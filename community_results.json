        "0":"### Historical Trends and Current Status\n- **Recent Arrest and Detention**: Mahmoud Khalil was arrested on March 8, 2025, by immigration authorities without a warrant, allegedly in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights at Columbia University[1][2].\n- **Legal Challenges**: Khalil's lawsuit challenging his detention is proceeding in federal court, focusing on constitutional rights violations[1]. His legal team is seeking bail, a return to New Jersey, and a preliminary injunction to release him[2].\n- **Deportation Proceedings**: A Louisiana immigration judge ruled Khalil deportable based on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing adverse foreign policy consequences[4][5]. However, his deportation is currently stayed by a federal court[4].\n\n### Recent Announcements\/Policies\n- **Government Policies**: The Trump administration has been criticized for targeting individuals engaged in pro-Palestine activism, using a Cold War-era law to justify deportation[4].\n- **Legal Filings**: Recent filings highlight the government's lack of a warrant for Khalil's arrest and emphasize his protected speech rights[2].\n\n### Authoritative Sources\n- **ACLU**: The American Civil Liberties Union is involved in Khalil's legal case and provides updates on court decisions[1][2].\n- **Amnesty International**: Has called for Khalil's release, citing violations of his freedom of expression and due process rights[3].\n- **Wikipedia**: Provides a comprehensive overview of Khalil's detention, including legal developments and political context[4].\n\n### Limitations or Uncertainties\n- **Legal Proceedings**: The outcome of Khalil's constitutional challenge and the ongoing legal proceedings create uncertainty about his deportation timeline.\n- **Political Factors**: Political pressure and public opinion could influence the legal process and decision-making.\n\n### Probabilistic Assessment\nGiven the legal challenges and political context, the probability of Khalil being deported before July 1, 2025, is uncertain. The current legal stay and ongoing constitutional challenge suggest a lower likelihood of deportation in the near term. However, if the legal stay is lifted, political factors could still play a significant role in determining his fate.\n\n## References\n1.

The group is working with the Trump administration to share intelligence and target individuals deemed a threat to public safety. Since releasing a list of thousands of names in February, Betar says arrests have already been made, including of Hamas supporters Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi. Betar's CEO, Jon Mantell, stated, 'These are dangerous people that need to be removed from our streets and campuses before it's too late.' Betar US spokesman Daniel Levy echoed those remarks, saying, 'We will unmask these terrorists who attack Jews with impunity. Those who cosplay Hamas on campus will be hit hard by the full weight of the law.' The group's renewed campaign is based on public safety, not politics, and is aimed at deporting 'illegal jihadi's from the United States.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 01:26 PM\nSource:[The Jerusalem Post](https:\/\/www.jpost.com\/diaspora\/article-853794)\n\n**Trump Administration Targets International Students for Pro-Palestinian Activism**\nThe Trump administration has been targeting international students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, leading to widespread concern over freedom of expression on university campuses. One student, R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a 30-year-old Turkish citizen and PhD student at Tufts University, was detained for 45 days in a federal detention center over 2,400 kilometers from her home, accused of participating in pro-terrorist activities. However, a federal judge ruled that the administration did not present any evidence to support the detention, and \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was released. Another student, Moshen Mahdawi, a 34-year-old Palestinian citizen and Columbia University student, was detained for over two weeks before being released on bail. The administration has argued that Mahdawi's activism undermines its foreign policy objectives. Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen and Georgetown University PhD student, has been detained for almost two months after his J-1 visa was revoked. His lawyers argue that the accusations are based on his wife's public support for Gaza during the war with Israel. Kseniia Petrova, a 30-year-old Russian citizen and Harvard University researcher, has been detained for almost three months after being accused of lying to federal officials and attempting to smuggle frog embryos into the US. Her colleagues have expressed support for her, and a court hearing in Vermont may determine whether she will be released or deported to Russia. Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old Palestinian refugee and Columbia University graduate, was arrested near his home on campus after being accused of participating in pro-Hamas activities. He is being held in a federal detention center in Louisiana, over 1,600 kilometers from his family. A judge has ruled that Khalil can be deported, but his lawyers are appealing the decision and challenging his detention in a federal case in New Jersey, arguing that he is being targeted for his freedom of expression, protected by the Constitution.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 09:08 AM\nSource:[KESQ.com](https:\/\/kesq.com\/kunamundo\/noticias-cnn\/cnn-spanish\/2025\/05\/13\/situacion-actual-en-5-de-los-casos-de-inmigracion-mas-destacados-de-la-administracion-trump\/)\n\n**Trump Administration Detains and Deports International Students for Pro-Palestinian Activism**\nThe Trump administration has been detaining and deporting international students who have been involved in pro-Palestinian activism.

Meanwhile, Moshen Mahdawi, a 34-year-old student at Columbia University, was detained for two weeks and then released after a federal judge ruled that the government had not presented any evidence to support the detention. Mahdawi was accused of being a threat to national security, but the judge said that the government's case was based on his pro-Palestinian activism. Other students, including Badar Khan Suri, Kseniia Petrova, and Mahmoud Khalil, have also been detained and are facing deportation. The Trump administration has argued that these students pose a threat to national security, but critics say that the government is using these cases to suppress pro-Palestinian activism and silence dissenting voices. 'It's a clear attempt to intimidate and silence students who are exercising their right to free speech and assembly,' said \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's lawyer.

Khalil, who has a green card, was unable to attend the birth of his son due to his detention in March, and has been held in a Louisiana immigration center over 1,000 miles from his home. He was detained without a warrant, and his wife, Nor Abdallah, was in her eighth month of pregnancy at the time. Khalil described the painful moment when he was unable to share the experience of his son's birth with his wife, except through a phone call from his cell. He wrote: 'In your first moments, I buried my face between my arms and lowered my voice so that the 70 men sleeping in this concrete room wouldn't see my eyes or hear my voice choking... I feel suffocated by my anger and the cruelty of a system that has deprived me and your mother of sharing this experience.' Khalil believes that his absence is not an individual case, but a reflection of a reality lived by many Palestinian fathers. He wrote: 'Like many Palestinian fathers, I have been separated from you by oppressive systems and distant prisons. In Palestine, this pain is a part of daily life. Children are born every day without their fathers - not because they chose to leave, but because they are killed by war and bombs and the cold machines of occupation. The sorrow I feel, and your mother's, is just a drop in the ocean of sorrow that Palestinian families have been drowning in for generations.' Khalil spoke about his relationship with the other fathers detained with him, saying: 'I recognize the look of every father in this detention center. I sit here, contemplating the majesty of your birth and wondering how many of the first ones will be sacrificed for the whims of the American government.' He pointed out the stark contrast between the American government's rhetoric on 'family values' and its actions: 'The politicians themselves who proclaim 'family values' are the ones who are tearing families apart.' Khalil addressed his son, saying: 'My love for you is deeper than anything I've ever known. Your love is not separate from the struggle for liberation... It is liberation itself. I fight for you, and for every Palestinian child who deserves safety, love, and freedom. I hope you will stand tall one day, knowing that your father was not absent out of indifference, but out of conviction.' After the birth, Khalil's wife, Nor Abdallah, released a statement saying that the US immigration and customs enforcement, along with the Trump administration, had stolen from them precious moments that cannot be replaced. She added: 'We should not spend our first days on earth without Mahmoud. He was stolen from us in an attempt to silence Mahmoud's voice supporting Palestinian freedom.' In March, Galoni Amor, the lawyer and advocate for reproductive justice, wrote that Khalil's case is not just about immigration or free speech, but about reproductive justice. He called on reproductive justice organizations in the US to take action, saying: 'If reproductive justice organizations cannot take on the disappearance of a Palestinian father while his wife is about to give birth, what is the value of their commitment to reproductive freedom? What is the use of a movement that demands 'freedom of parenthood' and then turns a blind eye to the families of color who are systematically deprived of the ability to raise their children safely and with dignity?' This case comes in the context of a growing campaign by the Trump administration against international students and US residents who express support for Palestine or criticize Israeli policies towards Gaza. Recently, Ramesh Oziturk, a Fulbright researcher at Tufts University, was released after being detained for an op-ed calling for peace, and was described by the administration as a 'threat to national security.' Reports have shown that the US authorities have sought to deport hundreds of international students since Khalil's detention, based on minor infractions unrelated to national security, including traffic violations or even being a victim of domestic violence. Khalil concluded his article with a message to his son, saying: 'You may ask one day why people are punished for defending Palestine, and why truth and empathy are a threat to power? These are difficult questions, but I hope you will explain to them our story: the world needs more courage, not less. It needs people who prefer justice over personal interests.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 12:18 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a](https:\/\/www.alquds.co.uk\/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82\/)\n\n**Mahmoud Khalil Calls Out Hypocrisy of 'Family Values' Politicians in Searing Op-Ed**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian and U.S. green card holder, was detained by ICE agents in Louisiana two weeks ago, missing the birth of his son.

In an op-ed, Khalil wrote about his experience, describing how he was only able to support his wife during childbirth by speaking to her over the phone. He criticized the 'family values' politicians who preach but fail to practice, tearing families apart. Khalil has now spent over two months in ICE captivity and has been separated from his family, highlighting the loss and dehumanization of fathers in detention centers. He wrote, 'My love for you is deeper than anything I have ever known. Loving you is not separate from the struggle for liberation.'

Vanessa Alvarez of JIRA began the protest by stating, 'Our communities are under attack.' She added, 'Right now, while we're speaking, ICE is separating families.' Alvarez concluded, 'We're here to say enough is enough. No more deportations. No more destroyed families. No more business as usual while our people suffer.' The protest focused on three urgent demands: an immediate halt to all deportations, justice for Kilmar Abrego Garcia and all immigrants facing detention and exile, and an end to the collaboration between local police and ICE. Representatives from groups such as the Riverside Church, the Jacksonville Community Action Committee, Ascendente Florida, Students for a Democratic Society, the Jacksonville Palestine Solidarity Network, and others addressed the crowd. They exposed the violence behind the headlines, explaining that deportations are not bureaucratic processes, but acts of state terror. Each day, ICE agents violently remove people from their homes, workplaces, and schools, often based on weak pretexts or racial profiling. Under the current administration of President Donald Trump, raids have dramatically increased, detaining asylum seekers, students, veterans, and even U.S. citizens like 20-year-old Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, who was wrongly imprisoned in Tallahassee despite presenting his birth certificate in court. Speaking about Lopez-Gomez, Monica Martinez, another organizer with JIRA, stated, 'Just because of his name, just because of his appearance, just because he exists.' A central figure during the protest was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a young man deported to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador due to ICE's false accusations of 'gang affiliation,' a charge regularly used as a legal tool against black and brown immigrants. The story of Abrego-Garcia, along with those of other criminalized immigrants and activists like Mahmoud Khalil, serves as a chilling reminder that the U.S. immigration system does not function to protect anyone, but to erase those deemed disposable. The protest revealed how Jacksonville's legal efforts fuel the deportation network through agreements 287(g) \u2013 programs that use local police to enforce federal immigration laws. From city streets to university campuses like the University of North Florida, police now use infractions like broken taillights or parking tickets to direct immigrants towards detention. Activists criticized the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office for its $630 million budget and denounced the passage of Ordinance 2025-0174 by the city council, a draconian law that criminalizes the existence of undocumented people with a 60-day prison sentence for 'unauthorized foreigners' and requires police to collaborate with ICE using mobile fingerprint scanners. The ordinance, urged by Councilor Kevin Carrico and supported by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, effectively empowers local police as immigration agents, promoting racial profiling while diverting taxpayer money to provide surveillance tools used to persecute black and brown communities. 'This is because it's essential that we present ourselves together. Every atrocity, every act of oppression and tyranny, is a test to see how much they can squeeze without retaliation,' said Gonzalo Kleinick of JIRA. 'We have to stand together. We have to support each other.' As the protest concluded, the energy remained fierce and determined. Speakers urged the crowd to continue organizing, resisting, and fighting for a city where immigrants are not persecuted, but celebrated. JIRA and its allies called on everyone to mobilize again for International Workers' Day \u2013 May 1, at 6:30 p.m., at the Duval County Courthouse \u2013 to continue the fight against deportations and for immigrant justice. 'They want us to be afraid,' Alvarez said, to conclude. 'But we're not afraid. They want us to be quiet. But we're loud. They want us to give up. But we're unstoppable.' 'The united people will never be defeated,' the crowd shouted.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 02:08 AM\nSource:[fightbacknews.org](https:\/\/fightbacknews.org\/articles\/jacksonville-manifiesta-para-detener-las-detenciones-ya-basta)\n\n**Lawful permanent residents like Mahmoud Khalil have a right to freedom of speech - but does that protect them from deportation?**\nThe Trump administration has revoked the visas of over 1,000 foreign university students since January 2025, many of whom participated in Palestinian rights protests. Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident born in Syria to Palestinian parents, was arrested and faces deportation after participating in protests at Columbia University in 2024. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that allowing Khalil to stay would create a 'hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.' Khalil's attorneys argue that the government is attempting to deport him for protected speech. The case raises questions about the limits of free speech for lawful permanent residents and whether the government can deport them for political views. A federal judge has ordered the government not to deport Khalil until his court cases are resolved, while another judge ruled that he can be deported for being a national security risk. The case is likely to end up before the Supreme Court, which will have to determine the balance between the executive branch's authority to deport noncitizens and the right to freedom of expression.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 21, 2025 12:35 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http:\/\/theconversation.com\/lawful-permanent-residents-like-mahmoud-khalil-have-a-right-to-freedom-of-speech-but-does-that-protect-them-from-deportation-254042)\n\n**Act Before It's Too Late: A Call to Action Against US Immigration Policy and Free Speech Suppression**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and a graduate student at Columbia University, wrote an article for The Washington Post, criticizing the US immigration policy and the suppression of free speech. Khalil, who is a lawful permanent resident, is facing deportation due to a ruling by the immigration court. In the article, titled 'Act before it's too late', Khalil argues that the government's reasons for his deportation are based on untrustworthy and biased media reports. He also claims that the immigration court handled his case without following proper procedures, while others who were detained with him are still waiting for their trials, which could take months or years. Khalil, who has advocated for human equality and dignity alongside Muslim, Jewish, and Christian friends at Columbia University, questions why his constitutional rights are being violated for speaking out against Israel's indiscriminate killing of Palestinians. He sees this as a dangerous example of suppressing free speech and political beliefs. Khalil also describes the poor conditions in the detention center, where 70 detainees sleep on hard mats, and some use prayer mats as blankets or shoes as pillows. He also mentions a detainee who has not seen his 9-month-old baby for months. Khalil urges action, saying that the situation is a warning that his rights are being threatened, and that he hopes people will be outraged by the suppression of dissenting voices, the fear of a vigilant public, and the country's fear of a clear and unambiguous condemnation of the brutal killings. He concludes by saying that he hopes his article will awaken people to the fact that some democracy is not true democracy, and that he hopes it will shake people into action before it's too late.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: April 18, 2025 04:17 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https:\/\/www.hani.co.kr\/arti\/international\/america\/1193117.html)\n\n**Pro-Palestinian Activist Mahmoud Khalil Faces Deportation from US**\nPro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has been detained by US immigration authorities and may be deported from the country.

According to Khalil, 'This is not a matter of simply violating university rules. This is a movement -- an anti-war movement.' Supporters of Khalil have been protesting his detention, with one supporter, Hakm Murad, saying, 'It's about instilling fear. It's about scaring the American public into submission so they won't speak out against the US funded occupation of Palestine and this regime's ongoing genocide in Gaza.

Judge Jamee E. Comans made the decision after an audit in Jena, Louisiana, where the government argued that Khalil's presence in the US posed 'potentially severe consequences for foreign policy'. Comans stated that the government had 'established clear and convincing evidence that he is subject to deportation'. Khalil, a lawful US resident, was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8 in his apartment vestibule, owned by the university. He was later transferred to a detention center in Jena, thousands of miles away from his lawyers and wife, a US citizen who is soon to give birth. Khalil's lawyers have questioned the legality of his detention, arguing that the Trump administration is attempting to suppress freedom of expression, protected by the US Constitution. The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, cited a little-used law to justify Khalil's deportation, which grants the authority to deport those who pose 'potentially adverse and severe consequences for US foreign policy'. Khalil's lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout, stated that the government's arguments before the court demonstrate that the attempt to deport his client 'has nothing to do with foreign policy'. A federal judge in New Jersey has temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation. Khalil is not accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia. However, the government has declared that foreign students who participate in such protests should be expelled from the country for expressing opinions that the administration considers anti-Semitic and 'pro-Hamas', referring to the militant Palestinian group that attacked Israel on October 7, 2023.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: April 11, 2025 08:31 PM\nSource:[telemundo47.com](https:\/\/www.telemundo47.com\/noticias\/juez-dictamina-que-activista-mahmoud-khalil-puede-ser-deportado\/2551729\/)\n\n**Anti-Israel Columbia protester Mahmoud Khalil can be deported, judge rules, but it won\u2019t happen immediately**\nAn immigration judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian-born permanent resident, can be deported over his involvement in anti-Israel demonstrations at Columbia University.

'Our constitution allows people to speak their minds,' said Khalil's lawyer Marc van der Hout. 'Nazis in this country, the Supreme Court has held, are able to demonstrate, are able to express their beliefs \u2013 but not Mahmoud Khalil.'

Khalil's lawyers and human rights organizations argue that he should not be deported without facing charges or evidence against him. They claim that he was targeted for expressing his support for Palestinians, a protected activity under the First Amendment. 'If our society remains committed to the rule of law and freedom of expression still prevails in the United States, no one should accept what happened to Mahmoud,' said Ramzi Kassem, co-director of the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility project, which supports Khalil's case. 'The arrest, detention, and attempted deportation of a prominent Palestinian human rights activist for exercising a constitutionally protected activity that the government disagrees with is not only illegal, but also represents a dangerous step towards a modern McCarthyist repression,' said Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which also supports Khalil. Khalil, who led protests at Columbia University in 2024 against the Israeli war in Gaza, is being targeted under a broad provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows for the deportation of any foreigner whose presence or activities in the United States may, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, pose a grave threat to the country's foreign policy.

Trump's administration has revoked Khalil's student visa and is seeking to deport him. Khalil's lawyer, Amy Greer, has called the move a 'terrible and inexcusable - and calculated - error' and a 'clear persecution of activists.' The university has denied any involvement in Khalil's detention and has expressed concern about the impact of the Trump administration's policies on students. The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups and the Columbia University community. A judge has temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation, and a hearing is scheduled for this week. Khalil's wife, a US citizen who is eight months pregnant, is also facing deportation threats. The Trump administration has accused Khalil of violating the conditions of his visa by participating in protests and has cited a 2025 executive order that allows for the deportation of individuals who support 'pro-jihadist' protests and 'all Hamas sympathizers on university campuses.'

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n### Historical Trends and Current Status\n- **Recent Arrest and Detention**: Mahmoud Khalil was arrested on March 8, 2025, by immigration authorities without a warrant, allegedly in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights at Columbia University[1][2].\n- **Legal Challenges**: Khalil's lawsuit challenging his detention is proceeding in federal court, focusing on constitutional rights violations[1]. His legal team is seeking bail, a return to New Jersey, and a preliminary injunction to release him[2].\n- **Deportation Proceedings**: A Louisiana immigration judge ruled Khalil deportable based on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing adverse foreign policy consequences[4][5]. However, his deportation is currently stayed by a federal court[4].\n\n### Recent Announcements\/Policies\n- **Government Policies**: The Trump administration has been criticized for targeting individuals engaged in pro-Palestine activism, using a Cold War-era law to justify deportation[4].\n- **Legal Filings**: Recent filings highlight the government's lack of a warrant for Khalil's arrest and emphasize his protected speech rights[2].\n\n### Authoritative Sources\n- **ACLU**: The American Civil Liberties Union is involved in Khalil's legal case and provides updates on court decisions[1][2].\n- **Amnesty International**: Has called for Khalil's release, citing violations of his freedom of expression and due process rights[3].\n- **Wikipedia**: Provides a comprehensive overview of Khalil's detention, including legal developments and political context[4].\n\n### Limitations or Uncertainties\n- **Legal Proceedings**: The outcome of Khalil's constitutional challenge and the ongoing legal proceedings create uncertainty about his deportation timeline.\n- **Political Factors**: Political pressure and public opinion could influence the legal process and decision-making.\n\n### Probabilistic Assessment\nGiven the legal challenges and political context, the probability of Khalil being deported before July 1, 2025, is uncertain. The current legal stay and ongoing constitutional challenge suggest a lower likelihood of deportation in the near term. However, if the legal stay is lifted, political factors could still play a significant role in determining his fate.\n\n## References\n1.

Another student, Moshen Mahdawi, a 34-year-old Palestinian citizen and Columbia University student, was detained for over two weeks before being released on bail. The administration has argued that Mahdawi's activism undermines its foreign policy objectives. Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen and Georgetown University PhD student, has been detained for almost two months after his J-1 visa was revoked. His lawyers argue that the accusations are based on his wife's public support for Gaza during the war with Israel.

Khalil, who has a green card, was unable to attend the birth of his son due to his detention in March, and has been held in a Louisiana immigration center over 1,000 miles from his home. He was detained without a warrant, and his wife, Nor Abdallah, was in her eighth month of pregnancy at the time. Khalil described the painful moment when he was unable to share the experience of his son's birth with his wife, except through a phone call from his cell. He wrote: 'In your first moments, I buried my face between my arms and lowered my voice so that the 70 men sleeping in this concrete room wouldn't see my eyes or hear my voice choking... I feel suffocated by my anger and the cruelty of a system that has deprived me and your mother of sharing this experience.' Khalil believes that his absence is not an individual case, but a reflection of a reality lived by many Palestinian fathers. He wrote: 'Like many Palestinian fathers, I have been separated from you by oppressive systems and distant prisons. In Palestine, this pain is a part of daily life. Children are born every day without their fathers - not because they chose to leave, but because they are killed by war and bombs and the cold machines of occupation. The sorrow I feel, and your mother's, is just a drop in the ocean of sorrow that Palestinian families have been drowning in for generations.' Khalil spoke about his relationship with the other fathers detained with him, saying: 'I recognize the look of every father in this detention center. I sit here, contemplating the majesty of your birth and wondering how many of the first ones will be sacrificed for the whims of the American government.' He pointed out the stark contrast between the American government's rhetoric on 'family values' and its actions: 'The politicians themselves who proclaim 'family values' are the ones who are tearing families apart.' Khalil addressed his son, saying: 'My love for you is deeper than anything I've ever known. Your love is not separate from the struggle for liberation... It is liberation itself. I fight for you, and for every Palestinian child who deserves safety, love, and freedom. I hope you will stand tall one day, knowing that your father was not absent out of indifference, but out of conviction.' After the birth, Khalil's wife, Nor Abdallah, released a statement saying that the US immigration and customs enforcement, along with the Trump administration, had stolen from them precious moments that cannot be replaced. She added: 'We should not spend our first days on earth without Mahmoud. He was stolen from us in an attempt to silence Mahmoud's voice supporting Palestinian freedom.' In March, Galoni Amor, the lawyer and advocate for reproductive justice, wrote that Khalil's case is not just about immigration or free speech, but about reproductive justice. He called on reproductive justice organizations in the US to take action, saying: 'If reproductive justice organizations cannot take on the disappearance of a Palestinian father while his wife is about to give birth, what is the value of their commitment to reproductive freedom? What is the use of a movement that demands 'freedom of parenthood' and then turns a blind eye to the families of color who are systematically deprived of the ability to raise their children safely and with dignity?' This case comes in the context of a growing campaign by the Trump administration against international students and US residents who express support for Palestine or criticize Israeli policies towards Gaza. Recently, Ramesh Oziturk, a Fulbright researcher at Tufts University, was released after being detained for an op-ed calling for peace, and was described by the administration as a 'threat to national security.'

Khalil concluded his article with a message to his son, saying: 'You may ask one day why people are punished for defending Palestine, and why truth and empathy are a threat to power?

The group is working with the Trump administration to share intelligence and target individuals deemed a threat to public safety. Since releasing a list of thousands of names in February, Betar says arrests have already been made, including of Hamas supporters Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi. Betar's CEO, Jon Mantell, stated, 'These are dangerous people that need to be removed from our streets and campuses before it's too late.' Betar US spokesman Daniel Levy echoed those remarks, saying, 'We will unmask these terrorists who attack Jews with impunity.

One student, R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a 30-year-old Turkish citizen and PhD student at Tufts University, was detained for 45 days in a federal detention center over 2,400 kilometers from her home, accused of participating in pro-terrorist activities. However, a federal judge ruled that the administration did not present any evidence to support the detention, and \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was released. Another student, Moshen Mahdawi, a 34-year-old Palestinian citizen and Columbia University student, was detained for over two weeks before being released on bail. The administration has argued that Mahdawi's activism undermines its foreign policy objectives. Badar Khan Suri, an Indian citizen and Georgetown University PhD student, has been detained for almost two months after his J-1 visa was revoked. His lawyers argue that the accusations are based on his wife's public support for Gaza during the war with Israel. Kseniia Petrova, a 30-year-old Russian citizen and Harvard University researcher, has been detained for almost three months after being accused of lying to federal officials and attempting to smuggle frog embryos into the US. Her colleagues have expressed support for her, and a court hearing in Vermont may determine whether she will be released or deported to Russia. Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old Palestinian refugee and Columbia University graduate, was arrested near his home on campus after being accused of participating in pro-Hamas activities. He is being held in a federal detention center in Louisiana, over 1,600 kilometers from his family.

Khalil, who has a green card, was unable to attend the birth of his son due to his detention in March, and has been held in a Louisiana immigration center over 1,000 miles from his home. He was detained without a warrant, and his wife, Nor Abdallah, was in her eighth month of pregnancy at the time. Khalil described the painful moment when he was unable to share the experience of his son's birth with his wife, except through a phone call from his cell. He wrote: 'In your first moments, I buried my face between my arms and lowered my voice so that the 70 men sleeping in this concrete room wouldn't see my eyes or hear my voice choking... I feel suffocated by my anger and the cruelty of a system that has deprived me and your mother of sharing this experience.' Khalil believes that his absence is not an individual case, but a reflection of a reality lived by many Palestinian fathers. He wrote: 'Like many Palestinian fathers, I have been separated from you by oppressive systems and distant prisons. In Palestine, this pain is a part of daily life. Children are born every day without their fathers - not because they chose to leave, but because they are killed by war and bombs and the cold machines of occupation. The sorrow I feel, and your mother's, is just a drop in the ocean of sorrow that Palestinian families have been drowning in for generations.' Khalil spoke about his relationship with the other fathers detained with him, saying: 'I recognize the look of every father in this detention center. I sit here, contemplating the majesty of your birth and wondering how many of the first ones will be sacrificed for the whims of the American government.' He pointed out the stark contrast between the American government's rhetoric on 'family values' and its actions: 'The politicians themselves who proclaim 'family values' are the ones who are tearing families apart.' Khalil addressed his son, saying: 'My love for you is deeper than anything I've ever known. Your love is not separate from the struggle for liberation... It is liberation itself. I fight for you, and for every Palestinian child who deserves safety, love, and freedom. I hope you will stand tall one day, knowing that your father was not absent out of indifference, but out of conviction.' After the birth, Khalil's wife, Nor Abdallah, released a statement saying that the US immigration and customs enforcement, along with the Trump administration, had stolen from them precious moments that cannot be replaced. She added: 'We should not spend our first days on earth without Mahmoud. He was stolen from us in an attempt to silence Mahmoud's voice supporting Palestinian freedom.' In March, Galoni Amor, the lawyer and advocate for reproductive justice, wrote that Khalil's case is not just about immigration or free speech, but about reproductive justice. He called on reproductive justice organizations in the US to take action, saying: 'If reproductive justice organizations cannot take on the disappearance of a Palestinian father while his wife is about to give birth, what is the value of their commitment to reproductive freedom? What is the use of a movement that demands 'freedom of parenthood' and then turns a blind eye to the families of color who are systematically deprived of the ability to raise their children safely and with dignity?' This case comes in the context of a growing campaign by the Trump administration against international students and US residents who express support for Palestine or criticize Israeli policies towards Gaza. Recently, Ramesh Oziturk, a Fulbright researcher at Tufts University, was released after being detained for an op-ed calling for peace, and was described by the administration as a 'threat to national security.' Reports have shown that the US authorities have sought to deport hundreds of international students since Khalil's detention, based on minor infractions unrelated to national security, including traffic violations or even being a victim of domestic violence. Khalil concluded his article with a message to his son, saying: 'You may ask one day why people are punished for defending Palestine, and why truth and empathy are a threat to power?

Vanessa Alvarez of JIRA began the protest by stating, 'Our communities are under attack.' She added, 'Right now, while we're speaking, ICE is separating families.' Alvarez concluded, 'We're here to say enough is enough. No more deportations. No more destroyed families. No more business as usual while our people suffer.' The protest focused on three urgent demands: an immediate halt to all deportations, justice for Kilmar Abrego Garcia and all immigrants facing detention and exile, and an end to the collaboration between local police and ICE. Representatives from groups such as the Riverside Church, the Jacksonville Community Action Committee, Ascendente Florida, Students for a Democratic Society, the Jacksonville Palestine Solidarity Network, and others addressed the crowd. They exposed the violence behind the headlines, explaining that deportations are not bureaucratic processes, but acts of state terror. Each day, ICE agents violently remove people from their homes, workplaces, and schools, often based on weak pretexts or racial profiling. Under the current administration of President Donald Trump, raids have dramatically increased, detaining asylum seekers, students, veterans, and even U.S. citizens like 20-year-old Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, who was wrongly imprisoned in Tallahassee despite presenting his birth certificate in court. Speaking about Lopez-Gomez, Monica Martinez, another organizer with JIRA, stated, 'Just because of his name, just because of his appearance, just because he exists.' A central figure during the protest was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a young man deported to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador due to ICE's false accusations of 'gang affiliation,' a charge regularly used as a legal tool against black and brown immigrants. The story of Abrego-Garcia, along with those of other criminalized immigrants and activists like Mahmoud Khalil, serves as a chilling reminder that the U.S. immigration system does not function to protect anyone, but to erase those deemed disposable. The protest revealed how Jacksonville's legal efforts fuel the deportation network through agreements 287(g) \u2013 programs that use local police to enforce federal immigration laws. From city streets to university campuses like the University of North Florida, police now use infractions like broken taillights or parking tickets to direct immigrants towards detention. Activists criticized the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office for its $630 million budget and denounced the passage of Ordinance 2025-0174 by the city council, a draconian law that criminalizes the existence of undocumented people with a 60-day prison sentence for 'unauthorized foreigners' and requires police to collaborate with ICE using mobile fingerprint scanners. The ordinance, urged by Councilor Kevin Carrico and supported by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, effectively empowers local police as immigration agents, promoting racial profiling while diverting taxpayer money to provide surveillance tools used to persecute black and brown communities. 'This is because it's essential that we present ourselves together. Every atrocity, every act of oppression and tyranny, is a test to see how much they can squeeze without retaliation,' said Gonzalo Kleinick of JIRA. 'We have to stand together. We have to support each other.' As the protest concluded, the energy remained fierce and determined. Speakers urged the crowd to continue organizing, resisting, and fighting for a city where immigrants are not persecuted, but celebrated. JIRA and its allies called on everyone to mobilize again for International Workers' Day \u2013 May 1, at 6:30 p.m., at the Duval County Courthouse \u2013 to continue the fight against deportations and for immigrant justice. 'They want us to be afraid,' Alvarez said, to conclude. 'But we're not afraid. They want us to be quiet. But we're loud. They want us to give up. But we're unstoppable.' 'The united people will never be defeated,' the crowd shouted.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 02:08 AM\nSource:[fightbacknews.org](https:\/\/fightbacknews.org\/articles\/jacksonville-manifiesta-para-detener-las-detenciones-ya-basta)\n\n**Lawful permanent residents like Mahmoud Khalil have a right to freedom of speech - but does that protect them from deportation?**\nThe Trump administration has revoked the visas of over 1,000 foreign university students since January 2025, many of whom participated in Palestinian rights protests. Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident born in Syria to Palestinian parents, was arrested and faces deportation after participating in protests at Columbia University in 2024. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that allowing Khalil to stay would create a 'hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.' Khalil's attorneys argue that the government is attempting to deport him for protected speech. The case raises questions about the limits of free speech for lawful permanent residents and whether the government can deport them for political views. A federal judge has ordered the government not to deport Khalil until his court cases are resolved, while another judge ruled that he can be deported for being a national security risk. The case is likely to end up before the Supreme Court, which will have to determine the balance between the executive branch's authority to deport noncitizens and the right to freedom of expression.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 21, 2025 12:35 PM\nSource:[The Conversation](http:\/\/theconversation.com\/lawful-permanent-residents-like-mahmoud-khalil-have-a-right-to-freedom-of-speech-but-does-that-protect-them-from-deportation-254042)\n\n**Act Before It's Too Late: A Call to Action Against US Immigration Policy and Free Speech Suppression**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and a graduate student at Columbia University, wrote an article for The Washington Post, criticizing the US immigration policy and the suppression of free speech. Khalil, who is a lawful permanent resident, is facing deportation due to a ruling by the immigration court. In the article, titled 'Act before it's too late', Khalil argues that the government's reasons for his deportation are based on untrustworthy and biased media reports. He also claims that the immigration court handled his case without following proper procedures, while others who were detained with him are still waiting for their trials, which could take months or years. Khalil, who has advocated for human equality and dignity alongside Muslim, Jewish, and Christian friends at Columbia University, questions why his constitutional rights are being violated for speaking out against Israel's indiscriminate killing of Palestinians. He sees this as a dangerous example of suppressing free speech and political beliefs. Khalil also describes the poor conditions in the detention center, where 70 detainees sleep on hard mats, and some use prayer mats as blankets or shoes as pillows. He also mentions a detainee who has not seen his 9-month-old baby for months. Khalil urges action, saying that the situation is a warning that his rights are being threatened, and that he hopes people will be outraged by the suppression of dissenting voices, the fear of a vigilant public, and the country's fear of a clear and unambiguous condemnation of the brutal killings. He concludes by saying that he hopes his article will awaken people to the fact that some democracy is not true democracy, and that he hopes it will shake people into action before it's too late.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: April 18, 2025 04:17 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https:\/\/www.hani.co.kr\/arti\/international\/america\/1193117.html)\n\n**Pro-Palestinian Activist Mahmoud Khalil Faces Deportation from US**\nPro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has been detained by US immigration authorities and may be deported from the country.

Judge Jamee E. Comans made the decision after an audit in Jena, Louisiana, where the government argued that Khalil's presence in the US posed 'potentially severe consequences for foreign policy'. Comans stated that the government had 'established clear and convincing evidence that he is subject to deportation'. Khalil, a lawful US resident, was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8 in his apartment vestibule, owned by the university. He was later transferred to a detention center in Jena, thousands of miles away from his lawyers and wife, a US citizen who is soon to give birth. Khalil's lawyers have questioned the legality of his detention, arguing that the Trump administration is attempting to suppress freedom of expression, protected by the US Constitution. The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, cited a little-used law to justify Khalil's deportation, which grants the authority to deport those who pose 'potentially adverse and severe consequences for US foreign policy'. Khalil's lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout, stated that the government's arguments before the court demonstrate that the attempt to deport his client 'has nothing to do with foreign policy'. A federal judge in New Jersey has temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation. Khalil is not accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia. However, the government has declared that foreign students who participate in such protests should be expelled from the country for expressing opinions that the administration considers anti-Semitic and 'pro-Hamas', referring to the militant Palestinian group that attacked Israel on October 7, 2023.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: April 11, 2025 08:31 PM\nSource:[telemundo47.com](https:\/\/www.telemundo47.com\/noticias\/juez-dictamina-que-activista-mahmoud-khalil-puede-ser-deportado\/2551729\/)\n\n**Anti-Israel Columbia protester Mahmoud Khalil can be deported, judge rules, but it won\u2019t happen immediately**\nAn immigration judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian-born permanent resident, can be deported over his involvement in anti-Israel demonstrations at Columbia University.

Khalil's lawyers and human rights organizations argue that he should not be deported without facing charges or evidence against him. They claim that he was targeted for expressing his support for Palestinians, a protected activity under the First Amendment. 'If our society remains committed to the rule of law and freedom of expression still prevails in the United States, no one should accept what happened to Mahmoud,' said Ramzi Kassem, co-director of the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility project, which supports Khalil's case. 'The arrest, detention, and attempted deportation of a prominent Palestinian human rights activist for exercising a constitutionally protected activity that the government disagrees with is not only illegal, but also represents a dangerous step towards a modern McCarthyist repression,' said Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which also supports Khalil. Khalil, who led protests at Columbia University in 2024 against the Israeli war in Gaza, is being targeted under a broad provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows for the deportation of any foreigner whose presence or activities in the United States may, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, pose a grave threat to the country's foreign policy. A federal judge has temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation while his case continues in court.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 19, 2025 07:30 PM\nSource:[independentespanol.com](https:\/\/www.independentespanol.com\/politica\/ee-uu\/green-card-residencia-permanente-deportacion-mahmoud-khalil-b2718230.html)\n\n**Columbia University Student Mahmoud Khalil Detained and Faces Deportation**\nMahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student at Columbia University, has been detained and faces deportation despite being a permanent resident in the US. Khalil was a prominent figure in student protests against the Gaza war and was accused by President Donald Trump of being a 'radical pro-Hamas' student. Trump's administration has revoked Khalil's student visa and is seeking to deport him. Khalil's lawyer, Amy Greer, has called the move a 'terrible and inexcusable - and calculated - error' and a 'clear persecution of activists.' The university has denied any involvement in Khalil's detention and has expressed concern about the impact of the Trump administration's policies on students. The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups and the Columbia University community. A judge has temporarily blocked Khalil's deportation, and a hearing is scheduled for this week. Khalil's wife, a US citizen who is eight months pregnant, is also facing deportation threats. The Trump administration has accused Khalil of violating the conditions of his visa by participating in protests and has cited a 2025 executive order that allows for the deportation of individuals who support 'pro-jihadist' protests and 'all Hamas sympathizers on university campuses.' Experts have questioned the legality of Khalil's detention, calling it an 'extraordinary measure with uncertain legal grounds.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 06:36 PM\nSource:[La Opini\u00f3n Digital](https:\/\/laopinion.com\/2025\/03\/11\/quien-es-mahmoud-khalid-el-estudiante-palestino-de-la-universidad-de-columbia-que-fue-detenido-para-ser-deportado-pese-a-ser-residente-permanente-en-ee-uu\/)\n\n**More protests planned after pro-Palestinian activist, Columbia grad detained by ICE**\nMahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents over the weekend. Khalil, a legal U.S. permanent resident, expressed support for the terrorist group Hamas during a protest and is now scheduled to be deported. Critics argue that he is being unfairly targeted for his activism, while immigration experts say his arrest is a huge overstep by the government. Protests are planned for Tuesday at Columbia and other universities, with a hearing set for Wednesday to determine whether Khalil can be deported. A judge has put a temporary restraint on any deportation. As one critic noted, 'His arrest reeks of authoritarianism.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 11, 2025 04:51 PM\nSource:[ABC7 New York](https:\/\/abc7ny.com\/post\/mahmoud-khalil-ice-arrest-protesters-demand-release-pro-palestinian-activist-columbia-grad\/16007394\/)\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is 2025-05-14\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100"

    "forecast":{
        "0":"(a) **Time Left Until Outcome:**  \nThere are approximately 6.5 weeks (about 48 days) until July 1, 2025, the deadline for determining whether Mahmoud Khalil is deported.\n\n(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  \nCurrently, Mahmoud Khalil remains in ICE detention in Louisiana. Although an immigration judge has ruled he is deportable and his permanent resident status has been revoked, a federal judge has put a stay on his deportation while his legal challenges\u2014including constitutional claims of due process and free speech violations\u2014proceed in federal court. As of now, Khalil cannot be deported until the courts resolve his pending cases[1][3][4]. If nothing changes, the status quo outcome is **No**\u2014he will not be deported before July 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  \nKhalil\u2019s legal team successfully maintains the court-ordered stay on deportation through July 1, 2025. Federal courts continue reviewing his constitutional challenge, and no further removal action is taken until the case is fully adjudicated. Delays, appeals, and possible injunctions keep Khalil in the U.S. past July 1[1][3][4].\n\n(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  \nThe federal court lifts the stay or rules against Khalil on urgent motions (such as bail or preliminary injunction), and the government moves swiftly to execute the deportation order. Political or administrative pressure leads to expedited removal proceedings, and Khalil is forcibly transported out of the United States before July 1, 2025. This would require a rapid and decisive turn in the legal process in the government's favor[4].\n\n---\n\n## **Rationale**\n\n- **Status quo inertia:**  \nCourt-ordered stays in high-profile, constitutionally complex deportation cases like this one often persist for months or years, especially with ongoing federal litigation and appeals. The fact that Khalil's legal team is backed by prominent organizations (ACLU, Center for Constitutional Rights, etc.) increases the likelihood of prolonged proceedings and robust defense[1][3].\n- **Judicial precedent:**  \nOther international students in similar high-profile cases (R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, Moshen Mahdawi) were ultimately released or saw proceedings drag on due to lack of evidence or successful legal challenges, further supporting the expectation that stays will remain in place while court reviews continue[3].\n- **Political and Public Pressure:**  \nThere is significant advocacy and media attention, with human rights organizations and student groups mobilizing against Khalil's deportation. This often encourages courts to proceed cautiously and avoid rushed removal, especially with constitutional claims at stake[2][3].\n- **Legal process realities:**  \nFederal court review cycles and appeals typically extend longer than 6\u20137 weeks unless there is a clear and urgent ruling. No reporting or official indication suggests imminent deportation action or dissolution of the stay[1][4].\n\n### **Downside Risks \/ Uncertainties**\n- **Change in judicial posture:**  \nIf the federal court is persuaded by government arguments or is pressured politically to expedite, a rapid ruling against Khalil could result in the lifting of the stay and execution of the deportation order before July 1. This is plausible but less likely, given norms in federal habeas and constitutional review cases.\n- **Executive action:**  \nA major, unforeseeable policy escalation by the administration or intervention at the highest levels could potentially bypass or override judicial delays, but this would be highly unusual and would likely generate further legal challenges.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Forecast**\n\nBased on the status quo with ongoing federal court review, an active deportation stay, and the slow pace of constitutional litigation\u2014countered by some risk of expedited government action under intense political pressure\u2014the most likely outcome is that Mahmoud Khalil **will not** be deported before July 1, 2025.\n\n**Probability: 85%**"
