    "forecast":{
        "0":"(a) **Time until resolution:**  \nThe December 2025 inflation data will be released in January 2026, so about **8 months remain** until the outcome is known.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nAs of early 2025, Argentina's annual inflation rate has fallen sharply from nearly 300% in April 2024 to around 55.9% in March 2025[2]. Monthly inflation is now consistently below 3%[3][5]. The most recent forecasts from major institutions and private analysts cluster around **30% for year-end 2025**[1][2][3][5]. The government's own market expectations survey projects around 23.3% inflation for 2025[5]. If these trends continue and current policies are maintained, **the status quo suggests a high probability that YoY inflation will be very near or just under 30%**.\n\n(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (Inflation \u2265 30% YoY):**  \nIf Argentina faces a **policy reversal**\u2014such as monetary easing, political pressure to restore subsidies, or renewed Central Bank financing of deficits\u2014disinflation could stall or reverse. External shocks, like a spike in global food or energy prices, or a currency crisis (potentially triggered by capital flight or loss of market confidence), could also drive inflation back above 30% YoY by December 2025. Even without a crisis, inflation inertia or lagged pass-through from previous devaluations could keep the annual figure above the threshold.\n\n(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (Inflation < 30% YoY):**  \nIf the Milei administration **sustains tight fiscal and monetary policies** through the remainder of the year, and political risks remain contained, Argentina\u2019s disinflation could continue. With monthly inflation now around 2\u20132.7% and trending down[3][5], and many forecasts showing a further drop, it is plausible for YoY inflation to slip **just below 30%** by December 2025\u2014especially if there are further improvements in price stability and no major external shocks.\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Momentum:** The pace of inflation reduction has been much faster than most forecasters anticipated, reflecting the administration\u2019s aggressive reforms and credible commitment to tough fiscal\/monetary discipline[1][3][5].\n- **Forecast convergence:** Most up-to-date projections\u2014BBVA Research, Trading Economics, and the Central Bank\u2019s survey\u2014expect YoY inflation to be right around 23\u201330% at the end of 2025[1][2][3][5]. These forecasts are more optimistic (lower) than the IMF\u2019s, which are generally slower to update and sometimes overshoot in volatile environments.\n- **Risks:** Argentina remains highly vulnerable to domestic political backlash (from rising poverty and social unrest) and external shocks. Inflation history in Argentina is volatile, and reversals can happen quickly if expectations or government resolve waver. However, the track record since late 2023 suggests an ability to outperform expectations if policy discipline persists[1][3][5].\n- **Status quo bias:** Most of the time, the world changes gradually. Given the strong downward momentum and broad forecast agreement on ~30% as the new normal, it is more likely than not that this level holds\u2014unless a major shock intervenes.\n\n---\n\n## Final Probability\n\n**Probability: 65%**\n\nArgentina\u2019s YoY inflation for December 2025 is more likely than not to be **below 30%**, but substantial uncertainty remains due to the country\u2019s history of shocks and volatility[1][2][3][5]."
