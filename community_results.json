        "0":"## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The Energy Star program, managed by the EPA for over 30 years, remains highly recognized and is currently operational, with EnergyStar.gov confirmed as up and reachable as of May 7, 2025[2].\n- The website continues to provide updates for 2025 product criteria, tax credit changes, and guidance for manufacturers and consumers, though some services (e.g., ProductFinder) are experiencing ongoing maintenance[2][3][4].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements\/Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- The EPA announced a plan to eliminate the Energy Star program as part of broader agency restructuring, aiming to reallocate resources and reduce costs[1].\n- Senior EPA officials have communicated that both the program and the overseeing office are slated for elimination, though public statements have stopped short of providing a definitive end date or explicit website shutdown notice[1].\n- The agency has reiterated its commitment to \u201cstatutory obligations,\u201d and certain Energy Star-related functions (notably those tied to federal tax credits) remain active and are being updated for 2025[4].\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The operational status of EnergyStar.gov can be independently confirmed via Is It Down Right Now? (www.isitdownrightnow.com\/energystar.gov.html), which verifies site availability and accessibility, and is the designated resolution source for this question.\n- The EPA\u2019s own website and official press releases provide authoritative updates on program changes[2][3][4].\n- Media reporting, such as The New York Times and Utility Dive, provides context on the policy environment and administrative intent[1].\n\n## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- There is no public timeline for the website\u2019s decommissioning, and it is unclear how swiftly the elimination directive will be executed.\n- Statutory obligations (such as ongoing tax credits and product labeling) may legally require some Energy Star web resources to remain accessible beyond the program\u2019s nominal end.\n- Partial service disruptions (as seen with ProductFinder) suggest heightened risk of degradation or phased shutdown prior to full decommissioning[2].\n- Political, legal, or administrative interventions could further delay or alter the shutdown process.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- Given the explicit elimination policy, partial service disruptions, but ongoing statutory activities and lack of an announced shutdown date, the likelihood that EnergyStar.gov will remain online on July 1, 2025, is lower than in a typical year but not negligible.\n- A reasonable probabilistic assessment would place the chance of EnergyStar.gov being online on July 1, 2025, at approximately 60%\u201375%, with the principal risk factors being unannounced rapid decommissioning or sudden administrative action in the intervening weeks.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.

Gov. Delbert Hosemann has called for a cautious budget approach in light of federal funding cuts. He stated, 'It's a difficult budget this year for two reasons. One, the positive part, which is we have been exceptionally productive.' The state has been paying down its debt, cutting income and grocery taxes, reducing the size of government, and increasing pay for teachers. However, these positive changes add complexity to the budgeting process. Hosemann emphasized the need to factor in federal spending cuts, which will impact approximately $350 to $390 million in federal funds. He said, 'We have challenges and we need to recognize, I think, and be prudent and conservative about next year.' The state government's budget will be from July 1 to June 30, 2026, and Hosemann anticipates further federal cuts. He suggested prioritizing expenses, paying state employees, and maintaining assets, followed by spending to make the government effective and paying down debt. Any remaining funds can be put toward local projects. Hosemann acknowledged the need for federal spending cuts, citing the national debt of over $36 trillion and a spending deficit of more than $1 trillion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 03:08 PM\nSource:[meridianstar.com](https:\/\/meridianstar.com\/2025\/05\/13\/hosemann-advocates-cautious-budget-approach-in-light-of-federal-funding-cuts\/)\n\n**EPA Announces Interim Rule Further Delaying TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting by Nine Months**\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced an interim rule that further delays the one-time reporting required under TSCA section 8(a)(7) for entities manufacturing or importing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) between 2011 and 2022.

The program, which has been in place for about three decades, has shaved an estimated $500 billion off Americans' utility bills and prevented 4 billion metric tons of emissions. Christine Egan, head of CLASP, said 'It has brand recognition and consumer trust that only Santa Claus can compete with.' Without Energy Star, consumers will have to pay more and work harder to identify which appliances will use the least energy and save the most money. Researchers and policy experts suggest that consumers can DIY something like Energy Star by looking at federal minimum efficiency standards, EnergyGuide, or asking appliance retailers for their most efficient equipment. However, Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator, doubted that any nonprofit or industry group has the expertise, credibility, or funding needed to oversee Energy Star, and saving the program will probably require Congress.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[Washington Post](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/climate-environment\/2025\/05\/13\/energy-star-cuts\/)\n\n**Uncertainty Surrounds the Future of Energy Star and its Impact on Global Energy Savings**\nThere is uncertainty about the future of the Energy Star program, a voluntary initiative launched in 1992 by George H.W.

The program, which is voluntary, has been criticized by both environmental groups and industry associations. The 'Energy Star' label was introduced in 1992 and is awarded to products that meet the standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. However, the agency does not verify the claims made by manufacturers, and anyone can apply for the label. Despite this, the program has led to more energy-efficient products and has saved US consumers an estimated $500 billion in electricity costs over the past 33 years, according to Ars Technica. The program is now under threat due to the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Steven Nadel, director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said, 'I'm not sure if they've thought it through.' Joseph Goffman, a former EPA official, believes the plans are well-thought-out, saying, 'I think we're seeing a conclusion of this administration's ideology: a decided hostility towards anything the government does to help people.' Industry associations and the US Chamber of Commerce have also criticized the move, saying the Energy Star program is 'a model for a successful non-regulatory program and a partnership between the government and the private sector.' Environmental groups have also spoken out against the plan, with Paula Glover, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, saying, 'The elimination of the Energy Star program would directly contradict the promise of the government to lower household energy costs.' \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 02:34 AM\nSource:[heise online](https:\/\/www.heise.de\/news\/US-Regierung-will-Energy-Star-stoppen-Branche-und-Klimaschuetzer-protestieren-10379566.html)\n\n**New Tax Bill Threatens U.S. Clean Energy Boom**\nThe latest budget reconciliation proposal in the U.S. House of Representatives would roll back federal clean energy tax incentives and overturn critical EPA programs, threatening the American-made energy boom and domestic manufacturing.

This decision could lead to increased electricity bills, despite the president's promise to lower them. Energy Star, launched in 1992, allows consumers to easily identify energy-efficient products, such as refrigerators, washing machines, and computers. According to internal sources, the program will be phased out in the coming months as part of a major EPA restructuring. The program's effectiveness is evident, with official figures showing that it saves consumers $40 billion annually, while costing only $32 million per year. Over 30 years, it has saved consumers over $500 billion. The decision has sparked widespread criticism, with over 1,000 companies, cities, and associations, including Samsung and the city of Seattle, writing to the EPA to defend the program. Even some Republican senators have expressed their support for Energy Star. Trump has promised to lower energy prices, but eliminating the program would also remove a valuable tool for helping households consume less energy. Officially, the administration aims to reduce EPA spending and 'recenter' its missions, with a goal of saving $300 million per year by 2026. However, many believe that this decision is primarily ideological and could have severe long-term consequences for families.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[Mac4Ever](https:\/\/www.mac4ever.com\/mac\/189145-trump-veut-supprimer-le-label-energy-star)\n\n**EPA is reportedly killing Energy Star program**\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to eliminate the Energy Star program, a popular initiative that has saved consumers and businesses over $500 billion in energy costs since its launch in 1992.

According to sources, the program will be eliminated as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Atmospheric Protection, which will be dissolved. Paul Gunning, the office's director, stated during an all-hands meeting that the Energy Star program and other climate work would be 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Critics, including Ben Evans from the US Green Building Council, argue that this would be 'incredibly shortsighted,' as the program saves consumers and businesses over $40 billion annually at a cost of just $32 million. Trade groups and companies have urged EPA chief Lee Zeldin to protect the program, calling it an 'effective non-regulatory program and partnership between the government and the private sector.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 01:44 AM\nSource:[Newser](https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/368265\/report-feds-are-killing-off-energy-star.html)\n\n**Shake-up at EPA threatens Energy Star, climate offices**\nThe Trump administration has proposed a reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that targets divisions housing climate change offices and Energy Star, a program designed to help lower energy costs for American households. The proposal, which aims to 'Power the Great American Comeback,' would eliminate Energy Star, a program that has saved $500 billion in energy costs over the past 30 years, according to Senator Ed Markey. The reorganization could also compromise other critical programs within the Office of Air and Radiation, such as monitoring trends in air pollution and providing energy resources to state and local governments. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the restructuring would bring the agency down to Reagan-era staffing levels, saving $300 million a year by 2026. However, critics argue that the cuts would roll back the U.S. fight against climate change and harm American families and businesses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 06, 2025 08:54 PM\nSource:[Los Angeles Times](https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/story\/2025-05-06\/shakeup-at-epa-threatens-energy-star-climate-offices)\n\n**Trump admin plans to shut down money-saving Energy Star program soon, sources say | CNN**\nThe Trump administration is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a public-private partnership that certifies energy-efficient appliances and helps consumers save money on energy-efficient products. According to sources, the agency is also planning to close its climate change division and climate protection partnership division. The Energy Star program, which was implemented in 1992, is 'nearly universally supported' by manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, said Joe Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under Biden. The program's certifications for appliances will likely stop, but the exact timeline is unclear. The changes are part of broader division closures within EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, which could represent a major blow for official government measuring of US fossil fuel emissions. 'With this action, EPA is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback,' said an EPA spokesperson. However, a spokesperson for Energy Star did not return CNN's request for comment. 'Energy Star ratings of appliances and electronics have been part of tens of millions of American households' purchases,' Goffman said, adding that energy performance ratings are now a built-in part of consumer shopping decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 06, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[CNN](https:\/\/us.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/06\/climate\/energy-star-trump)\n\n**EPA Announces Major Shift in Enforcement Priorities for Energy Sector**\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a significant shift in enforcement priorities for the energy sector. According to a memorandum issued on March 12, 2025, the EPA will no longer take enforcement action that could shut down energy production or power generation unless there is an imminent threat to human health or a statutory requirement. The agency will also prioritize enforcement related to coal ash at active coal-fired power plants, focusing on imminent threats to human health. Additionally, the EPA will no longer prioritize enforcement related to methane emissions from oil and gas facilities, and any existing orders or settlements will require additional approval. The shift in enforcement strategy aims to promote energy sector growth, but considerable uncertainty remains as to its effectiveness.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 21, 2025 06:03 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https:\/\/www.jdsupra.com\/legalnews\/epa-announces-major-shift-in-5600873\/)\n\n"

Mr. Gunning\u2019s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https:\/\/www.isitdownrightnow.com\/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The Energy Star program, managed by the EPA for over 30 years, remains highly recognized and is currently operational, with EnergyStar.gov confirmed as up and reachable as of May 7, 2025[2].\n- The website continues to provide updates for 2025 product criteria, tax credit changes, and guidance for manufacturers and consumers, though some services (e.g., ProductFinder) are experiencing ongoing maintenance[2][3][4].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements\/Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- The EPA announced a plan to eliminate the Energy Star program as part of broader agency restructuring, aiming to reallocate resources and reduce costs[1].\n- Senior EPA officials have communicated that both the program and the overseeing office are slated for elimination, though public statements have stopped short of providing a definitive end date or explicit website shutdown notice[1].\n- The agency has reiterated its commitment to \u201cstatutory obligations,\u201d and certain Energy Star-related functions (notably those tied to federal tax credits) remain active and are being updated for 2025[4].\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The operational status of EnergyStar.gov can be independently confirmed via Is It Down Right Now? (www.isitdownrightnow.com\/energystar.gov.html), which verifies site availability and accessibility, and is the designated resolution source for this question.\n- The EPA\u2019s own website and official press releases provide authoritative updates on program changes[2][3][4].\n- Media reporting, such as The New York Times and Utility Dive, provides context on the policy environment and administrative intent[1].\n\n## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- There is no public timeline for the website\u2019s decommissioning, and it is unclear how swiftly the elimination directive will be executed.\n- Statutory obligations (such as ongoing tax credits and product labeling) may legally require some Energy Star web resources to remain accessible beyond the program\u2019s nominal end.\n- Partial service disruptions (as seen with ProductFinder) suggest heightened risk of degradation or phased shutdown prior to full decommissioning[2].\n- Political, legal, or administrative interventions could further delay or alter the shutdown process.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- Given the explicit elimination policy, partial service disruptions, but ongoing statutory activities and lack of an announced shutdown date, the likelihood that EnergyStar.gov will remain online on July 1, 2025, is lower than in a typical year but not negligible.\n- A reasonable probabilistic assessment would place the chance of EnergyStar.gov being online on July 1, 2025, at approximately 60%\u201375%, with the principal risk factors being unannounced rapid decommissioning or sudden administrative action in the intervening weeks.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.

One, the positive part, which is we have been exceptionally productive.' The state has been paying down its debt, cutting income and grocery taxes, reducing the size of government, and increasing pay for teachers. However, these positive changes add complexity to the budgeting process. Hosemann emphasized the need to factor in federal spending cuts, which will impact approximately $350 to $390 million in federal funds. He said, 'We have challenges and we need to recognize, I think, and be prudent and conservative about next year.' The state government's budget will be from July 1 to June 30, 2026, and Hosemann anticipates further federal cuts. He suggested prioritizing expenses, paying state employees, and maintaining assets, followed by spending to make the government effective and paying down debt.

The program, which is voluntary, has been criticized by both environmental groups and industry associations. The 'Energy Star' label was introduced in 1992 and is awarded to products that meet the standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. However, the agency does not verify the claims made by manufacturers, and anyone can apply for the label. Despite this, the program has led to more energy-efficient products and has saved US consumers an estimated $500 billion in electricity costs over the past 33 years, according to Ars Technica. The program is now under threat due to the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Steven Nadel, director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said, 'I'm not sure if they've thought it through.' Joseph Goffman, a former EPA official, believes the plans are well-thought-out, saying, 'I think we're seeing a conclusion of this administration's ideology: a decided hostility towards anything the government does to help people.' Industry associations and the US Chamber of Commerce have also criticized the move, saying the Energy Star program is 'a model for a successful non-regulatory program and a partnership between the government and the private sector.'

Energy Star, launched in 1992, allows consumers to easily identify energy-efficient products, such as refrigerators, washing machines, and computers. According to internal sources, the program will be phased out in the coming months as part of a major EPA restructuring. The program's effectiveness is evident, with official figures showing that it saves consumers $40 billion annually, while costing only $32 million per year. Over 30 years, it has saved consumers over $500 billion. The decision has sparked widespread criticism, with over 1,000 companies, cities, and associations, including Samsung and the city of Seattle, writing to the EPA to defend the program. Even some Republican senators have expressed their support for Energy Star. Trump has promised to lower energy prices, but eliminating the program would also remove a valuable tool for helping households consume less energy. Officially, the administration aims to reduce EPA spending and 'recenter' its missions, with a goal of saving $300 million per year by 2026.

According to EPA Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection Paul Gunning, the office is being dissolved and the Energy Star program is being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' This decision has been met with criticism from lawmakers, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who argue that the program is essential for consumers to make informed decisions about energy-efficient appliances. In contrast, EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou claims that the reorganization will 'directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 04:59 PM\nSource:[The Week](https:\/\/theweek.com\/environment\/epa-energy-star-eliminated)\n\n**Utility bills could rise as Trump's EPA to end Energy Star program, experts warn**\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to end the Energy Star program, which has certified energy efficiency on home appliances for over 30 years. Experts warn that this could lead to higher energy bills for US customers. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said, 'If you wanted to raise families' energy bills, getting rid of the Energy Star label would be a pretty good way.' Hundreds of companies and groups signed a letter urging the EPA to maintain the program, citing its popularity with consumers and manufacturers. The plans to close the program come amid reports of wider agency cuts and the dissolution of the EPA's office of atmospheric protection and the office of air quality planning and standards. Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen said ending the program would raise costs for consumers and benefit billionaires and utility companies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 03:19 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2025\/may\/07\/energy-star-program-ends-utility-bills)\n\n**Trump administration plans to eliminate the 3-decade-old Energy Star program**\nThe Trump administration plans to eliminate the 33-year-old Energy Star program, which has helped American consumers save over $500 billion in energy costs. The plan was announced at an Environmental Protection Agency meeting, where a chart marked the program for closure as part of a reorganization effort. The EPA said it is reorganizing the agency to 'Power the Great American Comeback,' but did not specifically mention the Energy Star program. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse called the move 'economic sabotage,' saying it will force Americans to buy appliances that cost more to run and waste more energy. The Energy Star program has helped prevent 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and has about $100 billion's worth of appliances bearing the Energy Star sticker sold each year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 02:18 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/trump-energy-star-program-epa-eliminate\/)\n\n**Report: Feds Are Killing Off Energy Star**\nThe Trump administration is reportedly planning to kill off the Energy Star program, a public-private partnership that certifies energy-efficient appliances and has saved consumers and businesses over $500 billion since its introduction in 1992. According to sources, the program will be eliminated as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Atmospheric Protection, which will be dissolved. Paul Gunning, the office's director, stated during an all-hands meeting that the Energy Star program and other climate work would be 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Critics, including Ben Evans from the US Green Building Council, argue that this would be 'incredibly shortsighted,' as the program saves consumers and businesses over $40 billion annually at a cost of just $32 million. Trade groups and companies have urged EPA chief Lee Zeldin to protect the program, calling it an 'effective non-regulatory program and partnership between the government and the private sector.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 01:44 AM\nSource:[Newser](https:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/368265\/report-feds-are-killing-off-energy-star.html)\n\n**Shake-up at EPA threatens Energy Star, climate offices**\nThe Trump administration has proposed a reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that targets divisions housing climate change offices and Energy Star, a program designed to help lower energy costs for American households. The proposal, which aims to 'Power the Great American Comeback,' would eliminate Energy Star, a program that has saved $500 billion in energy costs over the past 30 years, according to Senator Ed Markey. The reorganization could also compromise other critical programs within the Office of Air and Radiation, such as monitoring trends in air pollution and providing energy resources to state and local governments. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the restructuring would bring the agency down to Reagan-era staffing levels, saving $300 million a year by 2026. However, critics argue that the cuts would roll back the U.S. fight against climate change and harm American families and businesses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 06, 2025 08:54 PM\nSource:[Los Angeles Times](https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/story\/2025-05-06\/shakeup-at-epa-threatens-energy-star-climate-offices)\n\n**Trump admin plans to shut down money-saving Energy Star program soon, sources say | CNN**\nThe Trump administration is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a public-private partnership that certifies energy-efficient appliances and helps consumers save money on energy-efficient products. According to sources, the agency is also planning to close its climate change division and climate protection partnership division. The Energy Star program, which was implemented in 1992, is 'nearly universally supported' by manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, said Joe Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under Biden. The program's certifications for appliances will likely stop, but the exact timeline is unclear. The changes are part of broader division closures within EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, which could represent a major blow for official government measuring of US fossil fuel emissions. 'With this action, EPA is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback,' said an EPA spokesperson. However, a spokesperson for Energy Star did not return CNN's request for comment. 'Energy Star ratings of appliances and electronics have been part of tens of millions of American households' purchases,' Goffman said, adding that energy performance ratings are now a built-in part of consumer shopping decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 06, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[CNN](https:\/\/us.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/06\/climate\/energy-star-trump)\n\n**EPA Announces Major Shift in Enforcement Priorities for Energy Sector**\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a significant shift in enforcement priorities for the energy sector. According to a memorandum issued on March 12, 2025, the EPA will no longer take enforcement action that could shut down energy production or power generation unless there is an imminent threat to human health or a statutory requirement. The agency will also prioritize enforcement related to coal ash at active coal-fired power plants, focusing on imminent threats to human health. Additionally, the EPA will no longer prioritize enforcement related to methane emissions from oil and gas facilities, and any existing orders or settlements will require additional approval. The shift in enforcement strategy aims to promote energy sector growth, but considerable uncertainty remains as to its effectiveness.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 21, 2025 06:03 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https:\/\/www.jdsupra.com\/legalnews\/epa-announces-major-shift-in-5600873\/)\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is 2025-05-14\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100"

    "forecast":{
        "0":"Based on the search results, I'll provide an analysis of whether EnergyStar.gov will still be online on July 1, 2025, combining the key elements from both forecasts.\n\nThe Energy Star program is currently in a precarious position following the Trump administration's announced plans to eliminate it as part of broader EPA restructuring efforts. As of May 14, 2025, we have approximately 1.5 months until the resolution date of July 1, 2025, when the website's status will be determined.\n\n## Current Status and Context\n\nEnergyStar.gov remains online and operational as of early May 2025, though with some degradation in services. The ProductFinder tool is currently unavailable due to \"ongoing maintenance\", but the website continues to provide information about 2025 product criteria and tax credit changes.\n\nThe EPA has announced plans to eliminate the Energy Star program as part of broader agency restructuring aimed at reducing costs. According to reports, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the reorganization \"will save at least $300 million annually for the American people\". Senior EPA officials, including Paul Gunning (Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection), have communicated that the program and its overseeing office are slated for elimination.\n\n## Factors Supporting Continued Website Operation\n\nSeveral factors suggest EnergyStar.gov may remain online through July 1, 2025:\n\n1. **Statutory Obligations**: The EPA has reiterated its commitment to \"fulfilling all of our statutory obligations\". Energy Star is tied to federal tax credits that remain active, with the website specifically providing updated guidance for claiming these credits in 2025.\n\n2. **Lack of Timeline**: Despite the announced elimination, no public statement or timeline from the EPA specifies a shutdown date for EnergyStar.gov specifically.\n\n3. **Administrative Inertia**: Government program shutdowns, especially those requiring coordination across agencies and external stakeholders, typically occur gradually rather than abruptly.\n\n4. **Industry and Political Pressure**: Nearly 1,100 companies and organizations have urged the EPA to maintain full funding and staffing levels for Energy Star, indicating significant stakeholder resistance to rapid elimination.\n\n## Factors Supporting Website Shutdown\n\nCountering these points are several factors that could lead to the website being offline by July 1:\n\n1. **Clear Elimination Directive**: The administration has explicitly targeted Energy Star for elimination, not just reduction, suggesting a comprehensive shutdown is planned.\n\n2. **Budget Priorities**: The reorganization aims to save hundreds of millions of dollars, creating strong financial incentives to shut down program infrastructure quickly.\n\n3. **Political Will**: Strong political determination could accelerate the shutdown process beyond typical government timelines.\n\n4. **Early Signs of Degradation**: Some Energy Star web services are already experiencing \"maintenance\" issues, potentially signaling the beginning of a phased shutdown.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely scenario is that EnergyStar.gov will still be accessible on July 1, 2025, though possibly in a reduced or static state. The timeline of less than two months from mid-May to July 1 is relatively short for complete decommissioning of a federal website tied to ongoing tax credits and statutory requirements.\n\nThe key determining factors are:\n- The pace of administrative execution\n- Whether statutory obligations (particularly tax credit verification) will maintain the website's necessity\n- The extent of political pressure from stakeholders\n\nWhile the program's eventual elimination appears certain based on current policy, the inertia of government operations and legal requirements suggest the website will likely remain accessible at the specific checkpoint date of July 1, 2025.\n\nProbability: 70%\n\n### Probability: 70%"
