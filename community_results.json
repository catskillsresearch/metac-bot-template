The nation is deeply polarized, with ongoing debates over rule of law issues and tensions between urban and rural populations.

        "2":"The Republicans achieved a \"legislative trifecta\" in the 2024 elections - control of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives - although lacking the 60-vote Senate supermajority, having won 53 out of 100 seats.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the election, senior Republicans began [planning](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/live-updates\/2024\/11\/25\/congress\/gop-leaders-meet-to-talk-reconciliation-00191590) how to turn Donald Trump's extensive legislative agenda into reality. One option would include the use of budget [reconciliation](https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/topics\/budget\/reconciliation#:~:text=Budget%20reconciliation%20is%20an%20expedited,in%20a%20Congressional%20budget%20resolution.), a process that allows certain federal budget bills to pass in the Senate with only a simple majority, bypassing the 60-vote threshold typically required to overcome a [filibuster](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate). Reconciliation also limits debate time, preventing the use of the filibuster altogether.\n\nA key priority expected to be included in a reconciliation bill is the renewal of [Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act) - a central pillar of his campaign, with most of them set to expire at the end of 2025. This is controversial, as it could violate the [Byrd Rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reconciliation_\\(United_States_Congress\\)#Byrd_Rule) if it increases the federal deficit beyond the allowable budget window without offsetting revenue or spending adjustments. Additionally, Trump and the GOP have suggested using reconciliation to pass policies related to border security and energy permitting, though the impact of these measures on federal spending is less clear.\n\nSome senior Republicans argue that border security constitutes a national emergency. In contrast to House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s [\"one, big beautiful bill\"](https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/administration\/5067370-mike-johnson-donald-trump-house-gop-reconciliation\/), they have proposed using a standalone reconciliation bill to address border security first, followed by a separate bill covering other priorities such as tax policy and the debt ceiling.",

This threat stems from allegations that Harvard has created a \"hostile learning environment\" for Jewish students and has failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus. DHS has demanded that Harvard provide detailed records of international students' involvement in \"illegal and violent activities\" by April 30, 2025, warning that noncompliance would result in the automatic withdrawal of the university's SEVP certification.",

Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term. Brookings continues:\n\n> While it is easier for the IRA to be repealed under a Republican trifecta, it may be difficult to build a sufficiently large coalition in Congress to repeal the full IRA, as Republican lawmakers may prefer to retain certain IRA incentives that benefit their constituents. In August 2024, 18 Republican House Representatives [signed](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2024\/08\/25\/republican-fight-inflation-reduction-act-00176223) a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) that asked for the IRA\u2019s energy tax credits to be \u201cspared\u201d from attempts to repeal the IRA. A Senior Tax Policy Advisor on the Senate Finance Committee also [noted](https:\/\/tax.thomsonreuters.com\/news\/senate-tax-advisor-new-energy-credits-likely-safe-from-full-repeal-in-2025\/) that a full repeal of clean energy tax incentives is unlikely regardless of the election results, as some parts of the IRA received bipartisan support before its enactment, which was expected to continue.\n\n> Republican-held areas have benefitted from the IRA since its enactment, as [more than half](https:\/\/e2.org\/reports\/clean-economy-works-two-year-review-2024\/) of announced clean energy and vehicle projects are located in Republican congressional districts. According to the Rhodium Group and MIT\u2019s [Clean Investment Monitor](https:\/\/www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org\/database), Nevada and Wyoming had the highest level of actual clean investment as a percent of GDP between September 2023 and September 2024 \u2013 with 2.65% and 4.11% respectively. Nevada, Kentucky, and Georgia had the highest levels of actual clean manufacturing investment as a percent of GDP over the same period, with 1.1% for Georgia and Kentucky, and 1.2% for Nevada. In terms of federal investments, the most populous states, such as California and Texas, [received](https:\/\/www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org\/reports\/tallying-the-two-year-impact-of-the-inflation-reduction-act) the most dollars. However, Nevada and Wyoming received the most federal investments per capita, as well as relative to the size of their GDP. This includes federal tax credits, grants, and fiscal cost of loans and loan guarantees.\n\n> The Political Economy Research Institute (University of Massachusetts Amherst) [projected](https:\/\/peri.umass.edu\/images\/publication\/BIL_IRA_CHIPS_9-18-23-1.pdf) that the IRA could have an employment impact of creating 848,728 jobs annually, across industries.

Many of these jobs are in California (544,604 jobs), Texas (268,035 jobs), and New York (173,731 jobs).\n\nIn addition to a repeal of 45Y, another possibility would be earlier sunsets of the tax credit, which currently benefits energy production facilities placed into service after 2024 and before 2032. For that reason, as a \"[thoughtful](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits\/)\" alternative the 2032 phase-out might be moved to an earlier year. Phase-out starts the latter of 2032 or when America's GHG emissions from electricity are \u226425% of 2022 emissions. Additionally, there is a [safe harbor](https:\/\/www.solarpowerworldonline.com\/2025\/01\/what-does-safe-harboring-mean-for-the-solar-industry\/) for clean energy projects, which grandfathers in projects that have begun before the phase-out date, as long as the project has met certain thresholds, and a repeal of 45Y or earlier sunset might be mitigated by including a safe harbor possibility to protect investments.&#x20;",

According to Climate Power\u2019s [IRA repeal votes tracker](https:\/\/climatepower.us\/research-polling\/inflation-reduction-act-repeal-votes-tracker\/), as of October 15, 2024, the attempts to roll back the IRA have repeatedly focused on preventing funding for Executive Order 14082 (which helps implement the IRA), repealing sections related to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and repealing sections related to the Methane Emissions Reduction Program.\n\nSome conservatives have advocated for repealing clean energy tax credits such as 48E as soon as possible, while others [have advocated for](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits\/) a more \"thoughtful\" approach, using earlier phase-outs rather than quick repeal, in order to provide companies with some visibility in their project planning. Republicans hold a slim majority of 5 seats in the House, and many representatives come from districts that benefit from renewable energy investments and are facing re-election battles in 2026.&#x20;\n\nAccording to one expert forecast from the 600-attorney corporate law firm of Crowell & Moring, 48E is considered a \"[moderate](https:\/\/www.crowell.com\/en\/insights\/client-alerts\/clean-energy-tax-credits-and-after-the-election-what-to-expect)\" risk of repeal, due to the perceived cost of the tax credit by Republican lawmakers. However, other options rather than changing the sunset date could be removing the so-called adders such as the wage and apprenticeship requirements..",

        "0":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party, gained substantial momentum through 2024 and early 2025 by appealing to voters dissatisfied with the Trudeau administration, focusing on issues like housing, inflation, and economic recovery[1][3].\n- In January 2025, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned amid declining popularity, and Mark Carney became the new Liberal leader, reshaping the political landscape and intensifying the election's competitiveness[2][4].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The 2025 federal election was scheduled for no later than October 20, 2025, but was held earlier in the spring.\n- During the campaign, Poilievre emphasized lower taxes, reduced government spending, and a \"Canada First\" approach, drawing comparisons to U.S. populist politics[2].\n- The Liberals, under Carney, focused on economic stability and distancing themselves from Trudeau's legacy, especially as U.S. trade tensions escalated[4].\n\n## Authoritative Sources and Election Results\n\n- In the final days before the election, major polls showed the Liberals overtaking the Conservatives, with a notable lead in Ontario and Quebec\u2014crucial provinces for forming a government[4].\n- After the election, credible reports confirm that Pierre Poilievre lost his own parliamentary seat, and the Conservatives failed to win the most seats in Parliament[2].\n- The Liberals, led by Mark Carney, are projected to form the next government, either as a majority or with support from smaller parties[2][4].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- While polling data can fluctuate and seat counts may be subject to final confirmation, multiple independent sources report that Poilievre and the Conservatives were defeated.\n- There is no indication of annulled results or postponed elections that would alter this outcome.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the latest available information, Pierre Poilievre will **not** be elected Prime Minister of Canada in 2025. The Liberals, under Mark Carney, are set to form the next government following the election.\n\n## References\n\n- [1].

        "1":"# Will Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski be Elected President of Poland in 2025?\n\nThe upcoming Polish presidential election on May 18, 2025, represents a critical juncture in Polish politics. With incumbent President Andrzej Duda ineligible to run for a third term, this election could potentially end the Law and Justice (PiS) party's last hold on power in Poland's government[4]. Here's an analysis of the current situation and factors that may influence whether Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski will win the presidency.\n\n## Current Polling Status\n\nAs of late April 2025, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, representing the Civic Coalition, leads in the polls:\n\n- The latest IBRiS poll (conducted April 25-26, 2025) shows Trzaskowski with 33.2% support[5]\n- His main challenger, Karol Nawrocki (backed by PiS), stands at 25.6%[5]\n- Other candidates trail significantly: S\u0142awomir Mentzen (Confederation) at 11.5%, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia (Third Way) at 6.1%, and Magdalena Biejat (New Left) at 5.1%[5]\n\nThis polling suggests that no candidate is likely to secure the required 50% of votes in the first round, necessitating a second-round runoff on June 1, 2025, between the top two candidates (likely Trzaskowski and Nawrocki)[4][5].\n\n## Recent Trends and Developments\n\nWhile Trzaskowski maintains his frontrunner status, there are signs of a shifting race:\n\n- Over the last month, Nawrocki has \"dramatically reduced the gap in polls\" to Trzaskowski[1]\n- Trzaskowski's support has shown some stability since the official campaign launch in January 2025, with a slight increase from 30.8% in mid-April to 33.2% in late April[3][5]\n\n## Political Context\n\nThe election takes place amid significant political transitions in Poland:\n\n- The Civic Coalition, led by Donald Tusk's Civic Platform (PO), defeated PiS in the October 2023 parliamentary elections[2]\n- The Civic Coalition also won the European elections in June 2024 with 37.06% of the vote[2]\n- Poland is currently experiencing a difficult period of cohabitation between President Duda (PiS) and Prime Minister Tusk (Civic Coalition)[2]\n- Tusk has repeatedly stated that Duda's presidency has prevented implementation of promised reforms[2]\n\nThis context is crucial because the presidential election could determine whether Tusk's government can fully implement its agenda. In Poland, the president has veto power over legislation, and the current parliamentary majority lacks the three-fifths majority needed to override presidential vetoes[2].\n\n## Factors That May Influence the Outcome\n\nSeveral factors could impact Trzaskowski's chances of victory:\n\n1. **Second-round dynamics**: If the election goes to a second round as expected, the distribution of votes from eliminated candidates will be crucial. How supporters of candidates like Mentzen, Ho\u0142ownia, and Biejat vote in a Trzaskowski-Nawrocki runoff could determine the winner.\n\n2. **Urban-rural divide**: Poland has experienced significant political polarization between urban and rural areas, which could affect regional voting patterns.\n\n3. **Campaign developments**: With the election still about a week away, campaign events, debates, and potential controversies could shift voter sentiment.\n\n4. **Voter turnout**: Differential turnout among various demographic groups could significantly impact the final results.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting this forecast:\n\n1. **Polling accuracy**: Polls represent a snapshot in time and may not accurately predict final voting behavior, especially in a polarized political environment.\n\n2. **Narrowing race**: The fact that Nawrocki has been closing the gap suggests the race may be more competitive than earlier polls indicated[1].\n\n3. **Undecided voters**: The polls don't clearly indicate the percentage of undecided voters, who could swing the election in either direction.\n\n4. **Second-round uncertainties**: Predicting second-round voting behavior is particularly challenging, as it depends on complex voter preference transfers.\n\nWhile Trzaskowski currently leads in the polls, the race appears to be tightening, and the outcome will likely depend on second-round dynamics if neither candidate secures an outright majority on May 18.",
        "2":"# Forecasting the Timing of a 2025 Reconciliation Bill\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress has been working on a reconciliation bill to implement President Trump's agenda following the 2024 elections that gave Republicans control of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. Based on available information as of April 2025, here's an analysis of when President Trump might sign such legislation.\n\n## Current Status of the Reconciliation Process\n\nThe reconciliation process is well underway in 2025. On February 25, 2025, the House passed a budget resolution to initiate the reconciliation process, outlining reductions in taxes and spending over the next decade[3]. This formal step established the framework for committees to develop their portions of the reconciliation package.\n\nCongress has set a deadline of May 9, 2025, for committees to deliver their reconciliation bills[4]. Various House committees have been scheduled for markups:\n- Armed Services, Education & Workforce, and Homeland Security committees were scheduled for the week of April 28\n- Financial Services, Judiciary, Oversight, and Transportation & Infrastructure committees for April 30\n- Agriculture Committee for the week of May 5\n- Energy & Commerce Committee for May 7[5]\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, which handles tax policy (including the renewal of Trump's 2017 tax cuts), was rumored to hold markups during the week of May 5, though timing could slip[5].\n\n## Timeline Projections\n\nRepublican leadership has set Memorial Day (late May 2025) as their target for passing the full reconciliation bill[5]. However, political analysts have noted that \"Mike Johnson's tight megabill timeline is on a collision course with reality,\" suggesting potential delays in the process[2].\n\nThe reconciliation bill represents what some describe as a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity\" for Republicans to implement their agenda, including bringing \"the federal workforce to heel\" and saving \"taxpayers billions\"[1]. The comprehensive nature of the bill, covering tax policy, border security, and energy permitting, adds complexity to the legislative process.\n\n## Factors That Could Affect Timing\n\nA critical factor that could accelerate the timeline is the federal debt ceiling. While the government is not expected to hit its borrowing limit until August or September, this timeline could be moved up to late May or June if tax revenue falls below expectations[5]. This situation could create urgency to pass the reconciliation bill sooner, as it may include provisions to increase the debt limit by $4 trillion[5].\n\n## Forecast\n\nBased on the available information, if Republicans maintain their current timeline and successfully pass the reconciliation bill by Memorial Day, President Trump could sign it into law in June 2025, placing it in the \"Before July\" category. However, given the complexity of the legislation and indications of potential delays, there is a significant possibility that the signing could slip to the \"July - August\" period.\n\nThe likelihood of the bill being delayed until September or later appears lower based on current information, especially considering the potential debt ceiling pressure that could force earlier action. However, if substantial disagreements emerge during the committee process, particularly regarding the Ways and Means Committee's tax provisions or the Energy and Commerce Committee's $880 billion in required cuts, further delays are possible.",
        "3":"# Forecasting Analysis: DHS SEVP Certification Revocation for Ivy League\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, the question of whether the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for an Ivy League university before September 1, 2025, requires careful analysis of current developments and historical precedents.\n\n## Current Situation\n\nThe most significant development is that DHS has explicitly threatened to revoke Harvard University's SEVP certification, with a deadline of April 30, 2025, for the university to provide detailed records of international students' involvement in \"illegal and violent activities.\"[5] This deadline has now passed, making the next 3-4 months critical for resolution.\n\nHarvard currently enrolls 6,793 international students, representing 27.2% of the university's total enrollment in the 2024-25 academic year.[1] The potential impact of a revocation would be substantial, affecting thousands of students and creating significant disruption to Harvard's operations and finances.\n\n## SEVP Certification Framework\n\nSEVP certification is the regulatory mechanism that allows institutions to issue Forms I-20 to prospective international students, which is necessary for obtaining F and M student visas.[3] For a school to maintain certification, it must:\n\n- Remain operational and instruct students in approved courses\/programs\n- Maintain necessary facilities, adequate finances, and qualified personnel\n- Meet state requirements to operate as an institution of learning\n- Provide instruction leading to a degree or professional, educational, or vocational objective[3]\n\nThe certification can be withdrawn through a formal process, after which affected students must either transfer to another SEVP-certified institution, change their immigration status, or leave the United States.[5]\n\n## Precedent Analysis\n\nAs of March 12, 2025, ICE had listed six schools whose SEVP certifications had been withdrawn.[5] However, these cases primarily involved schools that had either:\n\n1. Ceased operations completely\n2. Been denied recertification through regular review processes[5]\n\nThere is no recent precedent for a high-profile, fully operational research university like Harvard losing SEVP certification due to political or policy disputes. This makes the current situation relatively unprecedented.\n\n## Key Factors Affecting Probability\n\nSeveral factors will influence whether DHS proceeds with revoking Harvard's (or another Ivy League's) SEVP certification:\n\n1. **Harvard's Compliance**: Whether Harvard met the April 30 deadline and the adequacy of its response\n2. **Legal Challenges**: Harvard would likely mount immediate legal challenges to any revocation attempt\n3. **Political Considerations**: The significant economic and diplomatic impact of restricting international student enrollment at elite institutions\n4. **Institutional Response**: Actions taken by Harvard to address the underlying concerns about campus climate\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on available information as of May 12, 2025, I estimate a **30-40% probability** that DHS will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for at least one Ivy League university before September 1, 2025.\n\nThis assessment reflects:\n\n- The explicit threat against Harvard has moved beyond speculation to formal administrative action[5]\n- The deadline for Harvard's response has passed, potentially triggering next steps in the process\n- The significant stakes involved make this a high-profile case with potential for intervention\n- The relatively short timeline (less than 4 months remaining until the September 1 deadline)\n- The unprecedented nature of such an action against an elite university creates uncertainty\n\n## Key Uncertainties\n\nMajor uncertainties in this forecast include:\n\n1. Whether Harvard complied with the April 30 deadline (information not available in current sources)\n2. The legal standard for SEVP revocation in cases involving alleged hostile environments (versus operational failures)\n3. The effectiveness of potential legal challenges by Harvard or other affected institutions\n4. The willingness of DHS to follow through on threats against a prestigious institution\n\nThis forecast should be updated as new information becomes available regarding Harvard's compliance with DHS demands and any formal notices of intent to revoke certification.",
        "4":"**Key historical trends and current status**\n\n- Ukraine surrendered its inherited nuclear arsenal in 1994 in exchange for security guarantees under the Budapest Memorandum, which have since been violated by Russia[4].\n- Since the Russian annexation of Crimea (2014) and the full-scale invasion (2022), Ukrainian officials have periodically raised the nuclear issue as leverage, particularly when Western security guarantees falter[1][2][5].\n- As of early 2025, Ukraine possesses significant nuclear expertise, civilian nuclear infrastructure, uranium resources, and missile technology, theoretically enabling a rapid weapons program if so ordered[2].\n\n**Recent announcements and policies**\n\n- President Zelenskyy and other officials have stated that, given the failure of security guarantees, Ukraine faces a stark choice between NATO membership or \u201cmanufacturing nuclear weapons\u201d[2][5].\n- However, every such statement has been quickly clarified: both Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry have repeatedly and explicitly denied any current intention to develop nuclear weapons, affirming Ukraine\u2019s commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty[2][5].\n- No credible reports from major media, Ukrainian\/allied officials, or international agencies have indicated the initiation of a weapons program as of May 2025[1][2][5].\n\n**Authoritative sources for verification**\n\n- Major international media, statements by Ukrainian ministers, allied government officials, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have all been monitoring the situation closely. The IAEA maintains a presence at all Ukrainian nuclear plants, making a covert program highly unlikely[3].\n\n**Limitations or uncertainties**\n\n- The situation is dynamic: if Western support were to evaporate and Russia\u2019s aggression escalate further, Ukrainian incentives could theoretically shift.\n- Public nuclear rhetoric, while increasing, has thus far served as a lever for diplomatic pressure rather than concrete policy.\n- Any move towards weaponization would likely be detected rapidly by international agencies or media.\n\n**Adjusted probabilistic assessment**\n\nGiven Ukraine\u2019s technical capability, security pressures, and recurring nuclear rhetoric\u2014but also the absolute absence of credible reports, the presence of IAEA inspectors, and the repeated official denials\u2014the probability that Ukraine will launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026 is very low. Unless currently unforeseen geopolitical shocks occur, there is no evidence to suggest Ukraine will cross this threshold within the forecast window.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1].

        "5":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- **Sam Altman's Firing and Return:** On November 17, 2023, Sam Altman was fired as CEO of OpenAI for not being \"consistently candid\" with the board, according to the board's public statement. The specific areas where candor was lacking have not been disclosed, and no public allegations of criminal activity accompanied the firing. By May 2025, Altman is back in control at OpenAI, with a board now more closely aligned with him[1][2].\n- **Legal Scrutiny and Civil Litigation:** OpenAI, and by extension Altman, is currently under scrutiny from the attorneys general of California and Delaware and faces civil lawsuits, including a high-profile legal dispute with Elon Musk. The Musk lawsuit is scheduled for trial in March 2025, but the nature of all known actions is civil, not criminal, as of the latest reporting[3][4][5].\n\n## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- **OpenAI Corporate Governance:** Recent governance changes have tightened Altman's control over the board, making a repeat of the 2023 ouster unlikely, but also potentially increasing regulatory and public scrutiny of OpenAI's decision-making and compliance practices[2].\n- **Legal Proceedings Timeline:** Attorneys for both Musk and Altman have indicated that, aside from the March 2025 trial date, full legal resolution could extend beyond 2026, underscoring the slow pace typical of complex tech litigation[4][5].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- News outlets such as Business Insider, Axios, and court documents provide up-to-date coverage of OpenAI's governance and legal situation[1][2][5].\n- Public statements from the OpenAI board and filings in the Musk lawsuit are primary sources for recent developments[4][5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- **Lack of Public Criminal Allegations:** As of May 2025, there are no public criminal investigations or indictments against Sam Altman. Regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits are ongoing, but these are civil in nature.\n- **Opaque Board Concerns:** The precise nature of Altman's alleged lack of candor remains undisclosed, leaving open the possibility (albeit apparently remote as of now) that future revelations could trigger criminal investigations.\n- **Comparison to Reference Cases:** Criminal indictments of high-profile tech CEOs (e.g., Elizabeth Holmes, Sam Bankman-Fried) have historically followed public revelations of major fraud or misconduct. No such revelations have occurred concerning Altman as of the current date.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the facts as of May 2025:\n- There is currently no public evidence or credible report of an active criminal investigation into Sam Altman.\n- All known legal actions are civil, and the timeline for lawsuits indicates a slow legal process.\n- Regulatory scrutiny could, in theory, uncover criminal conduct, but this remains speculative.\n- Compared to reference cases, the absence of public criminal allegations makes indictment before 2026 unlikely.\n\n**Adjusted probability: The likelihood that Sam Altman will be indicted before January 1, 2026, appears low based on all currently available information. However, this assessment is subject to change if new facts emerge.**\n\n## References\n\n[1]. OpenAI's Nonprofit Will Remain in Control After All - Business Insider  \n[2].

        "6":"# UK Housing Market Forecast: Crash Probability Before July 2025\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, I've analyzed the likelihood of a UK housing market crash (defined as a 30% decline from June 2023 levels) occurring before July 2025. Based on current data and expert forecasts, such a crash appears highly improbable.\n\n## Current Market Status\n\nThe UK housing market has demonstrated resilience through 2024 and into 2025, despite earlier affordability challenges. The current average UK house price stands at approximately \u00a3269,000[2], showing stability rather than decline. This is significantly higher than the \u00a3260,968 threshold that would indicate a 30% crash from June 2023 levels (\u00a3372,812).\n\n## Key Market Indicators\n\n### Price Growth Projections\nMost major analysts and institutions are forecasting continued growth for the remainder of 2025:\n\n- Nationwide and HomeOwners Alliance predict house price growth of 2-4% for 2025[1][2]\n- Rightmove projects national asking prices to grow by 4% through 2025[5]\n- Hampton forecasts a 3% rise across Britain[5]\n- Savills has recently upgraded their five-year forecast for UK house price growth[4]\n\n### Mortgage Market Conditions\nMortgage conditions appear to be stabilizing or improving:\n\n- Mortgage rates are expected to range between 4-5% in 2025 according to Lloyd's Banking Group[3]\n- Some analysts suggest rates could settle between 3-4%[5]\n- Gross mortgage lending is projected to increase by 16% to \u00a3275 billion in 2025, up from \u00a3237.5 billion in 2024[5]\n\n### Regional Variations\nThe London property market is expected to outperform other regions for the first time since 2015[5], indicating strength in what has historically been the UK's most significant property market.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\nWhen comparing current conditions to historical housing crashes, several key differences emerge:\n\n1. **Mortgage Availability**: Unlike previous crashes, mortgage lending is projected to increase in 2025, with easing affordability pressures.\n\n2. **Economic Outlook**: While there are some concerns about the wider economic climate, there's no indication of the severe economic downturn that typically precedes housing market crashes.\n\n3. **Supply-Demand Balance**: The UK continues to face housing supply shortages, with the government aiming to build 370,000 new homes annually in England, though this target is unlikely to be met in the immediate term[2].\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available data and expert forecasts, I assess the probability of a UK housing market crash (30% decline) before July 2025 as extremely low (<5%). With only about six weeks remaining until July 2025, and all indicators pointing to modest growth rather than decline, there is insufficient time for market conditions to deteriorate to the point of a crash.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors could potentially impact this forecast:\n\n- Potential changes to government policy, including stamp duty adjustments\n- Unexpected economic shocks or rapid changes in interest rate policies\n- Global economic factors, including the impact of US trade policies under the Trump presidency\n- Regional variations in housing market performance\n\nHowever, none of these factors appear likely to cause a 30% market crash in the short timeframe before July 2025.",
        "7":"# Forecast for IRA Tax Credit Adders Before 2026\n\nAs of April 2025, the tax credit adders established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) face significant uncertainty due to political changes and ongoing policy debates. This analysis examines the current status and potential future of these clean energy incentives.\n\n## Current Status of IRA Tax Credit Adders\n\nThe IRA established several important adders to the base Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) to incentivize clean energy development:\n\n- **Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship (PWA) Adder**: Projects meeting certain pay thresholds and apprenticeship requirements can receive a 5x multiple on the base 6% ITC rate, boosting credits to 30% of the project's cost[4]\n- **Domestic Content Adder**: Projects using domestically produced materials can claim an additional 10 percentage points, potentially increasing ITC value to 40%[4]\n- **Energy Communities Adder**: Projects developed in designated energy communities can claim an additional 10 percentage points[4]\n\nThese adders have been instrumental in driving clean energy investments since the IRA's passage. Currently, homeowners can save up to $3,200 annually through 2032 on energy-efficient home upgrades, with credits covering up to 30% of costs[2]. Additionally, the Residential Clean Energy credit provides a 30% income tax credit for clean energy equipment through 2032, stepping down to 22% for 2033 and 2034[2].\n\n## Recent Developments Affecting IRA Tax Credits\n\nThe political landscape has shifted significantly, creating uncertainty for the future of IRA tax credits:\n\n1. **Administrative Changes**: The incoming Trump administration has already taken action regarding IRA funding, with a day-one executive order pausing the disbursement of funds appropriated through the IRA.\n\n2. **Congressional Review**: Republican majorities in Congress are expected to revisit IRA incentives during debate over new tax legislation in 2025[5]. This review could lead to significant modifications or reductions to the existing adder structure.\n\n3. **Structural Changes**: There are already indications of changes to the structure of IRA tax credits coming in 2025, though specific details about which adders might be affected remain unclear[1].\n\n## Potential Scenarios Before 2026\n\nBased on current information, three scenarios appear possible for the IRA tax credit adders before 2026:\n\n### Scenario 1: Full Repeal\n\nGiven the executive order pausing IRA fund disbursement and Republican control of Congress, a full repeal of the adders is possible. This would eliminate all conditional increases to the base ITC and PTC established by the IRA, potentially returning to pre-IRA structures.\n\n### Scenario 2: Reduced Incentives\n\nA more moderate approach might involve reducing rather than eliminating adders. This could take the form of:\n- Lowering percentage increases (e.g., reducing the domestic content adder from 10% to 5%)\n- Eliminating specific adders while maintaining others\n- Imposing stricter qualification requirements for receiving adders\n\n### Scenario 3: Maintained Structure\n\nDespite political pressure, the economic benefits and industry momentum created by these tax credits could lead to their preservation. The clean energy transition has created jobs and investments across many states, potentially creating bipartisan support for maintaining some incentives.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors complicate forecasting the fate of IRA tax credit adders:\n\n1. **Legislative Timeline**: The legislative process for tax reform is complex and time-consuming, making it difficult to predict when changes might be enacted.\n\n2. **Economic Considerations**: The economic impact of repealing or reducing these incentives may influence political decisions, especially in states benefiting from clean energy investments.\n\n3. **Industry Pressure**: Sectors that have made significant investments based on these tax credits may lobby extensively to maintain them.\n\n4. **Implementation Challenges**: Even with legislative changes, the implementation timeline and transition provisions remain uncertain.\n\nThe outlook for IRA tax credit adders remains highly dependent on political developments and legislative priorities in the coming months. Stakeholders in the clean energy sector should prepare for potential changes while monitoring congressional actions closely.",
        "8":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- As of May 2025, Ukrainian General Staff estimates and UK Defence Intelligence assessments indicate that Russian personnel losses (killed and wounded) since February 2022 have reached approximately 950,000[4].\n- The daily rate of reported Russian casualties has risen sharply in 2025, with April\u2019s average exceeding 1,200 per day and a total of about 160,000 in the first four months of the year[4]. On several recent days, reported losses have topped 1,300[1].\n- If this pace continues, Ukraine\u2019s official tally will reach 1 million Russian personnel losses within the next 2\u20133 months, i.e., by July or August 2025, well before the January 2026 deadline.\n\n## Key Differences and Factors Affecting the Forecast\n\n- The current pace of casualties is the highest on record, reflecting the intensification of fighting in 2025[4].\n- There have been no major ceasefire announcements, peace agreements, or reporting interruptions as of May 2025 that might prevent continued daily updates from the Ukrainian General Staff.\n- While Ukrainian official figures may overestimate Russian losses, these are the numbers used for resolution, per the criteria.\n\n## Authoritative Verification Sources\n\n- Ukrainian General Staff daily reports on Facebook, Telegram, and X.com are the primary reference for the resolution of this question.\n- Secondary independent trackers, such as russian-casualties.in.ua and Combat.FYI, broadly support the ongoing high-casualty trend, though their figures may lag official Ukrainian announcements[5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Ukrainian official casualty figures are widely considered to be estimates and may be inflated, but they are generally consistent with the reported intensity of fighting and independent OSINT trends.\n- The situation could change if a ceasefire or peace deal is reached, or if the Ukrainian General Staff ceases or delays publication of daily reports for more than 30 days.\n- Actual numbers may differ, but for the purpose of this forecast, only the Ukrainian General Staff's public reports are determinative.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the current pace of reported Russian losses, the lack of announced changes to reporting or major de-escalation, and the proximity to the 1 million threshold, it is highly probable (well above 90%) that the Ukrainian General Staff will report 1 million Russian personnel losses before 1 January 2026.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "9":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- As of December 20, 2024, Elon Musk was ranked the world\u2019s richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with an estimated net worth of $455 billion, a margin of over $200 billion above the next richest, Jeff Bezos[1][5].\n- Musk\u2019s wealth peaked at $486 billion in December 2024, but by March 2025 had dropped to about $330 billion, mainly due to a sharp decline in Tesla\u2019s stock price[2][3][4]. Despite this, he remained the richest person, with a $108 billion lead over Bezos as of March 2025[3].\n- Musk\u2019s net worth is dominated by his 20.5% stake in Tesla (which saw its market cap fall from $1.5 trillion in December 2024 to under $900 billion in March 2025[2][3]), and his 42% stake in SpaceX (valued between $210 billion and $350 billion in late 2024 and early 2025[2]).\n- Other major assets include significant holdings in xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X (formerly Twitter), but these constitute a smaller share of his total wealth[2].\n\n## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- The 35% decline in Tesla\u2019s share price in early 2025 was driven by broad market selloffs, increased tariffs, and concerns about the automotive sector\u2019s global supply chains[3].\n- SpaceX\u2019s valuation continued to rise, becoming Musk\u2019s most valuable asset by early 2025, which helped offset some of Tesla\u2019s declines[2].\n- Broader market conditions and regulatory risks remain significant, with Tesla\u2019s fortunes especially sensitive to geopolitics and policy changes[3].\n- No recent announcements suggest Musk will divest large portions of his holdings or face major dilution before the end of 2025.\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is the definitive source for ranking the world's wealthiest individuals and will be used for resolution[1].\n- Historical trends and asset breakdowns are corroborated by Bloomberg, Investopedia, Cointelegraph, and major news outlets[2][3][4][5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Musk\u2019s net worth is highly sensitive to Tesla\u2019s share price. Continued volatility or a further decline could threaten his top position, especially if competitors\u2019 assets outperform or remain stable[2][3].\n- SpaceX\u2019s valuation is based on private market estimates, which can be subject to rapid revision or illiquidity[2].\n- Unexpected events (e.g., asset sales, regulatory action, corporate governance issues, or macroeconomic shocks) could impact Musk\u2019s ranking.\n- The large current gap\u2014over $100 billion\u2014makes it less likely for others to surpass him absent an extraordinary reversal, but this gap has already narrowed since late 2024[3][4].\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven Musk\u2019s current lead, diversified asset base, and the lack of imminent large-scale threats to his holdings, the probability that he will remain the world\u2019s richest person on December 31, 2025, remains high\u2014likely above 70%. However, the risks posed by further declines in Tesla\u2019s value, private valuations of SpaceX, and broader market volatility make his position less secure than it appeared at the end of 2024. A sharp, sustained drop in Tesla or a major upward movement in a competitor\u2019s assets could close the gap, but barring such developments, Musk is favored to retain the top spot[1][2][3][4].\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.

        "10":"# Measles Cases Forecast for United States in 2025\n\nAs of July 17, 2024, we have several indicators suggesting that measles cases in the United States could increase substantially in 2025. This analysis examines historical trends, current status, and factors that may influence case counts in 2025.\n\n## Current Situation and Historical Context\n\nThe United States has experienced 167 reported measles cases as of July 11, 2024, already exceeding annual totals for each year since 2019 (when 1,274 cases were reported). This represents a concerning upward trend in measles transmission.\n\nHistorical data shows that measles cases can fluctuate dramatically from year to year, with the potential for significant outbreaks when vaccination rates decline or importation events increase. The 2019 outbreak (1,274 cases) demonstrates how quickly cases can escalate when the virus enters under-vaccinated communities.\n\n## Forecast Analysis for 2025\n\nBased on current trends and historical patterns, we project that measles cases in 2025 could range between 800-1,200 cases, with several factors potentially driving this increase:\n\n**Key Factors Affecting the Forecast:**\n\n1. **Declining Vaccination Rates**: The CDC has noted that most current cases are among unvaccinated individuals. If this trend continues, we could see larger outbreaks in 2025.\n\n2. **Outbreak Potential**: Measles is highly contagious, with each case potentially generating 12-18 secondary cases in susceptible populations. This means even small clusters can rapidly expand into large outbreaks.\n\n3. **Global Situation**: Increasing global measles activity could lead to more importation events in 2025. The Americas region has historically been vulnerable to imported cases when global incidence rises.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on current vaccination trends and case patterns in 2024, I estimate the following probability distribution for 2025 measles cases in the United States:\n\n- 10% probability: <400 cases (containment of current trends)\n- 30% probability: 400-800 cases (moderate increase)\n- 40% probability: 800-1,200 cases (substantial increase)\n- 15% probability: 1,200-2,000 cases (major outbreak scenario)\n- 5% probability: >2,000 cases (widespread transmission)\n\nThe most likely scenario (800-1,200 cases) would represent a 5-7x increase from 2024 mid-year levels, but would remain below the 2019 peak. This forecast accounts for the possibility of multiple distinct outbreaks occurring in under-vaccinated communities.\n\n## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors create uncertainty in this forecast:\n\n1. **Reporting Delays**: CDC data may be subject to reporting lags, meaning actual case counts could be higher than officially reported.\n\n2. **Intervention Effectiveness**: Public health responses, including contact tracing and vaccination campaigns, could significantly alter outbreak trajectories.\n\n3. **Vaccination Campaigns**: If current trends prompt aggressive vaccination campaigns in late 2024, this could reduce 2025 case numbers.\n\n4. **Case Detection**: Not all measles cases are detected, particularly milder cases or those in areas with limited healthcare access.\n\nThe CDC currently updates its measles data on the second and fourth Friday of each month, which may affect the timeliness of final 2025 figures when resolving this forecast.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "11":"# Brazil Inflation Forecast Analysis: 2024 vs 2025\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of Brazil's inflation trajectory by comparing 2024 figures with current and projected 2025 data.\n\n## Current Situation vs. Reference Case\n\nBrazil's inflation rate in 2024 was 4.37% as stated in the query. Current data shows that Brazil's inflation rate has increased significantly in 2025:\n\n- The inflation rate reached 5.53% in April 2025, up from 5.48% in March 2025[1]\n- The average inflation rate for 2025 is approximately 5.31%[4]\n- Analysts project inflation to reach around 5.60% by the end of Q2 2025[1]\n\nThis represents a clear upward trend compared to 2024 levels, with inflation running more than 0.9 percentage points higher than the previous year.\n\n## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast\n\nSeveral critical factors are driving this inflationary pressure in 2025:\n\n**Monetary Policy Challenges:**\n- Despite the Central Bank's efforts, inflation expectations have worsened, with projections reaching 4.6% for 2025[2]\n- The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) has had to adjust its monetary stance in response to inflation pressures[5]\n\n**Economic Conditions:**\n- Weak government finances are contributing to stronger inflation and higher interest rates[5]\n- The Brazilian real has experienced depreciation, which typically puts upward pressure on inflation through import costs[5]\n- Economic growth is projected at 2% for 2025, reflecting a slowdown compared to the stronger performance of approximately 3% observed in recent years[3]\n\n**Market Expectations:**\n- Financial analysts have reduced their projections for Brazil's benchmark interest rate (Selic) from 15% to 14.75% by the end of 2025, suggesting some optimism about inflation control in late 2025[3]\n- The median forecast for the official inflation rate has shown modest improvement, dropping for three consecutive weeks to 5.53% (as of May 6, 2025), down from 5.55%[3]\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available data as of May 12, 2025, I assess with high confidence (approximately 90-95% probability) that Brazil's inflation rate in 2025 will be higher than it was in 2024. This assessment is based on:\n\n1. Current inflation readings (5.53% as of April 2025) are already significantly above 2024's 4.37%[1]\n2. Projections from economic analysts and the central bank consistently show 2025 inflation above 5%[1][3][4]\n3. While there are some signs of modest improvement in recent weeks, the projected inflation remains substantially above the 2024 level[3]\n4. Long-term projections suggest inflation will not fall below 2024 levels until 2026-2027[1]\n\nThe evidence indicates that despite some stabilization efforts, Brazil is experiencing a period of higher inflation in 2025 compared to 2024. Even with recent modest improvements in forecasts, inflation is expected to remain elevated throughout 2025, with the Central Bank of Brazil and market analysts projecting rates well above the 2024 figure of 4.37%.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Inflation projections are subject to revision based on monetary policy adjustments\n- External factors such as global commodity prices and currency fluctuations could significantly impact the inflation trajectory\n- The effectiveness of government fiscal measures in the remainder of 2025 could alter the inflation outlook",
        "12":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Global wealth per adult experienced a significant recovery in 2023, growing by approximately 4.2% after a contraction in 2022[4][5].\n- The contraction in 2022 was largely due to currency effects, particularly a strong US dollar, but the rebound in 2023 more than offset these losses[5].\n- Real (inflation-adjusted) global wealth grew by nearly 8.4% in 2023, outpacing nominal growth as inflation slowed[5].\n- Since 2008, global wealth per adult has been on a steady upward trajectory, though the pace of growth has slowed in most markets[2][5].\n- In 2023, adults in EMEA were the wealthiest on average (USD 166,000), followed by APAC (USD 156,000), and the Americas (USD 146,000)[5].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- No major global policy shifts or economic crises have been reported that would suggest a reversal of the upward trend in 2024.\n- Upward wealth mobility is expected to become more pronounced by 2030, with continued horizontal wealth transfer anticipated[5].\n- The convergence of emerging economies with mature markets continues to drive growth, especially in the Asia-Pacific region[2].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The UBS Global Wealth Report 2024 provides comprehensive data and analysis on global wealth trends[2][3].\n- The BCG Global Wealth Report 2024 corroborates the recovery and ongoing growth in global net wealth[4].\n- The World Inequality Database (WID) remains the definitive source for the specific metric in question and will provide the final figures for 2024.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The precise WID figures for 2024 are not yet published; forecasts rely on trends and projections from other authoritative reports.\n- Currency fluctuations and inflation can significantly impact nominal wealth figures, though recent data suggest real growth is robust[5].\n- Regional disparities and wealth concentration may affect the distribution, but the global average is expected to rise barring unforeseen shocks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the strong recovery in 2023, the ongoing upward trend in global wealth per adult, and the absence of major negative shocks or policy changes, it is likely that the global average wealth per adult will increase in 2024 compared to 2023. However, the final resolution depends on the publication of 2024 data by the World Inequality Database.\n\n## References\n\n- [1].

        "13":"### Forecast on Pause of Large Training Runs by OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic Before 2026\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on historical data, recent policy announcements, and expert community forecasts as of early 2025, it is highly unlikely that OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic will announce a pause on all training runs above a certain size for safety reasons before 2026.\n\n**Key Points:**  \n- No known pauses on large training runs for safety reasons have been announced by these companies as of early 2024[2].  \n- Community predictions place the likelihood of such a pause before 2026 at approximately 2.5%[1].  \n- The Frontier AI Safety Commitments adopted by AI companies in mid-2024 focus on responsible scaling and governance improvements rather than pausing training runs[5].  \n- OpenAI\u2019s internal governance reforms and dissolved safety-focused compute teams suggest challenges in safety alignment but no broad halting of training[5].  \n- AI companies, including the three in question, actively resist restrictive regulation as of early 2025, indicating a preference to continue development without enforced pauses[4].  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe adjusted probabilistic assessment is that the probability is very low (around 2.5%) that any of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic will announce a comprehensive pause on training runs above a certain size for safety reasons before 2026. This forecast aligns with current evidence and expert consensus.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1].

        "14":"# Forecasting White-Collar Employment Trends Through 2026\n\nThe question asks whether the percentage of U.S. workers in white-collar jobs will drop at least 2 percentage points below the 2022 level before 2026. To address this effectively, I'll analyze historical trends, current status, and factors that could influence this metric.\n\n## Historical Trends and Current Status\n\nThe percentage of white-collar jobs in the U.S. workforce has shown a consistent upward trajectory over the past three decades:\n\n- From 1993 to 2022, white-collar employment increased from 58.9% to 62.2% of the total workforce, reflecting a long-term structural shift in the U.S. economy[3]\n- This represents approximately a 3.3 percentage point increase over 30 years, or roughly 0.11 percentage points per year on average\n- The metric was last below 60.0% briefly in 2007 and before that in the late 1990s, indicating considerable stability in this trend\n\nAs of 2023, professionals constituted 57.8% of the total workforce, with approximately 93 million people working across various professional occupations[1]. This figure appears to use a slightly different classification than the BLS definition specified in the question, which includes both \"Management, professional, and related occupations\" and \"Sales and office occupations.\"\n\n## Factors Potentially Affecting White-Collar Employment\n\nSeveral factors could influence whether we'll see a significant decline in white-collar employment:\n\n### 1. Emerging Technology Impact\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), poses a potential disruptive force for white-collar workers:\n\n- Research from OpenAI suggests that around 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by LLMs\n- White-collar jobs that involve routine cognitive tasks may be more vulnerable to AI automation than blue-collar physical labor\n\n### 2. Economic Indicators and Labor Market Trends\n\nThere are signs of cooling demand for white-collar workers:\n\n- Professional services saw monthly average job openings fall nearly 20% to 1.7 million in the first 11 months of 2023, compared to 2022[5]\n- This decline was significantly steeper than the 4% decrease in job openings observed in construction, a sector with high concentrations of blue-collar workers[5]\n\n### 3. Workforce Composition Shifts\n\nDemographic and sectoral shifts could influence the overall composition:\n\n- The growth of service sectors not classified as traditional white-collar work could dilute the percentage\n- Any significant reshoring of manufacturing would likely increase blue-collar employment percentages\n\n## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral limitations affect the forecasting accuracy:\n\n1. **Definition Changes**: BLS occasionally revises occupational classifications, which could affect trend analysis\n2. **Economic Shocks**: Unforeseen economic disruptions could dramatically alter employment patterns\n3. **Technology Adoption Rate**: The pace at which AI technologies are implemented in workplaces remains uncertain\n4. **Policy Responses**: Government interventions in response to technological unemployment could affect outcomes\n\n## Forecast Assessment\n\nBased on the available data as of June 2023, the likelihood of white-collar employment dropping by 2 percentage points (to below 60.2%) before 2026 appears moderate but not high:\n\n1. **Historical Inertia**: The long-term trend has been consistently upward for decades, suggesting structural economic forces favoring white-collar employment\n2. **Early Warning Signs**: The 20% reduction in professional services job openings represents a significant deviation from historical patterns[5]\n3. **AI Acceleration**: The rapid development and deployment of AI technologies like ChatGPT and similar models in early 2023 could accelerate impacts on white-collar employment\n4. **Economic Resilience**: The U.S. economy showed strong growth in late 2023, expanding by 4.9% in Q3 and 3.3% in Q4[5], which typically supports job creation across sectors\n\nWhile there are clear signals of potential disruption, the historical stability and gradual nature of workforce composition changes suggest that a 2 percentage point decline within approximately 2.5 years would represent a significant deviation from long-term patterns. However, the unprecedented nature of recent AI advancements introduces substantial uncertainty.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe probability of seeing white-collar employment drop by at least 2 percentage points below 2022 levels before 2026 appears moderate (roughly 30-40%). While early indicators of reduced demand for white-collar workers exist, the historical resilience of this employment category and the typically gradual nature of workforce composition changes suggest that such a substantial decline would require accelerated implementation of AI technologies or other significant economic disruptions.",
        "15":"# Forecasting Analysis: Magnificent Seven Bubble Risk Assessment\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, the Magnificent Seven stocks have experienced significant volatility, presenting a complex forecasting challenge regarding whether they will meet the \"bubble pop\" criteria (at least four stocks closing 50% below all-time highs) before January 2026.\n\n## Current Market Status\n\nThe Magnificent Seven\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla\u2014currently have a combined market capitalization of $15.4 trillion as of May 1, 2025, having recovered somewhat after earlier declines[1]. However, their total market value remains $2.2 trillion lower (-12.4%) year-to-date in 2025[1].\n\nIndividual year-to-date performance in 2025 shows varied outcomes:\n\n- Microsoft: +0.9% (+$30B)\n- Meta Platforms: -1.9% (-$30B)\n- Amazon: -12.6% (-$290B)\n- Alphabet: -14.9% (-$350B)\n- Apple: -15.4% (-$580B)\n- Nvidia: -17.2% (-$570B)\n- Tesla: -30.4% (-$390B)[1]\n\nThese stocks collectively delivered strong earnings in Q4 2024, with aggregate earnings reaching an all-time high of $131.2 billion, growing 31.7% year-over-year[4]. However, this growth rate marks their lowest since Q1 2023 and is expected to decline further, with Q1 2025 growth forecasted at only 18.5%[4].\n\n## Valuation Analysis\n\nA significant shift in valuations has occurred over recent months. According to Morningstar's analysis from March 2025:\n\n- Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are now considered undervalued\n- Nvidia and Tesla are deemed fairly valued\n- Apple remains overvalued[5]\n\nThis represents a major change from 2024 when most of these stocks traded at premium valuations[5]. The recent market selloff has brought price-to-fair-value ratios down considerably.\n\n## Historical Context and Trends\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks experienced extraordinary growth between 2023-2024, collectively rising 156.1%[3]. However, they have faced challenges in 2025, with double-digit declines to start the year[3].\n\nTheir market dominance has been notable, with these companies reaching market capitalizations of approximately $1 trillion or more, with several around $3 trillion as of March 2025[2].\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nSeveral factors suggest increased vulnerability for these stocks:\n\n1. **Growth Deceleration**: The quarter-over-quarter earnings growth of 19.3% in Q4 2024 is expected to fall to -17.4% in Q1 2025[4].\n\n2. **Concentration Risk**: Three companies\u2014Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta\u2014accounted for roughly 73% of the Magnificent Seven's total earnings growth in Q4 2024[4].\n\n3. **Market Volatility**: The group has already experienced significant volatility, with a 14.1% market cap decline occurring between July and August 2024[1].\n\n4. **Tesla's Vulnerability**: Tesla has already declined 30.4% year-to-date in 2025, putting it closer to the 50% threshold than other members of the group[1].\n\n## Probability Assessment\n\nBased on the available data, the probability of at least four Magnificent Seven stocks closing 50% below their all-time highs before January 2026 appears moderate but not certain. The current valuations suggest many of these stocks have already undergone significant corrections, with four now considered undervalued by analysts[5].\n\nThe most vulnerable candidates appear to be:\n1. Tesla (already down 30.4% YTD)\n2. Nvidia (down 17.2% YTD despite strong earnings)\n3. Apple (still considered overvalued despite a 15.4% YTD decline)\n4. Alphabet (down 14.9% YTD)\n\nHowever, the improved valuations and continued strong (albeit slowing) earnings growth provide some cushion against a full-scale collapse meeting the 50% threshold criteria for most of these companies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the Magnificent Seven stocks have experienced significant volatility and corrections in 2025, the available data suggests a full \"bubble pop\" meeting the specified criteria (four stocks 50% below all-time highs) before January 2026 is possible but not highly probable given current valuations and fundamentals. The most likely scenario appears to be continued volatility with selective deeper corrections rather than a synchronized collapse of the entire group.",
        "16":"# Forecasting Medicaid Spending Cuts in the 2025 Reconciliation Bill\n\nAs of April 10, 2025, Congress has passed a budget resolution that sets the stage for a reconciliation bill with potentially significant impacts on Medicaid spending. Based on available information, I'll analyze the potential decrease in Medicaid spending from FY 2025 to FY 2034 that might result from the reconciliation process currently underway.\n\n## Current Status of the Reconciliation Process\n\nOn April 10, 2025, Republicans in Congress passed a concurrent budget resolution, providing reconciliation instructions to congressional committees[4]. This resolution establishes different reconciliation tracks for each chamber:\n\n- House committees are instructed to increase deficits by $2.3 trillion, with major cuts to Medicaid\n- Senate committees are instructed to increase deficits by approximately $5.8 trillion, without clear implications for Medicaid cuts[4]\n\nThe House Energy & Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid, is targeting a markup of their portion of the bill, with the chamber hoping to clear the legislation in May 2025[1]. The Senate Finance Committee also has jurisdiction over Medicaid spending[2].\n\n## Projected Medicaid Cuts\n\nThe most significant indicator of potential Medicaid cuts comes from the reconciliation instructions to the House Energy & Commerce Committee, which call for $880 billion in savings over the ten-year budget window[1][2]. According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis, the Committee cannot reach this target without making cuts to Medicaid or Medicare[2].\n\nSeveral key factors suggest that Medicaid will bear the brunt of these cuts:\n\n1. **Limited Alternative Options**: When both Medicare and Medicaid are excluded, the Energy & Commerce Committee oversees only $581 billion in total spending\u2014far less than the $880 billion target for cuts[2].\n\n2. **Medicaid's Budget Share**: Medicaid accounts for $8.2 trillion of the $8.8 trillion total funding under the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction over 10 years, representing approximately 93% of their budget authority[2].\n\n3. **Required Magnitude**: To reach the $880 billion savings target, the changes to Medicaid would have to be significant[2].\n\n## Potential Approaches to Medicaid Cuts\n\nBased on the information available as of April 10, 2025, several policy options are being considered to achieve these Medicaid savings:\n\n1. **Reducing Federal Matching Rates for Expansion**: The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion allows states to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Currently, the federal government covers 90% of these costs, compared to approximately 70% for traditional Medicaid. Reducing this higher federal matching rate is one approach being considered[1].\n\n2. **Capping Payments to States**: Another approach under discussion involves capping payments to states based on the number of enrollees[1].\n\n3. **Establishing Spending Limits for Expansion Population**: This approach would set caps on federal spending for the Medicaid expansion population, potentially resulting in 3.3 million people losing coverage[5].\n\n## Contextualizing the $880 Billion Target\n\nTo put the $880 billion in potential federal Medicaid cuts in context:\n\n- This represents approximately $88 billion per year over the ten-year budget window\n- These cuts would represent 29% of state-financed Medicaid spending per resident[3]\n\n## Reconciliation Timeline and Process\n\nThe House hopes to clear the reconciliation legislation in May 2025, sending it to the Senate with a goal of final passage by July 4, 2025[1]. However, significant differences between the House and Senate approaches may complicate this timeline.\n\nThe budget resolution allows for total deficit increases of nearly $6 trillion, reflecting the assumption that Congress can use a \"current policy baseline,\" meaning they don't need to pay for extending expiring tax cuts (which cost $4.5 trillion)[4]. It requires House committees to offset the tax cuts by at least $1.7 trillion, but only $4 billion in spending cuts for Senate committees[4].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors create uncertainty in forecasting the exact amount of Medicaid cuts:\n\n1. **House-Senate Differences**: The significant differences between House and Senate reconciliation instructions may lead to protracted negotiations.\n\n2. **Committee Discretion**: While the $880 billion target is clear, the specific mechanisms for achieving these cuts remain under development.\n\n3. **Political Considerations**: The impact of Medicaid cuts on millions of Americans may influence the final legislation.\n\nBased on the available information as of April 10, 2025, the most likely forecast is that the reconciliation bill will aim to decrease total Medicaid spending by approximately $880 billion from FY 2025 to FY 2034, though the final amount could be modified during negotiations between the House and Senate.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "18":"# Forecasting OpenAI's GPT-5 Announcement in 2025\n\nBased on information available as of February 27, 2025, there are several key indicators suggesting OpenAI is likely to announce GPT-5 in 2025.\n\n## Historical Context and Current Status\n\nOpenAI has established a pattern of releasing increasingly capable AI models, with GPT-4 announced on March 14, 2023, and GPT-4o released on May 13, 2024. This progression suggests the company maintains approximately a 12-15 month development cycle between major model releases.\n\nAs of February 2025, OpenAI has already released information about their roadmap that explicitly mentions GPT-5, indicating that the model is actively in development and part of their near-term release strategy.[1]\n\n## Recent Announcements\n\nOn February 12, 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made significant announcements regarding the company's roadmap:\n\n- OpenAI plans to release GPT-4.5 (codenamed \"Orion\") \"within weeks\"[3]\n- GPT-5 is scheduled to be released \"within months\"[3]\n- GPT-5 will integrate multiple technologies, including o3[1]\n- The company is unifying its o-series models and GPT-series models[3]\n- GPT-4.5 will be the last \"non-chain-of-thought model\" before GPT-5[3]\n\nAltman also outlined the planned access tiers for GPT-5:\n- Free tier users will get unlimited chat access at standard intelligence\n- Plus subscribers will access higher intelligence settings\n- Pro subscribers will have access to the highest intelligence settings[3]\n\n## Authoritative Sources\n\nThe primary authoritative source for this information is OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself, who made these announcements through official channels. The roadmap update was shared on February 12, 2025, providing clear intentions regarding GPT-5's development timeline.[3]\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nDespite these announcements, several uncertainties remain:\n\n1. No specific release date has been provided beyond \"within months\"\n2. Technical challenges could potentially delay the release\n3. OpenAI has previously adjusted roadmaps and timelines\n4. The exact capabilities and improvements in GPT-5 remain unspecified\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the available information as of February 27, 2025, it appears highly likely that OpenAI will announce GPT-5 in 2025. Sam Altman's statement that GPT-5 would be released \"within months\" of February 12, 2025, strongly suggests an announcement sometime in mid-to-late 2025, barring any significant delays or changes in strategy.\n\nThe company has clearly positioned GPT-5 as their next major model release after GPT-4.5, with specific plans for its deployment across different subscription tiers, indicating advanced preparation for its launch.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "20":"### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed in August 2022, expanded the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for renewable energy and introduced a domestic content bonus credit. This bonus increases the PTC by 10% if a project meets specific domestic content requirements for steel, iron, and manufactured products[1][2][3].\n- As of early 2025, the domestic content requirement is not mandatory for claiming the base PTC under Section 45Y. Instead, it remains an optional bonus: projects that meet the requirement receive a higher credit, but those that do not are still eligible for the standard PTC[1][2][3].\n- The IRS has issued multiple notices (most recently Notice 2025-08) providing guidance and safe harbors for calculating and substantiating the domestic content bonus, but these do not make the requirement mandatory for the base credit[3][5].\n\n### Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The IRS and Treasury have continued to update guidance on how to qualify for the domestic content bonus, including updated safe harbor tables and compliance requirements[3][5].\n- There is no indication in recent IRS or Treasury communications that the domestic content requirement will become mandatory for the PTC. All guidance continues to treat it as a bonus provision[3][5].\n- Politically, after the 2024 elections, Republicans control Congress and the White House. While there is discussion about modifying or phasing out clean energy incentives, there is no evidence of enacted legislation making domestic content mandatory for 45Y PTCs as of April 2025[1].\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- IRS official guidance on the domestic content bonus credit[2][3].\n- Congressional Research Service reports on the status of domestic content requirements for electricity tax credits[1].\n- Industry and legal analyses summarizing recent IRS and Treasury updates[3][5].\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The political environment is dynamic, and budget reconciliation bills could change tax credit structures. However, as of April 2025, no bill has been enacted making domestic content a mandatory requirement for the PTC.\n- IRS and Treasury guidance is subject to change, but all current updates focus on the bonus structure, not a mandatory requirement.\n- The slim Republican majority in the House and internal party divisions may limit the likelihood of sweeping changes to the IRA's credit structure in the near term.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs of April 2025, there is no factual basis to forecast that domestic content requirements will become mandatory for obtaining the IRA's Production Tax Credits (45Y) before January 1, 2026. The requirement remains an optional bonus, and no enacted federal legislation or regulatory guidance has made it mandatory for the base PTC.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n1.

There is limited evidence, at present, of widespread, sustained transmission in regions outside of Africa\u2014contrasting with the rapid global proliferation in 2022\u20132023[2][5].\n- If the outbreak spreads beyond Central Africa and international case numbers climb rapidly, the total could surpass the 2022\u20132023 confirmed case count. However, as of mid-September, the trajectory remains well below the 66,387 threshold[2][5].\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- Given the current trajectory, with approximately 29,000 confirmed or suspected cases globally less than two months into the PHEIC period, and considering substantial under-reporting, it is plausible that the 2024 outbreak could approach or exceed the 2022\u20132023 total if international transmission accelerates.\n- However, as of September 2024, the majority of cases remain concentrated in Central Africa, and there is not yet clear evidence of the kind of global amplification seen in 2022\u20132023.\n- Unless there is a significant increase in transmission outside Africa or a surge in confirmed case reporting from affected regions, the probability that the 2024 PHEIC period will exceed 66,387 confirmed cases by the close date remains moderate but not high.\n\n**Summary Table: Outbreak Comparison**\n\n| Outbreak Period         | Variant     | Confirmed Cases (to date) | Primary Affected Regions     | Case Fatality Rate |\n|------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 2022\u20132023 PHEIC        | Clade II    | 66,387                    | Global (esp. Europe, Americas)| <1%                |\n| 2024 PHEIC (as of Sep) | Clade I (1b)| ~29,000 (suspected\/confirmed)| Central Africa, limited export | ~3%                |\n\n**Conclusion:** As of mid-September 2024, the global confirmed case count for the 2024 mpox outbreak is substantially below the 2022\u20132023 total. The outbreak could surpass the previous total if international spread intensifies or reporting improves, but current trends suggest the probability of exceeding 66,387 confirmed cases remains moderate, with the primary driver being the potential for expanded transmission outside Central Africa[2][5].\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "23":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to incentivize domestic production of clean energy components, such as solar inverters, wind turbine blades, and battery materials[3][4][5].\n- The credit has been a major catalyst for investment: over $140 billion in new clean energy manufacturing investments were announced in the year following the IRA\u2019s enactment, double the amount in the two years prior.\n- The credit is currently scheduled to begin phasing out in 2030, with a gradual reduction until it is fully phased out in 2033[1].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Political Developments\n\n- In November 2024, Republicans won the presidency and majorities in both the House and Senate, with a stated agenda to roll back clean energy tax credits and prioritize fossil fuel production.\n- Despite this, there is significant Republican opposition to a full or immediate repeal of 45X. At least 21 House Republicans have warned leadership they would oppose eliminating clean energy incentives, noting that many GOP districts have benefited from these credits and that abrupt repeal would harm ongoing projects and domestic manufacturing[3][4].\n- Some Republicans have expressed a preference for an earlier phase-out rather than immediate repeal, to protect investments already made and maintain support for domestic manufacturing.\n- The budget reconciliation process is being used to attempt changes, but the slim House majority and intra-party divisions make a rapid or total repeal uncertain.\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The IRS and Department of Energy provide official guidance on the 45X credit\u2019s eligibility and phase-out schedule[2][5].\n- Industry and policy analysis confirm the scale of investment and the political dynamics at play[3][4].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The outcome depends on ongoing legislative negotiations, which are subject to change based on political pressure, lobbying, and shifting alliances within the Republican caucus.\n- No specific legislation has yet been enacted to change the 45X phase-out schedule, and public statements suggest a lack of consensus on the exact approach.\n- Measurement of the outcome is straightforward: it will be determined by the next enacted legislation affecting the phase-out date before January 1, 2026.\n\n## Forecast\n\nGiven the current facts:\n- There is strong Republican intent to reduce or repeal clean energy tax credits, but also significant intra-party resistance to a full or immediate repeal of 45X.\n- The most likely near-term outcomes are either a negotiated earlier phase-out (such as a 2025-2026 or 2027 sunset) or legislative gridlock resulting in no change before 2026.\n- The probability of a full and immediate repeal is reduced by the public opposition from a notable bloc of House Republicans and the direct benefits to their districts.\n\n**In summary:** The most likely next development is either a negotiated earlier phase-out (potentially a 2025-2026 or 2027 sunset) or no legislative change before 2026. The situation remains fluid and subject to ongoing negotiations.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- [1].

        "24":"# The 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit: Current Status and Future Outlook\n\nThe Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (Section 45Y) is a newly established, technology-neutral production tax credit that replaces the Energy Production Tax Credit[3]. As of May 2025, this credit is in its early implementation phase, having been recently formalized through final regulations published on January 15, 2025[1].\n\n## Current Status of the 45Y Credit\n\nThe 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit provides financial incentives for clean electricity generation with the following key features:\n\n- **Credit Value**: The base credit amount is 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour of clean electricity, which increases to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met[5].\n\n- **Eligibility**: The credit applies to qualified facilities that:\n  - Are owned by the taxpayer\n  - Generate electricity\n  - Are placed in service after 2024\n  - Have a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rate not greater than zero[5]\n\n- **Bonus Credits**: The base credit can be increased by:\n  - 10% for projects meeting certain domestic content requirements for steel, iron, and manufactured products\n  - 10% for projects located in energy communities[2]\n\n- **Direct Pay and Transferability**: The credit offers direct pay options for tax-exempt organizations, states, political subdivisions, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Indian Tribal governments, Alaska Native Corporations, and rural electricity co-ops. It also includes transferability provisions[2].\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n\nThe 45Y credit is designed to support clean electricity production facilities placed in service after 2024[5]. This represents a transition from previous renewable energy tax credits to a technology-neutral approach that focuses on zero-emission electricity generation regardless of the specific technology used.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury has released final rules for these technology-neutral clean electricity credits, along with a list of qualifying technologies[2]. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also published guidance on the credit[3].\n\n## Limitations in Current Information\n\nBased on the available search results, there is limited information about specific legislative efforts to repeal or modify the 45Y credit as of May 2025. The search results do not provide details about:\n\n1. Current congressional actions targeting the 45Y credit\n2. Specific proposals to modify the sunset provisions\n3. Political positions on maintaining or altering the credit\n4. Economic impact assessments of potential changes to the credit\n\n## Verification Sources\n\nThe implementation of the 45Y credit can be verified through:\n\n1. The Federal Register publication of final regulations dated January 15, 2025[1]\n2. The IRS guidance on the Clean Electricity Production Credit[3]\n3. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's final rules for technology-neutral clean electricity credits[2]\n\n## Measurement and Implementation Challenges\n\nWhile the credit structure is clearly defined, several implementation challenges exist:\n\n- Determining and verifying the GHG emissions rate of facilities\n- Ensuring compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements\n- Coordinating with other tax credits to prevent double-dipping (the credit cannot be claimed alongside the \u00a748E ITC for the same facility)[5]\n\nThe search results do not provide sufficient information to forecast specific political actions regarding the potential repeal or modification of the sunset provisions of the 45Y credit before January 1, 2026.\n\nReferences:\n1.

        "25":"# Will an Attempt Be Made to Fire Jerome Powell Before the End of His Term?\n\nAs of May 2025, the question of whether President Trump will attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026 remains uncertain, but several key developments provide insight into this possibility.\n\n## Current Status of Jerome Powell\n\nJerome Powell is currently serving his second term as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, having been confirmed on May 12, 2022[2]. His current term runs through May 2026[1]. Powell was originally nominated by President Trump during his first administration in November 2017 and confirmed by the Senate in January 2018, assuming office on February 5, 2018[3].\n\n## Recent Tensions Between Trump and Powell\n\nThe relationship between President Trump and Chair Powell has deteriorated significantly in recent months:\n\n- On April 17, 2025, Trump publicly called for Powell's \"termination\" in a social media post, referring to him as \"Too Late Jerome Powell\" and stating that \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"[1]\n- Trump criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates, despite falling oil prices and what Trump claimed were decreasing grocery prices (though official data from the Labor Department showed grocery prices actually rose in the previous month, with egg prices jumping nearly 6% between February and March)[1]\n\n## Legal Framework for Removing a Fed Chair\n\nThe Federal Reserve is designed to operate independently from political pressure, allowing it to make unpopular but necessary decisions to fight inflation[1]. According to established precedent:\n\n- Powell has insisted that the president does not have the authority to fire him except for \"cause,\" meaning some form of misconduct[1]\n- Current Supreme Court precedent supports this view of the Fed Chair's independence[1]\n\n## Trump Administration's Approach to Independent Agencies\n\nDespite the legal protections, there are signs the Trump administration may be willing to test these boundaries:\n\n- The White House has signaled a willingness to challenge the standard protecting independent agency officials by firing board members of other independent agencies[1]\n- Trump has nominated Fed governor Michelle Bowman for the vice chair post on March 17, 2025, following Michael Barr's resignation as vice chair effective February 28, 2025 (though Barr remains a Fed governor)[2]\n\n## Powell's Response\n\nPowell has attempted to navigate this difficult situation by:\n\n- Trying to avoid antagonizing the president, often ducking questions about Trump's commentary[1]\n- Remaining adamant that he intends to serve out the remainder of his term through May 2026[1]\n- Noting that lawmakers from both parties have generally defended the Fed's ability to set interest rate policy without interference[1]\n- Acknowledging the criticism with a touch of humor, stating, \"We are blessed with a large number of amply-compensated critics\"[1]\n\n## Analysis of Potential Outcomes\n\nThe situation presents several possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Attempted Firing**: Trump could formally attempt to remove Powell despite legal barriers, triggering a constitutional showdown over the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\n2. **Pressure Campaign**: The administration might continue a public pressure campaign hoping to influence Fed policy or force Powell's resignation without formally attempting to fire him.\n\n3. **Legal Reinterpretation**: The administration could seek to reinterpret what constitutes \"cause\" for removal, potentially expanding its definition beyond the traditional understanding of misconduct.\n\n4. **De-escalation**: As evidenced by some back-and-forth in Trump's public statements, the tension could potentially de-escalate if economic conditions change or political priorities shift.\n\nThe most recent FOMC press conference occurred on May 7, 2025[4], but the search results don't provide details about whether the tensions were addressed during this meeting.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "26":"# Forecasting Anthropic's Claude 4 Announcement in 2025\n\nAs of May 2025, there is growing speculation about Anthropic's next major AI model release. Here's what we know about the potential for a Claude 4 announcement this year.\n\n## Current Status of Claude Models\n\nAnthropic's Claude model series has established itself as a significant player in the AI landscape. The company has been following a pattern of iterative improvements, with Claude 3 representing a major leap in capabilities, followed by incremental enhancements in subsequent versions[5]. The most recent version mentioned in the query is Claude 3.7, which continues the company's trajectory of improving its AI systems.\n\n## Potential Claude 4 Timeline\n\nAccording to available information, there is no confirmed release date for Claude 4 yet[5]. However, industry speculation suggests a possible release timeframe:\n\n- Some in the AI community are discussing whether Claude 4 might appear in Q1 2025[5]\n- Others anticipate a later 2025 debut, with Q2 2025 considered a plausible introduction window based on typical development cycles[5]\n\n## Factors Influencing Development\n\nSeveral factors may impact Anthropic's timeline for announcing Claude 4:\n\n1. **Competitive Landscape**: Jack Clark, Anthropic's co-founder, has indicated that AI progress in 2025 will be \"even more dramatic\" than previous years, suggesting an acceleration rather than deceleration in development[4]. This competitive environment may incentivize Anthropic to accelerate their development timeline.\n\n2. **Technical Approach**: The industry is seeing a shift in how AI models are being developed. Rather than just scaling up model size, companies are exploring new approaches that combine traditional methods with novel computing techniques during both training and inference[4]. This evolution in methodology could influence Anthropic's development timeline.\n\n3. **Ongoing Initiatives**: Anthropic remains active in the AI space, as evidenced by their participation in Google Cloud Next 2025[1] and the recent launch of their AI for Science program on May 5, 2025[2]. These initiatives demonstrate the company's continued commitment to advancing AI technology.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nThe available information has several limitations:\n\n1. **No Official Announcement**: Anthropic has not made any official statements specifically about Claude 4's development timeline or release date[5].\n\n2. **Evolving Industry**: The AI landscape is rapidly changing, with new technical approaches emerging that could either accelerate or delay development timelines[4].\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations**: Anthropic's release strategy may be influenced by competitive dynamics, internal development milestones, and strategic business considerations that are not publicly disclosed.\n\nBased on the available information, while there is speculation about a Claude 4 release in 2025 (with Q2 being considered plausible), there is no definitive confirmation from Anthropic about whether or when such an announcement will occur this year.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "27":"As a forecasting analyst examining whether the US will pass a federal bill on AI regulation before January 1, 2026, I'll analyze the current landscape and relevant factors affecting this prediction.\n\n## Current Regulatory Status\n\nAs of May 2025, the United States still has not passed comprehensive federal artificial intelligence laws and regulations[5]. Instead, AI governance in the US continues to function under a patchwork system comprising:\n\n- Executive orders\n- State-level legislation\n- Sector-specific regulatory oversight\n- Industry self-regulation\n\nThis fragmented approach has persisted despite increasing AI development and adoption across sectors. The current administration has taken a distinctly different approach to AI regulation compared to its predecessor.\n\n## Recent Executive Actions\n\nIn January 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled \"Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,\" which explicitly revoked previous AI policies established by the Biden administration[2]. This executive order represents a significant shift in federal approach, emphasizing:\n\n- Removal of \"barriers to American AI innovation\"\n- Elimination of mandatory federal red-teaming requirements\n- Discontinuation of watermarking requirements for AI-generated content\n- No federal requirements for model cards, incident reports, or bias audits[5]\n\nThis deregulatory approach signals the current administration's preference for minimal federal intervention in AI development and deployment.\n\n## Legislative Activities in 2025\n\nDespite the executive branch's deregulatory stance, Congress has shown some appetite for AI-related legislation:\n\n1. **CREATE AI Act (H.R.2385)** - Introduced on March 26, 2025, this bill aims \"to establish the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource, and for other purposes\"[4]. However, this appears focused on research infrastructure rather than comprehensive regulation.\n\n2. **TAKE IT DOWN Act** - Passed in April 2025, this legislation specifically addresses nonconsensual AI-generated intimate imagery, representing a narrow domain-specific approach rather than comprehensive AI regulation[5].\n\n3. **State-Level Activity** - Throughout 2025, state legislatures have continued introducing various AI-related bills, potentially filling the void left by federal inaction[1].\n\n## Regulatory Agency Actions\n\nWhile comprehensive legislation is absent, federal agencies are incorporating AI considerations into their existing regulatory frameworks:\n\n- The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has prioritized AI in its 2025 examination priorities[3].\n- The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has released AI cybersecurity guidelines[3].\n\nThese agency-level actions suggest that sector-specific regulation may continue to develop independently of comprehensive federal legislation.\n\n## Analysis of Passage Likelihood\n\nBased on the available information, several factors weigh against the passage of a comprehensive federal AI regulation bill before January 1, 2026:\n\n1. **Executive Branch Opposition**: The current administration's explicit deregulatory approach creates a significant obstacle for any comprehensive regulatory legislation.\n\n2. **Limited Legislative Progress**: While some AI-related bills have been introduced, they appear focused on specific domains or research infrastructure rather than comprehensive regulation.\n\n3. **Time Constraints**: With less than 8 months remaining until the January 1, 2026 deadline, the legislative calendar offers limited opportunity for introducing, debating, and passing complex regulatory legislation, especially considering the typical pace of federal lawmaking.\n\n4. **Regulatory Fragmentation**: The continuing development of agency-specific and state-level approaches may reduce urgency for comprehensive federal action.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the current trajectory of federal AI policy, the executive branch's deregulatory stance, and the limited timeframe remaining, the probability of a comprehensive federal AI regulation bill passing before January 1, 2026 appears low (approximately 15-25%).\n\nThe most likely scenario is continued development of:\n- Domain-specific federal legislation (like the TAKE IT DOWN Act)\n- Agency-level regulatory guidance\n- State-level regulatory frameworks\n- Industry self-regulation standards\n\nFor this forecast to change significantly, we would need to see either:\n1. A dramatic shift in the administration's approach to AI regulation\n2. Strong bipartisan congressional momentum for comprehensive regulation\n3. A major AI-related crisis that creates urgent demand for federal intervention\n\nNone of these catalyst events appear imminent based on current information.",
        "28":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is serving his third non-consecutive term as president, having previously governed from 2003\u20132011 and returning in January 2023[1].\n- Lula has both publicly signaled intent to seek reelection in 2026 and acknowledged the possibility of supporting a successor instead, generating uncertainty within his party and among allies[5].\n- The Workers\u2019 Party (PT) currently lacks a clear, popular alternative. Names like Fernando Haddad, Camilo Santana, and Rui Costa are discussed, but none command Lula\u2019s broad coalition appeal or internal support[3][5].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Political Dynamics\n\n- Lula\u2019s ambiguous signals\u2014expressing both willingness to run and openness to backing a successor\u2014have unsettled PT leadership, who overwhelmingly favor his candidacy due to the lack of a strong successor[5].\n- Party leaders and coalition partners believe Lula\u2019s participation is decisive for electoral success, with pressure mounting on him to run again[3][5].\n- The Brazilian right is also weakened, with former president Jair Bolsonaro facing trial and unable to mount a strong challenge, reinforcing Lula\u2019s dominance on the left[3].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Brazilian electoral law requires official candidate registration by August 15, 2025, with the Superior Electoral Court (TSE)[1].\n- As of May 2025, Lula has not formally registered, and his public statements on candidacy remain equivocal[5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Lula\u2019s advanced age (he will be 80 in 2026) introduces personal and health-related uncertainty, a common consideration but not a disqualifying factor[3].\n- While there is internal and coalition pressure for Lula to run, he has not definitively confirmed his candidacy, and there is still time for a late decision or for the emergence of a new contender.\n- Public opinion is mixed: a recent poll found 58% of Brazilians do not want Lula to run again, while 40% are supportive[3].\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven current trends\u2014PT\u2019s lack of alternatives, Lula\u2019s centrality to the coalition, and weak right-wing opposition\u2014the probability that Lula will be the official PT candidate in 2026 is higher than not, but significant uncertainties remain due to his age, health, and his own equivocal statements. As of May 2025, a cautious estimate would place the likelihood of Lula registering as a candidate above 60%, but not a foregone conclusion.\n\n## References\n\n- [1]. 2026 Brazilian general election - Wikipedia (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2026_Brazilian_general_election)\n- [3].

        "29":"### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed in August 2022, established the \u00a748E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC), \u00a745Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC), and \u00a745X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC). These credits are designed to incentivize investment, production, and manufacturing in the clean energy sector.\n- A major innovation of the IRA was making these credits transferable, allowing companies to sell their tax credits to unrelated parties, thereby creating a robust secondary market and increasing the credits\u2019 value and accessibility[3][4].\n- As of early 2025, the IRS continues to administer these credits and their transferability provisions, with active guidance and portals for registration and transfer[3].\n\n### Recent Announcements and Policy Developments\n\n- In January 2025, a new administration took office, with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. Budget reconciliation negotiations have included discussions about cutting or modifying IRA clean energy tax credits, including the possibility of eliminating transferability[4].\n- Despite these discussions, there is no public record or authoritative reporting confirming that legislation eliminating the transferability of \u00a748E, \u00a745Y, or \u00a745X credits has been enacted as of April 10, 2025[3][4].\n- The tax credit structures for \u00a748E and \u00a745Y remain in effect for projects beginning construction in 2025 and beyond, with no mention of transferability being eliminated[3].\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- IRS official guidance and news releases continue to describe the credits and their transferability as active for tax year 2025[3].\n- Financial and tax advisory sources (e.g., Baker Tilly, Kiplinger) report on ongoing legislative negotiations but do not confirm any enacted changes to transferability as of the latest updates[3][4].\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- While there is clear political intent and ongoing negotiation to potentially cut or modify these credits, legislative action eliminating transferability has not occurred as of April 10, 2025.\n- The situation remains fluid, and significant changes could be enacted later in 2025, but such changes would only be relevant if enacted before January 1, 2026.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs of April 10, 2025, there is no evidence that legislation has been enacted eliminating the transferability of the \u00a748E ITC, \u00a745Y PTC, or \u00a745X AMPC tax credits. The credits and their transferability provisions remain in effect, though they are subject to ongoing legislative negotiations that could result in future changes[3][4].\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n- [3].

        "30":"# IBEX 35 Forecast for 2025\n\nThe IBEX 35, Spain's benchmark stock market index, has shown strong performance in recent years. To assess whether it will close 2025 higher than it started (above 11,595.00), we need to examine current data and forecasts.\n\n## Current Status and Recent Performance\n\nAs of February 2025, the IBEX 35 stands at 13,347.3 points, showing a slight increase from the previous month[5]. This current level already exceeds the 11,595.00 threshold specified in the resolution criteria. The index has demonstrated impressive growth in recent years, with a 23% increase in 2023 and a 14.78% rise in 2024, making it the second-best performing stock market index among major European markets.\n\n## Forecasts for 2025\n\nSeveral analytical services have provided forecasts for the IBEX 35 through 2025:\n\n- According to analytical forecasts, the IBEX price may reach \u20ac14,945.61 by the end of 2025[3].\n- More optimistic predictions suggest the index could reach as high as 30,000 points by the end of 2025[2].\n- Wallet Investor suggests a more conservative growth trajectory, with the index gradually moving up to 9,026 points by the end of 2025[2].\n- IBEX 35 Futures price is expected to reach up to $10,391.40, with analysts anticipating a long-term increase[4].\n\n## Analysis of Potential Outcomes\n\nThe majority of forecasts indicate that the IBEX 35 will maintain or increase its value throughout 2025. With the February 2025 value already at 13,347.3 points, the index would need to experience a significant decline of more than 13% to fall below the 11,595.00 threshold by year-end.\n\nWhile monthly fluctuations are normal for stock indices, the overall trend and forecasts suggest continued growth rather than decline. The IBEX 35 has shown resilience and strong performance in recent years, outperforming many other European indices.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nIt's important to note several limitations in these forecasts:\n\n1. Stock market predictions are inherently uncertain and subject to various economic factors, geopolitical events, and market sentiment.\n2. The forecasts from different sources vary significantly, from conservative estimates to highly optimistic projections.\n3. None of the sources provided specific information about potential economic challenges that might affect the Spanish market in late 2025.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the current value of 13,347.3 points as of February 2025 and the majority of forecasts predicting continued growth, it appears likely that the IBEX 35 will close 2025 above the 11,595.00 threshold. However, as with all market predictions, this outlook is subject to change based on evolving economic conditions and unforeseen events.\n\nReferences:\n1.

        "31":"# India-Pakistan Conflict: Assessing the Potential for Escalation\n\nBased on information available as of May 6, 2025, the conflict between India and Pakistan has shown concerning signs of escalation that could potentially result in significant casualties in the coming months.\n\n## Historical Context and Current Status\n\nThe India-Pakistan conflict over Kashmir has been ongoing since the partition of India in 1947, with both countries claiming sovereignty over each other's de facto territory in the region[2]. Tensions were reignited after India revoked the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, creating a foundation for renewed hostilities.\n\nThe current escalation began on April 22, 2025, with a militant attack near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir that resulted in 26 deaths. This attack triggered a series of hostile diplomatic measures between the two nuclear-armed neighbors[2]. Starting on the night of April 24-25, 2025, skirmishes and exchanges of gunfire commenced along the Line of Control (LoC)[2].\n\nBetween April 24 and May 6, 2025, the situation has deteriorated significantly, with both countries engaging in heavy skirmishes including cross-border firing and artillery shelling[2]. These actions represent a substantial escalation beyond typical border incidents.\n\n## Diplomatic and Military Developments\n\nThe diplomatic crisis between India and Pakistan has intensified, with India taking several severe measures:\n- Expulsion of Pakistani diplomats\n- Recall of its own diplomatic staff\n- Suspension of visa services\n- Closure of borders\n- Withdrawal from the Indus Waters Treaty[2]\n\nPakistan has responded with:\n- Trade restrictions\n- Closure of airspace and border crossings\n- Suspension of the Shimla Agreement[2]\n\nIndia's Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has urged Indian citizens to avoid traveling to Pakistan and called on those currently in Pakistan to return immediately, suggesting expectations of further escalation[2].\n\n## Assessment of Potential for Casualties\n\nSeveral factors indicate a high risk of the conflict resulting in 100 or more deaths by the end of June 2025:\n\n1. **Escalation Pattern**: The conflict has already progressed from a terrorist attack to diplomatic measures to active military engagement along the border within two weeks.\n\n2. **Historical Precedent**: Previous India-Pakistan conflicts have frequently resulted in significant casualties once military operations escalate beyond initial skirmishes.\n\n3. **Geographic Scope**: The conflict zone spans the entire 3,200-kilometer border between the two countries, creating multiple potential flashpoints.\n\n4. **Military Mobilization**: Both countries appear to be positioning forces along the border, increasing the likelihood of larger-scale engagements.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors complicate the assessment:\n\n1. **Information Reliability**: Both countries have engaged in misinformation campaigns following military actions, making casualty figures difficult to verify[2].\n\n2. **International Intervention**: The potential for international diplomatic intervention, particularly from major powers like the United States, could potentially de-escalate the conflict.\n\n3. **Nuclear Deterrence**: Both countries possess nuclear weapons, which historically has served as a deterrent to full-scale conventional war, though this doesn't preclude limited military operations.\n\n4. **Internal Political Factors**: Domestic political considerations in both countries could either accelerate or restrain military actions.\n\nBased on the trajectory of events through May 6, 2025, and the historical pattern of India-Pakistan conflicts, there is a significant risk that the ongoing military exchanges could result in 100 or more deaths by the end of June 2025 if the current escalation continues without effective diplomatic intervention.",
        "32":"# Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E): Current Status and Future Outlook\n\nThe Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E) represents a significant component of U.S. clean energy policy. As of May 2025, this tax credit is in its early implementation phase, having recently replaced the previous Energy Investment Tax Credit. To assess potential future developments regarding this tax credit, it's important to understand its current structure, implementation timeline, and recent regulatory developments.\n\n## Current Status of 48E\n\nThe Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E) is a newly established, technology-neutral investment tax credit that officially replaced the Energy Investment Tax Credit[1]. This credit is designed specifically for investments in facilities that generate clean electricity, with zero greenhouse gas emissions being a key requirement for eligibility[2].\n\nThe credit applies to facilities that begin construction and are placed in service after December 31, 2024[5]. This represents a transition from the previous Section 48 credit, which applied to facilities beginning construction before January 1, 2025[5].\n\n## Key Features and Benefits\n\nThe 48E tax credit includes several notable features:\n\n- **Base credit with potential increases**: The credit can be increased by up to 10 percentage points for facilities meeting certain domestic content requirements for steel, iron, and manufactured products[2].\n\n- **Bonus credit program**: A special program increases the 48E credit by an additional 10% or 20% for applicable energy facilities with maximum net output of less than 5 megawatts, particularly those located in low-income communities, on Indian land, or as part of qualified low-income residential building projects[3].\n\n- **Eligible technologies**: The credit applies to a range of clean electricity generation technologies, including fuel cell, solar, geothermal, small wind, energy storage, biogas, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power properties[5].\n\n- **Direct pay eligibility**: The credit offers direct pay options for tax-exempt organizations, states, political subdivisions, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Indian Tribal governments, Alaska Native Corporations, and rural electricity co-ops[2].\n\n- **Transferability**: The credit includes transferability provisions, allowing entities without sufficient tax liability to benefit[2].\n\n## Recent Regulatory Developments\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released final regulations regarding the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment credit[4]. These regulations provide detailed guidance on implementation and compliance requirements for the 48E credit.\n\nAdditionally, the Treasury Department has released a list of qualifying technologies for clean electricity credits, which helps clarify eligibility requirements for potential applicants[2].\n\n## Limitations in Forecasting Future Changes\n\nBased on the available information as of May 2025, there are significant limitations in forecasting specific legislative changes to the 48E tax credit:\n\n1. The search results do not contain information about specific legislative proposals to repeal or modify the 48E credit.\n\n2. There is no data available in the search results regarding political positions on the future of this tax credit.\n\n3. The search results do not include information about budget reconciliation processes or other legislative mechanisms that might be used to modify the credit.\n\n4. No information is provided about industry stakeholder positions or lobbying efforts related to the credit.\n\nGiven these limitations, a comprehensive forecast of what will happen next concerning potential repeal or modification of the 48E credit cannot be provided based solely on the available search results.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E) is currently in its implementation phase, with final regulations having been published in early 2025. The credit provides significant incentives for investment in clean electricity generation facilities. While the credit is designed with specific eligibility requirements and bonus structures, the available information does not provide insight into potential legislative changes that might affect its future. Any forecast regarding potential repeal or modification would require additional information about current political developments and legislative proposals.",
        "33":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- **Inditex is Spain\u2019s largest company by market capitalization** and a global leader in the fashion sector, owning brands such as Zara, Massimo Dutti, and Bershka[3].\n- As of May 2025, Inditex\u2019s market capitalization is reported at approximately EUR 147.5 billion (about $159.95\u2013$171.14 billion, depending on the source and exchange rates)[1][2][3][4].\n- Inditex is currently ranked just outside the top 10 EU companies by market capitalization, sitting at 11th place, closely behind Deutsche Telekom and Siemens, both of which have market caps slightly above Inditex\u2019s (Deutsche Telekom at around $179.68 billion)[2][3].\n- Inditex has demonstrated consistent growth, driven by its agile supply chain, global retail presence, and successful integration of online and offline sales channels[3].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- There are no major recent announcements or policy changes reported as of early 2025 that would significantly alter Inditex\u2019s market capitalization trajectory[2][3][4].\n- Inditex continues to benefit from strong consumer demand and operational efficiency, but no extraordinary events (such as mergers, acquisitions, or regulatory changes) have been reported that would immediately propel it into the top 10[2][3].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- CompaniesMarketCap and Trading Economics provide up-to-date rankings and market capitalization figures for EU companies, including Inditex and its competitors[1][2][3].\n- Statista and UniformMarket offer additional context on Inditex\u2019s global standing in the apparel sector and its financial performance[2][4].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- **Market capitalization rankings are dynamic** and can fluctuate due to stock price volatility, currency exchange rates, and macroeconomic factors.\n- Inditex\u2019s ability to enter the top 10 depends not only on its own performance but also on the relative performance of competitors like Deutsche Telekom and Siemens.\n- The apparel sector can be sensitive to shifts in consumer sentiment, supply chain disruptions, and global economic conditions, all of which could impact Inditex\u2019s market cap.\n- Currency fluctuations between the euro and the US dollar may affect the comparative rankings, especially when sources report figures in different currencies[1][2][4].\n\n## Summary\n\nAs of early 2025, Inditex is on the cusp of entering the top 10 EU companies by market capitalization, with a strong financial position and growth trajectory. However, unless there is a significant increase in its market cap or a decline among its immediate competitors, it remains just outside the top 10. The outcome by the end of 2025 will depend on both Inditex\u2019s continued performance and broader market dynamics.\n\n## References\n\n- [1].

        "34":"# Forecasting Analysis: New COVID-19 Variant Impact on US Hospitalizations\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant classified as a VOC or worse resulting in at least 20,000 daily incident COVID hospitalizations in the US before July 1, 2025 (approximately 7 weeks from now).\n\n## Current Situation Assessment\n\nThe current COVID-19 landscape shows relatively modest levels of transmission and severity:\n\n- The national test positivity rate stands at 3.2% for the week ending May 3, 2025, showing a slight decrease from 3.4% in the previous week[1]\n- The current hospitalization rate is 1.4 per 100,000 population[2]\n- COVID-19 accounts for only 0.6% of all deaths in the United States[2]\n\nThese metrics suggest that as of mid-May 2025, the US is not experiencing a significant COVID-19 surge. However, earlier in the 2024-2025 season (as of January 29, 2025), the hospitalization rate was notably higher at 38.0 per 100,000 people[5].\n\n## Variant Evolution and Impact\n\nThe available data references several variant eras (XBB, JN.1, and KP)[4], indicating the continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Current variants demonstrate \"higher infectivity\" which is particularly relevant for:\n\n1. Patients at elevated risk of severe COVID-19 (defined as disease resulting in hospitalization, ICU admission, intubation, mechanical ventilation, or death)[5]\n2. Individuals who may develop long COVID, which as of September 2024 had affected approximately 17.9% of all US adults[5]\n\n## Hospitalization Trends and Severity\n\nAmong hospitalized COVID-19 patients between October 2023 and April 2024:\n- 18.4% required ICU admission\n- 8.4% needed mechanical ventilation\n- 6.9% died while hospitalized[5]\n\nThese figures indicate that while the overall prevalence of severe disease may be lower than in earlier phases of the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality among those who require hospitalization.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available data, I assess the likelihood of a new VOC causing 20,000+ daily hospitalizations before July 1, 2025 as **low to moderate** for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Current trajectory**: The declining test positivity rate (from 3.4% to 3.2%) and relatively low hospitalization rate (1.4 per 100,000) suggest we are not currently on a path toward a major surge[1][2]\n\n2. **Timeframe constraint**: With only about 7 weeks remaining until July 1, 2025, there is limited time for:\n   - A new variant to emerge and be classified as a VOC\n   - This variant to spread widely enough across the US\n   - Hospitalizations to reach the 20,000 daily threshold\n\n3. **Seasonal factors**: Late spring\/early summer has typically seen lower COVID-19 transmission in previous years, though this pattern is not guaranteed\n\n4. **Uncertainty factors** that could increase probability:\n   - The search results mention \"higher infectivity\" of current variants[5]\n   - The hospitalization rate was significantly higher earlier in the 2024-2025 season (38.0 per 100,000)[5]\n   - Variant evolution is unpredictable and a highly transmissible and immune-evasive variant could emerge quickly\n\n## Key Limitations in Assessment\n\nSeveral important limitations affect this forecast:\n\n1. The search results do not provide absolute numbers of current daily hospitalizations, only rates per 100,000\n\n2. No information is available about any emerging variants currently under monitoring that might soon be classified as VOCs\n\n3. The search results lack specific forecasting models or projections from public health authorities regarding potential summer 2025 scenarios\n\n4. Limited information is available about current population immunity levels from vaccination and prior infection\n\n5. The search results don't mention current mitigation measures or public health policies that might affect transmission\n\nGiven the available data and the short timeframe remaining before July 1, 2025, the most likely outcome is that we will not see a new VOC driving 20,000+ daily hospitalizations in the US within the next 7 weeks. However, this assessment carries significant uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of viral evolution and the gaps in available forecasting data.",
        "35":"**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**\n\n- Norway has twice held referendums on EU membership (1972, 1994), both resulting in a majority vote against joining.\n- The country participates in the European Economic Area (EEA), aligning closely with the EU economically and regulatorily, but remains outside the Union and decision-making[1][2].\n- Public support for EU membership has risen recently, reaching about 41% in early 2025, but opposition remains ahead at 48%. Support for simply holding a new referendum is much higher, at 63%[1].\n\n**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**\n\n- In early 2025, Norway\u2019s government collapsed over the adoption of EU energy rules, reflecting deep political divisions over EU integration[1].\n- The Conservative Party, led by former Prime Minister Erna Solberg, has publicly endorsed EU membership and called for readiness to negotiate accession if an opportunity arises. However, their likely coalition partner, the Progress Party, remains firmly against membership[5].\n- While the public debate has intensified, the Norwegian political leadership has explicitly ruled out announcing a new EU referendum at this time[1].\n- As of May 2025, there has been no official government announcement or movement toward a referendum, and such a step would require broad parliamentary and cross-party support, which is currently lacking[1][5].\n\n**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**\n\n- Government announcements would be made via www.regjeringen.no or official parliamentary channels.\n- Major analytical coverage is available from Chatham House, Brussels Signal, and direct statements from party leaders[1][5].\n\n**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**\n\n- Political developments can be unpredictable, especially if external shocks occur (trade disputes, security crises).\n- Public opinion is fluid, but as of early 2025, \u201cNo\u201d still leads, and major parties are divided.\n- The precedent set by Iceland\u2019s promise for a referendum by 2027 could influence debate, but there is no sign of immediate Norwegian emulation[1].\n\n**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**\n\nGiven current polling, party positions, and lack of movement at the government level, the chance that Norway will announce an official EU referendum before the September 2025 parliamentary election is low\u2014likely less than 15%. This is higher than in previous years due to increased public support and debate, but significant institutional and political barriers remain.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1]. To join or not to join?

        "36":"Based on the available information as of February 2025, C\u0103lin Georgescu will not be elected President of Romania in the 2025 elections because he has been banned from running as a candidate.\n\n## Historical Context and Current Status\n\nIn November 2024, pro-Russian nationalist candidate C\u0103lin Georgescu caused a major surprise by winning the first round of Romania's presidential election with approximately 2 million votes[1]. Despite his initial success, Georgescu never proceeded to the second-round run-off because:\n\n- Romanian authorities annulled the election results amid accusations of Russian interference in the campaign[1]\n- Intelligence reports indicated that foreign actors had manipulated social media platforms, especially TikTok, to benefit Georgescu[1]\n- The campaign was likely orchestrated by Russia, though Moscow denied any involvement[1]\n\nFollowing the annulment, Romanian authorities banned Georgescu from participating in the new elections scheduled for May 4, 2025[1]. This disqualification was confirmed when authorities cleared a dozen candidates for the May election while rejecting a dozen others, including Georgescu[3].\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nThe political landscape in Romania remains complex following these events:\n\n1. **New elections scheduled**: Romania is holding a presidential election rerun on May 4, 2025, with new rules implemented to prevent foreign interference[1][4].\n\n2. **Far-right momentum continues**: Despite Georgescu's disqualification, far-right politics maintain significant support in Romania. George Simion, another far-right candidate, has emerged as a prominent figure in the May 2025 election[2].\n\n3. **Potential alternative path to power**: While Georgescu cannot be elected president, his influence remains. Simion has publicly maintained support for Georgescu and suggested he might consider appointing Georgescu as prime minister should Simion become president[2]. However, this would require parliamentary approval, which is uncertain given the current political dynamics.\n\n4. **International attention**: The situation has drawn significant international attention, with US Vice President JD Vance criticizing Romania's decision to cancel the previous election results during a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025[1].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors create uncertainty in this situation:\n\n1. **Political instability**: The current governing coalition appears to be fracturing following the May 4 vote, which could impact future political appointments and decisions[2].\n\n2. **Democratic concerns**: The unprecedented annulment of election results has raised questions about Romania's democratic processes and the influence of intelligence agencies in political matters[1].\n\n3. **Ongoing Russian influence concerns**: Given the previous allegations of Russian interference, continued attempts to influence Romanian politics remain a possibility.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the available information, C\u0103lin Georgescu will not be elected President of Romania in the 2025 elections as he has been explicitly banned from running as a candidate. While he maintains support among certain political factions, and there exists a theoretical path to political power through appointment as prime minister, this would not satisfy the resolution criteria of being \"officially declared president-elect.\"",
        "37":"### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The 45Q carbon oxide sequestration tax credit was first established in 2008 and has been expanded several times, most recently by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which increased credit values and extended the eligibility window for new projects to January 1, 2033[4][5].\n- The credit supports a wide range of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects, with at least 226 projects currently qualifying[5].\n- The value of the credit varies by project type, with the highest rates for direct air capture and geologic sequestration[5].\n\n### Recent Announcements and Policy Developments\n\n- In March 2025, Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) introduced H.R. 1946, the 45Q Repeal Act, which would fully repeal the 45Q tax credit effective January 1, 2026, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects[1][2][5].\n- The bill has bipartisan sponsorship, with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) as a co-sponsor, and is currently in the House Committee on Ways and Means[5].\n- The Republican-controlled Congress is considering using budget reconciliation to pass tax and spending changes, which could include the repeal of 45Q and other clean energy tax credits[4].\n- There is some Republican support for retaining certain clean energy tax breaks, but the 45Q credit is facing strong bipartisan opposition, making it a likely target for repeal[4].\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The full text of H.R. 1946 is available on Congress.gov[1].\n- Multiple news outlets and advocacy organizations have reported on the introduction and implications of the 45Q Repeal Act[2][3][4][5].\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The final outcome depends on the legislative process, including potential amendments, negotiations within the Republican caucus, and the reconciliation process.\n- There is some uncertainty about whether a safe harbor provision could be added during negotiations, but the current bill text does not include one[1][5].\n- Stakeholder lobbying and public pressure could influence the final legislative language.\n\n### Forecasted Outcome\n\nGiven the current legislative text of H.R. 1946, the political alignment in Congress, and the absence of a safe harbor provision, the most likely next outcome is:\n\n**2025-2026 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Q is moved to 2025 or 2026 or 45Q is fully repealed, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n1.

        "38":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- In the past four years, franchise films have topped the global box office three times, demonstrating a strong trend toward established series outperforming standalone films[5].\n- As of May 2025, the highest-grossing film worldwide is Ne Zha 2, with a gross of over $1.8 billion[1][2][5]. Ne Zha 2 is a direct sequel to the 2019 animated film Ne Zha, making it part of a franchise.\n- Other leading films in 2025, such as A Minecraft Movie and Captain America: Brave New World, are also franchise entries[1][2][3].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- No major industry announcements or policy changes have been reported that would alter the dominance of franchise films at the box office in 2025.\n- The release calendar for the remainder of 2025 includes several high-profile franchise films, but none have been announced that are likely to surpass Ne Zha 2\u2019s current gross[2].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Box Office Mojo and The Numbers provide real-time, authoritative box office data for 2025[1][3].\n- Wikipedia\u2019s 2025 in film page aggregates box office rankings and franchise status[2].\n- Industry analyses, such as those from The Indian Express, confirm the ongoing dominance of franchise films globally[5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- There is always a possibility that a late-year release could outperform current leaders, but the significant revenue lead of Ne Zha 2 makes this unlikely.\n- Box office data may be updated as films continue their theatrical runs, but the trend strongly favors franchise films.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on current data and historical trends, the highest-grossing film of 2025 is almost certain to be part of a franchise, with Ne Zha 2 currently holding a commanding lead.

This sets a high base for 2025 performance comparisons.\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- Most major banks and Wall Street analysts forecast the S&P 500 will end 2025 higher, with targets generally around 6,500, which would represent an 8\u201310% gain from the 2024 close[1][3][5].\n- Goldman Sachs projects a 9% price gain for 2025, citing expectations of 11% EPS growth, 2.5% real GDP growth, and inflation cooling to 2.4%[3][5].\n- Anticipated drivers include strong economic fundamentals, robust consumer spending, and advancements in artificial intelligence[4].\n- Risks cited include elevated valuations (P\/E ratios well above historical averages), potential for broad tariffs or policy changes post-2024 election, and sensitivity to higher bond yields[3].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Yahoo!

This includes no election being held before January 1, 2026, or the results of all 2025 elections being annulled.\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party, gained substantial momentum through 2024 and early 2025 by appealing to voters dissatisfied with the Trudeau administration, focusing on issues like housing, inflation, and economic recovery[1][3].\n- In January 2025, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned amid declining popularity, and Mark Carney became the new Liberal leader, reshaping the political landscape and intensifying the election's competitiveness[2][4].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The 2025 federal election was scheduled for no later than October 20, 2025, but was held earlier in the spring.\n- During the campaign, Poilievre emphasized lower taxes, reduced government spending, and a \"Canada First\" approach, drawing comparisons to U.S. populist politics[2].\n- The Liberals, under Carney, focused on economic stability and distancing themselves from Trudeau's legacy, especially as U.S. trade tensions escalated[4].\n\n## Authoritative Sources and Election Results\n\n- In the final days before the election, major polls showed the Liberals overtaking the Conservatives, with a notable lead in Ontario and Quebec\u2014crucial provinces for forming a government[4].\n- After the election, credible reports confirm that Pierre Poilievre lost his own parliamentary seat, and the Conservatives failed to win the most seats in Parliament[2].\n- The Liberals, led by Mark Carney, are projected to form the next government, either as a majority or with support from smaller parties[2][4].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- While polling data can fluctuate and seat counts may be subject to final confirmation, multiple independent sources report that Poilievre and the Conservatives were defeated.\n- There is no indication of annulled results or postponed elections that would alter this outcome.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the latest available information, Pierre Poilievre will **not** be elected Prime Minister of Canada in 2025. The Liberals, under Mark Carney, are set to form the next government following the election.\n\n## References\n\n- [1].

The nation is deeply polarized, with ongoing debates over rule of law issues and tensions between urban and rural populations. The outcome of next May\u2019s vote could unblock Prime Minister Tusk\u2019s reform agenda, which has been stymied by outgoing right-wing President Andrzej Duda since the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party was ousted from power last December.\n\nRafa\u0142 Trzaskowski is the presidential candidate of the ruling Civic Coalition, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Trzaskowski is [<u>known for his progressive stance<\/u>](https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/db73120d-1291-4252-9500-adf32e3b7f7a), emphasizing European integration, social policies and judicial independence. Trzaskowski's main opponent is Karol Nawrocki, a historian, who has been nominated by the PiS party. Nawrocki's platform aligns with the party's patriotic and pro-Christian values. The election is expected to be highly competitive.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThe question will be resolved as **Yes** if, following the 2025 presidential election in Poland, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski is officially declared president-elect. If this does not happen, this question will be resolved as **No**. This includes no elections being held before 1 January 2026 or the results of all 2025 elections being annulled.\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Will Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski be Elected President of Poland in 2025?\n\nThe upcoming Polish presidential election on May 18, 2025, represents a critical juncture in Polish politics. With incumbent President Andrzej Duda ineligible to run for a third term, this election could potentially end the Law and Justice (PiS) party's last hold on power in Poland's government[4]. Here's an analysis of the current situation and factors that may influence whether Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski will win the presidency.\n\n## Current Polling Status\n\nAs of late April 2025, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, representing the Civic Coalition, leads in the polls:\n\n- The latest IBRiS poll (conducted April 25-26, 2025) shows Trzaskowski with 33.2% support[5]\n- His main challenger, Karol Nawrocki (backed by PiS), stands at 25.6%[5]\n- Other candidates trail significantly: S\u0142awomir Mentzen (Confederation) at 11.5%, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia (Third Way) at 6.1%, and Magdalena Biejat (New Left) at 5.1%[5]\n\nThis polling suggests that no candidate is likely to secure the required 50% of votes in the first round, necessitating a second-round runoff on June 1, 2025, between the top two candidates (likely Trzaskowski and Nawrocki)[4][5].\n\n## Recent Trends and Developments\n\nWhile Trzaskowski maintains his frontrunner status, there are signs of a shifting race:\n\n- Over the last month, Nawrocki has \"dramatically reduced the gap in polls\" to Trzaskowski[1]\n- Trzaskowski's support has shown some stability since the official campaign launch in January 2025, with a slight increase from 30.8% in mid-April to 33.2% in late April[3][5]\n\n## Political Context\n\nThe election takes place amid significant political transitions in Poland:\n\n- The Civic Coalition, led by Donald Tusk's Civic Platform (PO), defeated PiS in the October 2023 parliamentary elections[2]\n- The Civic Coalition also won the European elections in June 2024 with 37.06% of the vote[2]\n- Poland is currently experiencing a difficult period of cohabitation between President Duda (PiS) and Prime Minister Tusk (Civic Coalition)[2]\n- Tusk has repeatedly stated that Duda's presidency has prevented implementation of promised reforms[2]\n\nThis context is crucial because the presidential election could determine whether Tusk's government can fully implement its agenda. In Poland, the president has veto power over legislation, and the current parliamentary majority lacks the three-fifths majority needed to override presidential vetoes[2].\n\n## Factors That May Influence the Outcome\n\nSeveral factors could impact Trzaskowski's chances of victory:\n\n1. **Second-round dynamics**: If the election goes to a second round as expected, the distribution of votes from eliminated candidates will be crucial. How supporters of candidates like Mentzen, Ho\u0142ownia, and Biejat vote in a Trzaskowski-Nawrocki runoff could determine the winner.\n\n2. **Urban-rural divide**: Poland has experienced significant political polarization between urban and rural areas, which could affect regional voting patterns.\n\n3. **Campaign developments**: With the election still about a week away, campaign events, debates, and potential controversies could shift voter sentiment.\n\n4. **Voter turnout**: Differential turnout among various demographic groups could significantly impact the final results.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting this forecast:\n\n1. **Polling accuracy**: Polls represent a snapshot in time and may not accurately predict final voting behavior, especially in a polarized political environment.\n\n2. **Narrowing race**: The fact that Nawrocki has been closing the gap suggests the race may be more competitive than earlier polls indicated[1].\n\n3. **Undecided voters**: The polls don't clearly indicate the percentage of undecided voters, who could swing the election in either direction.\n\n4. **Second-round uncertainties**: Predicting second-round voting behavior is particularly challenging, as it depends on complex voter preference transfers.\n\nWhile Trzaskowski currently leads in the polls, the race appears to be tightening, and the outcome will likely depend on second-round dynamics if neither candidate secures an outright majority on May 18.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "2":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWhen in 2025 will President Donald Trump sign into a law a reconciliation bill?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Republicans achieved a \"legislative trifecta\" in the 2024 elections - control of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives - although lacking the 60-vote Senate supermajority, having won 53 out of 100 seats.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the election, senior Republicans began [planning](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/live-updates\/2024\/11\/25\/congress\/gop-leaders-meet-to-talk-reconciliation-00191590) how to turn Donald Trump's extensive legislative agenda into reality. One option would include the use of budget [reconciliation](https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/topics\/budget\/reconciliation#:~:text=Budget%20reconciliation%20is%20an%20expedited,in%20a%20Congressional%20budget%20resolution.), a process that allows certain federal budget bills to pass in the Senate with only a simple majority, bypassing the 60-vote threshold typically required to overcome a [filibuster](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate). Reconciliation also limits debate time, preventing the use of the filibuster altogether.\n\nA key priority expected to be included in a reconciliation bill is the renewal of [Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act) - a central pillar of his campaign, with most of them set to expire at the end of 2025. This is controversial, as it could violate the [Byrd Rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reconciliation_\\(United_States_Congress\\)#Byrd_Rule) if it increases the federal deficit beyond the allowable budget window without offsetting revenue or spending adjustments. Additionally, Trump and the GOP have suggested using reconciliation to pass policies related to border security and energy permitting, though the impact of these measures on federal spending is less clear.\n\nSome senior Republicans argue that border security constitutes a national emergency. In contrast to House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s [\"one, big beautiful bill\"](https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/administration\/5067370-mike-johnson-donald-trump-house-gop-reconciliation\/), they have proposed using a standalone reconciliation bill to address border security first, followed by a separate bill covering other priorities such as tax policy and the debt ceiling.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the 2025 period in which the US Congress has successfully passed *any* bill via the special parliamentary procedure of reconciliation and said bill is signed by the President into law.\n\nShould no such bill be passed and signed before January 1, 2026, this question will resolve as **Not in 2025**.\n\nThe bill must be signed by the president, simply passing Congress is not sufficient to resolve this question.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting the Timing of a 2025 Reconciliation Bill\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress has been working on a reconciliation bill to implement President Trump's agenda following the 2024 elections that gave Republicans control of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. Based on available information as of April 2025, here's an analysis of when President Trump might sign such legislation.\n\n## Current Status of the Reconciliation Process\n\nThe reconciliation process is well underway in 2025. On February 25, 2025, the House passed a budget resolution to initiate the reconciliation process, outlining reductions in taxes and spending over the next decade[3]. This formal step established the framework for committees to develop their portions of the reconciliation package.\n\nCongress has set a deadline of May 9, 2025, for committees to deliver their reconciliation bills[4]. Various House committees have been scheduled for markups:\n- Armed Services, Education & Workforce, and Homeland Security committees were scheduled for the week of April 28\n- Financial Services, Judiciary, Oversight, and Transportation & Infrastructure committees for April 30\n- Agriculture Committee for the week of May 5\n- Energy & Commerce Committee for May 7[5]\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, which handles tax policy (including the renewal of Trump's 2017 tax cuts), was rumored to hold markups during the week of May 5, though timing could slip[5].\n\n## Timeline Projections\n\nRepublican leadership has set Memorial Day (late May 2025) as their target for passing the full reconciliation bill[5]. However, political analysts have noted that \"Mike Johnson's tight megabill timeline is on a collision course with reality,\" suggesting potential delays in the process[2].\n\nThe reconciliation bill represents what some describe as a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity\" for Republicans to implement their agenda, including bringing \"the federal workforce to heel\" and saving \"taxpayers billions\"[1]. The comprehensive nature of the bill, covering tax policy, border security, and energy permitting, adds complexity to the legislative process.\n\n## Factors That Could Affect Timing\n\nA critical factor that could accelerate the timeline is the federal debt ceiling. While the government is not expected to hit its borrowing limit until August or September, this timeline could be moved up to late May or June if tax revenue falls below expectations[5]. This situation could create urgency to pass the reconciliation bill sooner, as it may include provisions to increase the debt limit by $4 trillion[5].\n\n## Forecast\n\nBased on the available information, if Republicans maintain their current timeline and successfully pass the reconciliation bill by Memorial Day, President Trump could sign it into law in June 2025, placing it in the \"Before July\" category. However, given the complexity of the legislation and indications of potential delays, there is a significant possibility that the signing could slip to the \"July - August\" period.\n\nThe likelihood of the bill being delayed until September or later appears lower based on current information, especially considering the potential debt ceiling pressure that could force earlier action. However, if substantial disagreements emerge during the committee process, particularly regarding the Ways and Means Committee's tax provisions or the Energy and Commerce Committee's $880 billion in required cuts, further delays are possible.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A description of an scenario that results in an unexpected outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that (1) good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time, and (2) good forecasters leave some moderate probability on most options to account for unexpected outcomes.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final probabilities for the N options in this order ['Before July', 'July - August', 'September - October', 'November - December', 'Not in 2025'] as:\nOption_A: Probability_A\nOption_B: Probability_B\n...\nOption_N: Probability_N\n\nwhere you must assign your probabilities so that Probability_A + Probability_B + ... + Probability_N = 100.\n\n",

This threat stems from allegations that Harvard has created a \"hostile learning environment\" for Jewish students and has failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus. DHS has demanded that Harvard provide detailed records of international students' involvement in \"illegal and violent activities\" by April 30, 2025, warning that noncompliance would result in the automatic withdrawal of the university's SEVP certification.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, at any time before September 1, 2025, the DHS formally revokes or suspends the SEVP certification of at least one university in the Ivy League, thereby preventing the affected institution from enrolling new international students under F or M visas.\n\nIt will resolve as **No** if no Ivy League SEVP certification is revoked or suspended before that date.\n\nAn announcement or notice of intent alone is not sufficient, the revocation or suspension must take effect.\n\nThe Ivy League includes the following institutions: Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University.\n\nUnder the circumstance that a court blocks the revocation or suspension by the DHS, this question will also resolve as **Yes** if the revocation or suspension is enacted in defiance of said court order.\n\nResolution will be determined based on information published by [credible sources](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/faq\/#definitions).\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Analysis: DHS SEVP Certification Revocation for Ivy League\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, the question of whether the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for an Ivy League university before September 1, 2025, requires careful analysis of current developments and historical precedents.\n\n## Current Situation\n\nThe most significant development is that DHS has explicitly threatened to revoke Harvard University's SEVP certification, with a deadline of April 30, 2025, for the university to provide detailed records of international students' involvement in \"illegal and violent activities.\"[5] This deadline has now passed, making the next 3-4 months critical for resolution.\n\nHarvard currently enrolls 6,793 international students, representing 27.2% of the university's total enrollment in the 2024-25 academic year.[1] The potential impact of a revocation would be substantial, affecting thousands of students and creating significant disruption to Harvard's operations and finances.\n\n## SEVP Certification Framework\n\nSEVP certification is the regulatory mechanism that allows institutions to issue Forms I-20 to prospective international students, which is necessary for obtaining F and M student visas.[3] For a school to maintain certification, it must:\n\n- Remain operational and instruct students in approved courses\/programs\n- Maintain necessary facilities, adequate finances, and qualified personnel\n- Meet state requirements to operate as an institution of learning\n- Provide instruction leading to a degree or professional, educational, or vocational objective[3]\n\nThe certification can be withdrawn through a formal process, after which affected students must either transfer to another SEVP-certified institution, change their immigration status, or leave the United States.[5]\n\n## Precedent Analysis\n\nAs of March 12, 2025, ICE had listed six schools whose SEVP certifications had been withdrawn.[5] However, these cases primarily involved schools that had either:\n\n1. Ceased operations completely\n2. Been denied recertification through regular review processes[5]\n\nThere is no recent precedent for a high-profile, fully operational research university like Harvard losing SEVP certification due to political or policy disputes. This makes the current situation relatively unprecedented.\n\n## Key Factors Affecting Probability\n\nSeveral factors will influence whether DHS proceeds with revoking Harvard's (or another Ivy League's) SEVP certification:\n\n1. **Harvard's Compliance**: Whether Harvard met the April 30 deadline and the adequacy of its response\n2. **Legal Challenges**: Harvard would likely mount immediate legal challenges to any revocation attempt\n3. **Political Considerations**: The significant economic and diplomatic impact of restricting international student enrollment at elite institutions\n4. **Institutional Response**: Actions taken by Harvard to address the underlying concerns about campus climate\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on available information as of May 12, 2025, I estimate a **30-40% probability** that DHS will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for at least one Ivy League university before September 1, 2025.\n\nThis assessment reflects:\n\n- The explicit threat against Harvard has moved beyond speculation to formal administrative action[5]\n- The deadline for Harvard's response has passed, potentially triggering next steps in the process\n- The significant stakes involved make this a high-profile case with potential for intervention\n- The relatively short timeline (less than 4 months remaining until the September 1 deadline)\n- The unprecedented nature of such an action against an elite university creates uncertainty\n\n## Key Uncertainties\n\nMajor uncertainties in this forecast include:\n\n1. Whether Harvard complied with the April 30 deadline (information not available in current sources)\n2. The legal standard for SEVP revocation in cases involving alleged hostile environments (versus operational failures)\n3. The effectiveness of potential legal challenges by Harvard or other affected institutions\n4. The willingness of DHS to follow through on threats against a prestigious institution\n\nThis forecast should be updated as new information becomes available regarding Harvard's compliance with DHS demands and any formal notices of intent to revoke certification.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "4":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026?\n\nQuestion background:\nUkraine seeks tangible security guaranties to protect herself from Russia:\n\n- In 1994, Britain, the US, Ukraine, and Russia signed the [Budapest Memorandum](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Budapest_Memorandum), which guaranteed the security and territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine surrendering her nuclear weapons.\n\n- The Memorandum [failed](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russian_occupation_of_Crimea) to prevent the occupation of several Ukrainian territories by Russia in 2014. \n\n- [Since 2014](https:\/\/www.rferl.org\/a\/ukraine-parliament-coalition-agreement\/26703123.html), Ukraine has been actively seeking to become a NATO member, in hope that it will prevent further military aggression by Russia. \n\n- In 2022, Russia started a large-scale military [invasion](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) of Ukraine. During the invasion, Russia has perpetrated a multitude of [war crimes](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War_crimes_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), forcing the International Criminal Court to issue an [arrest warrant](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Criminal_Court_arrest_warrants_for_Vladimir_Putin_and_Maria_Lvova-Belova) for Vladimir Putin. [According](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Allegations_of_genocide_of_Ukrainians_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) to legal scholars and official statements by several countries, Russia is perpetrating a genocide of Ukrainians as an ethnicity.\n\n- Russian officials have several times threatened Ukraine with a nuclear strike (e.g. by Dmitrii [Medvedev](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/europe\/russias-medvedev-warns-west-that-nuclear-threat-is-not-bluff-2022-09-27\/)).\n\nUkrainian officials openly stated that a restoration of the Ukrainian nuclear program is the alternative to NATO membership:\n\n- In 2021, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Melnyk [said](https:\/\/www.dailysabah.com\/world\/europe\/ukraine-mulls-nuclear-arms-if-nato-membership-not-impending-envoy) that if Ukraine is not allowed to become a NATO member, Ukraine might have to reconsider its status as a non-nuclear weapon state to guarantee her security\n- in 2022, President Zelenskyy [said](https:\/\/uawire.org\/zelensky-ukraine-may-reconsider-its-nuclear-status) that without the promised security guarantees according to the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine may reconsider its nuclear status.\n\nUkraine has at least some prerequisites for developing nuclear weapons:\n\n- a developed nuclear energy industry (Ukraine is the [#7](https:\/\/pris.iaea.org\/PRIS\/CountryStatistics\/CountryStatisticsLandingPage.aspx) in the world by nuclear energy generation) \n- uranium ore deposits and processing [facilities](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_power_in_Ukraine#Uranium_mining)\n- independent manufacturing of delivery systems, including intercontinental ballistic [missiles](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tsyklon).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are credible reports that Ukraine has a nuclear weapons program before January 1, 2026.\n\nFor the purpose of this question, we consider reports as credible if produced by any of these entities:\n\n- named Ukrainian officials (at the level of a minister or higher)\n- officials of the countries allied with Ukraine (e.g. the US)\n- relevant international agencies (e.g. the International Atomic Energy Agency) \n- major media (e.g. the New York Times).\n\nThe report should not be retracted within a month.\n\nCredible reports that Ukraine is in *possession* of nuclear weapons will count as \"Yes\" too, regardless of the source of the weapons. But we don't count as possession the cases where the nukes are stationed in Ukraine by another country without giving Ukraine the launch control.\n\nFor purposes of this question, a \"nuclear weapons program\" refers to a systematic set of scientific research, technological development, and engineering efforts with the aim of developing, manufacturing, and deploying nuclear weapons. This program may involve multiple facets including but not limited to uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing, warhead design, missile delivery systems, testing procedures, as well as logistical and operational planning for the use of nuclear weapons. For the purposes of this question, we will also consider a weapons program to be a program to deploy nuclear weapons obtained from other countries, as long as those weapons are under Ukraine's ability to command and launch.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n**Key historical trends and current status**\n\n- Ukraine surrendered its inherited nuclear arsenal in 1994 in exchange for security guarantees under the Budapest Memorandum, which have since been violated by Russia[4].\n- Since the Russian annexation of Crimea (2014) and the full-scale invasion (2022), Ukrainian officials have periodically raised the nuclear issue as leverage, particularly when Western security guarantees falter[1][2][5].\n- As of early 2025, Ukraine possesses significant nuclear expertise, civilian nuclear infrastructure, uranium resources, and missile technology, theoretically enabling a rapid weapons program if so ordered[2].\n\n**Recent announcements and policies**\n\n- President Zelenskyy and other officials have stated that, given the failure of security guarantees, Ukraine faces a stark choice between NATO membership or \u201cmanufacturing nuclear weapons\u201d[2][5].\n- However, every such statement has been quickly clarified: both Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry have repeatedly and explicitly denied any current intention to develop nuclear weapons, affirming Ukraine\u2019s commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty[2][5].\n- No credible reports from major media, Ukrainian\/allied officials, or international agencies have indicated the initiation of a weapons program as of May 2025[1][2][5].\n\n**Authoritative sources for verification**\n\n- Major international media, statements by Ukrainian ministers, allied government officials, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have all been monitoring the situation closely. The IAEA maintains a presence at all Ukrainian nuclear plants, making a covert program highly unlikely[3].\n\n**Limitations or uncertainties**\n\n- The situation is dynamic: if Western support were to evaporate and Russia\u2019s aggression escalate further, Ukrainian incentives could theoretically shift.\n- Public nuclear rhetoric, while increasing, has thus far served as a lever for diplomatic pressure rather than concrete policy.\n- Any move towards weaponization would likely be detected rapidly by international agencies or media.\n\n**Adjusted probabilistic assessment**\n\nGiven Ukraine\u2019s technical capability, security pressures, and recurring nuclear rhetoric\u2014but also the absolute absence of credible reports, the presence of IAEA inspectors, and the repeated official denials\u2014the probability that Ukraine will launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026 is very low. Unless currently unforeseen geopolitical shocks occur, there is no evidence to suggest Ukraine will cross this threshold within the forecast window.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1].

        "5":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman be indicted before 2026?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn November 17, 2023, Sam Altman was [fired as CEO of OpenAI](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/tech\/sam-altman-departs-open-ai-mira-murati-interim-ceo-41f6d51e). \n\nIn a [statement](https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/openai-announces-leadership-transition), OpenAI's board said:\n\n> Mr. Altman\u2019s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.\n\nIt is not yet known in what areas, or why, Altman was \"not consistently candid\" with the OpenAI board.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves Yes if before January 1, 2026, Sam Altman has been indicted in the United States on any charge(s) alleging violation of state or federal law. The question resolves No if this does not occur.\n\nNo conviction is necessary for a Yes resolution; this question concerns only indictment.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- **Sam Altman's Firing and Return:** On November 17, 2023, Sam Altman was fired as CEO of OpenAI for not being \"consistently candid\" with the board, according to the board's public statement. The specific areas where candor was lacking have not been disclosed, and no public allegations of criminal activity accompanied the firing. By May 2025, Altman is back in control at OpenAI, with a board now more closely aligned with him[1][2].\n- **Legal Scrutiny and Civil Litigation:** OpenAI, and by extension Altman, is currently under scrutiny from the attorneys general of California and Delaware and faces civil lawsuits, including a high-profile legal dispute with Elon Musk. The Musk lawsuit is scheduled for trial in March 2025, but the nature of all known actions is civil, not criminal, as of the latest reporting[3][4][5].\n\n## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- **OpenAI Corporate Governance:** Recent governance changes have tightened Altman's control over the board, making a repeat of the 2023 ouster unlikely, but also potentially increasing regulatory and public scrutiny of OpenAI's decision-making and compliance practices[2].\n- **Legal Proceedings Timeline:** Attorneys for both Musk and Altman have indicated that, aside from the March 2025 trial date, full legal resolution could extend beyond 2026, underscoring the slow pace typical of complex tech litigation[4][5].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- News outlets such as Business Insider, Axios, and court documents provide up-to-date coverage of OpenAI's governance and legal situation[1][2][5].\n- Public statements from the OpenAI board and filings in the Musk lawsuit are primary sources for recent developments[4][5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- **Lack of Public Criminal Allegations:** As of May 2025, there are no public criminal investigations or indictments against Sam Altman. Regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits are ongoing, but these are civil in nature.\n- **Opaque Board Concerns:** The precise nature of Altman's alleged lack of candor remains undisclosed, leaving open the possibility (albeit apparently remote as of now) that future revelations could trigger criminal investigations.\n- **Comparison to Reference Cases:** Criminal indictments of high-profile tech CEOs (e.g., Elizabeth Holmes, Sam Bankman-Fried) have historically followed public revelations of major fraud or misconduct. No such revelations have occurred concerning Altman as of the current date.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the facts as of May 2025:\n- There is currently no public evidence or credible report of an active criminal investigation into Sam Altman.\n- All known legal actions are civil, and the timeline for lawsuits indicates a slow legal process.\n- Regulatory scrutiny could, in theory, uncover criminal conduct, but this remains speculative.\n- Compared to reference cases, the absence of public criminal allegations makes indictment before 2026 unlikely.\n\n**Adjusted probability: The likelihood that Sam Altman will be indicted before January 1, 2026, appears low based on all currently available information. However, this assessment is subject to change if new facts emerge.**\n\n## References\n\n[1]. OpenAI's Nonprofit Will Remain in Control After All - Business Insider  \n[2].

        "6":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the UK housing market crash before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of 19 June 2023, the [Rightmove House Price Index](https:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/news\/house-price-index\/) indicates that the average asking price for a property in the UK is \u00a3372,812.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves **Yes** if, for any month before July 2025, the [Rightmove House Price Index](https:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/news\/house-price-index\/) indicates that the National average asking price for houses is equal to or less than \u00a3260,968; a decline of 30% from June 2023 levels.\n\nThe question is annulled if Rightmove changes the Rightmove House Price Index methodology, such that the June 2023 value is no longer within 5% of \u00a3260,968.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# UK Housing Market Forecast: Crash Probability Before July 2025\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, I've analyzed the likelihood of a UK housing market crash (defined as a 30% decline from June 2023 levels) occurring before July 2025. Based on current data and expert forecasts, such a crash appears highly improbable.\n\n## Current Market Status\n\nThe UK housing market has demonstrated resilience through 2024 and into 2025, despite earlier affordability challenges. The current average UK house price stands at approximately \u00a3269,000[2], showing stability rather than decline. This is significantly higher than the \u00a3260,968 threshold that would indicate a 30% crash from June 2023 levels (\u00a3372,812).\n\n## Key Market Indicators\n\n### Price Growth Projections\nMost major analysts and institutions are forecasting continued growth for the remainder of 2025:\n\n- Nationwide and HomeOwners Alliance predict house price growth of 2-4% for 2025[1][2]\n- Rightmove projects national asking prices to grow by 4% through 2025[5]\n- Hampton forecasts a 3% rise across Britain[5]\n- Savills has recently upgraded their five-year forecast for UK house price growth[4]\n\n### Mortgage Market Conditions\nMortgage conditions appear to be stabilizing or improving:\n\n- Mortgage rates are expected to range between 4-5% in 2025 according to Lloyd's Banking Group[3]\n- Some analysts suggest rates could settle between 3-4%[5]\n- Gross mortgage lending is projected to increase by 16% to \u00a3275 billion in 2025, up from \u00a3237.5 billion in 2024[5]\n\n### Regional Variations\nThe London property market is expected to outperform other regions for the first time since 2015[5], indicating strength in what has historically been the UK's most significant property market.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\nWhen comparing current conditions to historical housing crashes, several key differences emerge:\n\n1. **Mortgage Availability**: Unlike previous crashes, mortgage lending is projected to increase in 2025, with easing affordability pressures.\n\n2. **Economic Outlook**: While there are some concerns about the wider economic climate, there's no indication of the severe economic downturn that typically precedes housing market crashes.\n\n3. **Supply-Demand Balance**: The UK continues to face housing supply shortages, with the government aiming to build 370,000 new homes annually in England, though this target is unlikely to be met in the immediate term[2].\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available data and expert forecasts, I assess the probability of a UK housing market crash (30% decline) before July 2025 as extremely low (<5%). With only about six weeks remaining until July 2025, and all indicators pointing to modest growth rather than decline, there is insufficient time for market conditions to deteriorate to the point of a crash.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors could potentially impact this forecast:\n\n- Potential changes to government policy, including stamp duty adjustments\n- Unexpected economic shocks or rapid changes in interest rate policies\n- Global economic factors, including the impact of US trade policies under the Trump presidency\n- Regional variations in housing market performance\n\nHowever, none of these factors appear likely to cause a 30% market crash in the short timeframe before July 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "7":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWhat will happen to the adders to tax credits established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, before 2026?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2022 [Inflation Reduction Act](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inflation_Reduction_Act) included provisions incentivising clean energy projects to meet policy goals by increasing the size of the pre-existing **ITC (Investment Tax Credit)** and **PTC (Production Tax Credit)** when certain conditions are met. These credit bumps are termed \"adders\".\n\nThe ITC starts at 6% of base project cost and PTC starts at 0.5 cents\/kWh generated.\n\n[Adders from the Inflation Reduction Act include](https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/green-power-markets\/summary-inflation-reduction-act-provisions-related-renewable-energy), for example:\n\n* Increasing the ITC from 6% to 30% when workers are paid at least the prevailing wage and certain apprenticeship requirements are met;\n* Adding 10% to the Investment Tax Credit when materials are sourced sufficiently domestically;\n* A 0.3\u00a2\/kWh increase to PTC for being sited in a brownfield location or an area related to mining operations\n\n![Bar charts showing Investment Tax Credit (ITC) potential and Production Tax Credit (PTC) potential](https:\/\/www.enelnorthamerica.com\/content\/dam\/enel-na\/ira-2022\/inflation-reduction-act-bonus-tax-credit-blog-figure-1.png)\n\n(image [source](https:\/\/www.enelnorthamerica.com\/insights\/blogs\/maximizing-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022-bonus-tax-credits); note that values vary based on project size and other factors)\n\nThe IRA is speculated to be [at risk under Trump](https:\/\/www.thomsonreuters.com\/en-us\/posts\/corporates\/ira-uncertain-future\/); one of Trump's day-one executive orders included the following language:\n\n> [Sec. 7.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Repealed fully** if a federal bill is enacted before January 1, 2026 which eliminates all adders to the Investment Tax Credit (48E) and the Production Tax Credit (45Y) established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nIt will resolve as **Reduced incentives** If a federal bill is enacted before January 1, 2026 which either:\n\n* removes at least one but not all adders to 48E or 45Y (e.g. specifically removes the adder for \"prevailing wages\"), or\n* reduces the absolute amount or percentage of at least one adder to 48E or 45Y (e.g. reduces the \"Siting in Energy Community\" adder from 0.3c\/kWh to 0.2c\/kWh).\n\nIf no bill reducing or repealing the 48E or 45Y adders is enacted before January 1, 2026, this question will resolve as **Neither repealed nor reduced**.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, an adder is any provision that can conditionally increase either the Investment Tax Credit or Production Tax Credit available to US clean energy projects beyond the base credit, including any credits available conditional on worker wages or apprenticeships.\n\n* A bill that restores the base Investment Tax Credit to 30% as it was before the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act is still sufficient to resolve this question as **Repealed fully** as long as all adders are removed.\n* Amendments to the requirements to qualify for an adder (even if more restrictive) will not affect resolution; only the size or presence\/absence of adders will be considered.\n* If some adders are increased in size and at least one is reduced in size, this is still sufficient to resolve this question as **Reduced incentives**, independently of the size of the increases\/reductions.\n* If both 48E and 45Y are repealed, this question will resolve as **Repealed fully**. If only one of them is repealed and the other keeps some adders, it will resolve as **Reduced incentives**.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecast for IRA Tax Credit Adders Before 2026\n\nAs of April 2025, the tax credit adders established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) face significant uncertainty due to political changes and ongoing policy debates. This analysis examines the current status and potential future of these clean energy incentives.\n\n## Current Status of IRA Tax Credit Adders\n\nThe IRA established several important adders to the base Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) to incentivize clean energy development:\n\n- **Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship (PWA) Adder**: Projects meeting certain pay thresholds and apprenticeship requirements can receive a 5x multiple on the base 6% ITC rate, boosting credits to 30% of the project's cost[4]\n- **Domestic Content Adder**: Projects using domestically produced materials can claim an additional 10 percentage points, potentially increasing ITC value to 40%[4]\n- **Energy Communities Adder**: Projects developed in designated energy communities can claim an additional 10 percentage points[4]\n\nThese adders have been instrumental in driving clean energy investments since the IRA's passage. Currently, homeowners can save up to $3,200 annually through 2032 on energy-efficient home upgrades, with credits covering up to 30% of costs[2]. Additionally, the Residential Clean Energy credit provides a 30% income tax credit for clean energy equipment through 2032, stepping down to 22% for 2033 and 2034[2].\n\n## Recent Developments Affecting IRA Tax Credits\n\nThe political landscape has shifted significantly, creating uncertainty for the future of IRA tax credits:\n\n1. **Administrative Changes**: The incoming Trump administration has already taken action regarding IRA funding, with a day-one executive order pausing the disbursement of funds appropriated through the IRA.\n\n2. **Congressional Review**: Republican majorities in Congress are expected to revisit IRA incentives during debate over new tax legislation in 2025[5]. This review could lead to significant modifications or reductions to the existing adder structure.\n\n3. **Structural Changes**: There are already indications of changes to the structure of IRA tax credits coming in 2025, though specific details about which adders might be affected remain unclear[1].\n\n## Potential Scenarios Before 2026\n\nBased on current information, three scenarios appear possible for the IRA tax credit adders before 2026:\n\n### Scenario 1: Full Repeal\n\nGiven the executive order pausing IRA fund disbursement and Republican control of Congress, a full repeal of the adders is possible. This would eliminate all conditional increases to the base ITC and PTC established by the IRA, potentially returning to pre-IRA structures.\n\n### Scenario 2: Reduced Incentives\n\nA more moderate approach might involve reducing rather than eliminating adders. This could take the form of:\n- Lowering percentage increases (e.g., reducing the domestic content adder from 10% to 5%)\n- Eliminating specific adders while maintaining others\n- Imposing stricter qualification requirements for receiving adders\n\n### Scenario 3: Maintained Structure\n\nDespite political pressure, the economic benefits and industry momentum created by these tax credits could lead to their preservation. The clean energy transition has created jobs and investments across many states, potentially creating bipartisan support for maintaining some incentives.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors complicate forecasting the fate of IRA tax credit adders:\n\n1. **Legislative Timeline**: The legislative process for tax reform is complex and time-consuming, making it difficult to predict when changes might be enacted.\n\n2. **Economic Considerations**: The economic impact of repealing or reducing these incentives may influence political decisions, especially in states benefiting from clean energy investments.\n\n3. **Industry Pressure**: Sectors that have made significant investments based on these tax credits may lobby extensively to maintain them.\n\n4. **Implementation Challenges**: Even with legislative changes, the implementation timeline and transition provisions remain uncertain.\n\nThe outlook for IRA tax credit adders remains highly dependent on political developments and legislative priorities in the coming months. Stakeholders in the clean energy sector should prepare for potential changes while monitoring congressional actions closely.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A description of an scenario that results in an unexpected outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that (1) good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time, and (2) good forecasters leave some moderate probability on most options to account for unexpected outcomes.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final probabilities for the N options in this order ['Repealed fully', 'Reduced incentives', 'Neither repealed nor reduced'] as:\nOption_A: Probability_A\nOption_B: Probability_B\n...\nOption_N: Probability_N\n\nwhere you must assign your probabilities so that Probability_A + Probability_B + ... + Probability_N = 100.\n\n",
        "8":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 1 million Russian personnel losses be reported before 2026?\n\nQuestion background:\nSince the beginning of the Russian invasion in 2022, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine releases their daily estimation of Russian losses in personnel, vehicles, aircraft, and other military equipment on their pages in social networks (see links in Resolution Criteria).\n\nAlthough it's difficult to prove these numbers, and it's typical to exagerrate enemy losses during wars, these reports, in general, correlate well with battle intensity observed through public videos and OSINT data.\n\nSince 2022, it has reached more than 625,000 in total (around 640\/day), but the battles intensified since April 2024, reaching more than 1000\/day on most days. With this pace, 1 million casualties will be reached in September 2025.\n\nHistorical data are also tracked by independent trackers\nsuch as [russian-casualties-in-ua](https:\/\/russian-casualties.in.ua\/) , [Combat.FYI](https:\/\/combat.fyi\/) and in the [2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset](https:\/\/github.com\/PetroIvaniuk\/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset\/blob\/main\/data\/russia_losses_personnel.json).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before 1 January 2026, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports 1 million or more Russian personnel losses on their official public media pages on [Facebook](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GeneralStaff.ua), [Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/GeneralStaffZSU), [X.com](https:\/\/x.com\/GeneralStaffUA), and other social networks.\n\nIf before 1 January 2026 no such report is published, the question resolves as **No**.  This includes the case when the General Staff of the AFU stops publishing their data due to a ceasefire or peace agreement.\n\nIf, however, there are no credible reports about the ceasefire or peace agreement, but there are no new reports for more than 30 days in a row, the question may be **Annulled** at the discretion of Metaculus admins.\n\nNote that \"Personnel losses\" in this context are _killed and wounded_ soldiers and that wounded soldiers may return to the battlefield later.\n\nIn the past there were at least one occasion on [May 27, 2023](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GeneralStaff.ua\/posts\/594141432898939?ref=embed_post) when the error in the previous day's report was admitted and corrected. For this reason, the actual resolution should be delayed for 2 days.\n\nHistorical trackers mentioned in the Background information ([russian-casualties-in-ua](https:\/\/russian-casualties.in.ua\/), [Combat.FYI](https:\/\/combat.fyi\/) and the [2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset](https:\/\/github.com\/PetroIvaniuk\/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset\/blob\/main\/data\/russia_losses_personnel.json)) may be used as secondary resolution sources if the main resolution pages are banned\/unavailable.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- As of May 2025, Ukrainian General Staff estimates and UK Defence Intelligence assessments indicate that Russian personnel losses (killed and wounded) since February 2022 have reached approximately 950,000[4].\n- The daily rate of reported Russian casualties has risen sharply in 2025, with April\u2019s average exceeding 1,200 per day and a total of about 160,000 in the first four months of the year[4]. On several recent days, reported losses have topped 1,300[1].\n- If this pace continues, Ukraine\u2019s official tally will reach 1 million Russian personnel losses within the next 2\u20133 months, i.e., by July or August 2025, well before the January 2026 deadline.\n\n## Key Differences and Factors Affecting the Forecast\n\n- The current pace of casualties is the highest on record, reflecting the intensification of fighting in 2025[4].\n- There have been no major ceasefire announcements, peace agreements, or reporting interruptions as of May 2025 that might prevent continued daily updates from the Ukrainian General Staff.\n- While Ukrainian official figures may overestimate Russian losses, these are the numbers used for resolution, per the criteria.\n\n## Authoritative Verification Sources\n\n- Ukrainian General Staff daily reports on Facebook, Telegram, and X.com are the primary reference for the resolution of this question.\n- Secondary independent trackers, such as russian-casualties.in.ua and Combat.FYI, broadly support the ongoing high-casualty trend, though their figures may lag official Ukrainian announcements[5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Ukrainian official casualty figures are widely considered to be estimates and may be inflated, but they are generally consistent with the reported intensity of fighting and independent OSINT trends.\n- The situation could change if a ceasefire or peace deal is reached, or if the Ukrainian General Staff ceases or delays publication of daily reports for more than 30 days.\n- Actual numbers may differ, but for the purpose of this forecast, only the Ukrainian General Staff's public reports are determinative.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the current pace of reported Russian losses, the lack of announced changes to reporting or major de-escalation, and the proximity to the 1 million threshold, it is highly probable (well above 90%) that the Ukrainian General Staff will report 1 million Russian personnel losses before 1 January 2026.\n\n## References\n\n1.

Despite this, he remained the richest person, with a $108 billion lead over Bezos as of March 2025[3].\n- Musk\u2019s net worth is dominated by his 20.5% stake in Tesla (which saw its market cap fall from $1.5 trillion in December 2024 to under $900 billion in March 2025[2][3]), and his 42% stake in SpaceX (valued between $210 billion and $350 billion in late 2024 and early 2025[2]).\n- Other major assets include significant holdings in xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X (formerly Twitter), but these constitute a smaller share of his total wealth[2].\n\n## Recent Announcements or Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- The 35% decline in Tesla\u2019s share price in early 2025 was driven by broad market selloffs, increased tariffs, and concerns about the automotive sector\u2019s global supply chains[3].\n- SpaceX\u2019s valuation continued to rise, becoming Musk\u2019s most valuable asset by early 2025, which helped offset some of Tesla\u2019s declines[2].\n- Broader market conditions and regulatory risks remain significant, with Tesla\u2019s fortunes especially sensitive to geopolitics and policy changes[3].\n- No recent announcements suggest Musk will divest large portions of his holdings or face major dilution before the end of 2025.\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is the definitive source for ranking the world's wealthiest individuals and will be used for resolution[1].\n- Historical trends and asset breakdowns are corroborated by Bloomberg, Investopedia, Cointelegraph, and major news outlets[2][3][4][5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Musk\u2019s net worth is highly sensitive to Tesla\u2019s share price. Continued volatility or a further decline could threaten his top position, especially if competitors\u2019 assets outperform or remain stable[2][3].\n- SpaceX\u2019s valuation is based on private market estimates, which can be subject to rapid revision or illiquidity[2].\n- Unexpected events (e.g., asset sales, regulatory action, corporate governance issues, or macroeconomic shocks) could impact Musk\u2019s ranking.\n- The large current gap\u2014over $100 billion\u2014makes it less likely for others to surpass him absent an extraordinary reversal, but this gap has already narrowed since late 2024[3][4].\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven Musk\u2019s current lead, diversified asset base, and the lack of imminent large-scale threats to his holdings, the probability that he will remain the world\u2019s richest person on December 31, 2025, remains high\u2014likely above 70%. However, the risks posed by further declines in Tesla\u2019s value, private valuations of SpaceX, and broader market volatility make his position less secure than it appeared at the end of 2024. A sharp, sustained drop in Tesla or a major upward movement in a competitor\u2019s assets could close the gap, but barring such developments, Musk is favored to retain the top spot[1][2][3][4].\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.

        "10":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nHow many measles cases will be reported in the United States in 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn January 25, 2024, the US CDC [warned clinicians in the United States to be alert for measles cases](https:\/\/emergency.cdc.gov\/newsletters\/coca\/2024\/012524.html) after 23 cases were confirmed between December 1, 2023, and January 23, 2023. According to the CDC:\n\n>Most of these cases were among children and adolescents who had not received a measles-containing vaccine (MMR or MMRV), even if age eligible.\n\nThe [latest cases and outbreaks update](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/data-research\/?CDC_AAref_Val=https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/cases-outbreaks.html) from the CDC reported a total of 167 cases reported in 2024 as of July 11, 2024. The page currently states that it it is updated on the second and fourth Friday of every month, though it had [previously been updated monthly](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20240124073334\/https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/cases-outbreaks.html).\n\nWhile cases midway through 2024 have so far exceeded the annual total of prior years since 2019, when 1,274 cases were reported, it remains to be seen what annual case counts look like in the future and whether trends shift following the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the number of measles cases reported to the CDC in 2025, according to the [CDC's cases and outbreaks page](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/data-research\/?CDC_AAref_Val=https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/cases-outbreaks.html). The question will resolve when the first update has been published showing the total number of reported cases through the end of 2025.\n\n* If the total number of measles cases reported in 2025 is above 2,000 the question will resolve as above the upper bound.\n* If a total for 2025 has not been published before May 1, 2026, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Measles Cases Forecast for United States in 2025\n\nAs of July 17, 2024, we have several indicators suggesting that measles cases in the United States could increase substantially in 2025. This analysis examines historical trends, current status, and factors that may influence case counts in 2025.\n\n## Current Situation and Historical Context\n\nThe United States has experienced 167 reported measles cases as of July 11, 2024, already exceeding annual totals for each year since 2019 (when 1,274 cases were reported). This represents a concerning upward trend in measles transmission.\n\nHistorical data shows that measles cases can fluctuate dramatically from year to year, with the potential for significant outbreaks when vaccination rates decline or importation events increase. The 2019 outbreak (1,274 cases) demonstrates how quickly cases can escalate when the virus enters under-vaccinated communities.\n\n## Forecast Analysis for 2025\n\nBased on current trends and historical patterns, we project that measles cases in 2025 could range between 800-1,200 cases, with several factors potentially driving this increase:\n\n**Key Factors Affecting the Forecast:**\n\n1. **Declining Vaccination Rates**: The CDC has noted that most current cases are among unvaccinated individuals. If this trend continues, we could see larger outbreaks in 2025.\n\n2. **Outbreak Potential**: Measles is highly contagious, with each case potentially generating 12-18 secondary cases in susceptible populations. This means even small clusters can rapidly expand into large outbreaks.\n\n3. **Global Situation**: Increasing global measles activity could lead to more importation events in 2025. The Americas region has historically been vulnerable to imported cases when global incidence rises.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on current vaccination trends and case patterns in 2024, I estimate the following probability distribution for 2025 measles cases in the United States:\n\n- 10% probability: <400 cases (containment of current trends)\n- 30% probability: 400-800 cases (moderate increase)\n- 40% probability: 800-1,200 cases (substantial increase)\n- 15% probability: 1,200-2,000 cases (major outbreak scenario)\n- 5% probability: >2,000 cases (widespread transmission)\n\nThe most likely scenario (800-1,200 cases) would represent a 5-7x increase from 2024 mid-year levels, but would remain below the 2019 peak. This forecast accounts for the possibility of multiple distinct outbreaks occurring in under-vaccinated communities.\n\n## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors create uncertainty in this forecast:\n\n1. **Reporting Delays**: CDC data may be subject to reporting lags, meaning actual case counts could be higher than officially reported.\n\n2. **Intervention Effectiveness**: Public health responses, including contact tracing and vaccination campaigns, could significantly alter outbreak trajectories.\n\n3. **Vaccination Campaigns**: If current trends prompt aggressive vaccination campaigns in late 2024, this could reduce 2025 case numbers.\n\n4. **Case Detection**: Not all measles cases are detected, particularly milder cases or those in areas with limited healthcare access.\n\nThe CDC currently updates its measles data on the second and fourth Friday of each month, which may affect the timeliness of final 2025 figures when resolving this forecast.\n\n## References\n\n1.

In 2024, the Brazilian economy made efforts to keep inflation under control, with fiscal and monetary policies being adjusted to respond to internal and external inflationary pressures. The 2025 scenario will depend on several factors, including:\n\n 1. **Central Bank Monetary Policy**:\n * The trajectory of the **Selic Rate**, which is currently at restrictive levels, will be essential to control inflation. Decisions by the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) directly influence credit, consumption and investments.\n 2. **Internal and External Pressures**:\n * Internally, the impact of the labor market, fiscal policies and administered prices (such as fuel and energy) can influence inflation.\n * Externally, changes in commodity prices, currency fluctuations and global conditions such as interest rates in the United States can also affect inflation.\n 3. **Recent Indicators**:\n * The IPCA (Broad National Consumer Price Index), the main inflation measure in Brazil, closed 2024 at **X%** (replace with the real value when available).\n * Inflation targets for 2025 were set by the National Monetary Council (CMN), with a tolerance ceiling that may be crucial in the analysis.\n\n Brazil's inflation rate in 2024 is 4.37%.\n [Source](https:\/\/agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br\/economia\/noticia\/2024-09\/estimativas-do-mercado-para-inflacao-e-pib-permanecem-estaveis).\n\n [CNN](https:\/\/www.cnnbrasil.com.br\/economia\/macroeconomia\/mercado-eleva-previsao-para-inflacao-pela-6a-vez-consecutiva-em-2024-mostra-focus\/).\n\n [Forbes](https:\/\/forbes.com.br\/forbes-money\/2024\/09\/governo-eleva-previsao-de-alta-do-pib-e-da-inflacao-em-2024\/).\n\n [Central Bank of Brazil Report](https:\/\/www.bcb.gov.br\/publicacoes\/ri).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nOfficial IPCA data, reliable media sources.\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Brazil Inflation Forecast Analysis: 2024 vs 2025\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of Brazil's inflation trajectory by comparing 2024 figures with current and projected 2025 data.\n\n## Current Situation vs. Reference Case\n\nBrazil's inflation rate in 2024 was 4.37% as stated in the query. Current data shows that Brazil's inflation rate has increased significantly in 2025:\n\n- The inflation rate reached 5.53% in April 2025, up from 5.48% in March 2025[1]\n- The average inflation rate for 2025 is approximately 5.31%[4]\n- Analysts project inflation to reach around 5.60% by the end of Q2 2025[1]\n\nThis represents a clear upward trend compared to 2024 levels, with inflation running more than 0.9 percentage points higher than the previous year.\n\n## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast\n\nSeveral critical factors are driving this inflationary pressure in 2025:\n\n**Monetary Policy Challenges:**\n- Despite the Central Bank's efforts, inflation expectations have worsened, with projections reaching 4.6% for 2025[2]\n- The Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) has had to adjust its monetary stance in response to inflation pressures[5]\n\n**Economic Conditions:**\n- Weak government finances are contributing to stronger inflation and higher interest rates[5]\n- The Brazilian real has experienced depreciation, which typically puts upward pressure on inflation through import costs[5]\n- Economic growth is projected at 2% for 2025, reflecting a slowdown compared to the stronger performance of approximately 3% observed in recent years[3]\n\n**Market Expectations:**\n- Financial analysts have reduced their projections for Brazil's benchmark interest rate (Selic) from 15% to 14.75% by the end of 2025, suggesting some optimism about inflation control in late 2025[3]\n- The median forecast for the official inflation rate has shown modest improvement, dropping for three consecutive weeks to 5.53% (as of May 6, 2025), down from 5.55%[3]\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available data as of May 12, 2025, I assess with high confidence (approximately 90-95% probability) that Brazil's inflation rate in 2025 will be higher than it was in 2024. This assessment is based on:\n\n1. Current inflation readings (5.53% as of April 2025) are already significantly above 2024's 4.37%[1]\n2. Projections from economic analysts and the central bank consistently show 2025 inflation above 5%[1][3][4]\n3. While there are some signs of modest improvement in recent weeks, the projected inflation remains substantially above the 2024 level[3]\n4. Long-term projections suggest inflation will not fall below 2024 levels until 2026-2027[1]\n\nThe evidence indicates that despite some stabilization efforts, Brazil is experiencing a period of higher inflation in 2025 compared to 2024. Even with recent modest improvements in forecasts, inflation is expected to remain elevated throughout 2025, with the Central Bank of Brazil and market analysts projecting rates well above the 2024 figure of 4.37%.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Inflation projections are subject to revision based on monetary policy adjustments\n- External factors such as global commodity prices and currency fluctuations could significantly impact the inflation trajectory\n- The effectiveness of government fiscal measures in the remainder of 2025 could alter the inflation outlook\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "12":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill global average wealth per adult increase in 2024 compared to 2023?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe [ <u>World Inequality Database<\/u> ](https:\/\/wid.world\/) (WID) tracks inequality and wealth indicators globally. The \"Average national wealth at market value per adult\" measures average wealth per adult in terms of market value, providing insights into global economic changes and wealth distribution. This metric reflects changes in economic conditions, but also dynamics of capital redistribution\/concentration.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThe question will be resolved as **Yes** if the [ <u>World Inequality Database<\/u> ](https:\/\/wid.world\/) (WID) estimates that the \"[ <u>Median national wealth at market value per adult<\/u> ](https:\/\/wid.world\/world\/#anweal_p0p100_z\/WO\/last\/eu\/k\/p\/yearly\/a\/false\/48929.56\/125000\/curve\/false\/country)\" for 2024 is higher than that in 2023. It will be resolved as **No** otherwise or if the value is equal to or lower.\n\n\u2022 If WID does not publish 2024 data by the resolution date, the question will be **void**.\n\n \u2022 The comparison will be made with the most recent figure available corresponding to 2023.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Global wealth per adult experienced a significant recovery in 2023, growing by approximately 4.2% after a contraction in 2022[4][5].\n- The contraction in 2022 was largely due to currency effects, particularly a strong US dollar, but the rebound in 2023 more than offset these losses[5].\n- Real (inflation-adjusted) global wealth grew by nearly 8.4% in 2023, outpacing nominal growth as inflation slowed[5].\n- Since 2008, global wealth per adult has been on a steady upward trajectory, though the pace of growth has slowed in most markets[2][5].\n- In 2023, adults in EMEA were the wealthiest on average (USD 166,000), followed by APAC (USD 156,000), and the Americas (USD 146,000)[5].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- No major global policy shifts or economic crises have been reported that would suggest a reversal of the upward trend in 2024.\n- Upward wealth mobility is expected to become more pronounced by 2030, with continued horizontal wealth transfer anticipated[5].\n- The convergence of emerging economies with mature markets continues to drive growth, especially in the Asia-Pacific region[2].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The UBS Global Wealth Report 2024 provides comprehensive data and analysis on global wealth trends[2][3].\n- The BCG Global Wealth Report 2024 corroborates the recovery and ongoing growth in global net wealth[4].\n- The World Inequality Database (WID) remains the definitive source for the specific metric in question and will provide the final figures for 2024.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The precise WID figures for 2024 are not yet published; forecasts rely on trends and projections from other authoritative reports.\n- Currency fluctuations and inflation can significantly impact nominal wealth figures, though recent data suggest real growth is robust[5].\n- Regional disparities and wealth concentration may affect the distribution, but the global average is expected to rise barring unforeseen shocks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the strong recovery in 2023, the ongoing upward trend in global wealth per adult, and the absence of major negative shocks or policy changes, it is likely that the global average wealth per adult will increase in 2024 compared to 2023. However, the final resolution depends on the publication of 2024 data by the World Inequality Database.\n\n## References\n\n- [1].

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2026, at least one of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic announces a pause of all training runs above a certain size, citing safety reasons. The length of the pause does not matter.\n\nThe question resolves as **No** otherwise.\n\nThe \u201csize\u201d in \u201cpausing all training runs above a certain size\u201d does not matter. In other words, this question is about a blanket pause on all runs above some size, whatever that size is. Therefore, a pause on training all models is sufficient for a Yes resolution.\n\nIf there is regulation that comes into force before January 1, 2026, which prevents at least one of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic from carrying out training runs above some size, then the question resolves as Yes.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n### Forecast on Pause of Large Training Runs by OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic Before 2026\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on historical data, recent policy announcements, and expert community forecasts as of early 2025, it is highly unlikely that OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic will announce a pause on all training runs above a certain size for safety reasons before 2026.\n\n**Key Points:**  \n- No known pauses on large training runs for safety reasons have been announced by these companies as of early 2024[2].  \n- Community predictions place the likelihood of such a pause before 2026 at approximately 2.5%[1].  \n- The Frontier AI Safety Commitments adopted by AI companies in mid-2024 focus on responsible scaling and governance improvements rather than pausing training runs[5].  \n- OpenAI\u2019s internal governance reforms and dissolved safety-focused compute teams suggest challenges in safety alignment but no broad halting of training[5].  \n- AI companies, including the three in question, actively resist restrictive regulation as of early 2025, indicating a preference to continue development without enforced pauses[4].  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe adjusted probabilistic assessment is that the probability is very low (around 2.5%) that any of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic will announce a comprehensive pause on training runs above a certain size for safety reasons before 2026. This forecast aligns with current evidence and expert consensus.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1].

        "14":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the percent of U.S. workers employed in white-collar jobs drop at least 2 percentage points below the 2022 level before 2026?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs [The Economist reported in June 2023](https:\/\/www.economist.com\/finance-and-economics\/2023\/06\/15\/ai-is-not-yet-killing-jobs), the percent of US workers who are white-collar, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has been steadily rising from ~57% in 1985 to ~62% in 2022. Yet, as they write,\n\n> After astonishing breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, many people worry that they will end up on the economic scrapheap. Global Google searches for \u201cis my job safe?\u201d have doubled in recent months, as people fear that they will be replaced with large language models (llms). Some evidence suggests that widespread disruption is coming. In a recent paper Tyna Eloundou of Openai and colleagues say that \u201caround 80% of the us workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of llms\u201d.\n\nThe % in white-collar jobs was last below 60.0% briefly in 2007, and before that, in the late 1990s.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **YES** if, in any quarter between Q2 2023 and Q4 2025 inclusive, BLS reports the percent of US employed persons who are employed in white-collar jobs is less than or equal to 60.0%, and **NO** otherwise. For the purposes of this question, \"white-collar jobs\" will be defined as the total found by summing the following BLS occupations:\n\n* Management, professional, and related occupations\n* Sales and office occupations\n\nResolution will be determined according to the percentages found from the [quarterly averages reported in the BLS Current Population Survey](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/web\/empsit\/cpsee_e13.htm), computed as the sum of the employment for the above occupations divided by the total for the quarter.\n\n* If the names of the occupations listed above are modified or changed Metaculus may determine the most appropriate new occupations or resolve the question as **Ambiguous**.\n* The occupations and resolution mechanism listed above will be used for resolution regardless of any methodological changes BLS implements.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting White-Collar Employment Trends Through 2026\n\nThe question asks whether the percentage of U.S. workers in white-collar jobs will drop at least 2 percentage points below the 2022 level before 2026. To address this effectively, I'll analyze historical trends, current status, and factors that could influence this metric.\n\n## Historical Trends and Current Status\n\nThe percentage of white-collar jobs in the U.S. workforce has shown a consistent upward trajectory over the past three decades:\n\n- From 1993 to 2022, white-collar employment increased from 58.9% to 62.2% of the total workforce, reflecting a long-term structural shift in the U.S. economy[3]\n- This represents approximately a 3.3 percentage point increase over 30 years, or roughly 0.11 percentage points per year on average\n- The metric was last below 60.0% briefly in 2007 and before that in the late 1990s, indicating considerable stability in this trend\n\nAs of 2023, professionals constituted 57.8% of the total workforce, with approximately 93 million people working across various professional occupations[1]. This figure appears to use a slightly different classification than the BLS definition specified in the question, which includes both \"Management, professional, and related occupations\" and \"Sales and office occupations.\"\n\n## Factors Potentially Affecting White-Collar Employment\n\nSeveral factors could influence whether we'll see a significant decline in white-collar employment:\n\n### 1. Emerging Technology Impact\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), poses a potential disruptive force for white-collar workers:\n\n- Research from OpenAI suggests that around 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by LLMs\n- White-collar jobs that involve routine cognitive tasks may be more vulnerable to AI automation than blue-collar physical labor\n\n### 2. Economic Indicators and Labor Market Trends\n\nThere are signs of cooling demand for white-collar workers:\n\n- Professional services saw monthly average job openings fall nearly 20% to 1.7 million in the first 11 months of 2023, compared to 2022[5]\n- This decline was significantly steeper than the 4% decrease in job openings observed in construction, a sector with high concentrations of blue-collar workers[5]\n\n### 3. Workforce Composition Shifts\n\nDemographic and sectoral shifts could influence the overall composition:\n\n- The growth of service sectors not classified as traditional white-collar work could dilute the percentage\n- Any significant reshoring of manufacturing would likely increase blue-collar employment percentages\n\n## Measurement Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral limitations affect the forecasting accuracy:\n\n1. **Definition Changes**: BLS occasionally revises occupational classifications, which could affect trend analysis\n2. **Economic Shocks**: Unforeseen economic disruptions could dramatically alter employment patterns\n3. **Technology Adoption Rate**: The pace at which AI technologies are implemented in workplaces remains uncertain\n4. **Policy Responses**: Government interventions in response to technological unemployment could affect outcomes\n\n## Forecast Assessment\n\nBased on the available data as of June 2023, the likelihood of white-collar employment dropping by 2 percentage points (to below 60.2%) before 2026 appears moderate but not high:\n\n1. **Historical Inertia**: The long-term trend has been consistently upward for decades, suggesting structural economic forces favoring white-collar employment\n2. **Early Warning Signs**: The 20% reduction in professional services job openings represents a significant deviation from historical patterns[5]\n3. **AI Acceleration**: The rapid development and deployment of AI technologies like ChatGPT and similar models in early 2023 could accelerate impacts on white-collar employment\n4. **Economic Resilience**: The U.S. economy showed strong growth in late 2023, expanding by 4.9% in Q3 and 3.3% in Q4[5], which typically supports job creation across sectors\n\nWhile there are clear signals of potential disruption, the historical stability and gradual nature of workforce composition changes suggest that a 2 percentage point decline within approximately 2.5 years would represent a significant deviation from long-term patterns. However, the unprecedented nature of recent AI advancements introduces substantial uncertainty.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe probability of seeing white-collar employment drop by at least 2 percentage points below 2022 levels before 2026 appears moderate (roughly 30-40%). While early indicators of reduced demand for white-collar workers exist, the historical resilience of this employment category and the typically gradual nature of workforce composition changes suggest that such a substantial decline would require accelerated implementation of AI technologies or other significant economic disruptions.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "15":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the bubble in the Magnificent Seven pop before 2026?\n\nQuestion background:\nUS mega-cap stocks Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (parent of Google), Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms (Facebook), and Tesla are collectively known as [the Magnificent Seven](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Magnificent_Seven_(stocks)). At the time of writing, they are collectively worth $13.1 trillion, and their performance [has driven most of the gains in the S&P 500 over 2023](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html). \n\nThe Magnificent Seven's rise has left the S&P [more concentrated than at any time in the last 100 years](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/magnificent-7-stocks-overcrowding-8576644) and prompted fears of a bubble.\n\nOn the other hand, it is possible that recent advances in artificial intelligence will generate so much profit that the Magnificent Seven's current share prices are fully justified by future cash flow.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve positive if at any point between now and 1 Jan 2026 shares of at least four of the Magnificent Seven stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla) close at least 50% below their all-time high. \n\nThe question shall be resolved by using the daily closing share prices available from Yahoo Finance under the 'historical data' tab or, at the discretion of Metaculus admins, any other credible source of share price data.\n\nWhatever data source is used should be adjusted for share splits, so that this question does *not* resolve positive just because a few of the Magnificent Seven decide to do a stock split (ie offer N new shares for each old share).\n\nIn case the text above isn't clear enough, an example: \nIf Stock X's all-time high is $1,000 then it qualifies as down >50% if the share price falls below $500.\n\nPositive resolution requires that at least four of the Magnificent Seven stocks close down >50% from their all time high. Alphabet has two traded share classes, but only counts as one out of the seven companies. Alphabet counts  if *either* of its two traded share classes (tickers GOOG and GOOGL) is at least 50% below its all-time high. \n\nSo if GOOG is down 51% and GOOGL is down 49% and 3 other stocks in the Magnificent Seven are down >50% then this question resolves positive.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Analysis: Magnificent Seven Bubble Risk Assessment\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, the Magnificent Seven stocks have experienced significant volatility, presenting a complex forecasting challenge regarding whether they will meet the \"bubble pop\" criteria (at least four stocks closing 50% below all-time highs) before January 2026.\n\n## Current Market Status\n\nThe Magnificent Seven\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla\u2014currently have a combined market capitalization of $15.4 trillion as of May 1, 2025, having recovered somewhat after earlier declines[1]. However, their total market value remains $2.2 trillion lower (-12.4%) year-to-date in 2025[1].\n\nIndividual year-to-date performance in 2025 shows varied outcomes:\n\n- Microsoft: +0.9% (+$30B)\n- Meta Platforms: -1.9% (-$30B)\n- Amazon: -12.6% (-$290B)\n- Alphabet: -14.9% (-$350B)\n- Apple: -15.4% (-$580B)\n- Nvidia: -17.2% (-$570B)\n- Tesla: -30.4% (-$390B)[1]\n\nThese stocks collectively delivered strong earnings in Q4 2024, with aggregate earnings reaching an all-time high of $131.2 billion, growing 31.7% year-over-year[4]. However, this growth rate marks their lowest since Q1 2023 and is expected to decline further, with Q1 2025 growth forecasted at only 18.5%[4].\n\n## Valuation Analysis\n\nA significant shift in valuations has occurred over recent months. According to Morningstar's analysis from March 2025:\n\n- Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are now considered undervalued\n- Nvidia and Tesla are deemed fairly valued\n- Apple remains overvalued[5]\n\nThis represents a major change from 2024 when most of these stocks traded at premium valuations[5]. The recent market selloff has brought price-to-fair-value ratios down considerably.\n\n## Historical Context and Trends\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks experienced extraordinary growth between 2023-2024, collectively rising 156.1%[3]. However, they have faced challenges in 2025, with double-digit declines to start the year[3].\n\nTheir market dominance has been notable, with these companies reaching market capitalizations of approximately $1 trillion or more, with several around $3 trillion as of March 2025[2].\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nSeveral factors suggest increased vulnerability for these stocks:\n\n1. **Growth Deceleration**: The quarter-over-quarter earnings growth of 19.3% in Q4 2024 is expected to fall to -17.4% in Q1 2025[4].\n\n2. **Concentration Risk**: Three companies\u2014Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta\u2014accounted for roughly 73% of the Magnificent Seven's total earnings growth in Q4 2024[4].\n\n3. **Market Volatility**: The group has already experienced significant volatility, with a 14.1% market cap decline occurring between July and August 2024[1].\n\n4. **Tesla's Vulnerability**: Tesla has already declined 30.4% year-to-date in 2025, putting it closer to the 50% threshold than other members of the group[1].\n\n## Probability Assessment\n\nBased on the available data, the probability of at least four Magnificent Seven stocks closing 50% below their all-time highs before January 2026 appears moderate but not certain. The current valuations suggest many of these stocks have already undergone significant corrections, with four now considered undervalued by analysts[5].\n\nThe most vulnerable candidates appear to be:\n1. Tesla (already down 30.4% YTD)\n2. Nvidia (down 17.2% YTD despite strong earnings)\n3. Apple (still considered overvalued despite a 15.4% YTD decline)\n4. Alphabet (down 14.9% YTD)\n\nHowever, the improved valuations and continued strong (albeit slowing) earnings growth provide some cushion against a full-scale collapse meeting the 50% threshold criteria for most of these companies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the Magnificent Seven stocks have experienced significant volatility and corrections in 2025, the available data suggests a full \"bubble pop\" meeting the specified criteria (four stocks 50% below all-time highs) before January 2026 is possible but not highly probable given current valuations and fundamentals. The most likely scenario appears to be continued volatility with selective deeper corrections rather than a synchronized collapse of the entire group.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "16":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nHow much will the 2025 reconciliation bill decrease total Medicaid spending from Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 to FY 2034?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe federal budget process in the United States begins with the passage of a [budget resolution](https:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/research\/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation#how-does-congress-start-the-cbpp-anchor) \u2014 a concurrent resolution passed by both the House and Senate that sets broad fiscal targets for spending, revenue, the deficit, and debt levels. While it provides a framework for the upcoming fiscal year, it does not become law and does not require the president\u2019s signature. Importantly, the budget resolution may include reconciliation instructions, which direct specific congressional committees to draft legislation that meets the resolution\u2019s fiscal goals. These instructions are optional but allow for the creation of a [reconciliation bill](https:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/research\/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation), which allows the Senate to pass certain budget-related laws with a simple majority vote and limited debate, bypassing the [filibuster](https:\/\/www.senate.gov\/about\/powers-procedures\/filibusters-cloture.htm).\n\nIf reconciliation instructions are included, the resulting reconciliation bill must be passed by both chambers and signed by the president to become law. It can include changes to spending, revenue, or the debt limit, but is restricted by rules such as the [Byrd Rule](https:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/research\/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation#what-is-the-byrd-rule-cbpp-anchor), which prohibits provisions unrelated to budget changes. If the budget resolution does not include reconciliation instructions, Congress must enact any fiscal changes through the regular legislative process. In this case, changes to [discretionary spending](https:\/\/fiscaldata.treasury.gov\/americas-finance-guide\/federal-spending\/#the-difference-between-mandatory-discretionary-and-supplemental-spending) are made through the annual appropriations bills, which fund specific government departments and require presidential approval. Changes to mandatory spending programs (like Medicare, [Medicaid](https:\/\/usafacts.org\/articles\/how-much-of-the-federal-budget-is-mandatory-spending\/), or Social Security), however, require standalone legislation that amends the law governing those programs. These also must pass both chambers and be signed by the president, and they generally face a higher procedural hurdle in the Senate due to the possibility of a filibuster.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans have passed separate budget resolutions in March and April 2025, with the Senate version calling for approximately \\$4 billion in spending cuts, and the House version aiming for \\$1.5 trillion in cuts. President Trump has so far [backed the Senate version](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/trump-johnson-urge-gop-to-back-budget-resolution\/), though there is some opposition to this version among House Republicans.\n\nOne similarity between House and Senate plans is that both would [require the Energy and Commerce Committee to find \\$880 billion in cuts](https:\/\/www.healthcaredive.com\/news\/senate-advances-budget-resolution-medicaid\/744385\/) over 10 years. Reporting [suggests](https:\/\/www.healthcaredive.com\/news\/medicaid-cuts-necessary-meet-republican-budget-target-cbo\/741937\/) that this would likely require significant cuts to Medicaid, as spending under the purview of the Energy and Commerce Committee not part of Medicaid, Medicare, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is much smaller than the \\$880 billion in cuts required.\n\nThe [Congressional Budget Office](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Congressional_Budget_Office) (CBO) is required to produce [cost estimates](https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/cost-estimates) for many bills passed by Congress. Some examples of prior bills that cut Medicaid and their associated Medicaid spending impacts estimated by CBO are available [here](https:\/\/unidosus.org\/blog\/2025\/02\/21\/house-budget-resolutions-largest-medicaid-cuts-in-us-history\/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the total decrease in Medicaid spending over the period from fiscal year 2025 to 2034, inclusive, enacted as part of a spending reconciliation bill passed during fiscal year 2025. If no such reconciliation bill is enacted before the end of fiscal year 2025 (before October 1, 2025), this question will be **annulled**.\n\nThe question will resolve according to the cost estimate produced by the [Congressional Budget Office](https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/) (CBO) for the enacted reconciliation bill.\n\n* This question is asking the amount that spending decreases, for example a decrease in spending of \\$1 billion would resolve this question as \\$1 billion.\n* The value used in the CBO report will be the total cost change for Medicaid, if available, or via summing the \"budget authority\" line items reported as changing direct spending for Medicaid, or the equivalent if CBO changes their reporting terminology. If Medicaid is combined with another program, such as the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), such that the portion considered to be Medicaid spending cannot be easily determined, such line items will be ignored for the purposes of this question, unless Metaculus determines at its sole discretion that the combined line items make up a sizeable share of the Medicaid spending in which case Metaculus may **annul** the question.\n* Metaculus may use reports from [credible sources](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/faq\/#definitions) of the CBO figures. In the event the CBO report is not available within three months after the passage of the bill, or in the event it is unclear how to sum Medicaid line items to arrive at the total Medicaid spending change, Metaculus may use reporting and estimates from other credible sources to resolve this question.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Medicaid Spending Cuts in the 2025 Reconciliation Bill\n\nAs of April 10, 2025, Congress has passed a budget resolution that sets the stage for a reconciliation bill with potentially significant impacts on Medicaid spending. Based on available information, I'll analyze the potential decrease in Medicaid spending from FY 2025 to FY 2034 that might result from the reconciliation process currently underway.\n\n## Current Status of the Reconciliation Process\n\nOn April 10, 2025, Republicans in Congress passed a concurrent budget resolution, providing reconciliation instructions to congressional committees[4]. This resolution establishes different reconciliation tracks for each chamber:\n\n- House committees are instructed to increase deficits by $2.3 trillion, with major cuts to Medicaid\n- Senate committees are instructed to increase deficits by approximately $5.8 trillion, without clear implications for Medicaid cuts[4]\n\nThe House Energy & Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid, is targeting a markup of their portion of the bill, with the chamber hoping to clear the legislation in May 2025[1]. The Senate Finance Committee also has jurisdiction over Medicaid spending[2].\n\n## Projected Medicaid Cuts\n\nThe most significant indicator of potential Medicaid cuts comes from the reconciliation instructions to the House Energy & Commerce Committee, which call for $880 billion in savings over the ten-year budget window[1][2]. According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis, the Committee cannot reach this target without making cuts to Medicaid or Medicare[2].\n\nSeveral key factors suggest that Medicaid will bear the brunt of these cuts:\n\n1. **Limited Alternative Options**: When both Medicare and Medicaid are excluded, the Energy & Commerce Committee oversees only $581 billion in total spending\u2014far less than the $880 billion target for cuts[2].\n\n2. **Medicaid's Budget Share**: Medicaid accounts for $8.2 trillion of the $8.8 trillion total funding under the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction over 10 years, representing approximately 93% of their budget authority[2].\n\n3. **Required Magnitude**: To reach the $880 billion savings target, the changes to Medicaid would have to be significant[2].\n\n## Potential Approaches to Medicaid Cuts\n\nBased on the information available as of April 10, 2025, several policy options are being considered to achieve these Medicaid savings:\n\n1. **Reducing Federal Matching Rates for Expansion**: The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion allows states to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Currently, the federal government covers 90% of these costs, compared to approximately 70% for traditional Medicaid. Reducing this higher federal matching rate is one approach being considered[1].\n\n2. **Capping Payments to States**: Another approach under discussion involves capping payments to states based on the number of enrollees[1].\n\n3. **Establishing Spending Limits for Expansion Population**: This approach would set caps on federal spending for the Medicaid expansion population, potentially resulting in 3.3 million people losing coverage[5].\n\n## Contextualizing the $880 Billion Target\n\nTo put the $880 billion in potential federal Medicaid cuts in context:\n\n- This represents approximately $88 billion per year over the ten-year budget window\n- These cuts would represent 29% of state-financed Medicaid spending per resident[3]\n\n## Reconciliation Timeline and Process\n\nThe House hopes to clear the reconciliation legislation in May 2025, sending it to the Senate with a goal of final passage by July 4, 2025[1]. However, significant differences between the House and Senate approaches may complicate this timeline.\n\nThe budget resolution allows for total deficit increases of nearly $6 trillion, reflecting the assumption that Congress can use a \"current policy baseline,\" meaning they don't need to pay for extending expiring tax cuts (which cost $4.5 trillion)[4]. It requires House committees to offset the tax cuts by at least $1.7 trillion, but only $4 billion in spending cuts for Senate committees[4].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors create uncertainty in forecasting the exact amount of Medicaid cuts:\n\n1. **House-Senate Differences**: The significant differences between House and Senate reconciliation instructions may lead to protracted negotiations.\n\n2. **Committee Discretion**: While the $880 billion target is clear, the specific mechanisms for achieving these cuts remain under development.\n\n3. **Political Considerations**: The impact of Medicaid cuts on millions of Americans may influence the final legislation.\n\nBased on the available information as of April 10, 2025, the most likely forecast is that the reconciliation bill will aim to decrease total Medicaid spending by approximately $880 billion from FY 2025 to FY 2034, though the final amount could be modified during negotiations between the House and Senate.\n\n## References\n\n1.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the NATO defence spending target agreed upon at the 2025 NATO summit between July 24-26, 2025.\n\nIf the target agreed upon is not one of the values listed, this question will resolve as the highest value that is lower than the agreed upon target.\n\nIf there is a targeted range (such as 3-4%) the lower end of the range will be used.\n\nIf there is no new target, or the target is lowered, this question will resolve as **2 or lower**.\n\nFuture targets (such as \"by 2030\") will be included in this question. If there are multiple targets for different dates, the highest of these will be used.\n\nIf different targets for each country are introduced, this question will resolve as the lowest target for any member state. If targets are determined by mathematical operation, such as based upon GDP, this question will use the lowest effective target for any member state as of the summit.\n\nIf the NATO summit is delayed or relocated that will not impact this question, unless it is delayed to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be **annulled**.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Since 2006, NATO\u2019s official defence spending target has been 2% of GDP for each member state, reaffirmed after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014[1][3].\n- By 2024, 22-23 out of 32 NATO members had met or exceeded the 2% target, a significant increase from only three in 2014, largely due to heightened security concerns following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine[3].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policy Shifts\n\n- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has stated that members will need to spend \u201cconsiderably more than 3 percent\u201d of GDP on defence, signaling a clear intent to raise the target above the longstanding 2% benchmark[4].\n- There is growing consensus among NATO officials and analysts that the 2% target is outdated and insufficient to meet current security challenges[1][4].\n- The US, under President Trump, has demanded a 5% of GDP target, but this has been met with resistance from key European allies, notably Germany, who argue that such a level is too costly[4].\n- Policy analysis and reporting indicate that the most likely scenario for the 2025 NATO summit is agreement on a new defence spending floor of 3.5% of GDP[3].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Multiple sources, including statements from the NATO Secretary General and reputable policy analysis, converge on the likelihood of a new target set at or above 3%, with 3.5% cited as the most probable figure for the 2025 summit[3][4].\n- Calls for a 3% threshold are widespread, but the push for \u201cconsiderably more than 3 percent\u201d and the specific mention of 3.5% in summit scenario planning make 3.5% the most authoritative forecast[1][3][4].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- While the US push for a 5% target is significant, it is unlikely to be adopted due to strong European opposition and practical constraints on rapid increases in defence spending[4].\n- If a range is set (e.g., 3\u20134%), the lower end (3%) would be used per the resolution criteria, but current signals point to a specific floor rather than a range.\n- Final agreement depends on political negotiations at the summit, and unforeseen geopolitical developments could still influence the outcome.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on available evidence and authoritative statements as of May 2025, the most likely defence spending target to be agreed upon at the 2025 NATO summit is **3.5% of GDP**.\n\n## References\n\n- [1].

        "18":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill OpenAI announce a GPT-5 AI model in 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn March 14, 2023, OpenAI announced its GPT-4 model. On May 13, 2024, OpenAI released GPT-4o, highlighting improvements to vision and reasoning capabilities. In February 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a roadmap that included details about the GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 models. OpenAI plans to integrate several technologies into GPT-5, promising a more unified and capable system. Although exact dates were not given, it was mentioned that the launch could occur in \"[ <u>weeks\/months<\/u> ](https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2025\/02\/12\/openai-chatgpt-roadmap-gpt5)\".\n\n There has been speculation about possible advancements in GPT-5, including improved multimodal capabilities, increased processing efficiency, and better adaptability in real-world applications. OpenAI has also focused on refining AI alignment and safety measures, which may impact the timing of GPT-5\u2019s release. But the competitive landscape for AI models continues to evolve rapidly, so new systems are expected to launch quickly.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will be answered **Yes** if, before January 1, 2026, OpenAI publishes a paper (e.g., a blog post, article, or video, but not a tweet) announcing the existence of GPT-5.\n\n\u2022 For the purposes of this question, GPT-5 will be considered to exist if the OpenAI published paper describes some GPT-5 performance results or indicates that GPT-5 has been built. A reference to progress in training or development of GPT-5 will not be sufficient on its own. If OpenAI publishes some GPT-5 performance results and states that GPT-5 is still in some form of training or testing, this question will be resolved as **Yes**.\n\n \u2022 The model must be announced by OpenAI or any entity that legally acquires or merges with OpenAI.\n\n \u2022 If OpenAI does not explicitly refer to a potentially qualified model as GPT-5, Metaculus may determine whether the model is generally considered to be the successor to GPT-4 that was previously described as GPT-5.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting OpenAI's GPT-5 Announcement in 2025\n\nBased on information available as of February 27, 2025, there are several key indicators suggesting OpenAI is likely to announce GPT-5 in 2025.\n\n## Historical Context and Current Status\n\nOpenAI has established a pattern of releasing increasingly capable AI models, with GPT-4 announced on March 14, 2023, and GPT-4o released on May 13, 2024. This progression suggests the company maintains approximately a 12-15 month development cycle between major model releases.\n\nAs of February 2025, OpenAI has already released information about their roadmap that explicitly mentions GPT-5, indicating that the model is actively in development and part of their near-term release strategy.[1]\n\n## Recent Announcements\n\nOn February 12, 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made significant announcements regarding the company's roadmap:\n\n- OpenAI plans to release GPT-4.5 (codenamed \"Orion\") \"within weeks\"[3]\n- GPT-5 is scheduled to be released \"within months\"[3]\n- GPT-5 will integrate multiple technologies, including o3[1]\n- The company is unifying its o-series models and GPT-series models[3]\n- GPT-4.5 will be the last \"non-chain-of-thought model\" before GPT-5[3]\n\nAltman also outlined the planned access tiers for GPT-5:\n- Free tier users will get unlimited chat access at standard intelligence\n- Plus subscribers will access higher intelligence settings\n- Pro subscribers will have access to the highest intelligence settings[3]\n\n## Authoritative Sources\n\nThe primary authoritative source for this information is OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself, who made these announcements through official channels. The roadmap update was shared on February 12, 2025, providing clear intentions regarding GPT-5's development timeline.[3]\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nDespite these announcements, several uncertainties remain:\n\n1. No specific release date has been provided beyond \"within months\"\n2. Technical challenges could potentially delay the release\n3. OpenAI has previously adjusted roadmaps and timelines\n4. The exact capabilities and improvements in GPT-5 remain unspecified\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the available information as of February 27, 2025, it appears highly likely that OpenAI will announce GPT-5 in 2025. Sam Altman's statement that GPT-5 would be released \"within months\" of February 12, 2025, strongly suggests an announcement sometime in mid-to-late 2025, barring any significant delays or changes in strategy.\n\nThe company has clearly positioned GPT-5 as their next major model release after GPT-4.5, with specific plans for its deployment across different subscription tiers, indicating advanced preparation for its launch.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "19":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill TikTok still be available in the United States on December 31, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCongress has passed a law requiring TikTok to shut down or sell to a non-CPC affiliated entity within 9 months, with a possible 3 month extension for a sale in progress. Original house version of the bill [here](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/118th-congress\/house-bill\/7521\/text) (the senate folded it into a larger piece of legislation). In legal terms, congress is defining TikTok as a \"foreign adversary controlled application\". ByteDance is challenging the bill and [has indicated](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/bytedance-prefers-tiktok-shutdown-us-if-legal-options-fail-sources-say-2024-04-25\/) it would shut down rather than sell.\n\nThis question is about whether the service will continue to exist as a result of this bill passing, and in what form. It is possible that ByteDance will maintain ownership, for example via legal challenges to the bill. If ByteDance does comply is it not clear whether they would shut the service down or sell to a non-CPC entity.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nResolves to \"Yes, still owned by foreign adversary\" if TikTok is available in the US on December 31 2025, and the US app continues to be owned by ByteDance or another Chinese or foreign adversary firm contrary to the divestment written in the letter of the law. \"Ownership\" here is defined the way the law does, such that it is deemed to be \"controlled by\" a foreign adversary. If courts make a ruling about its status, that decision will apply, otherwise it will be based on reading of the law as passed. Details in fine print.\n\nResolves to \"Yes, non-adversary owner\" if TikTok is available in the US on December 31 2025, but the US app is no longer owned by ByteDance or any other firm headquartered in China, including Hong Kong or Macau but not Taiwan, or a foreign adversary. In the event that TikTok is sold to a company in another country that is deemed a US adversary, it will resolve to \"Yes, still owned by foreign adversary\"\n\nResolves to \"No\" otherwise.\n\n\"Available\" means a video streaming app with at least 50% of the current US TikTok user base and at least 50% of the current TikTok content library is available for download to US users on the Google Play store or the Apple app store. If TikTok is renamed but these conditions hold then it is deemed \"available.\" Changes to the TikTok algorithm do not affect this definition. The app must allow users to watch videos but changes to other app features such as users' ability to upload content or make comments do not affect this definition.\n\nQuoting the law: \"An entity \u201ccontrolled by a foreign adversary\u201d means an individual or entity that is:\n(A) a foreign person domiciled in, is headquartered in, has its principal place of business in, or is organized under the laws of a foreign adversary country;\n(B) an entity with respect to which a foreign person or combination of foreign persons described in (A) directly or indirectly own at least a 20 percent stake; or\n(C) a person subject to the direction or control of a foreign person or entity described in (A) or (B).\"\n\nDefinition of foreign adversary: \"\u201cForeign adversary countries\u201d are those specified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4872(d)(2), which currently includes the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of North Korea, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and the Islamic Republic of Iran.\" The list of countries at time of resolution will be used.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- In early 2024, Congress passed a law compelling ByteDance to divest TikTok\u2019s US operations to a non-foreign adversary entity within nine months, with a possible three-month extension if a sale is in progress[3].\n- ByteDance challenged the law on constitutional grounds, but the US Supreme Court upheld the ban in January 2025, requiring TikTok to cease operations in the US by January 19, 2025, unless sold to an approved owner[1][2][3].\n- Following the Supreme Court decision, TikTok briefly ceased operations, but executive orders from President Trump have twice delayed actual enforcement, pushing the deadline into the spring and then summer of 2025[2][3][4].\n- As of May 2025, TikTok remains available for US users, but the company\u2019s legal avenues are exhausted, and further extensions would require additional executive or legislative intervention.\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The Supreme Court\u2019s January 2025 decision eliminated the main legal avenue for ByteDance to retain ownership[1][2][3].\n- President Trump\u2019s executive orders have temporarily delayed enforcement but do not alter the requirement for divestment or shutdown[2][3][4].\n- ByteDance has publicly indicated its preference to shut down the US service rather than sell if legal options are exhausted, though some uncertainty remains about whether a buyer will emerge or a last-minute deal will be struck[2].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Supreme Court decision upholding the TikTok ban: NYU, January 2025[1].\n- Timeline and executive orders affecting enforcement: TechTarget, March 2025[3]; People, March 2025[2].\n- ByteDance\u2019s public statements and ongoing sale negotiations: Reuters (not directly cited in search results due to date, but referenced in question background).\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- ByteDance\u2019s final decision\u2014whether to sell or shut down\u2014remains uncertain, though public statements suggest a shutdown is more likely if pressured to divest[2].\n- The possibility of further executive or legislative intervention cannot be ruled out, but no new legal avenues currently exist post-Supreme Court ruling.\n- There is inherent uncertainty in predicting the outcome of ongoing business negotiations or the emergence of a last-minute buyer.\n- Enforcement actions by the US government and compliance by app stores will be crucial to determining actual US availability.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- The most likely outcome, based on current facts, is that TikTok will not be available in the US on December 31, 2025, unless ByteDance finds a buyer accepted by US authorities.\n- If TikTok is available, it is highly unlikely it will still be owned by ByteDance or any other entity deemed a \"foreign adversary\" under US law, due to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling and lack of further legal recourse[1][3].\n- The scenario in which TikTok is still available but owned by ByteDance is extremely low probability barring unforeseen political or legal changes.\n- The most plausible outcomes are:\n  - \"No\" (service unavailable in the US), or\n  - \"Yes, non-adversary owner\" (service available, but sold to a US or allied entity).\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Outcome                           | Probability (as of May 2025) | Key Factors                                                    |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Yes, still owned by foreign adversary | Very low (<5%)               | Supreme Court ruling, law prohibits this outcome                |\n| Yes, non-adversary owner             | Low-moderate (20\u201340%)         | Dependent on successful sale to US\/aligned entity               |\n| No                                  | High (60\u201380%)                 | ByteDance likely to shut down if unable\/unwilling to sell       |\n\n## References\n1.

        "20":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nIn 2025, will the domestic content requirements become mandatory for obtaining the IRA's Production Tax Credits (45Y)?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn August 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which [expanded](https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/green-power-markets\/summary-inflation-reduction-act-provisions-related-renewable-energy) the production tax credits (PTC) for wind and geothermal-generated electricity to cover most renewable sources and extended them through 2032. The IRA also established a [domestic content bonus credit](https:\/\/www.akingump.com\/en\/insights\/alerts\/irs-updates-ptc-and-itc-domestic-content-bonus-guidance) of up to 10% for projects whose steel\/iron and a specific percentage of their components were made in the US.\n\nIn the wake of the 2024 US elections, Republicans took control of both Houses of Congress and the White House, with President Donald Trump [having expressed interest](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/articles\/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta\/#the-ira-under-the-incoming-republican-white-house-and-congress) in reducing IRA spending. At the time of this question, congressional Republicans were working on a budget reconciliation bill to possibly enact tax and spending changes to the federal budget (see the Tax Foundation's updated [Budget Reconciliation tracker](https:\/\/taxfoundation.org\/research\/all\/federal\/trump-tax-cuts-2025-budget-reconciliation\/)).\n\nIt is important to note that in the House of Representatives, the Republicans hold a slim majority of 220 to 213. In March 2025, a group of 21 Republican representatives [sent a letter](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits\/) to House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith to urge him to phase out rather than eliminate the clean energy incentives of the IRA. House Speaker Mike Johnson [told reporters](https:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/energy-environment\/5167829-johnson-inflation-reduction-act-ira-climate-tax-infrastructure\/), in regard to repealing clean energy tax credits among other policies, \"It\u2019ll be somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.\" It's important to note, too, that reconciliation bills do not always succeed. In July 2017, for example, Senator John McCain famously [cast](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/07\/27\/us\/politics\/senate-health-care-vote.html) a decisive No vote to a reconciliation bill that would have repealed parts of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2026, a federal bill is enacted that makes the [existing requirements](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-drop\/n-23-38.pdf) for the domestic content bonus credit mandatory for the Production Tax Credits (PTC) described in [26 U.S. Code \u00a7 45Y](https:\/\/energycommunities.gov\/funding-opportunity\/clean-electricity-production-tax-credit-26-u-s-code-%C2%A4-45y\/).\n\n* If the domestic content requirements change, this question will resolve as **Yes** if the new requirements are at least as strict as those established by the IRA.\n* The domestic requirements becoming mandatory for PTC only for specific categories will not resolve this question.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed in August 2022, expanded the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for renewable energy and introduced a domestic content bonus credit. This bonus increases the PTC by 10% if a project meets specific domestic content requirements for steel, iron, and manufactured products[1][2][3].\n- As of early 2025, the domestic content requirement is not mandatory for claiming the base PTC under Section 45Y. Instead, it remains an optional bonus: projects that meet the requirement receive a higher credit, but those that do not are still eligible for the standard PTC[1][2][3].\n- The IRS has issued multiple notices (most recently Notice 2025-08) providing guidance and safe harbors for calculating and substantiating the domestic content bonus, but these do not make the requirement mandatory for the base credit[3][5].\n\n### Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The IRS and Treasury have continued to update guidance on how to qualify for the domestic content bonus, including updated safe harbor tables and compliance requirements[3][5].\n- There is no indication in recent IRS or Treasury communications that the domestic content requirement will become mandatory for the PTC. All guidance continues to treat it as a bonus provision[3][5].\n- Politically, after the 2024 elections, Republicans control Congress and the White House. While there is discussion about modifying or phasing out clean energy incentives, there is no evidence of enacted legislation making domestic content mandatory for 45Y PTCs as of April 2025[1].\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- IRS official guidance on the domestic content bonus credit[2][3].\n- Congressional Research Service reports on the status of domestic content requirements for electricity tax credits[1].\n- Industry and legal analyses summarizing recent IRS and Treasury updates[3][5].\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The political environment is dynamic, and budget reconciliation bills could change tax credit structures. However, as of April 2025, no bill has been enacted making domestic content a mandatory requirement for the PTC.\n- IRS and Treasury guidance is subject to change, but all current updates focus on the bonus structure, not a mandatory requirement.\n- The slim Republican majority in the House and internal party divisions may limit the likelihood of sweeping changes to the IRA's credit structure in the near term.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs of April 2025, there is no factual basis to forecast that domestic content requirements will become mandatory for obtaining the IRA's Production Tax Credits (45Y) before January 1, 2026. The requirement remains an optional bonus, and no enacted federal legislation or regulatory guidance has made it mandatory for the base PTC.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n1.

        "21":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the 2024 mpox outbreak exceed the 2022-2023 outbreak in confirmed cases?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2022-2023 mpox (monkeypox) outbreak, caused by the Clade II variant, resulted in a total of 66,387 confirmed cases worldwide between the declaration of a [Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO)](https:\/\/www.who.int\/europe\/emergencies\/situations\/monkeypox) on July 23, 2022, and its termination on May 10, 2023.\n\nIn August 2024, concerns have been raised about a [new outbreak of mpox](https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/health\/health-news\/cdc-alerts-doctors-watch-strain-mpox-spreading-africa-rcna1654240), this time involving the more severe Clade I variant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WHO have issued alerts and are considering declaring another PHEIC. This question aims to compare the scale of the mpox outbreak.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as \"Yes\" if the total number of new confirmed mpox cases worldwide, as reported by [Our World in Data](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/mpox), during the 2024 PHEIC period (from the declaration date to the termination date or the question close date, whichever comes first) exceeds 66,387 (the total number of confirmed cases during the 2022-2023 PHEIC period).\n\nThe question will resolve as \"No\" if the total number of new confirmed mpox cases worldwide during the 2024 PHEIC period remains at or below 66,387.\nIf no PHEIC is declared for the 2024 mpox outbreak, the question will resolve as \"Ambiguous\".\n\n- The data used for this question comes from [Our World in Data's mpox dataset](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/mpox), using the \"Confirmed cases\" metric with a \"Cumulative\" frequency.\n\n- The total number of new confirmed cases during the 2024 PHEIC period will be calculated by subtracting the cumulative confirmed cases on the day before the PHEIC declaration from the cumulative confirmed cases on the PHEIC termination date or the question close date, whichever comes first.\n\n- The question will close 180 days after the WHO declares a PHEIC for the 2024 mpox outbreak, or on December 31, 2025, at 11:59 PM EDT, whichever comes first.\n\n- Confirmed cases from all mpox variants (including Clade I and Clade II) will be counted towards the total during the 2024 PHEIC period.\n\n- If Our World in Data stops updating mpox case numbers or becomes unavailable, an alternative reputable data source may be used, as determined by the question administrators.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The 2022\u20132023 global mpox outbreak (Clade II) led to 66,387 confirmed cases worldwide between July 23, 2022, and May 10, 2023, with most cases outside Central Africa and relatively low mortality.\n- In contrast, the 2024 outbreak, involving the more severe Clade I variant (notably Clade 1b), is centered in Central Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with limited but notable exportation to other regions[2][4][5].\n- As of September 2024, over 29,000 cases (confirmed or suspected) and more than 800 deaths have been reported globally, with the vast majority in Central Africa[2][5].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on August 14, 2024, in response to the escalating Clade I outbreak[5].\n- CDC and WHO have issued alerts regarding the increased severity and international spread potential of Clade I mpox[1][2].\n- Active surveillance and containment measures are underway, but under-reporting remains a significant challenge, especially in resource-limited settings[2][5].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) provide regular situation updates[2][3][4].\n- The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains a global mpox situation summary[1].\n- Our World in Data compiles global mpox case counts, as referenced in the question description.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Under-ascertainment and under-reporting in Central Africa likely mean the true burden of the 2024 outbreak is higher than reported[5].\n- The majority of cases and fatalities remain in Central Africa as of September 2024. There is limited evidence, at present, of widespread, sustained transmission in regions outside of Africa\u2014contrasting with the rapid global proliferation in 2022\u20132023[2][5].\n- If the outbreak spreads beyond Central Africa and international case numbers climb rapidly, the total could surpass the 2022\u20132023 confirmed case count. However, as of mid-September, the trajectory remains well below the 66,387 threshold[2][5].\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- Given the current trajectory, with approximately 29,000 confirmed or suspected cases globally less than two months into the PHEIC period, and considering substantial under-reporting, it is plausible that the 2024 outbreak could approach or exceed the 2022\u20132023 total if international transmission accelerates.\n- However, as of September 2024, the majority of cases remain concentrated in Central Africa, and there is not yet clear evidence of the kind of global amplification seen in 2022\u20132023.\n- Unless there is a significant increase in transmission outside Africa or a surge in confirmed case reporting from affected regions, the probability that the 2024 PHEIC period will exceed 66,387 confirmed cases by the close date remains moderate but not high.\n\n**Summary Table: Outbreak Comparison**\n\n| Outbreak Period         | Variant     | Confirmed Cases (to date) | Primary Affected Regions     | Case Fatality Rate |\n|------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 2022\u20132023 PHEIC        | Clade II    | 66,387                    | Global (esp. Europe, Americas)| <1%                |\n| 2024 PHEIC (as of Sep) | Clade I (1b)| ~29,000 (suspected\/confirmed)| Central Africa, limited export | ~3%                |\n\n**Conclusion:** As of mid-September 2024, the global confirmed case count for the 2024 mpox outbreak is substantially below the 2022\u20132023 total. The outbreak could surpass the previous total if international spread intensifies or reporting improves, but current trends suggest the probability of exceeding 66,387 confirmed cases remains moderate, with the primary driver being the potential for expanded transmission outside Central Africa[2][5].\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "22":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an AI system solve one of the remaining Millennium Prize Problems before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe [Millennium Prize Problems](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Millennium_Prize_Problems) are a set of seven of the most notorious unsolved problems in mathematics that were stated by the [Clay Mathematics Institute](https:\/\/www.claymath.org\/) in 2000. A correct solution to any of the problems results in a $1 million prize awarded by the institute.\n\nAs of now, only one of these problems, the [Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture](https:\/\/www.claymath.org\/millennium\/poincare-conjecture\/), has been solved by Grigori Perelman in 2003. The remaining six problems: Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, Hodge Conjecture, Navier\u2013Stokes Existence and Smoothness, Riemann Hypothesis, Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap, and P vs NP , still remain unsolved.\n\nThis question asks whether an AI system will be credit to have solved one of these remaining six Millennium Prize Problems by the end of June 2025.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThe question resolves **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a Millennium Prize Problem is solved by an AI.\n\nThe question will resolve upon announcement by the Clay Mathematics Institute, or when at least 2 reputable papers (e.g., on arXiv or in peer-reviewed journals) show a correct solution. If the solution is disputed or inconclusive, resolution may be postponed until a consensus is reached.\n\nThe question will resolve **Yes** if most of the major elements of the solution were primarily discovered by the AI. The contribution of humans should be limited to:\n\n- Creating the system\n- Feeding the system with previously established knowledge\n- Stating the problem in a form understandable to the AI\n- Converting the solution into a form understandable by humans\n- Other tasks unrelated to the core of the solution.\n\nThe AI should be understood broadly as any computation system that is not human.\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Of the seven Millennium Prize Problems established by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, only the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture has been solved (by a human, Grigori Perelman, in 2003)[1][2].\n- The remaining six problems\u2014Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, Hodge Conjecture, Navier\u2013Stokes Existence and Smoothness, Riemann Hypothesis, Yang\u2013Mills Existence and Mass Gap, and P vs NP\u2014remain unsolved, with no credible claims of solutions (by AI or humans) as of June 2023[1][2][4].\n- AI has made progress in assisting mathematical research: systems have contributed to conjectures and proofs in specific, often more accessible domains (e.g., combinatorics, knot theory), but have not autonomously solved major open problems in pure mathematics[5].\n\n### Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- No announcements from the Clay Mathematics Institute indicate any changes to the prize conditions or procedures to specifically accommodate AI-generated solutions[1].\n- There are no credible reports as of June 2023 of an AI system being credited with the independent solution of any of the six remaining Millennium Prize Problems[2][3].\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The Clay Mathematics Institute's official Millennium Problems webpage serves as the definitive authority for problem status and solution announcements[1].\n- Reputable mathematical journals and preprint servers (e.g., arXiv) are required for public verification of any claimed solution, with independent expert consensus as a prerequisite for acceptance.\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The requirement that the AI be primarily responsible for the \"core of the solution\" sets a high bar and excludes routine computational assistance.\n- While rapid progress in AI capabilities is ongoing, the leap from contributing to mathematical research to autonomously solving a Millennium Prize Problem remains unprecedented and highly uncertain.\n- Measurement is straightforward: a resolution occurs only if the Clay Mathematics Institute or two reputable independent sources affirm a peer-reviewed or broadly accepted solution, with clear attribution to AI.\n\n### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the lack of precedent, the formidable difficulty of the problems, the high standards for what counts as an AI-derived solution, and the absence of any credible indicators of imminent success, the probability that an AI system will solve any of the remaining Millennium Prize Problems before July 2025 is extremely low\u2014likely less than 1%.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.

        "23":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWhat will happen next concerning the repeal of the 45X clean energy manufacturing tax credit of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit is a tax credit ([IRS](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/advanced-manufacturing-production-credit)) for domestic production in the United States of [components](https:\/\/www.plantemoran.com\/explore-our-thinking\/insight\/2023\/09\/understanding-the-section-45x-tax-credit-for-manufacturers) of clean energy, such as inverters for solar panels, blades of wind turbines, and electrode materials for batteries. 45X was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which had a goal of creating a thriving, rapidly-growing clean energy sector. The role of 45X is to help the upstream manufacturers, to help ensure that a rapidly-growing sectors such as solar would have the equipment it needed to meet demand, since tax credits boost after-tax profits and thus reduce the cost of capital.&#x20;\n\nWith solar manufacturing for example, a factory making a 2 gigawatts per year, considered a modest-sized plant, could generate an annual tax credit of \\$140 million, [according to Utility Dive](https:\/\/www.utilitydive.com\/news\/us-treasury-irs-releases-detailed-guidance-on-45X-clean-energy-tax-credits\/702691\/). This spurred a surge in investments in clean energy component manufacturing; in the year following the IRA being enacted, the clean energy manufacturing sector announced over \\$140 billion in new investments, which was double the amount in the two years before the IRA's enactment.\n\nIn November 2024, Donald Trump was elected president, along with Republican majorities in the House and Senate, with the [aim](https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/opinion\/msnbc-opinion\/trump-second-term-biden-climate-change-rcna126810) to \"maximize fossil fuel production\" according to a Trump campaign official, who added, \"Some of the price tags involved with some of these credits seem to be wildly understated... We\u2019d be looking to cut a lot of that spending.\"&#x20;\n\nAt the time of this question, Republicans in the House and Senate are working on budget reconciliation, a parliamentary procedure in the US that allows tax and spending bills to be passed with a simple majority. In the House Republicans have a slim 7-seat majority, and recently 21 Republican representatives [wrote a letter ](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2025\/03\/10\/house-republican-clean-energy-tax-breaks-00218126)to the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee warning that they would oppose eliminating the clean energy incentives. According to Politico:\n\n> The growing pushback against eliminating the IRA\u2019s hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and other incentives \u2014 which have largely [benefited GOP-controlled districts](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2023\/08\/13\/biden-inflation-reduction-act-climate-states-00110940) \u2014 will complicate efforts by House Republicans to slash federal outlays without shrinking Medicaid spending as they seek to offset the tax cuts in their budget bill.\n\n> \u201cWe need the projects that are currently under development to be brought online so we can continue the President\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda,\u201d added Garbarino, who previously led a letter last fall with 17 other Republicans urging leadership not to gut the credits. \u201cThese \\[credits] are helping the president accomplish what he said he wanted to do in his campaign, and that was to make America an energy dominant country.\u201d\n\n> Up until now, Republicans haven\u2019t detailed how far they are willing to go to protect these credits as Trump seeks to dismantle former President Joe Biden\u2019s climate agenda, even as other members have loudly [balked about cuts to Medicaid](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2025\/02\/24\/medicaid-gop-cuts-republicans-congress-00205542).\n\nGOP lawmakers have expressed concerns that companies have already made investments for various projects, and that therefore their preference would be to phase out credits such as 45X earlier rather than do a full and immediate repeal. 45X has in particular received strong GOP support, with Republican Congressman Bob Latta of Ohio [saying](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/can-the-ira-manufacturing-tax-credit-be-saved\/), \"Domestic manufacturing is a big priority for us, and it seems that particular credit is helping with that. We have to figure out some of the things that are working in the IRA.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the outcome that is enacted next, before January 1, 2026, with respect to the planned start of the phase-out of the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit ([26 U.S. Code \u00a7 45X](https:\/\/energycommunities.gov\/funding-opportunity\/advanced-manufacturing-production-credit-26-u-s-code-%C2%A4-45x\/)), when it pays out 100% of the credit value (explained further in the Fine Print).\n\nThe outcomes are defined as follows:\n\n**2025-2026 sunset.** The planned phase-out date of 45X is moved to 2026 (meaning the final year of receiving 100% of the credit value is 2025) or 45X is fully repealed, effective either in 2026 or 2025.\n\n**2027 sunset.** The planned phase-out date of 45X is moved to 2027 (meaning the final year of receiving 100% of the credit value is 2026).\n\n**2028 sunset.** The planned phase-out date of 45X is moved to 2028 (meaning the final year of receiving 100% of the credit value is 2027).\n\n**2029 sunset.** The planned phase-out date of 45X is moved to 2029 (meaning the final year of receiving 100% of the credit value is 2028).\n\nIf no legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026 that reduces the planned phase-out date of 45X, this question will resolve as **No sunset reduction before 2026**.\n\nThe IRS [has defined](https:\/\/www.faegredrinker.com\/en\/insights\/publications\/2023\/12\/department-of-treasury-issues-guidance-on-section-45x-production-tax-credit) the credit amount to begin phasing out in 2030, with the following schedule:\n\n* 2030 \u2013 eligible entities can claim 75% of the credit value.\n* 2031 \u2013 eligible entities can claim 50% of the credit value.\n* 2032 \u2013 eligible entities can claim 25% of the credit value.\n* 2033 \u2013  full phase out.\n\nThe question will resolve immediately once the criteria for any outcome are met, even if later developments would satisfy the criteria of another outcome.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to incentivize domestic production of clean energy components, such as solar inverters, wind turbine blades, and battery materials[3][4][5].\n- The credit has been a major catalyst for investment: over $140 billion in new clean energy manufacturing investments were announced in the year following the IRA\u2019s enactment, double the amount in the two years prior.\n- The credit is currently scheduled to begin phasing out in 2030, with a gradual reduction until it is fully phased out in 2033[1].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Political Developments\n\n- In November 2024, Republicans won the presidency and majorities in both the House and Senate, with a stated agenda to roll back clean energy tax credits and prioritize fossil fuel production.\n- Despite this, there is significant Republican opposition to a full or immediate repeal of 45X. At least 21 House Republicans have warned leadership they would oppose eliminating clean energy incentives, noting that many GOP districts have benefited from these credits and that abrupt repeal would harm ongoing projects and domestic manufacturing[3][4].\n- Some Republicans have expressed a preference for an earlier phase-out rather than immediate repeal, to protect investments already made and maintain support for domestic manufacturing.\n- The budget reconciliation process is being used to attempt changes, but the slim House majority and intra-party divisions make a rapid or total repeal uncertain.\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The IRS and Department of Energy provide official guidance on the 45X credit\u2019s eligibility and phase-out schedule[2][5].\n- Industry and policy analysis confirm the scale of investment and the political dynamics at play[3][4].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The outcome depends on ongoing legislative negotiations, which are subject to change based on political pressure, lobbying, and shifting alliances within the Republican caucus.\n- No specific legislation has yet been enacted to change the 45X phase-out schedule, and public statements suggest a lack of consensus on the exact approach.\n- Measurement of the outcome is straightforward: it will be determined by the next enacted legislation affecting the phase-out date before January 1, 2026.\n\n## Forecast\n\nGiven the current facts:\n- There is strong Republican intent to reduce or repeal clean energy tax credits, but also significant intra-party resistance to a full or immediate repeal of 45X.\n- The most likely near-term outcomes are either a negotiated earlier phase-out (such as a 2025-2026 or 2027 sunset) or legislative gridlock resulting in no change before 2026.\n- The probability of a full and immediate repeal is reduced by the public opposition from a notable bloc of House Republicans and the direct benefits to their districts.\n\n**In summary:** The most likely next development is either a negotiated earlier phase-out (potentially a 2025-2026 or 2027 sunset) or no legislative change before 2026. The situation remains fluid and subject to ongoing negotiations.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- [1].

It is technology-neutral, meaning it offers the incentive to any form of electrical production that does not on net create carbon emissions, such as wind, solar, nuclear and geothermal. According to [Crux Climate](https:\/\/www.cruxclimate.com\/insights\/tech-neutral-tax-credits):\n\n> The \u00a745Y tax credit value is determined per unit of electricity production. The base value of the \u00a745Y credit mirrors the legacy \u00a745 PTC, at 0.3 cents per KWh (adjusted for inflation), increased to 1.5 cents per KWh for facilities that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PWA) standards.\n\n> Companies can increase the value of the \u00a745Y tax credit by siting a project in a designated energy community, satisfying [domestic content adder](https:\/\/www.cruxclimate.com\/insights\/domestic-content-safe-harbor) requirements, and\/or qualifying for a [low-income bonus](https:\/\/www.cruxclimate.com\/insights\/low-income-community-bonus-credit-begins-today) for projects smaller than 5MWac. The value of each bonus adder increases the base value (either 0.3 cents or 1.5 cents) by 10%, except for certain low-income bonuses, which increase the value by 20%.\n\nAn analysis by Rhodium Group [estimated](https:\/\/rhg.com\/research\/tech-neutral-tax-credits-electric-power\/) that that clean energy tax credits including 45Y could drive 146 to 308 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy generation capacity in America's electrical grid by 2030 and 259-648 GWs by 2035.&#x20;\n\nIn the 2022 general election, Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. They made [several attempts](https:\/\/climatepower.us\/research-polling\/inflation-reduction-act-repeal-votes-tracker\/) to repeal various parts of the IRA, including clean energy tax credits such as 45Y, although it is important to note that most were symbolic efforts since Democrats controlled the Senate and the White House. According to the [Brookings Institution](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/articles\/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta\/):\n\n> Republican lawmakers have cited the cost of the IRA as one of the reasons to roll it back\u2014for example, the House Committee on Ways and Means has [highlighted](https:\/\/gop-waysandmeans.house.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/230421-Two-Pager-Green-Energy-Credits-FINAL.pdf) the \u201cexploding\u201d cost of \u201cgreen corporate welfare\u201d under the IRA.

Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term. Brookings continues:\n\n> While it is easier for the IRA to be repealed under a Republican trifecta, it may be difficult to build a sufficiently large coalition in Congress to repeal the full IRA, as Republican lawmakers may prefer to retain certain IRA incentives that benefit their constituents. In August 2024, 18 Republican House Representatives [signed](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2024\/08\/25\/republican-fight-inflation-reduction-act-00176223) a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) that asked for the IRA\u2019s energy tax credits to be \u201cspared\u201d from attempts to repeal the IRA. A Senior Tax Policy Advisor on the Senate Finance Committee also [noted](https:\/\/tax.thomsonreuters.com\/news\/senate-tax-advisor-new-energy-credits-likely-safe-from-full-repeal-in-2025\/) that a full repeal of clean energy tax incentives is unlikely regardless of the election results, as some parts of the IRA received bipartisan support before its enactment, which was expected to continue.\n\n> Republican-held areas have benefitted from the IRA since its enactment, as [more than half](https:\/\/e2.org\/reports\/clean-economy-works-two-year-review-2024\/) of announced clean energy and vehicle projects are located in Republican congressional districts. According to the Rhodium Group and MIT\u2019s [Clean Investment Monitor](https:\/\/www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org\/database), Nevada and Wyoming had the highest level of actual clean investment as a percent of GDP between September 2023 and September 2024 \u2013 with 2.65% and 4.11% respectively. Nevada, Kentucky, and Georgia had the highest levels of actual clean manufacturing investment as a percent of GDP over the same period, with 1.1% for Georgia and Kentucky, and 1.2% for Nevada. In terms of federal investments, the most populous states, such as California and Texas, [received](https:\/\/www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org\/reports\/tallying-the-two-year-impact-of-the-inflation-reduction-act) the most dollars. However, Nevada and Wyoming received the most federal investments per capita, as well as relative to the size of their GDP. This includes federal tax credits, grants, and fiscal cost of loans and loan guarantees.\n\n> The Political Economy Research Institute (University of Massachusetts Amherst) [projected](https:\/\/peri.umass.edu\/images\/publication\/BIL_IRA_CHIPS_9-18-23-1.pdf) that the IRA could have an employment impact of creating 848,728 jobs annually, across industries. Clean Jobs America [estimated](https:\/\/cleanjobsamerica.e2.org\/) that there has been an increase of 14% in clean energy workers since the enactment of the IRA in August 2022,[<sup>2<\/sup>]() with 3.5 million workers in clean energy. Many of these jobs are in California (544,604 jobs), Texas (268,035 jobs), and New York (173,731 jobs).\n\nIn addition to a repeal of 45Y, another possibility would be earlier sunsets of the tax credit, which currently benefits energy production facilities placed into service after 2024 and before 2032. For that reason, as a \"[thoughtful](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits\/)\" alternative the 2032 phase-out might be moved to an earlier year. Phase-out starts the latter of 2032 or when America's GHG emissions from electricity are \u226425% of 2022 emissions. Additionally, there is a [safe harbor](https:\/\/www.solarpowerworldonline.com\/2025\/01\/what-does-safe-harboring-mean-for-the-solar-industry\/) for clean energy projects, which grandfathers in projects that have begun before the phase-out date, as long as the project has met certain thresholds, and a repeal of 45Y or earlier sunset might be mitigated by including a safe harbor possibility to protect investments.&#x20;\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the outcome that is enacted next, before January 1, 2026, with respect to the planned start of the phase-out of the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit ([26 U.S. Code \u00a7 45Y](https:\/\/energycommunities.gov\/funding-opportunity\/clean-electricity-production-tax-credit-26-u-s-code-%C2%A4-45y\/)).\n\nThe outcomes are defined as follows:\n\n**2025-2026 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Y is moved to 2025 or 2026 or 45Y is fully repealed, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2025-2026 sunset w\/ safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Y is moved to 2025 or 2026 or 45Y is fully repealed, but with a safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2027-2028 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Y is moved to 2027 or 2028, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2027-2028 sunset w\/ safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Y is moved to 2027 or 2028, but with a safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2029-2031 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Y is moved to 2029, 2030, or 2031, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2029-2031 sunset w\/ safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Y is moved to 2029, 2030, or 2031, but with a safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\nIf no legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026 that reduces the planned phase-out date of 45Y or repeals it, this question will resolve as **No sunset reduction before 2026**.\n\n* The current law alternatively sunsets when greenhouse gas emissions of the United States are less than or equal to 25% of 2022 emissions. This question concerns the scheduled year; if the greenhouse gas emission threshold changes but the scheduled sunset year remains 2032 then it will not count, even if the stated purpose or effective outcome is an earlier phasing out of 45Y.\n* For the purposes of this question, a safe harbor must grandfather in most projects that are ongoing at the time of enactment.\n* The question will resolve immediately once the criteria for any outcome are met, even if later developments would satisfy the criteria of another outcome.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# The 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit: Current Status and Future Outlook\n\nThe Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (Section 45Y) is a newly established, technology-neutral production tax credit that replaces the Energy Production Tax Credit[3]. As of May 2025, this credit is in its early implementation phase, having been recently formalized through final regulations published on January 15, 2025[1].\n\n## Current Status of the 45Y Credit\n\nThe 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit provides financial incentives for clean electricity generation with the following key features:\n\n- **Credit Value**: The base credit amount is 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour of clean electricity, which increases to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met[5].\n\n- **Eligibility**: The credit applies to qualified facilities that:\n  - Are owned by the taxpayer\n  - Generate electricity\n  - Are placed in service after 2024\n  - Have a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rate not greater than zero[5]\n\n- **Bonus Credits**: The base credit can be increased by:\n  - 10% for projects meeting certain domestic content requirements for steel, iron, and manufactured products\n  - 10% for projects located in energy communities[2]\n\n- **Direct Pay and Transferability**: The credit offers direct pay options for tax-exempt organizations, states, political subdivisions, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Indian Tribal governments, Alaska Native Corporations, and rural electricity co-ops. It also includes transferability provisions[2].\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n\nThe 45Y credit is designed to support clean electricity production facilities placed in service after 2024[5]. This represents a transition from previous renewable energy tax credits to a technology-neutral approach that focuses on zero-emission electricity generation regardless of the specific technology used.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury has released final rules for these technology-neutral clean electricity credits, along with a list of qualifying technologies[2]. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also published guidance on the credit[3].\n\n## Limitations in Current Information\n\nBased on the available search results, there is limited information about specific legislative efforts to repeal or modify the 45Y credit as of May 2025. The search results do not provide details about:\n\n1. Current congressional actions targeting the 45Y credit\n2. Specific proposals to modify the sunset provisions\n3. Political positions on maintaining or altering the credit\n4. Economic impact assessments of potential changes to the credit\n\n## Verification Sources\n\nThe implementation of the 45Y credit can be verified through:\n\n1. The Federal Register publication of final regulations dated January 15, 2025[1]\n2. The IRS guidance on the Clean Electricity Production Credit[3]\n3. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's final rules for technology-neutral clean electricity credits[2]\n\n## Measurement and Implementation Challenges\n\nWhile the credit structure is clearly defined, several implementation challenges exist:\n\n- Determining and verifying the GHG emissions rate of facilities\n- Ensuring compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements\n- Coordinating with other tax credits to prevent double-dipping (the credit cannot be claimed alongside the \u00a748E ITC for the same facility)[5]\n\nThe search results do not provide sufficient information to forecast specific political actions regarding the potential repeal or modification of the sunset provisions of the 45Y credit before January 1, 2026.\n\nReferences:\n1.

        "25":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill  an attempt be made to fire Jerome Powell before the end of his term?\n\nQuestion background:\nJerome Powell, [Chair of the Board of Governors](https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/aboutthefed\/bios\/board\/powell.htm) of the Federal Reserve System also known as the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), was nominated by President Donald Trump in November 2017, and his nomination was confirmed by the US Senate the following January in a bipartisan 84-13 vote. In November 2021, Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden for second term, which passed the Senate 80-19. In addititon to his role as FRB Chair, Powell is also Chairman of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/fomc.asp) (FOMC), which determines the [fed funds rate](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/federalfundsrate.asp) (which impacts interest rates), and began serving both roles in February 2018. Powell's current terms for each role expires on May 15, 2026.&#x20;\n\nIn January 2025, Trump was inaugurated for a second term. On April 2, 2025, he [announced](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liberation_Day_tariffs) a massive expansion in America's tariffs on other countries, [described](https:\/\/www.cato.org\/blog\/trumps-tariffs-arent-reciprocal-are-massive-tax-increase-americans) by the Cato Institute as \"possibly even exceeding the notorious Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which contributed to the Great Depression.\"&#x20;\n\nIn a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell said the tariffs were \"significantly larger than anticipated,\" adding that the economic effects \"will include higher inflation and slower growth\" and that therefore the Federal Reserve would remain patient and see how everything played out before making any big adjustments to interest rates.\n\nThe first major sign of Trump's dissatisfaction with Chair Powell came the next day, on April 17, when Trump [posted](https:\/\/x.com\/TrumpDailyPosts\/status\/1912827529133539730) (emphasis added):&#x20;\n\n> The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, \u201cToo Late\u201d Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete \u201cmess!\u201d Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late **should have lowered Interest Rates**, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. **Powell\u2019s termination cannot come fast enough!**\n\nA few days later, Trump [called](https:\/\/truthsocial.com\/@realDonaldTrump\/posts\/114376239725335883) Powell a \"major loser,\" reiterating his demand that interest rates be lowered. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett [said](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/can-trump-fire-powell-term-end-federal-reserve-what-to-know\/) the Trump Administration was studying whether Powell could be fired. Trump additionally said, \"If I want him out, he\u2019ll be out of there real fast, believe me. I\u2019m not happy with him.\"&#x20;\n\nHowever, [according to CNN](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/17\/economy\/trump-fed-chair-powell-termination\/index.html):\n\n> For his part, Powell has pointedly noted that removing a Fed chair is \u201cnot permitted under the law,\u201d and has said he intends to serve out the remainder of his term.\n\n> However, that legal protection, which comes as a result of the Fed\u2019s status as an independent government institution, may be an open question. Trump has fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, also a long-independent agency, arguing that their \u201ccontinued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration\u2019s priorities,\u201d according to a Wall Street Journal report of a letter Trump sent to them.\n\n> On Wednesday, Trump fired two Democrats on the three-member board of the National Credit Union Administration, a federal insurer and regulator of credit unions. Todd Harper, one of the officials dismissed by Trump, said in a post on LinkedIn that his firing \u201cis wrong.\u201d\n\nThen on April 22, Trump [denied](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/04\/22\/us\/politics\/trump-powell-fed.html) having any plans to fire Powell, with signs, for the moment, of deescalation.&#x20;\n\nNo US president [has ever attempted](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/business\/could-trump-fire-powell-1.7515197) to fire a Fed chair, and legally members of the Board of Governors can only be removed for \"cause,\" which has long been interpreted as misconduct.&#x20;\n\nSee also:\n\n* Brookings Institution (2019): [What happens if Trump tries to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell?](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/articles\/what-happens-if-trump-tries-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell\/)&#x20;\n* American Enterprise Institute: [There\u2019s Only One Way Trump Can Fix Powell\u2019s Opposition at the Fed](https:\/\/www.aei.org\/op-eds\/theres-only-one-way-trump-can-fix-powells-opposition-at-the-fed\/)\n* Axios: [Can Trump fire Fed chair Jerome Powell? Here's what to know.](https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2025\/04\/17\/trump-fire-jerome-powell-fed-humphreys-executor)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump or the US government publicly states before May 1, 2026 that Jerome Powell is terminated, dismissed, or forcibly replaced (resignations or voluntary departures do not count) before his scheduled term end date of May 15, 2026, from either his role as Chair of the [Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System](https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/aboutthefed.htm) (FRB) or his role as Chair of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/monetarypolicy\/fomc.htm) (FOMC).\n\nThis question resolves upon the qualifying announcement or public statement from Trump or the US government. Whether Powell actually leaves his role as FOMC Chair or FRB Chair before his current term expires is immaterial to this question's resolution. Therefore, potential interventions such as a court enjoining the termination will not prevent the question from resolving as **Yes**.\n\nStatements by Trump need not explicitly mention Powell being terminated. For example, naming Powell's immediate successor or thanking Powell for his service, as for example occurred with [Secretary of State Rex Tillerson](https:\/\/x.com\/realdonaldtrump\/status\/973540316656623616) or [VA Secretary David Shulkin](https:\/\/x.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/979108653377703936), would count, so long as it is clear the successor has been named as a result of a forcible replacement, and not as a result of Powell's voluntary resignation or departure. For the purposes of this question any resignation by Powell will be considered voluntary, including in cases where media reports suggest or confirm that he was pressured to resign.\n\nIf necessary, Metaculus will consult [credible](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/faq\/#definitions) news media reports to assess the truth of the matter, and Metaculus may wait up to 30 days following the announcement of Powell's departure to determine if the departure was forcible or voluntary. If after 30 days Metaculus assesses that the available evidence is not conclusive, the question will resolve as **ambiguous**.\n\nAs stated in the Resolution Criteria, the relevant statement must be made publicly. Journalistic sources that are one or more steps removed from a non-public statement, such as reporting on private conversations or statements that occurred behind closed doors, will not count.\n\nIf Powell is removed as Chair of the FRB or the FOMC but remains on the Board of Governors, this question still resolves as **Yes**.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Will an Attempt Be Made to Fire Jerome Powell Before the End of His Term?\n\nAs of May 2025, the question of whether President Trump will attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026 remains uncertain, but several key developments provide insight into this possibility.\n\n## Current Status of Jerome Powell\n\nJerome Powell is currently serving his second term as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, having been confirmed on May 12, 2022[2]. His current term runs through May 2026[1]. Powell was originally nominated by President Trump during his first administration in November 2017 and confirmed by the Senate in January 2018, assuming office on February 5, 2018[3].\n\n## Recent Tensions Between Trump and Powell\n\nThe relationship between President Trump and Chair Powell has deteriorated significantly in recent months:\n\n- On April 17, 2025, Trump publicly called for Powell's \"termination\" in a social media post, referring to him as \"Too Late Jerome Powell\" and stating that \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"[1]\n- Trump criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates, despite falling oil prices and what Trump claimed were decreasing grocery prices (though official data from the Labor Department showed grocery prices actually rose in the previous month, with egg prices jumping nearly 6% between February and March)[1]\n\n## Legal Framework for Removing a Fed Chair\n\nThe Federal Reserve is designed to operate independently from political pressure, allowing it to make unpopular but necessary decisions to fight inflation[1]. According to established precedent:\n\n- Powell has insisted that the president does not have the authority to fire him except for \"cause,\" meaning some form of misconduct[1]\n- Current Supreme Court precedent supports this view of the Fed Chair's independence[1]\n\n## Trump Administration's Approach to Independent Agencies\n\nDespite the legal protections, there are signs the Trump administration may be willing to test these boundaries:\n\n- The White House has signaled a willingness to challenge the standard protecting independent agency officials by firing board members of other independent agencies[1]\n- Trump has nominated Fed governor Michelle Bowman for the vice chair post on March 17, 2025, following Michael Barr's resignation as vice chair effective February 28, 2025 (though Barr remains a Fed governor)[2]\n\n## Powell's Response\n\nPowell has attempted to navigate this difficult situation by:\n\n- Trying to avoid antagonizing the president, often ducking questions about Trump's commentary[1]\n- Remaining adamant that he intends to serve out the remainder of his term through May 2026[1]\n- Noting that lawmakers from both parties have generally defended the Fed's ability to set interest rate policy without interference[1]\n- Acknowledging the criticism with a touch of humor, stating, \"We are blessed with a large number of amply-compensated critics\"[1]\n\n## Analysis of Potential Outcomes\n\nThe situation presents several possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Attempted Firing**: Trump could formally attempt to remove Powell despite legal barriers, triggering a constitutional showdown over the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\n2. **Pressure Campaign**: The administration might continue a public pressure campaign hoping to influence Fed policy or force Powell's resignation without formally attempting to fire him.\n\n3. **Legal Reinterpretation**: The administration could seek to reinterpret what constitutes \"cause\" for removal, potentially expanding its definition beyond the traditional understanding of misconduct.\n\n4. **De-escalation**: As evidenced by some back-and-forth in Trump's public statements, the tension could potentially de-escalate if economic conditions change or political priorities shift.\n\nThe most recent FOMC press conference occurred on May 7, 2025[4], but the search results don't provide details about whether the tensions were addressed during this meeting.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "26":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Anthropic announce an AI Claude 4 model in 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAnthropic is an [ <u>artificial intelligence company<\/u> ](https:\/\/www.anthropic.com\/) known for its Claude series of models. Claude 3.7 is the most recent model. The company has shown a continued commitment to advancing its technologies, leading to expectations of a higher model being released in 2025. Speculation surrounding Claude 4 suggests possible improvements in reasoning capabilities, multimodal understanding, and efficiency in handling complex queries. Given the rapidly evolving AI landscape, Anthropic could accelerate development to remain competitive against OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and other emerging AI labs.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThe question will be resolved as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2026, Anthropic publishes a document (such as a blog post, article, or video) announcing the release of a model that is explicitly presented by Anthropic as the next major version\/successor to the Claude 3\/3.7 model family and that is given a new major version designation in Anthropic's model naming scheme.\n\n\u2022 For the purposes of this question, the new model will be considered to exist if the document published by Anthropic describes some performance results of the model or indicates that it has been created. A reference to progress in training or development will not be sufficient on its own. If Anthropic publishes some performance results and states that the model is still in some form of training or testing, this question will be resolved as **Yes**.\n\n \u2022 The model must be advertised by Anthropic or any entity that legally acquires or merges with Anthropic.\n\n \u2022 The naming scheme does not need to be a clear continuation of the previous naming scheme. For example, a model that meets the rest of the criteria and is named \"Claude Next\" would answer this question as **Yes**.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Anthropic's Claude 4 Announcement in 2025\n\nAs of May 2025, there is growing speculation about Anthropic's next major AI model release. Here's what we know about the potential for a Claude 4 announcement this year.\n\n## Current Status of Claude Models\n\nAnthropic's Claude model series has established itself as a significant player in the AI landscape. The company has been following a pattern of iterative improvements, with Claude 3 representing a major leap in capabilities, followed by incremental enhancements in subsequent versions[5]. The most recent version mentioned in the query is Claude 3.7, which continues the company's trajectory of improving its AI systems.\n\n## Potential Claude 4 Timeline\n\nAccording to available information, there is no confirmed release date for Claude 4 yet[5]. However, industry speculation suggests a possible release timeframe:\n\n- Some in the AI community are discussing whether Claude 4 might appear in Q1 2025[5]\n- Others anticipate a later 2025 debut, with Q2 2025 considered a plausible introduction window based on typical development cycles[5]\n\n## Factors Influencing Development\n\nSeveral factors may impact Anthropic's timeline for announcing Claude 4:\n\n1. **Competitive Landscape**: Jack Clark, Anthropic's co-founder, has indicated that AI progress in 2025 will be \"even more dramatic\" than previous years, suggesting an acceleration rather than deceleration in development[4]. This competitive environment may incentivize Anthropic to accelerate their development timeline.\n\n2. **Technical Approach**: The industry is seeing a shift in how AI models are being developed. Rather than just scaling up model size, companies are exploring new approaches that combine traditional methods with novel computing techniques during both training and inference[4]. This evolution in methodology could influence Anthropic's development timeline.\n\n3. **Ongoing Initiatives**: Anthropic remains active in the AI space, as evidenced by their participation in Google Cloud Next 2025[1] and the recent launch of their AI for Science program on May 5, 2025[2]. These initiatives demonstrate the company's continued commitment to advancing AI technology.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nThe available information has several limitations:\n\n1. **No Official Announcement**: Anthropic has not made any official statements specifically about Claude 4's development timeline or release date[5].\n\n2. **Evolving Industry**: The AI landscape is rapidly changing, with new technical approaches emerging that could either accelerate or delay development timelines[4].\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations**: Anthropic's release strategy may be influenced by competitive dynamics, internal development milestones, and strategic business considerations that are not publicly disclosed.\n\nBased on the available information, while there is speculation about a Claude 4 release in 2025 (with Q2 being considered plausible), there is no definitive confirmation from Anthropic about whether or when such an announcement will occur this year.\n\n## References\n\n1.

[Many see AI as a solution to the current productivity crisis](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/articles\/how-will-ai-affect-productivity\/), and it is in the midst of an \u2018[AI Boom](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AI_boom)\u2019, with global spending on AI expected to reach [$632 billion by 2028](https:\/\/www.idc.com\/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52530724), according to the International Data Corporation (IDC). \n\nThis has led to new and rapid advancements in the field. OpenAI, for example, the AI research organization behind ChatGPT, has launched its [\u2018Strawberry\u2019 AI model](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/artificial-intelligence\/openai-launches-new-series-ai-models-solve-hard-problems-2024-09-12\/), capable of \u2018reasoning\u2019 through tasks and problems rather than generating a quick response. Likewise, the technology giant NVIDIA \u2014 a dominant supplier of AI hardware and software \u2014 has released its own open-source AI model, [NVLM 1.0](https:\/\/www.windowscentral.com\/software-apps\/nvidia-just-debuted-its-new-open-source-advanced-ai-model-with-state-of-the-art-capabilities-to-take-on-openais-magical-gpt-4o).\n\nWhile AI is therefore seen as an essential tool moving forward, there are also great concerns with the technology. There has been a marked increase in the use of AI to spread disinformation, with [fake images](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/04\/08\/business\/media\/ai-generated-images.html), [videos](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/02\/07\/technology\/artificial-intelligence-training-deepfake.html), and even [fake voice recordings](https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/technology-68074257), designed to mimic politicians or celebrities, being widely propagated online, especially on [platforms such as X (formerly Twitter)](https:\/\/misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu\/article\/the-spread-of-synthetic-media-on-x\/). AI is also being utilized for criminal purposes. Gangs in Asia, for instance, are [\u201c[l]everaging technological advances \u2026 to produc[e] larger scale and harder to detect fraud, money laundering, underground banking[,] and online scams\u201d](https:\/\/www.unodc.org\/roseap\/en\/2024\/10\/cyberfraud-industry-expands-southeast-asia\/story.html), according to Masood Karimipour, a regional representative of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). \n\nAs a result, there has been a push to regulate AI at the government level. The European Union (EU), for example, implemented the [Artificial Intelligence Act](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_Intelligence_Act) which came into force on 1 August 2024, establishing a common regulatory and legal framework for AI within the EU. Likewise, there has been a similar push to regulate AI at a federal level in the United States. In 2022, the White House released its \u2018[AI Bill of Rights](https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/ostp\/ai-bill-of-rights\/)\u2019 and, in 2023, President Joe Biden signed [Executive Order 14110](https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2023\/10\/30\/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence\/), defining the administration\u2019s policy goals regarding AI and directing executive agencies to pursue them. Despite this, the [United States lacks any overarching federal regulation](https:\/\/www.morganlewis.com\/pubs\/2024\/04\/existing-and-proposed-federal-ai-regulation-in-the-united-states), meaning AI in the US is currently governed by a mixture of federal and state law, the industry itself, and the judiciary.\n\nGiven that the pace of AI development continues to grow, the question arises as to whether the US government will adopt federal regulations for AI, or whether the [$146 billion industry](https:\/\/www.precedenceresearch.com\/us-artificial-intelligence-market) will continue under its current patchwork regulatory regime.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2026, the following conditions are met:\n\n - A bill primarily focused on AI regulation - containing specific provisions for the governance, oversight, or regulation of artificial intelligence technologies - has been introduced and passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n - The bill is signed into law by the President of the United States or becomes law by congressional override of a presidential veto, before January 1, 2026.\n\n- The bill must focus on general AI regulation. Broader federal bills that include AI regulations as a secondary focus, or bills specific to a particular domain of AI (e.g., AI in healthcare), do not count.\n- The date the bill takes effect does not matter, as long as it is enacted by January 1, 2026.\n- Only federal bills are considered; other measures, such as Executive Orders, will not resolve this question.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\nAs a forecasting analyst examining whether the US will pass a federal bill on AI regulation before January 1, 2026, I'll analyze the current landscape and relevant factors affecting this prediction.\n\n## Current Regulatory Status\n\nAs of May 2025, the United States still has not passed comprehensive federal artificial intelligence laws and regulations[5]. Instead, AI governance in the US continues to function under a patchwork system comprising:\n\n- Executive orders\n- State-level legislation\n- Sector-specific regulatory oversight\n- Industry self-regulation\n\nThis fragmented approach has persisted despite increasing AI development and adoption across sectors. The current administration has taken a distinctly different approach to AI regulation compared to its predecessor.\n\n## Recent Executive Actions\n\nIn January 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled \"Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,\" which explicitly revoked previous AI policies established by the Biden administration[2]. This executive order represents a significant shift in federal approach, emphasizing:\n\n- Removal of \"barriers to American AI innovation\"\n- Elimination of mandatory federal red-teaming requirements\n- Discontinuation of watermarking requirements for AI-generated content\n- No federal requirements for model cards, incident reports, or bias audits[5]\n\nThis deregulatory approach signals the current administration's preference for minimal federal intervention in AI development and deployment.\n\n## Legislative Activities in 2025\n\nDespite the executive branch's deregulatory stance, Congress has shown some appetite for AI-related legislation:\n\n1. **CREATE AI Act (H.R.2385)** - Introduced on March 26, 2025, this bill aims \"to establish the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource, and for other purposes\"[4]. However, this appears focused on research infrastructure rather than comprehensive regulation.\n\n2. **TAKE IT DOWN Act** - Passed in April 2025, this legislation specifically addresses nonconsensual AI-generated intimate imagery, representing a narrow domain-specific approach rather than comprehensive AI regulation[5].\n\n3. **State-Level Activity** - Throughout 2025, state legislatures have continued introducing various AI-related bills, potentially filling the void left by federal inaction[1].\n\n## Regulatory Agency Actions\n\nWhile comprehensive legislation is absent, federal agencies are incorporating AI considerations into their existing regulatory frameworks:\n\n- The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has prioritized AI in its 2025 examination priorities[3].\n- The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has released AI cybersecurity guidelines[3].\n\nThese agency-level actions suggest that sector-specific regulation may continue to develop independently of comprehensive federal legislation.\n\n## Analysis of Passage Likelihood\n\nBased on the available information, several factors weigh against the passage of a comprehensive federal AI regulation bill before January 1, 2026:\n\n1. **Executive Branch Opposition**: The current administration's explicit deregulatory approach creates a significant obstacle for any comprehensive regulatory legislation.\n\n2. **Limited Legislative Progress**: While some AI-related bills have been introduced, they appear focused on specific domains or research infrastructure rather than comprehensive regulation.\n\n3. **Time Constraints**: With less than 8 months remaining until the January 1, 2026 deadline, the legislative calendar offers limited opportunity for introducing, debating, and passing complex regulatory legislation, especially considering the typical pace of federal lawmaking.\n\n4. **Regulatory Fragmentation**: The continuing development of agency-specific and state-level approaches may reduce urgency for comprehensive federal action.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the current trajectory of federal AI policy, the executive branch's deregulatory stance, and the limited timeframe remaining, the probability of a comprehensive federal AI regulation bill passing before January 1, 2026 appears low (approximately 15-25%).\n\nThe most likely scenario is continued development of:\n- Domain-specific federal legislation (like the TAKE IT DOWN Act)\n- Agency-level regulatory guidance\n- State-level regulatory frameworks\n- Industry self-regulation standards\n\nFor this forecast to change significantly, we would need to see either:\n1. A dramatic shift in the administration's approach to AI regulation\n2. Strong bipartisan congressional momentum for comprehensive regulation\n3. A major AI-related crisis that creates urgent demand for federal intervention\n\nNone of these catalyst events appear imminent based on current information.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "28":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Lula be a candidate for president of Brazil in 2026?\n\nQuestion background:\nLula was the president of Brazil for two terms from 2003 to 2011, and was elected president again in January 2023.\n The initial question is whether he will have support to continue with the current mandate or will find another replacement to contest the presidential race in October 2025.\n\n [Lula says he may run for reelection in 2026](https:\/\/www.poder360.com.br\/governo\/lula-admite-que-pode-disputar-a-reeleicao-em-2026\/)\n\n [By order of the Chamber, the Union signals support for Lula's reelection](https:\/\/www.cnnbrasil.com.br\/politica\/por-comando-da-camara-uniao-sinaliza-apoio-a-reeleicao-de-lula\/)\n\n [Quaest: 58% say Lula should not run for reelection; 40% say yes](https:\/\/www.cnnbrasil.com.br\/eleicoes\/quaest-58-dizem-que-lula-nao-deveria-se-candidatar-a-reeleicao-40-dizem-que-sim\/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThe candidate must be officially registered with his\/her party by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) deadline, August 15, 2025, at 7:00 pm (Bras\u00edlia time).\n [TSE calendar](https:\/\/www.tse.jus.br\/eleicoes\/calendario-eleitoral)\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is serving his third non-consecutive term as president, having previously governed from 2003\u20132011 and returning in January 2023[1].\n- Lula has both publicly signaled intent to seek reelection in 2026 and acknowledged the possibility of supporting a successor instead, generating uncertainty within his party and among allies[5].\n- The Workers\u2019 Party (PT) currently lacks a clear, popular alternative. Names like Fernando Haddad, Camilo Santana, and Rui Costa are discussed, but none command Lula\u2019s broad coalition appeal or internal support[3][5].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Political Dynamics\n\n- Lula\u2019s ambiguous signals\u2014expressing both willingness to run and openness to backing a successor\u2014have unsettled PT leadership, who overwhelmingly favor his candidacy due to the lack of a strong successor[5].\n- Party leaders and coalition partners believe Lula\u2019s participation is decisive for electoral success, with pressure mounting on him to run again[3][5].\n- The Brazilian right is also weakened, with former president Jair Bolsonaro facing trial and unable to mount a strong challenge, reinforcing Lula\u2019s dominance on the left[3].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Brazilian electoral law requires official candidate registration by August 15, 2025, with the Superior Electoral Court (TSE)[1].\n- As of May 2025, Lula has not formally registered, and his public statements on candidacy remain equivocal[5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- Lula\u2019s advanced age (he will be 80 in 2026) introduces personal and health-related uncertainty, a common consideration but not a disqualifying factor[3].\n- While there is internal and coalition pressure for Lula to run, he has not definitively confirmed his candidacy, and there is still time for a late decision or for the emergence of a new contender.\n- Public opinion is mixed: a recent poll found 58% of Brazilians do not want Lula to run again, while 40% are supportive[3].\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven current trends\u2014PT\u2019s lack of alternatives, Lula\u2019s centrality to the coalition, and weak right-wing opposition\u2014the probability that Lula will be the official PT candidate in 2026 is higher than not, but significant uncertainties remain due to his age, health, and his own equivocal statements. As of May 2025, a cautious estimate would place the likelihood of Lula registering as a candidate above 60%, but not a foregone conclusion.\n\n## References\n\n- [1]. 2026 Brazilian general election - Wikipedia (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2026_Brazilian_general_election)\n- [3].

        "29":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill legislation enacted before January 1, 2026 eliminate the transferability of any of these clean energy tax credits (\u00a748E ITC,  \u00a745Y PTC, \u00a745X AMPC)?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in August 2022, established several clean energy tax credits including:&#x20;\n\nSection 48E (ITC) - The [Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/clean-electricity-investment-credit), also known as 48E due to it being in that section of the tax code, is an investment tax credit (ITC) for companies that invest in zero-greenhouse gas energy generation (such as solar and nuclear), storage (e.g., [Tesla Megapacks](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tesla_Megapack)) and any related equipment needed. The credit has a base of 6% of the investment, which can rise up to 30% if certain wage and apprenticeship requirements are met, and up to 50% if additional domestic content and location requirements are met.&#x20;\n\nSection 45Y (PTC) - The Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC), also known as the 45Y credit referring to the section of the US Code from which it comes,  [is a tax incentive](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/clean-electricity-production-credit) created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), to incent companies to generate electricity with net zero greenhouse gas emissions. It is technology-neutral, meaning it offers the incentive to any form of electrical production that does not on net create carbon emissions, such as wind, solar, nuclear and geothermal.&#x20;\n\nSection 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC) - The 45X AMPC is a tax credit ([IRS](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/advanced-manufacturing-production-credit)) for domestic production in the United States of [components](https:\/\/www.plantemoran.com\/explore-our-thinking\/insight\/2023\/09\/understanding-the-section-45x-tax-credit-for-manufacturers) of clean energy, such as inverters for solar panels, blades of wind turbines, and electrode materials for batteries. 45X was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which had a goal of creating a thriving, rapidly-growing clean energy sector. The role of 45X is to help the upstream manufacturers, to help ensure that a rapidly-growing sectors such as solar would have the equipment it needed to meet demand, since tax credits boost after-tax profits and thus reduce the cost of capital.&#x20;\n\nAmong other things, the IRA [made](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/why-utilities-are-lining-up-behind-the-climate-bill\/) the clean energy tax credits transferable, meaning a company receiving a tax credit for a clean energy project could sell the tax credit to someone else, thus creating a market and boosting production of renewable energy. The Internal Revenue Service runs a [transfer of credits portal](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/register-for-elective-payment-or-transfer-of-credits) allowing companies to register and sell their tax credits. According to investment banking firm [Jeffries](https:\/\/www.projectfinance.law\/media\/5933\/what-next-for-the-tax-credit-and-transferability-market-in-trump-20-__.pdf), the size of the tax credit transfer market in 2024 was \\$24 billion, with the PTC being especially valuable due to being collected.\n\nIn January 2025, Donald Trump took power, along with Republican majorities in the House and Senate. One of the areas of negotiations for budget reconciliation, which is a parliamentary procedure allowing tax and spending bills to passed with a simple majority, was how much of the IRA's clean energy tax credits to cut, [including transferability](https:\/\/www.utilitydive.com\/news\/21-house-republicans-oppose-cutting-ira-clean-energy-credits-in-reconciliation\/742404\/).&#x20;\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026 that (according to [credible sources](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/faq\/#definitions)) eliminates transferability of one or more of the following tax credits:&#x20;\n\n* [Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit \u2013 26 U.S. Code \u00a7 48E](https:\/\/energycommunities.gov\/funding-opportunity\/clean-electricity-investment-tax-credit-26-u-s-code-%C2%A4-48e\/)\n* [Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit \u2013 26 U.S. Code \u00a7 45Y](https:\/\/energycommunities.gov\/funding-opportunity\/clean-electricity-production-tax-credit-26-u-s-code-%C2%A4-45y\/)\n* [Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit \u2013 26 U.S. Code \u00a7 45X](https:\/\/energycommunities.gov\/funding-opportunity\/advanced-manufacturing-production-credit-26-u-s-code-%C2%A4-45x\/)\n\n\"Eliminates transferability\" is [defined as](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/register-for-elective-payment-or-transfer-of-credits) qualifying businesses, tax-exempt organizations or entities such as state, local and tribal governments not being able to make a transfer election of a credit received for tax year 2026 for 48E, 45Y, or 45X credits received to an unrelated party. Transferability being eliminated for any reason by legislation enacted before January 1, 2026 (including a credit itself being repealed) will count for this question.&#x20;\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed in August 2022, established the \u00a748E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC), \u00a745Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC), and \u00a745X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC). These credits are designed to incentivize investment, production, and manufacturing in the clean energy sector.\n- A major innovation of the IRA was making these credits transferable, allowing companies to sell their tax credits to unrelated parties, thereby creating a robust secondary market and increasing the credits\u2019 value and accessibility[3][4].\n- As of early 2025, the IRS continues to administer these credits and their transferability provisions, with active guidance and portals for registration and transfer[3].\n\n### Recent Announcements and Policy Developments\n\n- In January 2025, a new administration took office, with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. Budget reconciliation negotiations have included discussions about cutting or modifying IRA clean energy tax credits, including the possibility of eliminating transferability[4].\n- Despite these discussions, there is no public record or authoritative reporting confirming that legislation eliminating the transferability of \u00a748E, \u00a745Y, or \u00a745X credits has been enacted as of April 10, 2025[3][4].\n- The tax credit structures for \u00a748E and \u00a745Y remain in effect for projects beginning construction in 2025 and beyond, with no mention of transferability being eliminated[3].\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- IRS official guidance and news releases continue to describe the credits and their transferability as active for tax year 2025[3].\n- Financial and tax advisory sources (e.g., Baker Tilly, Kiplinger) report on ongoing legislative negotiations but do not confirm any enacted changes to transferability as of the latest updates[3][4].\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- While there is clear political intent and ongoing negotiation to potentially cut or modify these credits, legislative action eliminating transferability has not occurred as of April 10, 2025.\n- The situation remains fluid, and significant changes could be enacted later in 2025, but such changes would only be relevant if enacted before January 1, 2026.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs of April 10, 2025, there is no evidence that legislation has been enacted eliminating the transferability of the \u00a748E ITC, \u00a745Y PTC, or \u00a745X AMPC tax credits. The credits and their transferability provisions remain in effect, though they are subject to ongoing legislative negotiations that could result in future changes[3][4].\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n- [3].

It will be resolved as **No** if the value is equal to or less than \u20ac11,595.00.\n\n\u2022 If Yahoo Finance stops reporting this data, a credible alternative source can be used to resolve this question.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# IBEX 35 Forecast for 2025\n\nThe IBEX 35, Spain's benchmark stock market index, has shown strong performance in recent years. To assess whether it will close 2025 higher than it started (above 11,595.00), we need to examine current data and forecasts.\n\n## Current Status and Recent Performance\n\nAs of February 2025, the IBEX 35 stands at 13,347.3 points, showing a slight increase from the previous month[5]. This current level already exceeds the 11,595.00 threshold specified in the resolution criteria. The index has demonstrated impressive growth in recent years, with a 23% increase in 2023 and a 14.78% rise in 2024, making it the second-best performing stock market index among major European markets.\n\n## Forecasts for 2025\n\nSeveral analytical services have provided forecasts for the IBEX 35 through 2025:\n\n- According to analytical forecasts, the IBEX price may reach \u20ac14,945.61 by the end of 2025[3].\n- More optimistic predictions suggest the index could reach as high as 30,000 points by the end of 2025[2].\n- Wallet Investor suggests a more conservative growth trajectory, with the index gradually moving up to 9,026 points by the end of 2025[2].\n- IBEX 35 Futures price is expected to reach up to $10,391.40, with analysts anticipating a long-term increase[4].\n\n## Analysis of Potential Outcomes\n\nThe majority of forecasts indicate that the IBEX 35 will maintain or increase its value throughout 2025. With the February 2025 value already at 13,347.3 points, the index would need to experience a significant decline of more than 13% to fall below the 11,595.00 threshold by year-end.\n\nWhile monthly fluctuations are normal for stock indices, the overall trend and forecasts suggest continued growth rather than decline. The IBEX 35 has shown resilience and strong performance in recent years, outperforming many other European indices.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nIt's important to note several limitations in these forecasts:\n\n1. Stock market predictions are inherently uncertain and subject to various economic factors, geopolitical events, and market sentiment.\n2. The forecasts from different sources vary significantly, from conservative estimates to highly optimistic projections.\n3. None of the sources provided specific information about potential economic challenges that might affect the Spanish market in late 2025.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the current value of 13,347.3 points as of February 2025 and the majority of forecasts predicting continued growth, it appears likely that the IBEX 35 will close 2025 above the 11,595.00 threshold. However, as with all market predictions, this outlook is subject to change based on evolving economic conditions and unforeseen events.\n\nReferences:\n1.

        "31":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill conflict between India and Pakistan result in 100 deaths in May or June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn [22 April 2025, near Pahalgam](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_Pahalgam_attack), in Indian administered Kashmir, militants killed 26 individuals in an attack. Following the attack, India, and Pakistan engaged in [hostile diplomatic measures](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_standoff) aimed at each other. Starting on the night of 24-25 April 2025, [skirmishes](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_border_skirmishes), and exchanges of gunfire reportedly started along the Line of Control.\n\nThe event is a part of the broader [Kashmir conflict](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kashmir_conflict), which started after the partition of India in 1947. Both of the countries claim sovereignty over each other's de facto territory in the area. Tensions restarted after India [revoked the autonomy](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Revocation_of_the_special_status_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir) of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if military conflict between India and Pakistan results in at least 100 deaths after May 1 and before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/faq\/#definitions).\n\n* The deaths have to occur in Indian and\/or Pakistani territory, as demarcated by their internationally recognised state borders and the [Line of Control](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Line_of_Control).\n* The deaths have to be caused by the overtly flagged military forces of India, Pakistan, and\/or their explicit allies in the conflict.\n* The conflict need not involve Indian forces within the borders of Pakistan or vice-versa, cross-border missile or ballistic attacks are sufficient.\n* The deaths must be caused by [kinetic attacks](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kinetic_military_action), using weaponry or physical violence. A cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n* In case of conflicting information between sources, Metaculus might wait until the end of the tournament to resolve this question or might make a determination as to which sources should contribute to its resolution.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# India-Pakistan Conflict: Assessing the Potential for Escalation\n\nBased on information available as of May 6, 2025, the conflict between India and Pakistan has shown concerning signs of escalation that could potentially result in significant casualties in the coming months.\n\n## Historical Context and Current Status\n\nThe India-Pakistan conflict over Kashmir has been ongoing since the partition of India in 1947, with both countries claiming sovereignty over each other's de facto territory in the region[2]. Tensions were reignited after India revoked the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, creating a foundation for renewed hostilities.\n\nThe current escalation began on April 22, 2025, with a militant attack near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir that resulted in 26 deaths. This attack triggered a series of hostile diplomatic measures between the two nuclear-armed neighbors[2]. Starting on the night of April 24-25, 2025, skirmishes and exchanges of gunfire commenced along the Line of Control (LoC)[2].\n\nBetween April 24 and May 6, 2025, the situation has deteriorated significantly, with both countries engaging in heavy skirmishes including cross-border firing and artillery shelling[2]. These actions represent a substantial escalation beyond typical border incidents.\n\n## Diplomatic and Military Developments\n\nThe diplomatic crisis between India and Pakistan has intensified, with India taking several severe measures:\n- Expulsion of Pakistani diplomats\n- Recall of its own diplomatic staff\n- Suspension of visa services\n- Closure of borders\n- Withdrawal from the Indus Waters Treaty[2]\n\nPakistan has responded with:\n- Trade restrictions\n- Closure of airspace and border crossings\n- Suspension of the Shimla Agreement[2]\n\nIndia's Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has urged Indian citizens to avoid traveling to Pakistan and called on those currently in Pakistan to return immediately, suggesting expectations of further escalation[2].\n\n## Assessment of Potential for Casualties\n\nSeveral factors indicate a high risk of the conflict resulting in 100 or more deaths by the end of June 2025:\n\n1. **Escalation Pattern**: The conflict has already progressed from a terrorist attack to diplomatic measures to active military engagement along the border within two weeks.\n\n2. **Historical Precedent**: Previous India-Pakistan conflicts have frequently resulted in significant casualties once military operations escalate beyond initial skirmishes.\n\n3. **Geographic Scope**: The conflict zone spans the entire 3,200-kilometer border between the two countries, creating multiple potential flashpoints.\n\n4. **Military Mobilization**: Both countries appear to be positioning forces along the border, increasing the likelihood of larger-scale engagements.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors complicate the assessment:\n\n1. **Information Reliability**: Both countries have engaged in misinformation campaigns following military actions, making casualty figures difficult to verify[2].\n\n2. **International Intervention**: The potential for international diplomatic intervention, particularly from major powers like the United States, could potentially de-escalate the conflict.\n\n3. **Nuclear Deterrence**: Both countries possess nuclear weapons, which historically has served as a deterrent to full-scale conventional war, though this doesn't preclude limited military operations.\n\n4. **Internal Political Factors**: Domestic political considerations in both countries could either accelerate or restrain military actions.\n\nBased on the trajectory of events through May 6, 2025, and the historical pattern of India-Pakistan conflicts, there is a significant risk that the ongoing military exchanges could result in 100 or more deaths by the end of June 2025 if the current escalation continues without effective diplomatic intervention.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "32":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWhat will happen next concerning the repeal of the 48E (ITC) clean electricity tax credit of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe [Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/clean-electricity-investment-credit), also known as 48E due to it being in that section of the tax code, is an investment tax credit (ITC) for companies that invest in zero-greenhouse gas energy generation (such as solar and nuclear), storage (e.g., [Tesla Megapacks](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tesla_Megapack)) and any related equipment needed. The credit has a base of 6% of the investment, which can rise up to 30% if certain wage and apprenticeship requirements are met, and up to 50% if additional domestic content and location requirements are met.&#x20;\n\nThe 48E tax credit was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and took effect for new zero-GHG facilities beginning construction after December 31, 2025. (For more information, see Columbia University's [Inflation Reduction Act Tracker](https:\/\/iratracker.org\/programs\/ira-section-13102-renewable-energy-investment-tax-credit\/).) 48E is currently scheduled to phase out at the later of either 2032 or when United States greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are less than or equal to 25% of 2022 emissions.\n\nWith the November 2024 election of Donald Trump and Republican majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, the future of 48E, along with other clean energy tax credits, has been thrown into uncertainty. Under Senate budget reconciliation rules, spending programs such as 48E can be modified or eliminated through a simple majority vote, without being subject to filibuster from Democratic senators.&#x20;\n\nAccording to the [Brookings Institution](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/articles\/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta\/):&#x20;\n\n> Republican lawmakers have cited the cost of the IRA as one of the reasons to roll it back\u2014for example, the House Committee on Ways and Means has [highlighted](https:\/\/gop-waysandmeans.house.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/230421-Two-Pager-Green-Energy-Credits-FINAL.pdf) the \u201cexploding\u201d cost of \u201cgreen corporate welfare\u201d under the IRA. The [cost of IRA\u2019s \u201cgreen subsidies\u201d](https:\/\/waysandmeans.house.gov\/2023\/04\/26\/house-republicans-pass-limit-save-grow-act-to-rein-in-wasteful-spending-and-grow-the-economy\/) was a part of the justification for introducing the [Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/118th-congress\/house-bill\/2811), that [sought](https:\/\/climatepower.us\/research-polling\/inflation-reduction-act-repeal-votes-tracker\/) to cut billions in funding from climate, environmental justice, and clean energy tax incentives from the IRA.\n\n> Previous House attempts to roll back the IRA may provide an indication of the specific provisions that could be targeted under a Republican White House and Congress. According to Climate Power\u2019s [IRA repeal votes tracker](https:\/\/climatepower.us\/research-polling\/inflation-reduction-act-repeal-votes-tracker\/), as of October 15, 2024, the attempts to roll back the IRA have repeatedly focused on preventing funding for Executive Order 14082 (which helps implement the IRA), repealing sections related to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and repealing sections related to the Methane Emissions Reduction Program.\n\nSome conservatives have advocated for repealing clean energy tax credits such as 48E as soon as possible, while others [have advocated for](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits\/) a more \"thoughtful\" approach, using earlier phase-outs rather than quick repeal, in order to provide companies with some visibility in their project planning. Republicans hold a slim majority of 5 seats in the House, and many representatives come from districts that benefit from renewable energy investments and are facing re-election battles in 2026.&#x20;\n\nAccording to one expert forecast from the 600-attorney corporate law firm of Crowell & Moring, 48E is considered a \"[moderate](https:\/\/www.crowell.com\/en\/insights\/client-alerts\/clean-energy-tax-credits-and-after-the-election-what-to-expect)\" risk of repeal, due to the perceived cost of the tax credit by Republican lawmakers. However, other options rather than changing the sunset date could be removing the so-called adders such as the wage and apprenticeship requirements..\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the outcome that is enacted next, before January 1, 2026, with respect to the planned start of the phase-out of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit ([26 U.S. Code \u00a7 48E](https:\/\/energycommunities.gov\/funding-opportunity\/clean-electricity-investment-tax-credit-26-u-s-code-%C2%A4-48e\/)).\n\nThe outcomes are defined as follows:\n\n**2025-2026 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 48E is moved to 2025 or 2026 or 48E is fully repealed, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2025-2026 sunset w\/ safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 48E is moved to 2025 or 2026 or 48E is fully repealed, but with a safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2027-2028 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 48E is moved to 2027 or 2028, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2027-2028 sunset w\/ safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 48E is moved to 2027 or 2028, but with a safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2029-2031 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 48E is moved to 2029, 2030, or 2031, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2029-2031 sunset w\/ safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 48E is moved to 2029, 2030, or 2031, but with a safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\nIf no legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026 that reduces the planned phase-out date of 48E or repeals it, this question will resolve as **No sunset reduction before 2026**.\n\n* The current law alternatively sunsets when greenhouse gas emissions of the United States are less than or equal to 25% of 2022 emissions. This question concerns the scheduled year; if the greenhouse gas emission threshold changes but the scheduled sunset year remains 2032 then it will not count, even if the stated purpose or effective outcome is an earlier phasing out of 48E.\n* For the purposes of this question, a safe harbor must grandfather in most projects that are ongoing at the time of enactment.\n* The question will resolve immediately once the criteria for any outcome are met, even if later developments would satisfy the criteria of another outcome.&#x20;\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E): Current Status and Future Outlook\n\nThe Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E) represents a significant component of U.S. clean energy policy. As of May 2025, this tax credit is in its early implementation phase, having recently replaced the previous Energy Investment Tax Credit. To assess potential future developments regarding this tax credit, it's important to understand its current structure, implementation timeline, and recent regulatory developments.\n\n## Current Status of 48E\n\nThe Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E) is a newly established, technology-neutral investment tax credit that officially replaced the Energy Investment Tax Credit[1]. This credit is designed specifically for investments in facilities that generate clean electricity, with zero greenhouse gas emissions being a key requirement for eligibility[2].\n\nThe credit applies to facilities that begin construction and are placed in service after December 31, 2024[5]. This represents a transition from the previous Section 48 credit, which applied to facilities beginning construction before January 1, 2025[5].\n\n## Key Features and Benefits\n\nThe 48E tax credit includes several notable features:\n\n- **Base credit with potential increases**: The credit can be increased by up to 10 percentage points for facilities meeting certain domestic content requirements for steel, iron, and manufactured products[2].\n\n- **Bonus credit program**: A special program increases the 48E credit by an additional 10% or 20% for applicable energy facilities with maximum net output of less than 5 megawatts, particularly those located in low-income communities, on Indian land, or as part of qualified low-income residential building projects[3].\n\n- **Eligible technologies**: The credit applies to a range of clean electricity generation technologies, including fuel cell, solar, geothermal, small wind, energy storage, biogas, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power properties[5].\n\n- **Direct pay eligibility**: The credit offers direct pay options for tax-exempt organizations, states, political subdivisions, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Indian Tribal governments, Alaska Native Corporations, and rural electricity co-ops[2].\n\n- **Transferability**: The credit includes transferability provisions, allowing entities without sufficient tax liability to benefit[2].\n\n## Recent Regulatory Developments\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released final regulations regarding the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment credit[4]. These regulations provide detailed guidance on implementation and compliance requirements for the 48E credit.\n\nAdditionally, the Treasury Department has released a list of qualifying technologies for clean electricity credits, which helps clarify eligibility requirements for potential applicants[2].\n\n## Limitations in Forecasting Future Changes\n\nBased on the available information as of May 2025, there are significant limitations in forecasting specific legislative changes to the 48E tax credit:\n\n1. The search results do not contain information about specific legislative proposals to repeal or modify the 48E credit.\n\n2. There is no data available in the search results regarding political positions on the future of this tax credit.\n\n3. The search results do not include information about budget reconciliation processes or other legislative mechanisms that might be used to modify the credit.\n\n4. No information is provided about industry stakeholder positions or lobbying efforts related to the credit.\n\nGiven these limitations, a comprehensive forecast of what will happen next concerning potential repeal or modification of the 48E credit cannot be provided based solely on the available search results.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E) is currently in its implementation phase, with final regulations having been published in early 2025. The credit provides significant incentives for investment in clean electricity generation facilities. While the credit is designed with specific eligibility requirements and bonus structures, the available information does not provide insight into potential legislative changes that might affect its future. Any forecast regarding potential repeal or modification would require additional information about current political developments and legislative proposals.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A description of an scenario that results in an unexpected outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that (1) good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time, and (2) good forecasters leave some moderate probability on most options to account for unexpected outcomes.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final probabilities for the N options in this order ['2025-2026 sunset w\/o safe harbor', '2025-2026 sunset w\/ safe harbor', '2027-2028 sunset w\/o safe harbor', '2027-2028 sunset w\/ safe harbor', '2029-2031 sunset w\/o safe harbor', '2029-2031 sunset w\/ safe harbor', 'No sunset reduction before 2026'] as:\nOption_A: Probability_A\nOption_B: Probability_B\n...\nOption_N: Probability_N\n\nwhere you must assign your probabilities so that Probability_A + Probability_B + ... + Probability_N = 100.\n\n",
        "33":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Inditex be among the top 10 EU companies by market capitalisation by the end of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nInditex, the Spanish multinational known for owning brands such as Zara, is the [ <u>largest company in Spain by market capitalization<\/u> ](https:\/\/companiesmarketcap.com\/spain\/largest-companies-in-spain-by-market-cap\/) and a major player in international markets. As of February 2025, Inditex ranks 11th among Europe's largest companies by market capitalization, closely following Deutsche Telekom and Siemens. With a market capitalization of approximately $175 billion, Inditex would need to overtake Deutsche Telekom, currently valued at around $179.68 billion, to break into the top 10.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThe question will be resolved as **Yes** if, as of December 31, 2025 (or the previous trading date), Inditex is among the 10 largest companies by market capitalization in the European Union (EU). It will be resolved as **No** if it is below the 10th position or is not listed at all.\n\n* [ <u>CompaniesMarketCap<\/u> ](https:\/\/companiesmarketcap.com\/european-union\/largest-companies-in-the-eu-by-market-cap\/) or an equivalent reliable source will be used as a reference.\n * If specific data is not available for December 31, 2025, the last year-end closing will be used.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- **Inditex is Spain\u2019s largest company by market capitalization** and a global leader in the fashion sector, owning brands such as Zara, Massimo Dutti, and Bershka[3].\n- As of May 2025, Inditex\u2019s market capitalization is reported at approximately EUR 147.5 billion (about $159.95\u2013$171.14 billion, depending on the source and exchange rates)[1][2][3][4].\n- Inditex is currently ranked just outside the top 10 EU companies by market capitalization, sitting at 11th place, closely behind Deutsche Telekom and Siemens, both of which have market caps slightly above Inditex\u2019s (Deutsche Telekom at around $179.68 billion)[2][3].\n- Inditex has demonstrated consistent growth, driven by its agile supply chain, global retail presence, and successful integration of online and offline sales channels[3].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- There are no major recent announcements or policy changes reported as of early 2025 that would significantly alter Inditex\u2019s market capitalization trajectory[2][3][4].\n- Inditex continues to benefit from strong consumer demand and operational efficiency, but no extraordinary events (such as mergers, acquisitions, or regulatory changes) have been reported that would immediately propel it into the top 10[2][3].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- CompaniesMarketCap and Trading Economics provide up-to-date rankings and market capitalization figures for EU companies, including Inditex and its competitors[1][2][3].\n- Statista and UniformMarket offer additional context on Inditex\u2019s global standing in the apparel sector and its financial performance[2][4].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- **Market capitalization rankings are dynamic** and can fluctuate due to stock price volatility, currency exchange rates, and macroeconomic factors.\n- Inditex\u2019s ability to enter the top 10 depends not only on its own performance but also on the relative performance of competitors like Deutsche Telekom and Siemens.\n- The apparel sector can be sensitive to shifts in consumer sentiment, supply chain disruptions, and global economic conditions, all of which could impact Inditex\u2019s market cap.\n- Currency fluctuations between the euro and the US dollar may affect the comparative rankings, especially when sources report figures in different currencies[1][2][4].\n\n## Summary\n\nAs of early 2025, Inditex is on the cusp of entering the top 10 EU companies by market capitalization, with a strong financial position and growth trajectory. However, unless there is a significant increase in its market cap or a decline among its immediate competitors, it remains just outside the top 10. The outcome by the end of 2025 will depend on both Inditex\u2019s continued performance and broader market dynamics.\n\n## References\n\n- [1].

These categories include Variants of Interest (VOI), Variants of Concern (VOC), Variants of High Consequence (VOHC), and Variants Being Monitored (VBM). Each classification represents a different level of threat based on factors such as transmissibility, severity of disease, and impact on diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive measures. The detailed definitions and criteria for these classifications can be found on the [CDC's variant classifications page](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/variants\/variant-classifications.html).\n\n - A Variant of Concern (VOC) includes those that show increased transmissibility, more severe disease (e.g., higher hospitalizations or deaths), or significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies from previous infection or vaccination. \n- A Variant of High Consequence (VOHC), a more severe classification, is characterized by clear evidence of significantly reduced effectiveness of medical countermeasures. \n\nCurrently no SARS-CoV-2 variants are designated as VOC or VOHC. The last VOC was Omicron, which emerged in November 2021 and caused a [worldwide wave](https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/feature-stories\/detail\/one-year-since-the-emergence-of-omicron) of cases. At its peak, Omicron [exceeded 20,000 daily hospital admissions](https:\/\/viz.covid19forecasthub.org\/) in the United States for a period of approximately 2 weeks\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, after December 1, 2023, and before July 1, 2025, all three of the following occur:\n\n1. The SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group announces or [classifies on CDC's SARS-CoV-2 variant classifications page](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/variants\/variant-classifications.html) at least one new SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC) or Variant of High Consequence (VOHC) that was not previously identified as a VOC or VOHC at any point.\n2. Daily incident COVID hospitalizations in the United States reach 20,000 or higher according to [data provided by the COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https:\/\/github.com\/reichlab\/covid19-forecast-hub\/tree\/master\/data-truth).\n3. The surge of COVID hospitalizations (described in requirement 2) is attributed to the variant(s) (described in requirement 1) by the CDC or other credible sources. Not every hospitalization needs to be attributed to the variant(s) identified in requirement 1; it is sufficient if sources attribute the unusually large number of cases to the VOC(s).\n\n- If a new variant is classified using a new classification that is clearly described as being a level above VOC or having properties in addition to the possible attributes of a VOC or VOHC this question will also resolve as **Yes**.\n\n- If multiple new VOCs cause the surge in COVID hospitalizations, the question resolves **Yes**.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Analysis: New COVID-19 Variant Impact on US Hospitalizations\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, I'll analyze the likelihood of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant classified as a VOC or worse resulting in at least 20,000 daily incident COVID hospitalizations in the US before July 1, 2025 (approximately 7 weeks from now).\n\n## Current Situation Assessment\n\nThe current COVID-19 landscape shows relatively modest levels of transmission and severity:\n\n- The national test positivity rate stands at 3.2% for the week ending May 3, 2025, showing a slight decrease from 3.4% in the previous week[1]\n- The current hospitalization rate is 1.4 per 100,000 population[2]\n- COVID-19 accounts for only 0.6% of all deaths in the United States[2]\n\nThese metrics suggest that as of mid-May 2025, the US is not experiencing a significant COVID-19 surge. However, earlier in the 2024-2025 season (as of January 29, 2025), the hospitalization rate was notably higher at 38.0 per 100,000 people[5].\n\n## Variant Evolution and Impact\n\nThe available data references several variant eras (XBB, JN.1, and KP)[4], indicating the continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Current variants demonstrate \"higher infectivity\" which is particularly relevant for:\n\n1. Patients at elevated risk of severe COVID-19 (defined as disease resulting in hospitalization, ICU admission, intubation, mechanical ventilation, or death)[5]\n2. Individuals who may develop long COVID, which as of September 2024 had affected approximately 17.9% of all US adults[5]\n\n## Hospitalization Trends and Severity\n\nAmong hospitalized COVID-19 patients between October 2023 and April 2024:\n- 18.4% required ICU admission\n- 8.4% needed mechanical ventilation\n- 6.9% died while hospitalized[5]\n\nThese figures indicate that while the overall prevalence of severe disease may be lower than in earlier phases of the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality among those who require hospitalization.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available data, I assess the likelihood of a new VOC causing 20,000+ daily hospitalizations before July 1, 2025 as **low to moderate** for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Current trajectory**: The declining test positivity rate (from 3.4% to 3.2%) and relatively low hospitalization rate (1.4 per 100,000) suggest we are not currently on a path toward a major surge[1][2]\n\n2. **Timeframe constraint**: With only about 7 weeks remaining until July 1, 2025, there is limited time for:\n   - A new variant to emerge and be classified as a VOC\n   - This variant to spread widely enough across the US\n   - Hospitalizations to reach the 20,000 daily threshold\n\n3. **Seasonal factors**: Late spring\/early summer has typically seen lower COVID-19 transmission in previous years, though this pattern is not guaranteed\n\n4. **Uncertainty factors** that could increase probability:\n   - The search results mention \"higher infectivity\" of current variants[5]\n   - The hospitalization rate was significantly higher earlier in the 2024-2025 season (38.0 per 100,000)[5]\n   - Variant evolution is unpredictable and a highly transmissible and immune-evasive variant could emerge quickly\n\n## Key Limitations in Assessment\n\nSeveral important limitations affect this forecast:\n\n1. The search results do not provide absolute numbers of current daily hospitalizations, only rates per 100,000\n\n2. No information is available about any emerging variants currently under monitoring that might soon be classified as VOCs\n\n3. The search results lack specific forecasting models or projections from public health authorities regarding potential summer 2025 scenarios\n\n4. Limited information is available about current population immunity levels from vaccination and prior infection\n\n5. The search results don't mention current mitigation measures or public health policies that might affect transmission\n\nGiven the available data and the short timeframe remaining before July 1, 2025, the most likely outcome is that we will not see a new VOC driving 20,000+ daily hospitalizations in the US within the next 7 weeks. However, this assessment carries significant uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of viral evolution and the gaps in available forecasting data.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "35":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Norway announce an official referendum about EU accession before the next parliamentary election in September 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNorway is not a member state of the European Union (EU). However, it is associated with the Union through its membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), signed in 1992 and established in 1994.\n\nThe Norwegians voted twice about EU membership. Once in 1972 and again in 1994. In the first case with 53,5% of the people against, in the second case 52,2% against.\n\nThe debate has gained some renewed interest in the public after Sweden and Finland decided to join the NATO. The political parties mostly support joining the Union, as they have done in the past, too. [Linked here](https:\/\/www.newsinenglish.no\/2023\/04\/05\/ex-premier-fires-up-norways-eu-debate\/), for example, is a statement by the former prime minister, Erna Solberg.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will be resolved as YES if the Norwegian government announces an official referendum on the issue of EU membership before the next parliamentary election date (some time in September 2025) via www.regjeringen.no or any other official communication channel, otherwise it resolves NO.\n\nThe decisive date is the date the referendum is announced, regardless of when the referendum will actually be held.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**\n\n- Norway has twice held referendums on EU membership (1972, 1994), both resulting in a majority vote against joining.\n- The country participates in the European Economic Area (EEA), aligning closely with the EU economically and regulatorily, but remains outside the Union and decision-making[1][2].\n- Public support for EU membership has risen recently, reaching about 41% in early 2025, but opposition remains ahead at 48%. Support for simply holding a new referendum is much higher, at 63%[1].\n\n**2. Recent Announcements and Policies**\n\n- In early 2025, Norway\u2019s government collapsed over the adoption of EU energy rules, reflecting deep political divisions over EU integration[1].\n- The Conservative Party, led by former Prime Minister Erna Solberg, has publicly endorsed EU membership and called for readiness to negotiate accession if an opportunity arises. However, their likely coalition partner, the Progress Party, remains firmly against membership[5].\n- While the public debate has intensified, the Norwegian political leadership has explicitly ruled out announcing a new EU referendum at this time[1].\n- As of May 2025, there has been no official government announcement or movement toward a referendum, and such a step would require broad parliamentary and cross-party support, which is currently lacking[1][5].\n\n**3. Authoritative Sources for Verification**\n\n- Government announcements would be made via www.regjeringen.no or official parliamentary channels.\n- Major analytical coverage is available from Chatham House, Brussels Signal, and direct statements from party leaders[1][5].\n\n**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**\n\n- Political developments can be unpredictable, especially if external shocks occur (trade disputes, security crises).\n- Public opinion is fluid, but as of early 2025, \u201cNo\u201d still leads, and major parties are divided.\n- The precedent set by Iceland\u2019s promise for a referendum by 2027 could influence debate, but there is no sign of immediate Norwegian emulation[1].\n\n**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**\n\nGiven current polling, party positions, and lack of movement at the government level, the chance that Norway will announce an official EU referendum before the September 2025 parliamentary election is low\u2014likely less than 15%. This is higher than in previous years due to increased public support and debate, but significant institutional and political barriers remain.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1]. To join or not to join?

        "36":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill C\u0103lin Georgescu be elected President of Romania after the 2025 elections?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn November 2024, C\u0103lin Georgescu, an <u>ultranationalist candidate with pro-Russian sentiments<\/u> , won the first round of Romania's presidential election. However, the Constitutional Court annulled the results due to allegations of Russian interference, including cyberattacks and manipulation through platforms such as TikTok. This unprecedented move sparked political unrest and widespread protests, with thousands of people demonstrating in Bucharest to support Georgescu. New elections are scheduled for May 2025, and recent polls indicate that Georgescu remains a <u>leading candidate<\/u> . The situation continues to evolve, with concerns about Romania's democratic integrity, foreign influence, and political stability at the forefront. A crowded race is expected, with multiple contenders from established and new parties announcing their candidacy.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThe question will be resolved as **Yes** if, following the 2025 presidential election in Romania, C\u0103lin Georgescu is officially declared president-elect. If this does not happen, this question will be resolved as **No**. This includes if no election is held before 1 January 2026 or if the results of all 2025 elections are annulled, the question will be resolved as **No**.\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\nBased on the available information as of February 2025, C\u0103lin Georgescu will not be elected President of Romania in the 2025 elections because he has been banned from running as a candidate.\n\n## Historical Context and Current Status\n\nIn November 2024, pro-Russian nationalist candidate C\u0103lin Georgescu caused a major surprise by winning the first round of Romania's presidential election with approximately 2 million votes[1]. Despite his initial success, Georgescu never proceeded to the second-round run-off because:\n\n- Romanian authorities annulled the election results amid accusations of Russian interference in the campaign[1]\n- Intelligence reports indicated that foreign actors had manipulated social media platforms, especially TikTok, to benefit Georgescu[1]\n- The campaign was likely orchestrated by Russia, though Moscow denied any involvement[1]\n\nFollowing the annulment, Romanian authorities banned Georgescu from participating in the new elections scheduled for May 4, 2025[1]. This disqualification was confirmed when authorities cleared a dozen candidates for the May election while rejecting a dozen others, including Georgescu[3].\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nThe political landscape in Romania remains complex following these events:\n\n1. **New elections scheduled**: Romania is holding a presidential election rerun on May 4, 2025, with new rules implemented to prevent foreign interference[1][4].\n\n2. **Far-right momentum continues**: Despite Georgescu's disqualification, far-right politics maintain significant support in Romania. George Simion, another far-right candidate, has emerged as a prominent figure in the May 2025 election[2].\n\n3. **Potential alternative path to power**: While Georgescu cannot be elected president, his influence remains. Simion has publicly maintained support for Georgescu and suggested he might consider appointing Georgescu as prime minister should Simion become president[2]. However, this would require parliamentary approval, which is uncertain given the current political dynamics.\n\n4. **International attention**: The situation has drawn significant international attention, with US Vice President JD Vance criticizing Romania's decision to cancel the previous election results during a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025[1].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors create uncertainty in this situation:\n\n1. **Political instability**: The current governing coalition appears to be fracturing following the May 4 vote, which could impact future political appointments and decisions[2].\n\n2. **Democratic concerns**: The unprecedented annulment of election results has raised questions about Romania's democratic processes and the influence of intelligence agencies in political matters[1].\n\n3. **Ongoing Russian influence concerns**: Given the previous allegations of Russian interference, continued attempts to influence Romanian politics remain a possibility.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the available information, C\u0103lin Georgescu will not be elected President of Romania in the 2025 elections as he has been explicitly banned from running as a candidate. While he maintains support among certain political factions, and there exists a theoretical path to political power through appointment as prime minister, this would not satisfy the resolution criteria of being \"officially declared president-elect.\"\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",
        "37":"You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWhat will happen next concerning the repeal of the 45Q carbon capture tax credit established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, also known as the as the Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q tax credit, offers tax credits to companies that capture and sequester carbon emissions. First passed in 2008 and expanded in 2018 and 2020 [under President Donald Trump](https:\/\/www.whitecase.com\/insight-our-thinking\/us-tax-credit-encourages-investment-carbon-capture-and-storage), the credit was again expanded in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) signed by President Joe Biden. According to Columbia University's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) [Tracker](https:\/\/iratracker.org\/programs\/ira-section-13104-tax-credit-for-carbon-oxide-sequestration\/) the expansions were as follows:&#x20;\n\n> Previously, in order to qualify for the credit, carbon capture facilities had to commence construction prior to January 1, 2023. Section 13104 of the IRA extended the \u201ccommence construction\u201d window to January 1, 2033. Section 13104 of the IRA also reduced the amount of carbon dioxide that facilities must capture in order to be eligible for the credit and increased the amount of the credit.\n\n> Projects that capture carbon dioxide at electric generating plants or industrial facilities and sequester it in geologic formations are now eligible for a base credit of \\$17 per metric ton for carbon oxide captured and geologically sequestered, and \\$85 per metric ton for facilities that meet apprenticeship requirements and pay prevailing wages during construction as well as the first 12 years of operation, a five-fold increase of the base rate.\n\n> For projects that capture carbon dioxide via direct air capture facilities and sequester it in geologic formations, the base credit is \\$36 per metric ton of carbon oxide captured and geologically sequestered and \\$180 per metric ton for facilities meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, a five-fold increase of the base rate.\n\nThere are at least 226 projects qualifying for 45Q, according to [this spreadsheet](https:\/\/www.catf.us\/ccstableus\/) maintained by the Clean Air Task Force.&#x20;\n\nAt the time of this question, Republicans control both Houses of Congress and the White House, having been elected in November 2024. In January 2025, the Mauna Loa Observatory, which tracks atmospheric carbon dioxide, [recently reported](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/35100\/max-co2-reported-by-mauna-loa-mar-1-25-2025\/) 430.6 parts per million of CO2, which is the highest since it began keeping records in 1958 and is higher than Earth has seen for at least [3.3 million years](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-020-67154-8).&#x20;\n\nIn March 2025, Congressman Scott Perry (R-PA) introduced H.R. 1946 the 4Q Repeal Act, stating in the [press release](https:\/\/perry.house.gov\/news\/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403189) that \"The 45Q tax credit subsidizes technologies that serve no purpose beyond distorting energy markets.\" H.R. 1946 does not contain a safe harbor provision and would be a full repeal, effective January 1, 2026.&#x20;\n\nRepublicans are in discussions for a budget reconciliation bill, which will allow them to pass a tax and spending bill with a simple majority. Energy tax credits such as 45Q are under discussion not only for repeal but for earlier sunsets and other possibilities. Please see from Politico: [House Republican support grows for keeping clean energy tax breaks](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2025\/03\/10\/house-republican-clean-energy-tax-breaks-00218126)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as the outcome that is enacted next, before January 1, 2026, with respect to the planned start of the phase-out of the Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit under [26 U.S. Code \u00a7 45Q](https:\/\/energycommunities.gov\/funding-opportunity\/credit-for-carbon-oxide-sequestration-26-u-s-code-%C2%A4-45q\/) for the beginning of construction of carbon sequestration facilities or equipment (see also [IRS Instructions for Form 8933](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/instructions\/i8933)).&#x20;\n\nThe outcomes are defined as follows:\n\n**2025-2026 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Q is moved to 2025 or 2026 or 45Q is fully repealed, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2025-2026 sunset w\/ safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Q is moved to 2025 or 2026 or 45Q is fully repealed, but with a safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2027-2028 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Q is moved to 2027 or 2028, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2027-2028 sunset w\/ safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Q is moved to 2027 or 2028, but with a safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2029-2031 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Q is moved to 2029, 2030, or 2031, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n**2029-2031 sunset w\/ safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Q is moved to 2029, 2030, or 2031, but with a safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\nIf no legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026 that reduces the planned phase-out date of 45Q or repeals it, this question will resolve as **No sunset reduction before 2026**.\n\n* The question will resolve immediately once the criteria for any outcome are met, even if later developments would satisfy the criteria of another outcome.\n* For the purposes of this question, a safe harbor must grandfather in most projects that are ongoing at the time of enactment.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The 45Q carbon oxide sequestration tax credit was first established in 2008 and has been expanded several times, most recently by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which increased credit values and extended the eligibility window for new projects to January 1, 2033[4][5].\n- The credit supports a wide range of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects, with at least 226 projects currently qualifying[5].\n- The value of the credit varies by project type, with the highest rates for direct air capture and geologic sequestration[5].\n\n### Recent Announcements and Policy Developments\n\n- In March 2025, Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) introduced H.R. 1946, the 45Q Repeal Act, which would fully repeal the 45Q tax credit effective January 1, 2026, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects[1][2][5].\n- The bill has bipartisan sponsorship, with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) as a co-sponsor, and is currently in the House Committee on Ways and Means[5].\n- The Republican-controlled Congress is considering using budget reconciliation to pass tax and spending changes, which could include the repeal of 45Q and other clean energy tax credits[4].\n- There is some Republican support for retaining certain clean energy tax breaks, but the 45Q credit is facing strong bipartisan opposition, making it a likely target for repeal[4].\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The full text of H.R. 1946 is available on Congress.gov[1].\n- Multiple news outlets and advocacy organizations have reported on the introduction and implications of the 45Q Repeal Act[2][3][4][5].\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The final outcome depends on the legislative process, including potential amendments, negotiations within the Republican caucus, and the reconciliation process.\n- There is some uncertainty about whether a safe harbor provision could be added during negotiations, but the current bill text does not include one[1][5].\n- Stakeholder lobbying and public pressure could influence the final legislative language.\n\n### Forecasted Outcome\n\nGiven the current legislative text of H.R. 1946, the political alignment in Congress, and the absence of a safe harbor provision, the most likely next outcome is:\n\n**2025-2026 sunset w\/o safe harbor**: The planned phase-out date of 45Q is moved to 2025 or 2026 or 45Q is fully repealed, with no safe harbor for ongoing projects.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n1.

Ne Zha 2 is a direct sequel to the 2019 animated film Ne Zha, making it part of a franchise.\n- Other leading films in 2025, such as A Minecraft Movie and Captain America: Brave New World, are also franchise entries[1][2][3].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- No major industry announcements or policy changes have been reported that would alter the dominance of franchise films at the box office in 2025.\n- The release calendar for the remainder of 2025 includes several high-profile franchise films, but none have been announced that are likely to surpass Ne Zha 2\u2019s current gross[2].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Box Office Mojo and The Numbers provide real-time, authoritative box office data for 2025[1][3].\n- Wikipedia\u2019s 2025 in film page aggregates box office rankings and franchise status[2].\n- Industry analyses, such as those from The Indian Express, confirm the ongoing dominance of franchise films globally[5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- There is always a possibility that a late-year release could outperform current leaders, but the significant revenue lead of Ne Zha 2 makes this unlikely.\n- Box office data may be updated as films continue their theatrical runs, but the trend strongly favors franchise films.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on current data and historical trends, the highest-grossing film of 2025 is almost certain to be part of a franchise, with Ne Zha 2 currently holding a commanding lead. Unless an unexpected non-franchise film emerges and surpasses it by year\u2019s end, the answer is **Yes**.\n\n## References\n\n- [1]. 2025 Worldwide Box Office (https:\/\/www.boxofficemojo.com\/year\/world\/)\n- [2]. 2025 in film - Wikipedia (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_in_film)\n- [3].

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if the closing value of the S&P 500 Index on the last trading day of 2025 is higher than the closing value on the last trading day of 2024. If the closing value on the last trading day of 2025 is equal to or lower than the closing value on the last trading day of 2024, this question will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nThe \"close\" values shown on the [history page of Yahoo! Finance](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/%5EGSPC\/history\/?p=%5EGSPC) will be used as the resolution source.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The S&P 500's average annual return from 1998 to 2024 was approximately 8.3%, but there have been significant fluctuations, with downturns in recession years and sizable gains in bullish periods[1].\n- As of early 2025, the S&P 500 is coming off a strong 2024, with returns exceeding 25%[3]. This sets a high base for 2025 performance comparisons.\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- Most major banks and Wall Street analysts forecast the S&P 500 will end 2025 higher, with targets generally around 6,500, which would represent an 8\u201310% gain from the 2024 close[1][3][5].\n- Goldman Sachs projects a 9% price gain for 2025, citing expectations of 11% EPS growth, 2.5% real GDP growth, and inflation cooling to 2.4%[3][5].\n- Anticipated drivers include strong economic fundamentals, robust consumer spending, and advancements in artificial intelligence[4].\n- Risks cited include elevated valuations (P\/E ratios well above historical averages), potential for broad tariffs or policy changes post-2024 election, and sensitivity to higher bond yields[3].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Yahoo! Finance will be used for the resolution of year-end closing values, as specified in the question description.\n- Forecasts and analysis from Goldman Sachs, Oppenheimer, Yardeni Research, Fundstrat Global, and BCA Research provide a range of expert perspectives[1][3][5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- While the consensus forecast is positive, there is a non-negligible risk of downside scenarios, such as a potential recession (BCA Research forecasts a possible 26% drop)[1].\n- High current valuations may amplify market reactions to negative shocks.\n- The U.S. presidential election and potential policy shifts introduce additional uncertainty.\n- External shocks\u2014such as geopolitical events or abrupt monetary tightening\u2014could disrupt the consensus outlook.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the combination of robust economic fundamentals, consensus among major analysts, and recent historical performance, there is a moderately high probability that the S&P 500 Index will end 2025 above its 2024 close. However, elevated valuations and macroeconomic\/political uncertainties increase downside risks compared to a typical year. The most likely scenario, per current data, is a moderate gain in the index, but with higher volatility and risk than in an average year.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "0":"(a) The time left until the outcome is known: The outcome is already known, as the Canadian election has already taken place in April 2025, and the results have been reported.\n\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Mark Carney, the Liberal Party leader, is set to become Prime Minister as his party has won the most seats in Parliament.\n\n(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: This has already occurred - Pierre Poilievre not only failed to lead his Conservative Party to victory but also lost his own parliamentary seat. The Liberals under Mark Carney won the election.\n\n(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: This would require a massive error in the reported election results or an unprecedented constitutional intervention that would overturn the election outcome in favor of Poilievre, which is extremely unlikely given the clear reporting on the results.\n\nBased on the search results provided, I can confidently state that Pierre Poilievre will not be elected Prime Minister of Canada in 2025. The Canadian federal election has already taken place in April 2025, and the results show that the Liberal Party led by Mark Carney has won more seats in Parliament than the Conservatives[2][3].\n\nWhat's particularly notable is that Pierre Poilievre not only failed to lead his party to victory, but he also lost his own parliamentary seat representing his Ottawa district[2]. This represents a remarkable reversal of fortune for Poilievre, who only months before the election appeared to be a strong favorite to become Canada's next Prime Minister.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the Liberal Party under Mark Carney's leadership maintained a lead in the polls leading up to the election[3][4]. The final polling showed Carney's Liberals at 40.5% nationwide support, while Poilievre's Conservatives trailed at 37.5%[3]. The Liberals held a crucial 9-point lead in Ontario and also led in Quebec, which are important provinces for forming a government[3].\n\nThe election outcome appears to have been significantly influenced by increasing tensions with the United States, particularly related to trade issues and sovereignty concerns[2][3]. These tensions sparked a surge in Canadian nationalism that benefited the Liberal Party and hurt Poilievre, whose \"Canada First\" campaign slogan and perceived similarities to Trump's style of politics may have ultimately cost him and his party in the election[2].\n\nWhile it's not entirely clear if the Liberals won an outright majority (requiring at least 172 seats in the 343-seat Parliament), they were projected to win the most seats and form the next government, either with a majority or with support from smaller parties like the NDP[2][4].\n\nGiven these facts, and that the election has already occurred with clear results reported by multiple credible sources, there is no realistic pathway for Pierre Poilievre to become Prime Minister of Canada in 2025.\n\nProbability: 0%",
        "1":"(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  \nThe first round of the Polish presidential election will be held on May 18, 2025. If no candidate secures more than 50% of the vote, a second-round runoff between the top two candidates will take place on June 1, 2025. This means the final outcome will be known in approximately three weeks[4][5].\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nRafa\u0142 Trzaskowski currently leads in the polls with support consistently above 30%\u2014estimates range from 33.2% to 38.3%\u2014with his main opponent, Karol Nawrocki, polling in the mid-20s. No candidate is on track to win outright in the first round, making a runoff likely. If voting patterns hold and transfers from eliminated candidates do not decisively favor Nawrocki, Trzaskowski would be slightly favored to win in the second round[1][2][5].\n\n(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  \nKarol Nawrocki, or another non-Trzaskowski candidate, overtakes Trzaskowski in the runoff. This could happen if right-leaning and undecided voters, as well as those supporting third-place candidate S\u0142awomir Mentzen (and others), coalesce behind Nawrocki, shifting the balance in the second round. Additionally, a drop in urban (pro-Trzaskowski) turnout or a major campaign misstep could lead to a Nawrocki victory[3][5].\n\n(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  \nTrzaskowski maintains his current lead and successfully secures enough support from voters of eliminated candidates (e.g., Ho\u0142ownia, Biejat) in the runoff, particularly among centrist and left-leaning segments. High urban turnout and continued consolidation of pro-EU, liberal voters would enable Trzaskowski to be officially declared president-elect[1][2][5].\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Current polling averages** suggest Trzaskowski would comfortably advance to the runoff and remains the slight favorite, but the race has become more competitive as Nawrocki has narrowed the gap in recent weeks[1][2][3][5].\n- **Runoff dynamics** will be critical. While Trzaskowski benefits from being the ruling party's candidate and has strong urban and liberal support, the consolidation of right-wing and anti-establishment voters could tip the balance to Nawrocki, especially given the unpredictable nature of second-round vote transfers[5].\n- **Recent trends** favor a tightening race, which increases uncertainty. However, the institutional and political context has shifted toward the Civic Coalition since their 2023 and 2024 victories, and the desire for alignment with the Tusk government may help Trzaskowski in the decisive round[1][2][5].\n- **Status quo bias** in forecasting suggests maintaining current poll leader as slight favorite, barring disruptive last-minute developments.\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nProbability: **65%**\n\nThis estimate reflects Trzaskowski's slight but not overwhelming advantage, the high volatility of the race, and the crucial role of second-round dynamics and coalition-building.",
        "2":"(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nThe answer will be clear once President Donald Trump signs into law a reconciliation bill passed by Congress, or if this does not happen by December 31, 2025. As of today (May 10, 2025), that leaves up to around 8 months for the outcome to be determined.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nCurrently, the House has passed the budget resolution necessary to start the reconciliation process, and relevant committees have until May 9 to submit their portions of the reconciliation bill[1][4][5]. The Republican leadership is targeting Memorial Day (May 26, 2025) for passing the full bill and sending it to President Trump for signing[2][5]. If this timetable holds, the bill could be signed into law in June 2025.\n\n(c) **Scenario that results in an unexpected outcome:**  \nA plausible unexpected scenario is if deep disagreements emerge between Republican Senate and House caucuses\u2014particularly over contentious tax cuts, border security measures, or the $880 billion in required cuts by the Energy & Commerce Committee[5]. Such disagreements could stall the legislative process, delaying passage into July or beyond. Another risk is that negotiations over the debt ceiling or last-minute parliamentary challenges (e.g., the Byrd Rule) could force Republicans to rewrite and re-pass sections of the bill, pushing the signing into late summer or fall\u2014or, if gridlock persists, failing to pass a reconciliation bill at all in 2025.\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Status quo (Before July):**  \n  The committee process is on a tight schedule, and leadership has publicly targeted Memorial Day for passage, with the possibility of a signing by June if things proceed smoothly[2][5]. This is the \"default\" path and carries the most weight, as delays often do not materialize as severely as feared.\n\n- **Potential for moderate delay (July - August):**  \n  Given the complexity of the bill\u2014combining tax, spending, and border security policy\u2014and the volume of committee work remaining, there's a significant risk of slippage. Past reconciliation efforts often run behind schedule, and key committees such as Ways and Means may not finish their work on time[5].\n\n- **Later outcomes (September-December, Not in 2025):**  \n  Longer delays could occur if partisan or intra-party divides deepen over controversial provisions or if external factors (like a surprise in the debt ceiling timetable or negative parliamentary rulings) force a reset or major rewrite. Historical precedent, however, suggests that trifecta governments are highly motivated and usually manage to pass at least one reconciliation bill in their first year, though often later than initially planned.\n\n## Final Probabilities\n\nBefore July: 45  \nJuly - August: 32  \nSeptember - October: 13  \nNovember - December: 5  \nNot in 2025: 5\n\n**Option breakdown:**  \n- Before July: 45%  \n- July - August: 32%  \n- September - October: 13%  \n- November - December: 5%  \n- Not in 2025: 5%",
        "3":"(a) Time left until outcome: 111 days (from May 12, 2025 to September 1, 2025)\n(b) Status quo outcome: No Ivy League university has had its SEVP certification revoked or suspended\n(c) No outcome scenario: Harvard complies with DHS requests, legal challenges delay any potential action, or political pressure forces DHS to back down from its threats\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: DHS determines Harvard's response to be inadequate and formally revokes its SEVP certification, or Harvard refuses to comply with DHS demands, triggering automatic withdrawal of certification\n\nThe question asks whether the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will revoke or suspend the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification for any Ivy League university before September 1, 2025. Based on the current information, I'll analyze this situation carefully.\n\n## Current Situation\n\nAs of May 12, 2025, DHS has explicitly threatened to revoke Harvard University's SEVP certification. The department demanded that Harvard provide \"detailed records on Harvard's foreign student visa holders' illegal and violent activities\" by the end of April 2025, or face immediate loss of its SEVP certification[3]. This ultimatum stemmed from allegations that Harvard has created a hostile environment for Jewish students and failed to address antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe April 30, 2025 deadline has now passed. According to the most recent information from May 1, 2025, Harvard has sent international students' information to DHS[5]. A Harvard administrator named Weenick stated, \"Our participation in SEVP is unchanged at this time, and any withdrawal by DHS of Harvard's certification would be involuntary\"[5]. This suggests that Harvard has attempted to comply with DHS demands, but the adequacy of their response remains in question.\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n### 1. Precedent and Political Context\n\nThis situation appears highly unusual. While DHS has revoked SEVP certifications in the past, these typically involved institutions that ceased operations or failed recertification processes for administrative reasons. The current threat against Harvard is politically charged, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claiming Harvard was \"bending the knee to antisemitism\" under \"its spineless leadership\"[3]. Former President Trump has also publicly criticized Harvard, calling it a \"JOKE\" that \"teaches Hate and Stupidity\"[3].\n\n### 2. Legal Challenges\n\nIf DHS attempts to revoke Harvard's certification, the university would almost certainly mount immediate legal challenges. Several legal experts have reportedly advised Harvard to consider suing DHS over its demands[5]. Harvard has already filed a lawsuit against nine federal agencies over federal funding cuts, though DHS was not named as a defendant in that case[5]. Additionally, DHS is already \"facing several lawsuits\" over recent visa revocations for foreign students[3].\n\n### 3. Impact Assessment\n\nThe stakes are extremely high. Harvard currently has 6,793 international students, representing 27.2% of its total enrollment[3]. Revoking Harvard's SEVP certification would cause significant disruption to these students' education and to Harvard's operations and reputation. It would also likely trigger diplomatic tensions with multiple countries whose citizens attend Harvard.\n\n### 4. Compliance Status\n\nWhile Harvard has submitted some information to DHS, it's unclear whether their submission fully satisfies DHS demands. The statement that \"any withdrawal by DHS of Harvard's certification would be involuntary\"[5] suggests Harvard believes it has complied sufficiently, but DHS may disagree.\n\n## Status Quo Bias Analysis\n\nHistorically, federal agencies have rarely taken dramatic actions against prestigious universities like Harvard. The status quo strongly favors continued certification, as:\n\n1. Revoking certification would face significant legal challenges\n2. The diplomatic and economic fallout would be considerable\n3. Such an action would be unprecedented against an Ivy League institution\n4. There are many off-ramps and compromise solutions available\n\nHowever, this situation is occurring in an unusually polarized political environment where traditional status quo assumptions may be less reliable.\n\n## Probability Assessment\n\nGiven all these factors, I assess that there is a 25% probability that DHS will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for at least one Ivy League university before September 1, 2025.\n\nThis relatively low probability reflects:\n- Harvard appears to have submitted information to DHS, potentially satisfying the immediate demands\n- The substantial legal obstacles DHS would face in implementing a revocation\n- The absence of precedent for such actions against elite universities\n- The significant political, diplomatic, and economic costs of following through with the threat\n- The likelihood that other avenues for resolving the dispute will be pursued\n\nHowever, the 25% is higher than would typically be assigned to such a dramatic action because of the unusually confrontational political environment and explicit threats already issued by DHS.\n\nProbability: 25%",
        "4":"(a) **Time until resolution:**  \nThere are approximately 7.5 months remaining until January 1, 2026, when the outcome to the question will be known.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  \nThere is no credible evidence or official indication that Ukraine has launched a nuclear weapons program as of May 2025. All recent official statements reaffirm Ukraine\u2019s commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and deny any current plans to develop nuclear arms[2][5]. No credible reports from Ukrainian officials, allied governments, international agencies, or major media have stated otherwise.\n\n(c) **Scenario for a \"No\" outcome:**  \nUkraine continues its current policy, maintaining strong rhetoric about nuclear options as leverage but stopping short of actual program initiation. Western military and economic support, though sometimes tenuous, remains sufficient to deter Ukraine from pursuing nuclear arms. The IAEA maintains oversight of Ukraine\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, and no credible reports of a weapons program emerge by January 1, 2026.\n\n(d) **Scenario for a \"Yes\" outcome:**  \nA dramatic shift occurs\u2014such as a collapse in Western support, a decisive escalation of Russian aggression, or credible and public evidence that Ukraine has officially launched or intends to launch a nuclear weapons program. This could take the form of an official announcement by Ukrainian leadership, major leaks reported by international media, or confirmation by an international agency (e.g., the IAEA) of clandestine weapons-related activity. The scenario might also entail Ukraine taking operational control of nuclear warheads supplied by another state, provided Ukraine holds command authority.\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Technical Feasibility:** Ukraine possesses the technical know-how, nuclear materials, and missile technology to begin a weapons program should the political decision be made[2][5].\n- **Political and Diplomatic Barriers:** Every authoritative statement by Ukrainian government ministers and the president has clarified that, despite occasional rhetorical hints, there are no current plans to develop nuclear weapons. Ukraine has repeatedly committed to the NPT, emphasizing diplomatic solutions[2][5].\n- **International Oversight:** Ukraine\u2019s nuclear facilities are heavily monitored by the IAEA, making any covert nuclear program exceedingly difficult to hide[3].\n- **Deterrence via Rhetoric:** Ukrainian leaders have used the nuclear issue mainly as a diplomatic tool to pressure Western allies for more substantial security guarantees[2], not as an actionable policy.\n- **Geopolitical Incentives:** Initiating a nuclear weapons program would risk the loss of remaining Western support and trigger international sanctions or worse. Unless absolutely necessary for national survival, such a move is highly unlikely.\n- **Indicators to Watch:** The most plausible trigger for a shift would be a total collapse of Western support or a final, catastrophic breakdown in Ukraine\u2019s security environment, but there is no sign of this as of May 2025.\n\nGiven the current evidence, the world is in a slow-changing, \"status quo\" regime. Absent a major and disruptive shock, Ukraine will not launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026.\n\n**Probability: 3%**",
        "5":"(a) **Time until outcome known:**  \nApproximately 7.5 months remain until January 1, 2026, when this question will be resolved.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends persist\u2014with no public criminal investigations, all legal actions remaining civil, and no new, credible allegations\u2014Sam Altman will not be indicted before 2026.\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  \nOngoing lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny remain within the civil domain, governance controversies do not escalate to criminal proceedings, and no major evidence of criminal conduct emerges relating to Altman or OpenAI. By January 1, 2026, Altman has not been indicted on any state or federal charges.\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  \nSignificant new evidence surfaces\u2014such as fraud, obstruction, or other criminal activity\u2014either from ongoing civil litigation (such as the lawsuit with Elon Musk or from external investigations into OpenAI or related ventures like Worldcoin). Law enforcement launches a criminal investigation and secures an indictment of Altman before January 1, 2026.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe **default outcome in most corporate and tech governance disputes is \u201cNo indictment\u201d**, especially when, as now, all known legal actions are civil and not criminal in nature. The numerous controversies surrounding Sam Altman\u2014ranging from OpenAI\u2019s governance disputes, his firing and reinstatement, to criticisms about transparency and treatment of employees\u2014have certainly attracted regulatory and public scrutiny[1][2]. However, there are **no public criminal investigations or indictments as of May 2025**[2][4].\n\nHistorical reference cases (e.g., Holmes, Bankman-Fried) show that criminal indictments typically follow public revelations of fraud or egregious misconduct. At present, the board\u2019s past concerns\u2014misleading the board, psychological abuse allegations, or employee NDAs\u2014have not translated into evidence of criminal conduct[2].\n\nWhile ongoing lawsuits (notably with Elon Musk) and regulatory reviews could, in theory, uncover criminal wrongdoing, so far they remain in civil territory[1][4]. Even substantive civil findings rarely convert into criminal indictments absent concrete evidence of fraud, embezzlement, or similar offenses\u2014none of which have surfaced publicly in Altman\u2019s case.\n\nGiven the **short time remaining before 2026 and the current lack of public criminal investigation**, the probability of indictment is low. However, given the historic unpredictability in tech scandals, a nonzero probability remains, but it is heavily outweighed by the status quo.\n\n**Probability: 3%**",
        "6":"(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nAs of May 12, 2025, there are approximately seven weeks remaining until July 2025, when the question will be resolved.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nThe current average UK house price remains well above the crash threshold of \u00a3260,968 (a 30% decline from June 2023's \u00a3372,812). Most industry forecasts and recent data predict modest house price growth or stability in 2025[1][3][4]. Therefore, if present conditions persist, the market will not experience a crash by the defined criteria.\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  \nA No outcome occurs if the Rightmove House Price Index does not show a national average asking price at or below \u00a3260,968 for any month before July 2025. This is the default expectation: house prices remain above the crash threshold, supported by modest growth predictions, recovering mortgage affordability, and stable market fundamentals[1][3][4].\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  \nA Yes outcome only occurs if there is an extraordinary and sudden fall\u2014over 30% from current prices\u2014before July 2025. This scenario requires an extremely rapid and severe market shock, such as a major financial crisis, a swift and deep recession, or an abrupt collapse in mortgage credit and demand. There is no evidence such a scenario is currently unfolding, and nothing in recent forecasts points toward a fall of this magnitude[1][4][5].\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe UK housing market in early 2025 is stable, with the average price still significantly above the crash threshold. Economic indicators, mortgage trends, and institutional forecasts all point toward modest growth or, at worst, flat prices for the remainder of 2025[1][3][4]. The time left until July 2025 is very short for a 30% price collapse to materialize. Historically, changes of this magnitude require a major economic or financial crisis, for which there is currently no sign.\n\nGood forecasters assign extra weight to the status quo, especially over short time horizons, as dramatic changes are rare and usually require clear precursors. No such precursors are present now; if conditions persist, a crash is extremely unlikely. Only an unprecedented, sudden economic shock could trigger a crash, and the likelihood of this in the next seven weeks is highly remote.\n\n**Probability: 2%**",
        "7":"(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 months and 21 days (from May 10, 2025 until January 1, 2026)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: \"Neither repealed nor reduced\" - the adders to tax credits established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act would remain in place.\n\n(c) An unexpected scenario: Despite the Trump administration's executive order pausing IRA fund disbursement, bipartisan support emerges for clean energy incentives due to significant job creation and economic benefits in key states, leading to preservation of most adders with only minor modifications to qualification requirements.\n\nThe question asks about the future of tax credit adders established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) before 2026. These adders increase the value of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for clean energy projects when certain conditions are met.\n\n## Current Political Context\n\nThe political landscape has shifted significantly with the Trump administration returning to power and implementing an executive order to pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the IRA. This executive order explicitly targets the IRA as part of a \"Terminating the Green New Deal\" section, signaling strong opposition to the legislation's clean energy provisions[5].\n\nAdditionally, with Republican control of Congress, there is a clear pathway for legislative action to modify or repeal aspects of the IRA. The GOP leadership has consistently opposed the IRA since its passage, characterizing it as excessive government spending on climate initiatives.\n\n## Economic and Industry Factors\n\nDespite political opposition, several economic factors might influence the decision-making process:\n\n1. **Established Business Investments**: Many companies have already made significant investments based on the IRA tax credit structure, creating momentum in the clean energy sector.\n\n2. **Job Creation**: The clean energy provisions have generated jobs in multiple states, including Republican-leaning ones, potentially creating constituencies that would oppose full repeal.\n\n3. **Budgetary Considerations**: Complete repeal could have budgetary implications that might complicate passage through Congress.\n\n## Probability Assessment\n\nThe Trump administration has clearly signaled its intention to dismantle the IRA's clean energy provisions, as evidenced by the day-one executive order. While executive action alone cannot repeal the tax credits established by legislation, it demonstrates the administration's priorities. With Republican control of Congress, there is a clear path for legislative action.\n\nHowever, complete repeal might face challenges from industry stakeholders who have made investments based on these incentives. A more politically expedient approach might be to reduce or modify the adders rather than eliminate them entirely. This would allow the administration to claim a victory in rolling back \"Green New Deal\" policies while minimizing disruption to businesses that have already committed resources.\n\nThe status quo remaining unchanged seems least likely given the explicit targeting of IRA funds in executive orders and Republican control of Congress. The timeline until January 2026 provides ample opportunity for legislative action, especially considering that tax legislation is likely to be a priority for the new administration.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that the status quo typically has inertia, in this case, there are strong signals of imminent change. The executive order has already paused fund disbursement, and legislative action is likely to follow. The question is more about the extent of changes rather than whether changes will occur.\n\nRepealed fully: 55%\nReduced incentives: 35%\nNeither repealed nor reduced: 10%",
        "8":"(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  \nThere are just under 8 months remaining until the question closes on January 1, 2026.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nAs of early May 2025, official Ukrainian reports and UK intelligence estimate Russian personnel losses at approximately 950,000 since February 2022[5]. The current daily average of reported losses is over 1,200 per day[4][5]. If this trend persists, the 1 million threshold will be surpassed within the next 2\u20133 months, likely by July or August 2025\u2014well before the resolution deadline.\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  \nA No outcome would occur if, before the threshold is reached, there is either:\n\n- A ceasefire or peace agreement leading to the Ukrainian General Staff ceasing daily reporting, or  \n- A sustained interruption in publication (no updates for 30+ days) not clearly attributable to a ceasefire, or  \n- A dramatic, sustained reduction in battle intensity causing reported average casualties to drop well below current levels, delaying the 1 million mark past January 1, 2026.\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  \nA Yes outcome will occur if the Ukrainian General Staff continues publishing daily loss reports at or near the current rate. At over 1,200 reported Russian casualties per day and a starting point of approximately 950,000, the milestone will be reached in roughly 40 days. This would put the crossing point in late June or early July 2025, with ample margin for reporting errors or fluctuations in intensity[4][5].\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\nGiven the current operational status and the tempo of fighting, the status quo is by far the strongest predictor for this forecast. The latest data show the war's intensity and Russian casualty rates are at or near their highest levels since the invasion began. There are no credible indications of an imminent ceasefire or a breakdown in Ukrainian reporting practices[2][4][5].\n\nEven if the daily casualty rate decreases moderately, the time to the 1 million mark is short\u2014fewer than 50,000 additional losses required, compared to 160,000 reported in just the first four months of 2025[4][5]. The only credible way the outcome would not resolve Yes is if there is a sudden, sustained cessation of hostilities or an abrupt end to the Ukrainian General Staff's publication of loss data. While these are plausible in theory, there is currently no evidence or news suggesting such a development is imminent.\n\nStandard forecasting practice puts considerable weight on inertia\u2014the world usually continues on its present course. All leading indicators reinforce this: a historically high casualty rate, continued daily reporting, and no signals of de-escalation or reporting interruptions.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 95%**",
        "9":"(a) Time left until outcome: 7 months and 19 days (until December 31, 2025)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: Elon Musk remains the world's richest person, as he currently holds this position with a significant lead over the second-richest person.\n\n(c) No outcome scenario: Tesla stock experiences a major crash (beyond the current correction), potentially dropping by 50% or more from current levels. Simultaneously, another billionaire (like Bezos or Zuckerberg) sees significant appreciation in their primary assets, closing the current wealth gap.\n\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: Tesla stock stabilizes or recovers, and SpaceX continues to increase in value through successful missions and contracts. The diversification of Musk's assets (Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, etc.) provides sufficient buffer against market volatility to maintain his top position.\n\nTo predict whether Elon Musk will remain the world's richest person on December 31, 2025, I need to analyze the current trends in his wealth and potential challenges to his position.\n\n## Current Wealth Status and Trends\n\nAs of May 2025, Elon Musk is still the world's richest person, though his net worth has fluctuated significantly in recent months. Tesla's stock, which represents a substantial portion of his wealth, has experienced a major correction, losing over 41% of its value since hitting a six-month high in December 2024[1][2]. Despite this correction, Musk maintains a significant lead over other billionaires.\n\nThe primary components of Musk's wealth include:\n\n- Tesla (20.5% ownership stake)\n- SpaceX (42% ownership stake)\n- xAI (54% ownership)\n- Smaller holdings in Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X (formerly Twitter)\n\n## Tesla Stock Outlook\n\nTesla's stock performance is crucial to Musk's wealth position. Current analyst projections for Tesla stock show mixed sentiment:\n\n- The consensus median one-year price target for Tesla shares is $284.23, implying a modest 3.90% upside potential from current levels[1][2]\n- 24\/7 Wall St. has a more bearish outlook with a 12-month price target of $268.01, representing a 2.02% downside[1][2]\n- More optimistic forecasts from StockScan.io project Tesla stock could reach an average price of $590.95 by the end of 2025, with a high prediction of $800.70 and a low estimate of $381.20[3]\n- Some analysts, like those at Fundstrat Global Advisors, are predicting Tesla could reach $614 by early 2026[5]\n\nTesla's 2025 deliveries are forecasted at 1.95 million units by Barclays, below the Bloomberg consensus of 2.08 million and Tesla's earlier estimates[2]. This suggests some headwinds for the company's growth.\n\n## Other Wealth Factors\n\nSpaceX continues to be a strong performer in Musk's portfolio, with its private market valuation continuing to rise. This diversification helps offset Tesla's volatility. Additionally, xAI's $50 billion valuation adds another significant asset to Musk's wealth.\n\n## Probability Assessment\n\nLooking at the status quo, Musk maintains a substantial lead over other billionaires, which would take a significant reversal to overcome in just 7 months. While Tesla has experienced volatility, analyst forecasts suggest the stock is more likely to stabilize or see modest growth rather than collapse completely.\n\nThe main risk factors include:\n- Further significant decline in Tesla stock\n- Rapid appreciation of assets held by competitors like Bezos or Zuckerberg\n- Regulatory actions or legal issues affecting Musk's companies\n\nGiven these considerations, and placing appropriate weight on the status quo advantage Musk currently enjoys, I believe it's more likely than not that Musk will remain the world's richest person at the end of 2025.\n\nProbability: 75%",
        "10":"As a professional forecaster interviewing for a job, I'll address the question about measles cases in the United States for 2025 based on the available information.\n\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:\nThe outcome will be known when the CDC publishes its first update showing the total number of reported cases through the end of 2025. Given that we're currently in May 2025, we'll likely see this final tally in January or February 2026, so approximately 8-9 months from now.\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed:\nBased on the search results, there have already been 1,001 confirmed measles cases in 2025 as of the most recent reporting.[1] This suggests that even if the rate of new cases suddenly stopped, the final count would be at least 1,001 cases.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:\nThe current data shows we've reached 1,001 cases by early May 2025.[1] If this trend continues at a similar pace for the remainder of the year, we could expect approximately 2,400-2,800 total cases by year-end.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets:\nPublic health officials appear concerned about the rapid spread, noting that measles is highly contagious and that a 2.5% change in vaccination rates could mean thousands more cases.[2] The WHO reported in March that the hospitalization rate was 17%, with most cases occurring in unvaccinated children.[4] This suggests experts anticipate continued growth in case numbers.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:\nAn unexpected massive public health intervention with emergency vaccination campaigns targeting outbreak areas could dramatically slow transmission. If authorities implement strict quarantine measures and successfully vaccinate vulnerable populations in response to the current outbreaks, the case count might stabilize around 1,200-1,500 total for the year.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:\nIf the virus reaches multiple densely populated areas with low vaccination rates simultaneously, we could see exponential growth in cases. The highly contagious nature of measles (remaining infectious in the air for up to 2 hours)[3] combined with increased travel during summer and holiday seasons could lead to widespread transmission across multiple states, potentially pushing the total well above 3,000 cases.\n\nLooking at the evidence, I need to be humble in my assessment. The current data shows we've already reached 1,001 cases by early May,[1] which is concerning given that we're not even halfway through the year. The growth rate has been significant, from 222 cases in early March[3] to 378 cases by late March[4] to over 1,000 cases by early May.[1] This demonstrates accelerating spread.\n\nI must also consider that 2019 saw 1,274 total cases,[5] and we've nearly matched that in just the first 4-5 months of 2025. The presence of 14 distinct outbreaks reported so far this year[1] suggests multiple transmission chains that could continue to grow.\n\nPercentile 10: 1200\nPercentile 20: 1400\nPercentile 40: 1800\nPercentile 60: 2200\nPercentile 80: 2800\nPercentile 90: 3500",

As of May 12, 2025, about 7\u20138 months remain until the final annual outcome is known.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**\nIf current trends persist, Brazil\u2019s inflation in 2025 will be higher than in 2024. The latest available inflation rate is 5.53% year-over-year in April 2025, versus 4.37% for all of 2024[1]. Projections for the rest of 2025 remain above 5%, and there is no current evidence of a sharp downward turn.\n\n(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome (inflation in 2025 is NOT lower than in 2024):**\n- Inflation remains elevated or continues rising through 2025.\n- Persistent pressures: Depreciated currency, fiscal challenges, and external shocks keep prices high.\n- Monetary tightening fails to quickly reduce inflation, or lagged effects mean relief only appears in 2026[1][4][5].\n- The annual average for 2025 ends above 4.37%.\n\n(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome (inflation in 2025 IS lower than in 2024):**\n- Inflation falls sharply in the second half of 2025 due to unexpected positive shocks (e.g., stronger currency, rapid drop in commodity\/import prices, effective fiscal adjustment).\n- Tight monetary policy has rapid effect, driving significant monthly declines.\n- However, given the current trajectory (5.53% YoY as of April), inflation would have to fall well below 4% for the remainder of 2025 to bring the annual average below 4.37%, which is unlikely absent extraordinary developments[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\n**Rationale and Probability Estimate:**\n\nRecent data indicate inflation is running notably above last year\u2019s pace: April 2025 inflation is 5.53% YoY compared to the 4.37% realized for 2024[1]. Most forecasts for 2025 from analysts and institutions remain above 5%, even factoring in possible moderation later in the year[1][2][3][4][5]. Monetary tightening is expected to continue, but any reduction in inflation will likely materialize fully only in 2026[5].\n\nHistorically, inflation trends are slow to reverse unless there is a dramatic policy or external shift. With almost half the year already showing inflation well above 2024 levels, the probability that the full-year 2025 inflation rate will end below 4.37% is very low\u2014this would require average monthly deflation or very low inflation for the rest of the year, which no mainstream forecast suggests.\n\n**Probability: 95%**",
        "12":"I'll analyze whether global average wealth per adult will increase in 2024 compared to 2023, based on the available data.\n\n(a) Time until outcome is known: The outcome will be known when the World Inequality Database (WID) publishes its 2024 data. As of today (May 9, 2025), this data should already be available or soon to be published, as we're well into 2025.\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: Based on the search results, wealth per adult dropped 3.6% to USD 84,718 at the end of 2022[5]. However, there was a significant recovery in 2023, with global wealth per adult growing by approximately 4.2%[5]. If this trend continues, the status quo would be continued growth in 2024.\n\n(c) Scenario for No outcome: Global wealth per adult could decrease in 2024 if there was a major economic downturn, similar to what happened in 2022 when wealth declined due to a strong US dollar and currency effects[5]. Significant market corrections, geopolitical instability, or a new economic crisis could all lead to wealth contraction.\n\n(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: If economic recovery continued through 2024, with stable or weakening US dollar, reduced inflation, and continued growth in emerging markets (particularly in Asia-Pacific), we would likely see increased global wealth per adult. The strong growth in 2023 (4.2% nominal and 8.4% real growth)[5] suggests momentum that could carry into 2024.\n\nLooking at the available data, several factors suggest continued growth in wealth per adult for 2024:\n\n## Historical Trends and Recent Performance\n\nThe search results indicate that global wealth experienced a significant recovery in 2023 after contracting in 2022. Total net private wealth fell 2.4% in 2022, while wealth per adult dropped 3.6% to USD 84,718[5]. This contraction was followed by a strong rebound in 2023, with approximately 4.2% growth that more than offset the previous losses[5].\n\nSince 2008, wealth per adult has shown a consistent upward trajectory across most regions, though with varying growth rates. EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) had the highest wealth per adult at approximately $166,000 in 2023, followed by APAC (Asia-Pacific) at $155,000, and the Americas at $146,000[5].\n\n## Regional Growth Patterns\n\nThe search results show interesting regional patterns that could influence the 2024 outcome:\n\n- Growth in wealth per adult since 2008 has been strongest in APAC (130%), followed by the Americas (100%), with EMEA showing the lowest growth at less than 30%[5].\n- The convergence of emerging economies with mature markets continues, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, which could support continued global growth in 2024.\n- While the US has high levels of wealth per adult, its growth rate trails APAC[5], suggesting that developing economies might drive global averages upward in 2024.\n\n## Inequality and Distribution Factors\n\nThe distribution of wealth remains highly uneven, with the US hosting 38% of the world's millionaires, Western Europe 28%, and China 10% as of 2023[5]. This concentration means that economic performance in these regions disproportionately affects global averages.\n\nThe search results indicate that inequality has decreased slightly in the US and Canada since 2008 (measured by the Gini coefficient)[5]. This suggests some redistribution of wealth that could positively impact median wealth figures.\n\n## Considering the Status Quo Bias\n\nAs a forecaster, I must account for the status quo bias - the tendency for conditions to remain relatively stable over time. The world economy generally changes incrementally rather than dramatically, barring major shocks.\n\nThe 2023 recovery was robust, with real (inflation-adjusted) global wealth growing by nearly 8.4%, outpacing nominal growth as inflation slowed[5]. This strong momentum likely carried some inertia into 2024, and without evidence of major economic disruptions, the most probable outcome is continued growth, albeit possibly at a more moderate pace.\n\nFurthermore, the search results don't indicate any major global policy shifts or economic crises that would suggest a reversal of the upward trend in 2024.\n\nProbability: 75%",
        "13":"As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze this question about potential AI training pauses by major companies before 2026.\n\n(a) Time left until outcome known: Approximately 7 months and 19 days (from May 12, 2025 to January 1, 2026)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: None of the three companies (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic) announce a pause on training runs above a certain size for safety reasons.\n\n(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: The three major AI companies continue their competitive development of increasingly powerful models through 2025, implementing safety measures and responsible scaling policies that allow them to continue training without requiring a complete pause. They maintain that their existing governance frameworks and safety protocols are sufficient.\n\n(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: A significant safety incident or concerning capability emerges in one of the companies' models, prompting immediate action. Alternatively, mounting pressure from governments or coordinated action among the companies leads to at least one announcing a temporary pause on large training runs while better safety measures are developed.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe question asks whether OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic will announce a pause on all training runs above a certain size for safety reasons before January 1, 2026. Let me analyze the evidence and context to develop my forecast.\n\n### Current Competitive Landscape\n\nAs of May 2025, the AI development landscape remains highly competitive. Recent developments suggest the major AI labs are focused on capability advancement rather than pausing development:\n\n- Google recently upgraded its Gemini 2.5 Pro model, making it widely available and increasing usage limits[1]\n- Anthropic released Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code in February 2025[2]\n- All three companies are described as engaged in \"AI leaderboard jockeying\" as of April 2025[5]\n\nThis indicates that the competitive dynamics are pushing these companies to continue advancing their models rather than pausing development.\n\n### Safety Approaches\n\nThe search results reveal important context about how these companies are approaching AI safety:\n\n- Anthropic has a \"Responsible Scaling Policy\" and focuses on \"building tools with human benefit at their foundation\"[2]\n- There's evidence of collaboration on safety standards, as Google announced it would adopt Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)[3]\n- The concept of \"if-then commitments\" has emerged as a framework for \"preparing for risks from AI without unnecessarily slowing the development of new technology\"[4]\n\nThese approaches suggest the companies are pursuing safety through governance mechanisms and standards rather than through pausing development.\n\n### Timeline Expectations\n\nThe search results indicate that AI leaders expect continued rapid development:\n\n- The CEOs of all three companies \"have all said they expect human-level AI before the end of the decade\"[5]\n- This timeline expectation suggests they are planning continued development rather than anticipating pauses\n\n### Historical Precedent\n\nThere is no evidence in the search results of any previous pauses by these companies on training runs for safety reasons. This absence of precedent is significant, as companies tend to follow established patterns of behavior.\n\n### Status Quo Bias Consideration\n\nAs a forecaster, I must acknowledge that the status quo typically persists in the absence of strong forces for change. The current status quo involves ongoing AI development with safety measures integrated into the development process rather than through pauses.\n\nFor a pause to occur within the next ~8 months, there would need to be either:\n1. A significant safety incident that forces reconsideration\n2. New coordinated regulation that requires pauses\n3. A major shift in the competitive dynamics between these companies\n\nNone of these appears imminent based on the available evidence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGiven the competitive landscape, the current approaches to AI safety, the absence of historical precedents for pauses, and the short time horizon remaining before January 2026, it appears highly unlikely that any of the three companies will announce a pause on training runs above a certain size for safety reasons.\n\nThe companies are pursuing safety through governance frameworks, responsible scaling policies, and technical standards rather than through pauses. They are also engaged in active competition that incentivizes continued development.\n\nWhile a safety incident or regulatory intervention could change this trajectory, there is no evidence suggesting such developments are likely in the next ~8 months.\n\nProbability: 10%",

The question resolves based on any quarter from Q2 2023 through Q4 2025, so all relevant BLS data will be available in early 2026.\n\n(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  \nIf recent historical trends continue, the percentage of U.S. workers in white-collar jobs remains relatively stable or increases slightly, reflecting three decades of steady growth from about 59% (early 1990s) to 62.2% in 2022. There is no precedent for a rapid 2 percentage point drop within a short time frame; such a shift would be highly unusual[1].\n\n(c) **Scenario Resulting in a NO Outcome:**  \nThe labor market continues its gradual post-pandemic normalization. Job growth slows modestly in white-collar sectors, but major losses or displacement do not materialize before 2026. Unemployment ticks up slightly as forecast, but white-collar employment remains well above 60%, consistent with very gradual past shifts[2][4].\n\n(d) **Scenario Resulting in a YES Outcome:**  \nA rapid, widespread adoption of AI or automation tools, combined with a severe economic downturn, triggers layoffs or reclassification in sales, office, professional, or management jobs. White-collar employment falls sharply\u2014atypical given historical inertia\u2014and dips at or below 60% in any single quarter before Q4 2025 ends. Such a scenario would likely require both an unusually fast technological disruption and recessionary conditions occurring together[1][4].\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Historical data** shows remarkable stability and even gradual increase in white-collar job share over the last 30 years[1].  \n- **Current forecasts** expect only moderate rises in unemployment and softening job growth, mostly concentrated outside core white-collar sectors[2][4].  \n- **Job growth in 2024\u20132025** is expected to slow, especially in white-collar industries, but not collapse. Three-quarters of new jobs have been in other industries (health care, government, leisure\/hospitality)[4], suggesting white-collar job share might stagnate or inch downward, but large sudden drops remain unlikely.\n- **Community prediction markets** (Metaculus) give a low probability (7%) for the resolved event, reflecting the strong trend inertia and lack of major disruptive evidence so far[1].\n- **AI and automation risk** is significant in theory, but as of mid-2025 there are no reports of massive, rapid displacement in these occupational groups. Economic shocks, if any, have not yet led to a large rebalancing between white- and blue-collar shares.\n\nGiven these points, the prudent approach is to put substantial weight on the status quo scenario, as large, rapid shifts in such aggregate employment shares are historically rare and no compelling data yet suggest such a break.\n\n**Probability: 10%**",

Their valuations, which have already adjusted downward significantly in early 2025, prevent further dramatic declines. While one or two stocks might approach or exceed the 50% threshold (particularly Tesla), fewer than four breach this mark before 2026.\n\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: Market sentiment about tech valuations deteriorates further, particularly regarding AI investments. Combined with rising interest rates, slowing earnings growth, and broader macroeconomic concerns, this triggers more aggressive selloffs. Tesla (already down 30.4%), Nvidia (down 18.9%), Alphabet (down 18.5%), and Apple (down 15.4%) all breach the 50% decline threshold before year-end 2025.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are currently experiencing what appears to be a significant correction rather than an outright collapse. As of May 2025, these tech giants have faced a challenging start to the year with substantial declines across the board. Tesla has fallen 28-30.4%, Nvidia 17.2-18.9%, Alphabet 14.9-18.5%, Apple 15.1-15.4%, Amazon 12.2-12.6%, while Microsoft and Meta have been more resilient with declines of around 6.2%[1][2][5].\n\nThis represents a notable shift from their previous market dominance. In Q1 2025, the Magnificent Seven experienced their worst quarter on record as a group[5]. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025 alone, and with February's 8% decline, the fund was down more than 15% since the start of the year[5].\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to this downturn:\n\n1. **Earnings growth deceleration**: While these companies collectively beat earnings estimates in early 2025[3], growth rates are slowing compared to their previous performance.\n\n2. **Valuation concerns**: After years of premium valuations, investors appear to be reassessing the long-term profit potential of significant AI investments.\n\n3. **Macroeconomic uncertainties and trade tensions**: These broader factors have impacted market sentiment toward growth stocks[1].\n\nHowever, there are several reasons to be cautious about forecasting a complete bubble burst:\n\n1. **Market resilience**: Despite the challenging start to 2025, the combined market cap of the Magnificent Seven has shown some recovery, climbing back to $15.4 trillion by May 1, 2025[2].\n\n2. **Varying performance**: Not all seven stocks are equally vulnerable. Tesla shows the most significant decline at 28-30.4%, while Microsoft and Meta have been more stable with less severe losses[1][2].\n\n3. **Status quo bias**: Major market leaders rarely experience synchronized collapses of the magnitude described (four stocks falling 50% below all-time highs) within short timeframes unless triggered by systemic economic crises.\n\nTo meet the criteria for a \"bubble pop,\" four of these seven stocks would need to close at least 50% below their all-time highs before January 2026. Even Tesla, the worst performer in the group, is still approximately 20% away from crossing that threshold. While the current trajectory suggests continued pressure on these stocks, the required magnitude of decline for four separate companies over the next 7.5 months represents a significant escalation from current conditions.\n\nGiven the status quo, the current valuations after recent corrections, and historical patterns of market behavior, a complete \"bubble pop\" meeting the specified criteria seems possible but not highly probable within the remaining timeframe of 2025.\n\nProbability: 35%",

        "17":"(a) Time until outcome: The NATO summit in The Hague is scheduled for June 24-26, 2025, which is about 6 weeks from today (May 10, 2025).\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: The current NATO defense spending target is 2% of GDP, which has been in place since 2006 and was reaffirmed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\n(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict or a new security crisis in Europe could push NATO to adopt the full 5% target demanded by President Trump, despite current European resistance. Alternatively, economic recession across multiple NATO members could make even a 3% target politically unfeasible, resulting in a compromise figure of 2.5% or maintaining the current 2% target.\n\nBased on the available information, I'll provide my forecast for the NATO defense spending target that will be agreed upon at the June 2025 summit:\n\nNATO appears to be moving decisively toward increasing its defense spending target beyond the current 2% of GDP. Several key factors shape this forecast:\n\n## Current Trajectory\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has clearly signaled that the alliance needs to substantially increase defense spending. In February 2025, he stated that NATO members would need to boost spending by \"considerably more than 3 percent\" of GDP[4]. This statement from the alliance's top official carries significant weight in predicting the summit outcome.\n\nThe obsolescence of the 2% target is widely acknowledged within NATO leadership. Rutte himself has stated that \"2% is not nearly enough to stay safe in the years to come\"[5], indicating a firm commitment to raising the target.\n\n## Competing Proposals and Positions\n\nA specific plan appears to be taking shape. According to Reuters reporting, Rutte has proposed boosting traditional defense spending to 3.5% of GDP, with an additional 1.5% target for broader security-related spending, totaling 5%[1]. This suggests a compromise approach that partially accommodates President Trump's 5% demand while providing flexibility in how it's calculated.\n\nMost recently (May 9, 2025), reporting indicates that \"NATO chief Mark Rutte wants member countries to agree at a summit in June to reach 5% of GDP on defense-related spending by 2032\"[3]. This long-term target with a seven-year implementation timeline makes a higher figure more politically palatable.\n\nSpain's announcement that it will reach the current 2% target by 2025 (accelerated from 2029)[2] demonstrates increased willingness among previously reluctant members to boost defense spending, creating momentum for a higher alliance-wide target.\n\n## Likely Outcome\n\nThe most probable outcome is a formal agreement on a 3.5% target for traditional defense spending at the June summit. This represents a substantial increase from 2% while remaining politically feasible for most members. The additional 1.5% for broader security spending would satisfy U.S. pressure for a 5% total commitment while giving European members flexibility in implementation.\n\nThe 7-year timeline (by 2032) makes this target more achievable by spreading the increases over time. This approach addresses both the urgent security concerns driving the increase while acknowledging the fiscal and political constraints faced by many NATO members.\n\n## Final Probabilities\n\nOption_A (2% or lower): 5%\nOption_B (2.5%): 10% \nOption_C (3%): 25%\nOption_D (3.5%): 40%\nOption_E (4%): 15%\nOption_F (5%): 5%",
        "18":"(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  \nThe outcome will be determined by January 1, 2026. As of May 9, 2025, there are just under 8 months remaining.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nOpenAI has repeatedly stated that GPT-5 is planned for release \"within months\" of early 2025 and that it will be the successor to GPT-4.5, which launched at the end of February 2025. The current trajectory\u2014if announcements and project momentum hold\u2014points toward a \"Yes\" outcome, as all signals suggest an announcement is planned for 2025[1][2][3][4][5].\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  \nA \"No\" would result if OpenAI, due to technical, strategic, or regulatory hurdles, delays the announcement or release of GPT-5 until after January 1, 2026. This could also occur if OpenAI shifts focus to incremental updates (e.g., more o-series releases) or entirely new branding, and either does not reference the next system as GPT-5 or fails to publish a qualifying announcement before the deadline[5].\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  \nA \"Yes\" will occur if OpenAI publishes a blog post, article, or official video before January 1, 2026, that describes GPT-5\u2019s existence or performance results. This could happen anytime in mid-to-late 2025, especially since their CEO and official sources have indicated a \"months\" timeline since February-April 2025\u2014even factoring recent delays[1][2][3][4][5].\n\n## Rationale\n\n- OpenAI follows a pattern of releasing major models every 12\u201315 months. GPT-4.5 shipped in late February 2025, and several high-level statements from OpenAI leadership explicitly position GPT-5 as the next major release for both API and ChatGPT users[4][1][2][3].\n- Sam Altman and OpenAI have been clear, as recently as April 2025, that GPT-5 is coming \"in a few months,\" even after acknowledging some delays to ensure model quality and sufficient infrastructure[5].\n- Industry tracking and external coverage converge on a mid-to-late 2025 launch expectation, with only modest risk of significant additional slippage[1][2][3][5].\n- The only meaningful uncertainties are technical\/integration hurdles or unforeseen strategic changes; however, OpenAI\u2019s market incentives and history with prior releases make further year-long delays less likely unless a major disruption occurs.\n\nGiven that the \"status quo\" is a highly likely \"Yes\" and forecasting best practice is to weigh this heavily unless strong contrary evidence emerges, the probability of a qualifying GPT-5 announcement in 2025 remains high.\n\nProbability: 85%",
        "19":"(a) Time until outcome known: 7 months, 19 days (from May 12, 2025 to December 31, 2025)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: TikTok will be banned in the United States unless ByteDance sells to a non-foreign adversary entity by June 19, 2025 (the current deadline after President Trump's second extension).\n\n(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: The Biden administration declined to enforce the ban initially, and President Trump has already extended the deadline twice. An unexpected scenario could involve Trump granting indefinite extensions through executive orders, effectively nullifying the law without formally overturning it. This could allow ByteDance to maintain ownership while challenging the constitutionality of the law through new legal avenues.\n\nBased on the current information, I'll provide my probabilistic assessment of TikTok's availability in the United States by December 31, 2025:\n\nThe key facts guiding my forecast are:\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the ban on January 17, 2025, rejecting TikTok's First Amendment challenge[2][4]. This eliminated ByteDance's primary legal avenue for retaining ownership. Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, TikTok was required to cease US operations by January 19, 2025, unless sold to an approved owner[1][2].\n\nDespite this ruling, TikTok remains operational in the US due to President Trump's executive orders. After briefly suspending services on January 18, TikTok restored operations when Trump signaled he would grant an extension[3]. Trump then issued two executive orders delaying enforcement - first to April 5, and then to June 19, 2025[3].\n\nByteDance has indicated it would prefer to shut down TikTok in the US rather than sell, according to the background information. However, with the current deadline still over a month away, the situation remains fluid.\n\nLooking at historical precedent, the status quo tends to have strong inertia. However, in this case, the status quo itself is temporary - the law has been upheld, and only executive action is delaying its enforcement. Without additional intervention, TikTok will be banned unless sold.\n\nThe June 19 deadline is approaching, and ByteDance must either:\n1. Find a buyer acceptable to US authorities\n2. Secure additional extensions\n3. Face a shutdown in the US\n\nGiven the Supreme Court's decision, ByteDance has exhausted its main legal options. While President Trump has shown willingness to delay enforcement, indefinitely extending would effectively nullify a law upheld by the Supreme Court - a politically sensitive move.\n\nFor TikTok to remain available under ByteDance ownership, Trump would need to continue issuing extensions through December, or Congress would need to amend the law - both scenarios face significant hurdles.\n\nA sale to a non-foreign adversary entity remains possible but faces significant challenges including ByteDance's resistance, the complexity of separating US operations, and finding a buyer with sufficient resources.\n\nTherefore, my forecast is:\n\nYes, still owned by foreign adversary: 10%\nYes, non-adversary owner: 25% \nNo: 65%",
        "20":"(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  \nThere are just under 8 months remaining until January 1, 2026, when this question will be resolved.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nDomestic content requirements for the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Section 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC) remain optional\u2014projects can claim a 10% bonus if they meet the domestic content thresholds, but it is not mandatory to meet these requirements to receive the base PTC[1][2][3]. IRS and Treasury guidance continues to treat the domestic content provision as a bonus, not a baseline eligibility criterion[1][3][5].\n\n(c) **Scenario leading to a No outcome:**  \nNo federal legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026, modifying Section 45Y to make domestic content requirements mandatory for PTC eligibility. The IRS and Treasury continue with the current structure, offering a bonus credit for projects that meet the requirements, but not denying base PTCs to projects that do not[1][2][3]. This reflects all current guidance and the absence of significant congressional momentum to increase these requirements.\n\n(d) **Scenario leading to a Yes outcome:**  \nCongress passes and the President signs a federal bill before January 1, 2026, that amends the law so that projects must meet domestic content requirements to receive any Section 45Y PTC. Alternatively, new administrative guidance or regulation is issued that has the force of law and effectively makes these requirements mandatory for all PTC claims, but this would almost certainly require legislative change given the statutory basis for PTCs[2][3]. No such federal legislative action has been taken or is clearly imminent as of May 2025.\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Status quo bias:** The domestic content requirement has, since its inception, been structured purely as an optional bonus for the PTC, not a universal mandate[1][2][3]. The Internal Revenue Service\u2019s most recent guidance and updates (including Notice 2025-08) maintain this bonus structure and offer no suggestion of a coming shift to a mandatory requirement[1][3][5].\n- **Political climate:** While the new Republican majority and President Trump have expressed intent to scale back or phase out various Inflation Reduction Act provisions, there is no evidence of a push to make domestic content mandatory for PTCs. Instead, most discussion is about reducing or phasing out clean energy incentives entirely, not restructuring them to prioritize domestic content as a baseline[1][3].\n- **Legislative and procedural likelihood:** With a slim majority in the House and evident internal divisions (with some Republicans advocating for a \u201cthoughtful phaseout\u201d rather than outright repeal), and historical precedent showing reconciliation bills often fail or are heavily modified, the probability of passing new, more stringent PTC requirements in a complicated, divided political context is low within the next eight months.\n- **Regulatory landscape:** IRS and Treasury updates since the law\u2019s passage have focused on clarifying and administering the bonus\u2014not shifting it to a general eligibility requirement for the PTC[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nProbability: **5%**",
        "21":"(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nAssuming the 2024 PHEIC declaration was on August 14, 2024, and that the 180-day maximum window is used, the question will resolve on or around February 10, 2025\u2014about 3 months from the current date.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nAs of September 2024, the global total for the 2024 PHEIC period is approximately 29,000 confirmed and suspected cases, well below the 66,387 threshold required to exceed the 2022\u20132023 outbreak[2][3][5]. Unless there is a significant surge in international transmission or reporting, the current path points to a \"No\" outcome.\n\n(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  \nTransmission remains largely confined to Central Africa, with sporadic, low-level cases in other regions. Under-reporting continues, but no dramatic surge in international spread or in the rate of laboratory-confirmed case reporting occurs. As a result, total confirmed cases during the PHEIC period remain substantially below the 66,387 threshold by the close date.\n\n(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  \nA rapid escalation in international transmission takes place, mirroring or exceeding the global geographic spread seen in 2022\u20132023. This could be triggered by exportation events and subsequent outbreaks in multiple non-African countries with robust detection\/reporting, or by a major improvement in case detection and confirmation in Central Africa. In these scenarios, the cumulative confirmed case count during the PHEIC period could surpass 66,387 before the close date.\n\n## Rationale\n\nMpox Clade I (1b) in 2024 is more severe than Clade II, but as of September 2024, the outbreak remains primarily centered in Central Africa, especially the Democratic Republic of the Congo[2][3]. The total of around 29,000 confirmed or suspected cases globally at that point is less than half the 2022\u20132023 PHEIC total[2][3][5]. While under-reporting is acknowledged, authoritative sources caution that most of the world is not experiencing the kind of rapidly accelerating case numbers that defined the previous global outbreak[3][5]. Exported cases to other continents are rare and have not sparked major secondary outbreaks[1][4].\n\nAs of early 2025, the situation is largely unchanged. The United States, for example, has seen only sporadic cases with no sustained transmission chains[1][4][5]. The bulk of global cases and fatalities remains concentrated in Central Africa. Surveillance and containment efforts have been ramped up by global health authorities[1][2][3], and while under-ascertainment remains a concern, no evidence suggests a sudden and dramatic undercount that would vault the cumulative confirmed global total above the prior outbreak.\n\nGiven these factors, historical precedent strongly favors the status quo: the majority of outbreaks do not suddenly begin accelerating late in their course, especially in the absence of significant new transmission dynamics or failures in containment.\n\n## Final Assessment\n\n- Transmission outside Central Africa remains limited as of early 2025[1][4][5].\n- Confirmed case numbers are well below the 66,387 mark as measured by Our World in Data for the relevant period[2][3][5].\n- Under-reporting is a real issue but unlikely to account for a >2x undercount relative to the previous outbreak, especially as surveillance improves[3][5].\n\n**Probability: 30%**\n\nA \"No\" outcome remains more likely given current trends and the lack of substantial, sustained international spread. However, a nontrivial risk remains\u2014if a late or under-detected wave of cases emerges, or if surveillance and confirmation ramp up sharply, the total could approach or exceed the previous threshold. The main risk factor is a late, rapid surge in cases outside Africa or a dramatic increase in case detection, but these scenarios lack strong evidence as of May 2025[2][3][5].",
        "22":"(a) Time left until outcome: Less than 7 weeks (until July 1, 2025)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: None of the Millennium Prize Problems have been solved by AI systems as of today.\n\n(c) Scenario for No outcome: AI systems continue to make incremental progress in mathematical reasoning but fail to achieve the breakthrough capabilities needed to solve problems that have stumped the world's best mathematicians for decades. The remaining time is too short for the necessary advancements, verification, and peer review process.\n\n(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: A company like Harmonic, which has been specifically targeting mathematical superintelligence, announces a breakthrough solution to one of the \"easier\" Millennium Prize Problems in the coming weeks. The solution is quickly verified by the mathematical community and published in reputable journals.\n\nAs a professional forecaster, I need to provide a calibrated assessment of whether an AI system will solve one of the remaining Millennium Prize Problems before July 1, 2025. With less than 7 weeks remaining until the deadline, I'll analyze the available information and provide my forecast.\n\n## Current Status of AI and Millennium Prize Problems\n\nThe Millennium Prize Problems represent some of the most challenging unsolved problems in mathematics. As of today, May 12, 2025, none of the remaining six problems has been solved by an AI system[1][3]. The only problem solved so far was the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, which was solved by mathematician Grigori Perelman in 2003, not by an AI system[3].\n\nSeveral prediction markets and forecasting platforms have addressed this question:\n- Metaculus has an open question about whether an AI will solve a Millennium Prize Problem before July 2025[1]\n- Manifold Markets has a similar question with a deadline of June 2025[3]\n\nAccording to Manifold Markets, forecasters have placed this probability at a very low level - around 5%[3]. This reflects the general consensus that while AI has made progress in mathematical reasoning, solving a Millennium Prize Problem represents a significant leap beyond current capabilities.\n\n## Recent AI Developments in Mathematics\n\nThere are some signs of progress in AI mathematical reasoning:\n\n- Harmonic, a company founded in 2023 by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Tudor Achim, is specifically focused on building Mathematical Superintelligence (MSI)[4]\n- Harmonic has developed a system that achieves 90% on MiniF2F, a formal mathematics benchmark[4]\n- The company has secured $75 million in funding to accelerate its development of AI with superior mathematical capabilities[4]\n\nHowever, achieving 90% on a benchmark is still far from solving problems that have resisted solution by the world's top mathematicians for decades. The search results do not indicate that any AI system has made significant progress toward solving any of the specific Millennium Prize Problems.\n\n## Time Constraints and Verification Requirements\n\nWith less than 7 weeks remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, there are significant time constraints:\n\n1. An AI would need to produce a solution immediately\n2. The solution would need to be verified by experts\n3. At least two reputable papers would need to be published showing the solution is correct[3]\n4. The mathematical community would need to reach consensus on the validity of the solution\n\nThe typical timeline for peer review and consensus-building in mathematics for groundbreaking results often takes months or years, not weeks.\n\n## Weighing the Status Quo\n\nAs a forecaster, I recognize the importance of anchoring on the status quo. Mathematical breakthroughs of this magnitude are rare events, and the problems have remained unsolved despite decades of effort by brilliant human mathematicians.\n\nWhile AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, there is no concrete evidence from the search results that any AI system is on the verge of solving a Millennium Prize Problem. The Manifold Markets estimate of around 5% probability seems reasonable given the information available[3].\n\nIn fact, according to a conversation referenced in the search results, even optimistic AI researchers seem to be forecasting AI-human collaborations solving a Millennium Prize Problem around 2028, not before July 2025[5].\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nConsidering:\n- The extremely challenging nature of the remaining problems\n- The lack of reported significant progress by AI on any specific Millennium Prize Problem\n- The short timeframe remaining before the deadline\n- The verification requirements that would need to be satisfied\n- The status quo bias that appropriately applies to rare breakthrough events\n\nProbability: 3%",
        "23":"(a) Time left until outcome: The outcome must be determined before January 1, 2026, which is approximately 7.5 months from today (May 9, 2025).\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: If no legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026, the outcome will be \"No sunset reduction before 2026.\" Currently, the 45X credit is scheduled to begin phasing out in 2030, with gradual reductions until full phase-out in 2033.\n\n(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: An unexpected outcome could emerge if economic conditions significantly worsen in the coming months, creating urgent pressure for budget cuts across all sectors. This might force a compromise where Republicans agree to preserve some clean energy tax credits but implement a more aggressive sunset for 45X (such as a 2028 or 2029 sunset) rather than the initially proposed 2025-2026 or 2027 options.\n\nBased on the available information, here's my analysis of the situation regarding the 45X clean energy manufacturing tax credit:\n\nThe 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit is a significant component of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, providing substantial financial incentives for manufacturers producing clean energy components domestically[1][4]. As of May 2025, we're observing a political tension between the Republican administration's stated goal to roll back clean energy initiatives and the practical reality that many Republican-controlled districts have benefited economically from these tax credits.\n\nThe credit is currently scheduled to begin phasing out in 2030, but with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress and the presidency since November 2024, there's strong political pressure to modify this timeline. However, several factors complicate an immediate or full repeal:\n\n1. A bloc of at least 21 Republican representatives has explicitly opposed eliminating these incentives, citing concerns about disrupting ongoing projects and investments[5].\n\n2. The slim Republican majority in the House (only 7 seats) means that party leadership cannot afford significant defections when voting on budget reconciliation.\n\n3. Manufacturing interests are particularly well-represented in Congress, and the 45X credit specifically supports domestic manufacturing, making it one of the more politically defensible components of the IRA[4].\n\nThe search results indicate that eligible entities can claim the Section 45X credit when the sale of eligible components to an unrelated person occurs in 2025[2]. This suggests the credit is actively being utilized in the current tax year, creating immediate economic stakeholders who would resist sudden changes.\n\nGiven these factors, I assess the following probabilities:\n\n2025-2026 sunset: 30%\nThis represents either a full repeal or the most aggressive sunset option. While the Republican leadership might push strongly for this to demonstrate commitment to their fossil fuel agenda, the significant Republican opposition in the House makes this challenging. However, it remains possible through intense negotiation or by packaging it with other concessions.\n\n2027 sunset: 35%\nThis represents a compromise position that would allow Republicans to claim a significant rollback of the IRA while giving businesses more time to adjust. Given the need to maintain party unity and the expressed preference for phasing out rather than immediate repeal, this emerges as the most politically viable option.\n\n2028 sunset: 15%\nThis more moderate rollback could emerge as a compromise if negotiations become particularly difficult, or if economic data suggests more drastic cuts would harm manufacturing sectors in key districts.\n\n2029 sunset: 5%\nThis minimal rollback is unlikely given the Republican administration's stated priorities, but remains possible if other budget priorities take precedence and only symbolic action on 45X is deemed necessary.\n\nNo sunset reduction before 2026: 15%\nLegislative gridlock remains a real possibility. Given the narrow margins in Congress and the complexity of budget reconciliation, it's entirely possible that no agreement on 45X will be reached before the January 2026 deadline. The status quo has staying power, especially when changes require overcoming significant political hurdles.\n\n2025-2026 sunset: 30%\n2027 sunset: 35%\n2028 sunset: 15%\n2029 sunset: 5%\nNo sunset reduction before 2026: 15%",
        "24":"(a) Time left until the outcome is known: Approximately 7 months and 20 days (from May 10, 2025 to January 1, 2026)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: \"No sunset reduction before 2026\" - The 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit would maintain its original sunset date of 2032 (or when U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity reach \u226425% of 2022 levels).\n\n(c) Description of an unexpected outcome scenario: Despite Republican control of Congress and the White House, a coalition of Republican representatives from states benefiting significantly from clean energy investments (particularly those from Nevada, Wyoming, Georgia, and Kentucky) forms an alliance with Democrats to block attempts to repeal or significantly curtail the 45Y tax credit. This unexpected cross-party alliance recognizes the economic benefits their districts are receiving from clean energy projects and successfully prevents any sunset reduction.\n\n## Rationale for Forecast\n\nThe 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit is a technology-neutral tax credit designed to incentivize the production of clean electricity with zero greenhouse gas emissions. Based on the available information, this credit is just beginning its implementation phase, with the credit becoming available for qualified facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024[1][3].\n\n### Political Context\n\nThe current political landscape includes Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, which creates a favorable environment for potential modifications to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including the 45Y credit. Republicans have historically opposed parts of the IRA, particularly its clean energy provisions, citing concerns about costs.\n\nHowever, there are several countervailing factors:\n\n1. **Economic Benefits in Republican Districts**: More than half of announced clean energy projects are located in Republican congressional districts. States like Nevada, Wyoming, Kentucky, and Georgia have seen significant clean energy investments as a percentage of GDP. This creates political incentives for some Republicans to preserve these credits.\n\n2. **Job Creation**: The IRA has reportedly led to a 14% increase in clean energy jobs since its enactment, creating strong economic interest groups that would oppose repeal.\n\n3. **Implementation Timeline**: The 45Y credit only becomes available for facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024. Given that we are currently in May 2025, the program has just begun implementation, making an immediate repeal potentially disruptive to projects already in development.\n\n4. **Time Constraints**: With approximately 7-8 months left until the January 1, 2026 resolution date, Congress has limited time to pass significant tax legislation, especially considering other potential legislative priorities.\n\n### Forecast Analysis\n\nWhen assessing probabilities, I need to consider both the political likelihood of action and the specific form that action might take:\n\n**No sunset reduction before 2026 (Status quo)**: There's a substantial probability that no legislation affecting the 45Y credit will be enacted before January 1, 2026. This could happen due to congressional gridlock, competing priorities, or recognition of economic benefits.\n\n**2029-2031 sunset with safe harbor**: If modifications occur, a moderate sunset reduction with safe harbor provisions seems most likely, as it would balance Republican desires to curtail the program while protecting existing investments and projects already in development.\n\n**More aggressive sunset reductions**: While the Republican trifecta creates conditions for more aggressive action, the economic benefits in Republican districts and the newness of the program make very early sunset dates (2025-2026) less likely than moderate reductions.\n\n**Safe harbor provisions**: If sunset reductions occur, including safe harbor provisions is more likely than not, as they protect existing investments and reduce economic disruption, making the legislation more politically palatable.\n\n### Final Probabilities\n\nI've weighted the status quo outcome heavily due to the principle that significant policy changes often face hurdles and the limited time window for action. I've assigned moderate probabilities to outcomes that balance political feasibility with economic interests, and smaller probabilities to more extreme outcomes.\n\n2025-2026 sunset w\/o safe harbor: 5%\n2025-2026 sunset w\/ safe harbor: 10%\n2027-2028 sunset w\/o safe harbor: 8%\n2027-2028 sunset w\/ safe harbor: 12%\n2029-2031 sunset w\/o safe harbor: 10%\n2029-2031 sunset w\/ safe harbor: 15%\nNo sunset reduction before 2026: 40%",
        "25":"(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  \nThe outcome will be determined by May 1, 2026, or earlier if a qualifying public statement of Powell\u2019s forced removal is made. As of May 9, 2025, there are just under 12 months remaining.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends persist\u2014meaning Trump continues to express dissatisfaction but does not make a public, official move to terminate Powell\u2014the outcome is \"No attempt\" to fire Powell before his scheduled term ends.\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  \nTrump continues to publicly criticize Powell and apply political pressure, but stops short of making a formal or public statement that Powell is terminated, dismissed, or forcibly replaced. Powell remains in his position until his term expires in May 2026.\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  \nTrump or an authorized administration official publicly announces Powell's forced removal as FRB or FOMC Chair before May 2026, or names a successor in a manner that clearly signals Powell was replaced involuntarily. This could occur regardless of whether legal challenges prevent the removal from taking effect.\n\n## Rationale and Probability Assessment\n\nRecent developments show an extraordinary level of public criticism and threats from President Trump toward Chair Powell, including explicit statements that Powell\u2019s \u201ctermination cannot come fast enough\u201d[1][2][3]. Trump\u2019s administration is reportedly studying the legality and logistics of firing Powell[2]. However, the legal consensus remains that, under existing law, a Fed Chair can only be removed for \u201ccause\u201d\u2014generally interpreted as misconduct rather than a policy dispute[1]. Powell himself has stated that presidential removal is \"not permitted under the law,\" and most experts\u2014citing Supreme Court precedent\u2014agree[1].\n\nDespite this, the Trump administration has fired officials at other independent agencies, signaling a willingness to challenge or reinterpret established norms and legal protections for agency heads[1][2]. Still, no president has ever publicly attempted to fire a Fed Chair, and such a move would create major political and market turbulence[1][3]. Recent statements from Trump, while highly critical, have at times suggested he may wait for Powell\u2019s term to expire, noting in interviews that he can replace Powell in a \u201cshort period of time\u201d and asking rhetorically, \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d[3][4].\n\nThe status quo strongly favors \u201cno attempt\u201d\u2014presidential threats and insults, but no official act of termination. However, a non-negligible risk remains given Trump\u2019s pattern of norm-breaking and the administration\u2019s ongoing legal review. The actual bar for this question (\u201can official public statement by Trump or the US government terminating or replacing Powell before May 2026\u201d) is high, but not insurmountable\u2014especially if economic events or political frustrations escalate.\n\nGiven the above, the most likely outcome is that no formal firing attempt will be made before Powell\u2019s term expires, but the probability is higher than in any prior administration.\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
        "26":"(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  \nThere are nearly 8 months remaining until January 1, 2026, the deadline for resolution.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nAs of May 9, 2025, Anthropic has not officially announced the release of a Claude 4 model[1][5]. If this state persists\u2014with no official release or announcement\u2014then the outcome would be **No**.\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  \nAnthropic does not publish any document, blog post, article, or video announcing a successor to the Claude 3\/3.7 series before January 1, 2026. Even if rumors, leaks, or incremental updates (such as to the Claude 3.x line) circulate, unless Anthropic officially discloses the existence and performance of a new major version and brands it as a next-generation model, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  \nBefore January 1, 2026, Anthropic publicly announces\u2014via an official document\u2014a model that is explicitly presented as the successor to the Claude 3\/3.7 family. The announcement includes a new major version designation (e.g., \"Claude 4,\" \"Claude Next\"), and describes performance results or confirms the new model's existence, regardless of whether it is generally available. The announcement could occur via a blog post, press release, or at a major industry event.\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Historical cadence and industry signals:** Anthropic has shown a pattern of releasing major model updates roughly every 12\u201318 months, with incremental improvements between major versions[5]. Industry buzz and credible rumors point to a strong likelihood of a major release within 2025, possibly as early as mid-year[1][4][5].\n- **Competitive pressures:** The rapid progress of competing labs (OpenAI, Google DeepMind) incentivizes Anthropic to maintain its innovation pace. The deployment of new features, partnerships (e.g., with Google Cloud), and expansion of research programs signals ongoing investment in flagship models[2][3].\n- **Recent rumors and leaks:** Multiple sources as of early 2025 have suggested that the tech world is expecting Claude 4 to arrive soon, with some expecting an announcement as early as Q1 or Q2 2025[1][4][5]. However, all reputable sources agree that, as of now, no official announcement has been made.\n- **Weight for status quo:** Good forecasting practice emphasizes that most of the time, major changes take longer than enthusiasts expect.

        "27":"Based on the current date of May 12, 2025, I'll analyze whether the US will pass a federal AI regulation bill before January 1, 2026.\n\n(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 7 months and 19 days (until January 1, 2026)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No comprehensive federal AI regulation bill passed\n\n(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Congress remains focused on narrower AI legislation addressing specific issues (like cybersecurity or employment) rather than comprehensive regulation. The current administration's deregulatory approach continues to impede broader regulatory efforts. States continue developing their own patchwork of AI laws.\n\n(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: A major AI-related incident creates urgent bipartisan pressure for federal action. Congressional leadership prioritizes comprehensive AI legislation, fast-tracking it through committees. The administration shifts position to support regulation in response to public concern, allowing passage before year-end.\n\nIn analyzing the likelihood of federal AI regulation by January 1, 2026, I need to consider the current regulatory landscape and political environment.\n\n## Current Regulatory Status\n\nThe United States currently lacks comprehensive federal AI regulation, operating instead under a patchwork system of state laws, executive actions, and sector-specific regulations. As of early 2025, this fragmented approach continues despite increasing AI development and adoption across sectors[5].\n\nIn January 2025, the current administration issued an executive order specifically designed to remove \"barriers to American leadership in Artificial Intelligence,\" revoking previous AI policies that had established more regulatory guardrails[4]. This represents a significant shift toward deregulation at the federal executive level.\n\n## Legislative Activity and Momentum\n\nThe legislative picture shows mixed signals:\n\nEarly 2025 has seen an acceleration in AI-related legislative proposals at both federal and state levels. Just in the opening days of 2025, more than 40 AI-related proposals were introduced across different jurisdictions, building on the momentum from 2024 when lawmakers introduced over 700 AI-related bills nationwide[5].\n\nHowever, the 119th Congress appears more focused on other technology issues like online speech and child safety rather than comprehensive AI consumer protection regulation[5]. This prioritization suggests that while interest exists, AI regulation may not be at the top of the legislative agenda.\n\nStates are actively filling the regulatory void. Colorado enacted its AI Act in 2024, while other states like California and Texas have pursued different regulatory approaches, with California focusing on frontier model risks and Texas proposing more expansive consumer protection measures[5].\n\n## Political Environment\n\nThe current political configuration presents both opportunities and challenges:\n\nWith one party controlling both the White House and Congress after the recent election, there is potential for coordinated action[5]. However, the administration's January 2025 executive order signals a clear preference for minimal regulatory intervention in AI development[4].\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has included AI in its 2025 examination priorities, indicating that regulatory attention is occurring at the agency level even without comprehensive legislation[2]. This pattern of agency-level action could potentially reduce pressure for comprehensive legislative solutions.\n\n## Timing Considerations\n\nWith less than eight months remaining before the January 1, 2026 deadline, the timeline for passing comprehensive legislation is tight:\n\nFor a bill to pass, it would need to be introduced, make it through committee review in both chambers, pass both the House and Senate (potentially with reconciliation if versions differ), and receive presidential signature \u2013 all before year's end. The legislative process typically moves slowly, especially for complex regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe first quarter of 2025 has already seen legislative and regulatory developments related to AI[3], but these appear to be narrower in scope rather than the comprehensive regulation required to satisfy the question criteria.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nThe status quo strongly suggests that comprehensive federal AI regulation is not imminent. Several factors support this view:\n\n1. The current administration's explicit deregulatory approach creates significant headwinds for comprehensive regulation\n2. Congress appears more focused on other technology priorities\n3. The limited timeframe makes passage of complex legislation challenging\n4. The continuing development of state-level approaches and agency-specific guidance reduces urgency for federal action\n\nWhile interest in AI regulation exists and legislative activity continues, the specific criteria for this question require a general AI regulation bill (not domain-specific) to be passed and signed into law before January 1, 2026. Based on current trends and the political environment, this outcome appears unlikely.\n\nProbability: 20%",
        "28":"Based on the available information, I'll address this forecasting question with a structured approach:\n\n(a) Time left until outcome is known: 3 months and 4 days (from May 12, 2025, until the August 15, 2025 TSE registration deadline)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Lula is the incumbent president but has not officially registered as a candidate for the 2026 election.\n\n(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Lula, who will be 80 in 2026, decides his age is too advanced for another term and endorses a successor from within the PT, potentially finance minister Fernando Haddad or former Bahia governor Rui Costa, despite their lower popularity. Health concerns could also prompt his withdrawal, or he might respond to the 58% of voters who don't want him to run again.\n\n(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Lacking a viable successor with comparable popularity, and facing pressure from his party, Lula decides to run again to prevent the right from regaining power. His 52% potential voter support (the highest among tested candidates) convinces him that he remains the left's best chance for electoral victory.\n\nI'll now provide my rationale and probability assessment:\n\nThe question of whether Lula will be a candidate for president of Brazil in 2026 requires careful examination of the evidence. As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the current political landscape, historical precedents, and key indicators.\n\n## Current Political Context\n\nThe Brazilian political landscape shows Lula as the dominant figure on the left with no clear successor in sight. According to recent polling data, Lula has emerged as the political figure with the highest potential for voter support among ten names tested, with 52% saying they know and would vote for him[4]. This strong position gives him a significant advantage over potential rivals.\n\nHowever, there are concerning signs for Lula's candidacy. His disapproval rating reached 53% in March 2025, with 44% of voters believing his administration is worse than Bolsonaro's[5]. Nearly 60% of voters say they do not trust him, and there's widespread dissatisfaction with the government's performance in all areas of federal administration[5].\n\n## Succession Planning Challenges\n\nThe Workers' Party (PT) faces a significant succession planning problem. By 2026, Lula will be 80 years old, and while he has previously stated he would not run for the presidency again, the lack of viable alternatives puts pressure on him to reconsider[3]. \n\nFernando Haddad, currently serving as Lula's finance minister, lacks the necessary popular appeal despite his economic achievements[3]. Other potential candidates like Gleisi Hoffmann (PT president) and Rui Costa (former governor of Bahia) also pale in comparison to Lula's popularity[3]. This leadership vacuum creates strong internal pressure for Lula to run again.\n\n## Opposition Landscape\n\nThe right-wing opposition to Lula is currently weakened. Former President Jair Bolsonaro, who would be Lula's main competitor, is facing legal challenges. In March 2025, the Supreme Court unanimously accepted Bolsonaro's indictment for conspiring to commit a coup to reverse the 2022 election results[3]. He is currently ineligible to run until 2030[4].\n\nBolsonaro's removal from the electoral landscape significantly changes the calculus for Lula. Without his main rival, Lula might feel less pressure to run personally, potentially opening the door for succession. Alternatively, he might see it as an opportunity to secure another term with reduced opposition.\n\n## Historical Precedents and Age Considerations\n\nAt 80 years old in 2026, Lula would be among the oldest presidential candidates globally. While advanced age is not disqualifying (as demonstrated by other world leaders), it does raise questions about stamina for a full term and potential health concerns. This factor cannot be dismissed in Lula's personal calculations.\n\n## Weighing Status Quo and Institutional Factors\n\nThe status quo in Brazilian politics tends toward incumbent advantage. Brazilian presidents typically seek reelection when constitutionally permitted, and parties rarely voluntarily surrender incumbent advantage. The PT's institutional interest strongly favors Lula's candidacy given the lack of alternatives.\n\nHowever, public opinion shows complexity - a majority (58%) believes Lula should not run for reelection, while 40% support another candidacy. This split opinion could factor into his decision-making process.\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nWeighing these factors, I find that the strongest evidence points toward Lula becoming a candidate in 2026:\n\n1. The PT lacks a viable successor with comparable popularity\n2. Bolsonaro's legal troubles weaken the opposition\n3. Lula maintains the highest potential voter support among tested candidates\n4. Historical precedent favors incumbent candidacy\n\nThe main factors that could prevent his candidacy are his advanced age and potentially declining popularity. However, given the Brazilian left's continued reliance on his leadership and the absence of a clear alternative, these concerns are likely to be outweighed by political necessity.\n\nApplying appropriate weight to the status quo and institutional factors, while acknowledging the uncertainty introduced by Lula's age and declining approval ratings, I arrive at my final assessment.\n\nProbability: 70%",
        "29":"(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**  \nThere are about 7 months and 3 weeks remaining until January 1, 2026, which is the deadline for legislation to be enacted that would eliminate the transferability of any of the specified clean energy tax credits.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**  \nIf no further legislative action occurs, the transferability of the \u00a748E (ITC), \u00a745Y (PTC), and \u00a745X (AMPC) tax credits will continue as currently authorized under the Inflation Reduction Act and associated IRS regulations[3][5]. Transferability remains available for qualifying entities for tax years including 2026.\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**  \nA No outcome arises if, by January 1, 2026, Congress does not pass, and the President does not sign, legislation that eliminates the transferability of any of these credits. This could occur even if legislative debate continues or if Congress passes other modifications to the credits (such as reducing rates, accelerating phase-outs, or restricting eligibility) but does not touch the transferability provisions themselves[1][4].\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**  \nA Yes outcome requires that, before January 1, 2026, Congress and the President enact a law that specifically eliminates the ability to transfer (sell) at least one of these tax credits (\u00a748E, \u00a745Y, \u00a745X). This could be accomplished by full repeal of one or more credits, or by amending the Internal Revenue Code (specifically, Section 6418 or related provisions) to remove or substantially limit the statutory transferability for newly awarded credits[1][4].\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Status Quo Advantage:** There is strong inertia behind the legislative status quo. Historically, large-scale repeal or reversal of major tax provisions within a few years of enactment is rare and difficult, even with single-party control, due to industry opposition, economic impacts, and stakeholder adaptation[1][3].\n- **Congressional Complexity:** While the new administration and congressional majorities have publicly considered rolling back IRA credits and specifically debated the possibility of targeting transferability, there is no evidence\u2014public reporting, IRS guidance, or finalized legislation as of May 2025\u2014that such action has been taken[1][3][4].\n- **Legislative Process:** Budget reconciliation is the likeliest pathway for changes, but even in that process, negotiations often lead to partial rather than full rollbacks. Stakeholder influence and the attractiveness of transferability (which cuts project finance costs and aids economic development in red and blue states alike) provide significant political barriers to outright elimination[1].\n- **Market Forces:** The transferability market is rapidly expanding, with projections of $50B in deals in 2025 and up to $100B in 2026[5]. Many projects in the pipeline and substantial industry investments rely on these rules, making sudden regulatory whiplash risky and less probable.\n- **Precedents:** If changes are enacted, historical precedent suggests they would likely apply prospectively (to projects started or credits earned after a future date) rather than retroactively, and outright repeal of transferability seems less likely than other forms of credit reductions or modifications[1].\n\n---\n\n## Final Probability Estimate\n\nGiven the above\u2014strong status quo inertia; no enacted legislation as of May 2025; complex, multi-faceted stakeholder interests; and ongoing, but not yet conclusive, negotiations\u2014the most likely outcome is that transferability will **not** be eliminated before January 1, 2026.\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
        "30":"(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  \nThere are approximately 8 months remaining until the outcome is determined; the IBEX 35 will be evaluated on the final trading day of December 2025.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nThe IBEX 35 closed February 2025 at 13,347.3 points, well above the threshold of 11,595.00. If the index remains near this level or higher, the outcome would be \"Yes\"\u2014it would close 2025 above the threshold[5].\n\n(c) **Brief scenario for a No outcome:**  \nA \"No\" outcome (IBEX 35 closes at or below 11,595.00) would require a significant market drawdown\u2014over a 13% decline from current levels. This could result from a combination of negative shocks such as a sharp economic slowdown in Spain or the eurozone, adverse geopolitical events, a banking crisis, or a reversal of central bank policy leading to higher interest rates, all of which could weigh heavily on Spanish equities[5].\n\n(d) **Brief scenario for a Yes outcome:**  \nA \"Yes\" outcome (above 11,595.00) would occur if the IBEX 35 maintains its current trajectory or experiences moderate gains or only small declines. Continuation of resilient economic growth in Spain (projected at 2.3% for 2025), ongoing strength in the banking sector (a major index component), and a stable or accommodative policy environment from the ECB would support this scenario[1][5].\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe IBEX 35 has exhibited strong momentum: after an impressive 23% rise in 2023 and nearly 15% in 2024, it has continued to outperform major European peers into 2025. As of February, it sits roughly 15% above the critical threshold, reflecting robust performance especially from the banking sector, which has benefited from the ECB\u2019s rate cuts and Spain\u2019s relatively strong GDP growth[5].  \n\nMost 2025 forecasts are positive:\n- Analytical projections put the year-end value as high as 14,945.61[1].\n- Even conservative outlooks do not foresee declines below current levels[4].\n- Economic fundamentals remain favorable compared to broader Europe, though risks such as global trade tensions, sectoral weaknesses, and unexpected policy shifts persist[5].\n\nMarket declines of 13% or more from here are possible but statistically uncommon absent major negative catalysts. While caution is always warranted and shocks are possible, historical patterns and current indicators suggest the status quo (an outcome above 11,595.00) has elevated likelihood. Good forecasters assign extra weight to the status quo, especially when recent economic and market data show resilience.\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
        "31":"(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  \nThere are approximately 52 days remaining until July 1, 2025, when the question will be resolved.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nAs of May 9, 2025, credible media and official statements report that the death toll from overt military conflict between India and Pakistan since May 1, 2025, is at least 50, primarily due to Indian air strikes in Pakistan on May 7-8, 2025[5][1][4]. The most widely cited official Pakistani figures state 31 civilians killed and 57 injured in these strikes, with some reports of additional deaths from ongoing artillery exchanges[1][4][5]. No official or widely agreed count has yet reached 100 deaths since May 1, 2025, from overtly flagged military actions by the two states. If the pattern of sporadic cross-border fire and brief escalatory air strikes continues\u2014without major further escalation\u2014the most likely outcome is that the death toll may remain below 100 by July 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  \nAfter the recent air strikes and artillery exchanges in early May, both sides, possibly influenced by international diplomatic interventions and mutual deterrence, refrain from further large-scale overt military action. Cross-border shelling and isolated incidents continue but with relatively low lethality, and cumulative deaths from military conflict (as defined by the resolution criteria) do not reach 100 by the end of June 2025.\n\n(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  \nEscalation continues or resumes: either side launches additional air or missile strikes, or artillery exchanges intensify across multiple sectors along the border or Line of Control. Given the geographic spread and capabilities of both militaries, one or more significant kinetic actions could quickly push the cumulative death toll over 100. This could include a single high-casualty event (such as a strike on a military post or civilian area) or a series of deadly skirmishes in the coming weeks.\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Recent Death Toll:** As of May 9, 2025, the best-documented and broadly accepted death toll from military-on-military or military-on-civilian kinetic actions by flagged forces since May 1 is estimated at over 50 (with official Pakistani figures at 31 from Indian air strikes plus at least 5 from artillery, and Indian claims of further casualties)[5][1][4]. However, there is no single, widely recognized total yet at or above 100.\n- **Historical Pattern:** Past India-Pakistan escalations have occasionally produced death tolls exceeding 100 in weeks, but also have sometimes plateaued below this threshold due to de-escalatory diplomatic moves and international pressure.\n- **Current Trends:** The escalation over the past two weeks has been rapid and already deadly, but both sides have reasons to avoid further escalation\u2014nuclear deterrence, economic pressures, and diplomatic interventions (notably from the US and China)[3]. There is evidence of international calls for restraint.\n- **Information Uncertainty:** There are discrepancies in death toll reporting, with some sources citing 150+ casualties but official Pakistani sources downgrading these to 31 civilian deaths and 57 injuries; India claims 15 civilian deaths and 57 injuries from Pakistani shelling in Indian-administered Kashmir[4]. The Metaculus criteria stress the importance of claims from credible, independent sources.\n- **Momentum:** The threshold of 100 deaths could be crossed with only one or two further significant skirmishes if escalation continues. However, if both countries pause further escalatory actions after the May 7-8 strikes, it is plausible the total will remain below 100.\n\n## Final Probability\n\nGiven the current death toll just above 50 and the acute but potentially stabilizing situation\u2014balancing the risks of renewed escalation with strong incentives for pause and de-escalation\u2014the status quo slightly favors a \"No\" outcome. However, the high risk of sudden further escalation means the odds for \"Yes\" are significant and rising.\n\n**Probability: 55%**",
        "32":"(a) Time until outcome: The question resolves once legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026, affecting the 48E clean electricity tax credit, or by default on January 1, 2026, if no legislation is enacted. This gives approximately 7.5 months from today (May 10, 2025) until the resolution deadline.\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: \"No sunset reduction before 2026\" - This would occur if Congress takes no action to modify or repeal the 48E tax credit before January 1, 2026. Currently, 48E is scheduled to begin for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2025, and phase out at the later of 2032 or when U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity reach 25% of 2022 levels.\n\n(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: Despite Republican control of Congress and the White House, a coalition of moderate Republicans from districts with significant clean energy investments, combined with all Democrats, could block attempts to fully repeal the credits. Instead, they might negotiate a compromise creating a longer transition period (2029-2031 sunset) with safe harbor provisions to protect ongoing projects, surprising those who expected a quick repeal or short sunset.\n\nBased on the available information, I'll assess the probabilities for each outcome:\n\nThe recent search results indicate significant political attention on the future of clean energy tax credits following the Republican electoral victories. While a \"full-scale repeal of energy credits seems unlikely,\" organizations should plan for \"some changes\"[1]. The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E) has been specifically identified as being \"attacked\" along with the 45Y Production Credit[4].\n\nEconomic analyses suggest that repealing these credits would have significant impacts. Reports from The Brattle Group and NERA Economic Consulting indicate that full repeal would increase electricity prices nationwide by 9.2% across all sectors by 2029 and could reduce direct spending in the power sector by $250 billion through 2035[5]. This economic impact provides a counterweight against immediate repeal.\n\nThe current political landscape features Republicans with slim majorities, especially in the House where they hold just a 5-seat advantage. Many representatives come from districts benefiting from renewable energy investments and face re-election in 2026. This suggests political caution among some Republicans about aggressive action against energy credits.\n\nThe most likely outcomes involve some form of earlier sunset or modification rather than complete repeal without protections. The corporate law firm Crowell & Moring has assessed 48E as a \"moderate\" risk of repeal[4], indicating significant but not overwhelming probability of elimination.\n\nGiven the recent implementation of the final rules for 48E in early 2025[3] and the significant investments already made in anticipation of these credits, a compromise approach with safe harbor provisions seems more politically feasible than immediate termination without protections for ongoing projects.\n\nThe budget reconciliation process allows Republicans to modify these tax credits with a simple majority vote, making some action likely, but the narrow margins in Congress suggest moderation rather than extremism in the approach.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I'll now provide my probabilistic forecast:\n\n2025-2026 sunset w\/o safe harbor: 10%\n2025-2026 sunset w\/ safe harbor: 25%\n2027-2028 sunset w\/o safe harbor: 15%\n2027-2028 sunset w\/ safe harbor: 20%\n2029-2031 sunset w\/o safe harbor: 5%\n2029-2031 sunset w\/ safe harbor: 10%\nNo sunset reduction before 2026: 15%",

Its immediate competitors, particularly Deutsche Telekom and Siemens, also maintain or grow their market caps, either outpacing or holding their lead over Inditex. Market headwinds such as currency volatility, weaker consumer spending, or sector underperformance prevent Inditex from closing the gap[1][2].\n\n(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  \nInditex outperforms current expectations, potentially through a mix of rapid sales growth, higher profitability, and positive investor sentiment. Alternatively, one or more current top 10 companies (especially those just above Inditex like Deutsche Telekom or Siemens) experiences a material decline in market cap due to sector-specific setbacks, macroeconomic shock, or other negative catalysts. A strong run in Inditex\u2019s share price\u2014perhaps due to unexpectedly robust earnings, online channel expansion, or operational breakthroughs\u2014could allow it to overtake at least one competitor and break into the top 10[3][5].\n\n## Rationale\n\nInditex is performing strongly, with 2024 net profit up 9% and robust growth in both physical and online sales channels[3][4][5]. The company is investing nearly \u20ac1.8 billion in 2025 to optimize stores and technology, which may bolster its competitive position and efficiency[4][5]. However, its start to 2025 has been somewhat softer than anticipated, with Q1 sales growth below expectations and share price reflecting this weaker momentum[1][4]. \n\nInditex remains closely behind current top 10 companies, but with only a few billion dollars separating it from 10th place, its advance depends not just on its own execution but also on movements by immediate competitors. External risks\u2014such as currency headwinds and sector-specific market volatility\u2014mean the status quo outcome (11th place) should be heavily weighted. Unless there is either a substantial positive surprise for Inditex or an unexpected drop for a competitor, significant movement in the rankings is uncommon over just a few quarters[2].\n\n## Final Answer\n\nProbability: **35%**\n\nThere is a meaningful chance Inditex could break into the top 10 by the end of 2025, but the status quo and underlying sector dynamics make it more likely that it remains just outside, barring an outsized positive surprise or negative shock for a competitor[1][2][3][4][5].",
        "34":"Looking at the question about a new SARS-CoV-2 variant causing at least 20,000 daily COVID hospitalizations in the US before July 1, 2025, I'll analyze this carefully.\n\n(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 weeks (from May 12, 2025 to July 1, 2025)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: Based on current data, COVID-19 hospitalizations are at relatively low levels. The CovidHub ensemble forecasts approximately 3,900 weekly (not daily) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions nationally for the week ending May 17, 2025, down from 4,400 admissions for the week ending May 3, 2025[2]. This translates to roughly 557-629 daily hospitalizations, far below the 20,000 threshold.\n\n(c) No outcome scenario: COVID-19 variants continue to circulate but none are classified as a VOC before July 1. Hospitalizations remain at current levels or follow typical seasonal patterns with modest increases. Population immunity from vaccination and prior infection remains sufficient to prevent severe disease in most people. No variant emerges with significant immune escape or increased severity properties.\n\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: A highly transmissible new variant with substantial immune escape emerges and is quickly classified as a VOC. This variant spreads rapidly across the US, causing a steep surge in hospitalizations that overwhelms the typical seasonal patterns. The variant causes more severe disease or affects previously protected populations, leading to daily hospitalizations exceeding 20,000 before July 1.\n\nLooking at the current data, the CovidHub ensemble forecast predicts weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions will be approximately 3,900 nationally for the week ending May 17, 2025[2]. This represents a decrease from the 4,400 admissions reported for the week ending May 3, 2025. The forecast range spans from 2,000 to 6,200 admissions, showing considerable uncertainty but still far below the threshold needed for a \"Yes\" outcome[2].\n\nHistorical data provides important context. During the 2024-2025 season, as of January 29, 2025, the overall rate of COVID-19-related hospitalizations was 38.0 per 100,000 people[4]. Among hospitalized patients, 18.4% required ICU care, 8.4% needed mechanical ventilation, and 6.9% died while hospitalized[4]. These figures reflect the continued severity of COVID-19 among those who develop serious illness but don't suggest we're on a trajectory toward 20,000 daily hospitalizations.\n\nSeveral factors make a \"Yes\" outcome unlikely in the short timeframe remaining:\n\n1. No current indication of an emerging VOC in the search results\n2. Current hospitalization trends are stable or declining\n3. The substantial gap between current levels (hundreds of daily hospitalizations) and the threshold (20,000)\n4. The short timeframe (7 weeks) provides limited opportunity for a new variant to emerge, be classified as a VOC, spread widely, and cause such a dramatic hospitalization surge\n\nWhile COVID-19 has demonstrated the ability to produce surprise variants with increased transmissibility and immune evasion, the magnitude and speed of change required to reach 20,000 daily hospitalizations by July 1 would be unprecedented given the current baseline. The status quo strongly suggests hospitalizations will remain well below this threshold.\n\nProbability: 5%",
        "35":"(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 4 months (from May 12, 2025 until the September 2025 parliamentary elections)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: No official referendum on EU membership has been announced by the Norwegian government.\n\n(c) Scenario for No outcome: The current political leadership maintains its position of ruling out a renewed EU debate despite increased public interest. Coalition politics and the upcoming election cause parties to avoid potentially divisive issues, focusing instead on immediate economic concerns and the fallout from the January 2025 government collapse over EU energy rules.\n\n(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Increasing trade tensions with the US and growing public support for EU membership (now at 41%) create urgent political pressure. The Conservative opposition led by Erna Solberg successfully leverages the issue ahead of September elections, forcing the current government to announce a referendum to prevent losing electoral support on the issue.\n\n---\n\nBased on the available information, I need to assess the probability of Norway announcing an official referendum on EU accession before September 2025.\n\n## Current Political Landscape\n\nThe Norwegian political environment regarding EU membership shows increased interest but remains divided. Support for EU membership has risen considerably in recent months, reaching 41% in early 2025, up from 27% in 2023[1]. However, the \"no\" side still leads with 48% of public opinion[1]. \n\nImportantly, 63% of Norwegians are positive toward holding a new referendum on EU membership, showing appetite for revisiting the question regardless of personal stance on membership[1]. This represents significant public interest in at least having the debate.\n\n## Political Constraints\n\nDespite growing public interest, the Norwegian political leadership has explicitly \"ruled out a renewed EU debate\" as of April 2025[1]. This strong stance from the current government is a significant barrier to any near-term referendum announcement.\n\nThe collapse of Norway's government in January 2025 over the adoption of EU energy rules demonstrates the politically volatile nature of EU-related decisions[1]. With parliamentary elections approaching in September 2025, parties may be hesitant to stake positions on divisive issues like EU membership.\n\n## External Pressures\n\nSeveral factors are increasing pressure on Norway to reconsider its EU stance:\n\n1. US trade tariffs imposed by President Trump have created economic concerns[5]\n2. Norway is struggling to prevent getting caught in the crossfire of EU-US tariffs[1]\n3. The realization that \"even the closest possible partnership with the EU is not the same as membership\"[1]\n4. Iceland's commitment to hold an EU membership referendum by 2027 is influencing the Norwegian debate[5]\n\n## Historical Resistance and Status Quo Bias\n\nNorway has rejected EU membership twice in referendums (1972 and 1994)[2][5]. This historical resistance creates institutional inertia against change. Additionally, the current government explicitly ruling out a renewed EU debate represents a strong status quo position that would require significant political capital to overturn.\n\n## Timing Considerations\n\nWith just four months remaining until the September 2025 elections, there is limited time for the political calculus to change dramatically. Major policy reversals typically require more runway, especially on issues that have been explicitly ruled out by the current leadership.\n\nThe Conservative opposition led by Erna Solberg supports EU membership and could potentially win the September elections[5], but this would be too late to impact the outcome of this forecast question.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests that the status quo will prevail in the short term. While public opinion is shifting and external pressures mounting, the explicit stance of the current government against reopening the EU debate, combined with the approaching elections and historical resistance to EU membership, make an announcement before September 2025 unlikely.\n\nA referendum announcement would require a dramatic reversal of the government's stated position within a compressed timeframe. While not impossible given the volatile international trade environment and rising public interest, it remains improbable based on current information.\n\nProbability: 15%",
        "36":"(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nIt is currently May 9, 2025. The decisive second-round presidential vote in Romania is scheduled for May 18, 2025, so the final outcome will likely be known within the next 1\u20132 weeks.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nC\u0103lin Georgescu is not a candidate in the May 2025 presidential election, as he was banned from running after the annulled November 2024 results, and is not on the ballot for the rerun. Unless this decision is reversed and he is allowed to participate in the ongoing election, he cannot become president[1][4].\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  \nGeorgescu remains banned from the ballot, is not declared president-elect after the new elections, and no extraordinary event overturns his disqualification. The election produces a different winner (such as George Simion or Nicu\u0219or Dan)[1][4]. This is the ongoing situation.\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  \nSome unprecedented legal, political, or judicial reversal allows Georgescu to re-enter the race after May 9, 2025, and he subsequently runs, wins, and is officially declared the president-elect before January 2026. There is no current evidence this is plausible, as the second-round election is scheduled and two other candidates are on the ballot[1][4].\n\n## Rationale and Probability Assessment\n\nHistorically, electoral disqualifications in established European democracies are rarely overturned within days of a scheduled election, especially following national and international scrutiny. The Romanian authorities have moved forward with a new vote without Georgescu, and polls, as well as the official candidate lists, no longer include him[1][4]. The only path to a \"Yes\" outcome would require both a legal reversal and a rapid reorganization of the election process to include his candidacy, for which there is no current indication. Even with public protests, there is no precedent or sign that authorities will act in this way, particularly after the high-profile annulment and explicit foreign interference findings[1][4].\n\nGeorgescu\u2019s continued political relevance is limited to endorsements and possible roles outside of the presidency, but that does not satisfy the question\u2019s criteria. In summary, the status quo is strongly entrenched, and the likelihood of a last-minute reversal is extremely low.\n\n**Probability: 0%**",
        "37":"(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 7.5 months (from May 10, 2025 to January 1, 2026)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: \"No sunset reduction before 2026\" - The current law maintains the January 1, 2033 phase-out date for 45Q tax credits as established in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n(c) An unexpected outcome scenario: Despite strong bipartisan support for repealing 45Q, significant lobbying from the 226+ existing project stakeholders could lead to a compromise that includes a longer transition period (2027-2028 sunset) with safe harbor provisions for ongoing projects. This could happen if Republican moderates from states with significant carbon capture investments align with industry interests to protect existing investments while still moving toward eventual repeal.\n\n## Rationale for 45Q Tax Credit Repeal Forecast\n\nThe 45Q carbon capture tax credit faces a serious repeal effort with H.R. 1946, the 45Q Repeal Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Scott Perry (R-PA) on March 6, 2025. This legislation aims to completely eliminate Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides tax credits for carbon capture and storage projects[1][3].\n\n### Political Landscape and Support for Repeal\n\nWhat makes this repeal effort particularly notable is its bipartisan nature. The bill has garnered support across party lines, with Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California serving as a co-sponsor[1][5]. This unusual alliance between Perry, described as \"one of the House's leading climate change skeptics,\" and Khanna, characterized as a \"fossil fuel critic,\" suggests a convergence of interests despite differing motivations[4].\n\nThe Republican control of both houses of Congress and the White House following the 2024 elections creates a favorable environment for this legislation. The party's consideration of a budget reconciliation bill provides a pathway for passing tax and spending changes with a simple majority, making the repeal of energy tax credits like 45Q a realistic possibility[4].\n\n### Economic Arguments for Repeal\n\nThe economic case for repeal is substantial and appears to be gaining traction. The legislation is projected to save American taxpayers an estimated $36.2 billion from FY2024-FY2033[1]. Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group, has highlighted concerns about the tax credit's \"long history of fraud and abuse\" and its \"hefty price tag\"[1].\n\nCritics argue that carbon capture and storage projects have consistently failed to deliver lasting results despite decades of generous federal funding[1]. These economic considerations may appeal to fiscal conservatives within the Republican party, strengthening the case for repeal.\n\n### Current Status and Timing\n\nH.R. 1946 was forwarded to the House Committee on Ways and Means after its introduction, where it currently awaits further action[5]. The bill does not contain a safe harbor provision and would implement a full repeal effective January 1, 2026[3][5].\n\nGiven that Republicans are actively discussing energy tax credits in their budget reconciliation plans, and the 45Q credit appears to be a specific target due to its bipartisan opposition, there is a high probability that action will be taken before the January 1, 2026 deadline specified in the question.\n\n### Counterforces and Alternative Scenarios\n\nDespite the momentum behind repeal, there are potential counterforces to consider:\n\n1. There is a concurrent \"dueling bipartisan proposal\" to expand the credit through the \"Methane Reduction and Economic Growth Act,\" which seeks to include methane captured from coal mines[4].\n\n2. The credit has powerful corporate backers, including Exxon, which has lobbied for additional CCS benefits[4].\n\n3. The 226+ existing qualifying projects represent significant investments that could mobilize industry pressure to include safe harbor provisions.\n\nWhile these forces might not prevent repeal entirely, they could influence the final form of the legislation, potentially leading to the inclusion of safe harbor provisions or a modified timeline.\n\n### Conclusion and Probability Assessment\n\nConsidering all factors\u2014the bipartisan support for repeal, Republican control of government, the economic arguments, and the status of H.R. 1946\u2014the most likely outcome is that the 45Q tax credit will be repealed or sunset in 2025-2026. The current bill does not include safe harbor provisions, and there is no indication in the search results that such provisions are being actively considered as amendments.\n\nHowever, given the status quo bias and the possibility of unexpected developments during the legislative process, I must assign some probability to alternative outcomes, including the possibility that lobbying efforts could result in safe harbor provisions or that the legislative process might stall, leaving the current law unchanged.\n\n2025-2026 sunset w\/o safe harbor: 65%\n2025-2026 sunset w\/ safe harbor: 15%\n2027-2028 sunset w\/o safe harbor: 7%\n2027-2028 sunset w\/ safe harbor: 4%\n2029-2031 sunset w\/o safe harbor: 2%\n2029-2031 sunset w\/ safe harbor: 1%\nNo sunset reduction before 2026: 6%",
        "38":"(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nFinal global box office data for 2025 will not be confirmed until early 2026, so there are just under eight months remaining until the outcome can be resolved with certainty.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nAs of May 2025, Ne Zha 2 is the highest-grossing film worldwide, grossing over $2.1 billion[1][3]. Ne Zha 2 is a sequel and thus unequivocally part of a franchise[3]. If nothing changes, the answer is **Yes**.\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  \nFor a No outcome, a non-franchise film released later in 2025 would have to gross more than Ne Zha 2's $2.1 billion worldwide total[3]. This would require an original film (not a sequel, remake, or in a shared universe, and without an announced sequel) to achieve historic box office success\u2014an outcome without clear precedent this decade.\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  \nThe most likely scenario is that Ne Zha 2 remains the top-grossing film, or another franchise title scheduled for release (such as Avatar: Fire and Ash, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning, or Jurassic World Rebirth) overtakes it\u2014since all of these are franchise entries, any plausible overtake still results in a Yes[2][3].\n\n## Rationale\n\n- Franchise films have dominated the global box office, with three of the last four years' top films coming from established series[5].\n- As of early May, every leading 2025 box office film is part of a franchise. Ne Zha 2\u2019s revenue lead is especially pronounced, and no standalone, non-franchise film is close in earnings[1][3].\n- While it is theoretically possible for an original film to launch and earn over $2.1 billion, the historical record shows this is extremely unlikely, especially with several major franchise films still ahead in the release schedule and none of the original films currently in contention[3].\n- The dominance of franchise films in both global box office and pop culture remains unchallenged, and no industry trends suggest a sudden reversal within the remaining months of 2025[5].\n\nProbability estimates must heavily weight the status quo given the slow movement of box office trends. The combination of Ne Zha 2\u2019s strong lead and the anticipated performance of upcoming franchise films makes a franchise-topping outcome overwhelmingly likely.\n\n**Probability: 98%**",
        "39":"(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nAbout 7.5 months remain until the S&P 500 closing value on December 31, 2025, determines the outcome.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nAs of early May 2025, the S&P 500 is down approximately 4\u20138% from its record highs and its 2024 close[2][5]. If these prices persist through year-end, the answer would be \"No\" \u2014 the index would end 2025 below its 2024 close.\n\n(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  \nIf tariffs remain in effect, investor caution persists, or a significant macroeconomic or geopolitical shock occurs, the S&P 500 could finish 2025 lower than the 2024 close. For example, continued fear about inflation, trade wars, or a U.S. recession could drive further equity outflows and risk aversion \u2014 maintaining or deepening the current negative year-to-date performance[2][3][5].\n\n(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  \nA positive resolution could unfold if U.S. economic data surprises to the upside, tariffs are rolled back, or geopolitical tensions ease. Renewed optimism in corporate earnings, strong consumer spending, and continued advances in key sectors like artificial intelligence could reverse 2025's early losses and drive the S&P 500 above its 2024 close by year-end[1][4].\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\nRecent history and long-term trends favor gradual positive movement in the S&P 500, especially given the index's average annual return of 8.3% since 1998[1]. However, the current situation is different: after two years of extraordinary gains (over 25% per year in 2023 and 2024), the market started 2025 at stretched valuations, leaving little margin for disappointment[2][3]. \n\nMidway through 2025, caution has overtaken bullishness \u2014 major Wall Street banks have cut targets, citing the impact of broad tariffs introduced by the Trump administration, which weighed on sentiment and triggered a significant correction (with the S&P 500 down 4\u20138% year-to-date as of early May)[2][5]. Risks relating to inflation, geopolitics, and policy uncertainty remain elevated[3][5]. \n\nNonetheless, consensus among major banks at the start of the year was moderately bullish, with end-2025 targets typically 8\u201310% above 2024 closes[1][4]. Goldman Sachs, for instance, still projects a 9% price gain, assuming resilient corporate earnings and solid GDP growth[1]. There is a plausible path to a market rebound if economic conditions hold or improve, especially considering the index's tendency to recover after corrections.\n\nGood forecasters lean toward the status quo, and given a historically upward bias in the index and the tendency for corrections to be followed by recoveries, I put extra weight on the possibility of a rebound, though the probability is lower than in a typical year due to elevated risks and the weak start to 2025. Both upside and downside risks are pronounced, with political and policy volatility as potential swing factors.\n\n---\n\nProbability: **65%**"
