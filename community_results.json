        "0":"# Forecasting the #2 Position on Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List for June 28, 2025\n\nAs of May 13, 2025, I've analyzed the available information to forecast who is likely to occupy the second position on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List by June 28, 2025.\n\n## Current Status (May 2025)\n\nAccording to the most recent Forbes data from early May 2025, the current top billionaire rankings are:\n\n1. Elon Musk - $386.5 billion (increased by $46 billion in the last month)[1]\n2. Jeff Bezos (holding second place for the second consecutive month)[1]\n3. Mark Zuckerberg[1]\n4. Larry Ellison[1]\n5. Warren Buffett[1]\n\nJeff Bezos currently occupies the second position, with his wealth primarily tied to Amazon's stock performance. Earlier data from April 2025 showed Bezos and Zuckerberg with very similar net worths of approximately $215-216 billion each[4], indicating a close race for the second position.\n\n## Key Trends and Market Factors\n\nSeveral important trends could influence the rankings by late June:\n\n**Stock Market Volatility:** The market has been experiencing volatility in response to President Trump's tariff plans and recession concerns[1]. This uncertainty is causing business leaders to pause new ventures and investments, which could disproportionately affect different billionaires depending on their portfolio composition.\n\n**Tech Stock Performance:** The wealth of top billionaires like Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg is heavily influenced by technology stock performance. Recent months have shown significant growth in tech valuations, with tech leaders collectively accounting for over $600 billion of the $1.5 trillion increase among the world's wealthiest individuals[3].\n\n**Tesla's Recent Recovery:** Tesla stock recovered from an early April plunge to end the month up about 7%, significantly boosting Musk's fortune[1]. This demonstrates how quickly these rankings can change based on individual company performance.\n\n## Forecast Analysis for June 28, 2025\n\nBased on the available information, I assess the following probabilities for the second position on June 28:\n\n1. **Jeff Bezos (50%)** - Currently holds the position and has maintained it for two consecutive months[1]. Amazon's diverse business model provides some insulation against market volatility.\n\n2. **Mark Zuckerberg (30%)** - Was very close to Bezos in wealth as of early April[4]. Meta's continued investments in AI and virtual reality could drive stock growth if these sectors gain momentum.\n\n3. **Larry Ellison (10%)** - Currently in fourth place[1]. Oracle's enterprise focus might provide stability during economic uncertainty.\n\n4. **Elon Musk (5%)** - While currently in first place, significant Tesla volatility could potentially drop him to second if the company faces setbacks.\n\n5. **Warren Buffett (3%)** - His more diversified portfolio through Berkshire Hathaway offers stability, but growth is typically slower than tech-focused billionaires.\n\n6. **Someone else (2%)** - Including potential rapid wealth increases from other billionaires just outside the top 5.\n\n## Uncertainties and Limitations\n\nSeveral factors create uncertainty in this forecast:\n\n- The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List is updated daily based on stock price changes, making it inherently volatile\n- Potential major business announcements, acquisitions, or stock sales could significantly alter wealth positions\n- Geopolitical events or policy changes affecting specific industries could impact billionaire wealth disproportionately\n- The ongoing market reaction to President Trump's economic policies creates additional uncertainty\n\nThis forecast assumes no major regulatory actions targeting specific companies and no significant personal wealth transfers (such as major charitable donations) from any of the top billionaires."

Here are the top 10](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2025\/04\/01\/nx-s1-5345950\/forbes-billionaires-list)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as the person ranked #2 according to the [Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/real-time-billionaires\/#482980403d78) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025.\n\nIf there is a tie for second place, the question will be annulled. If there is a change to a name, for example if \"& family\" is added, it will still count.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting the #2 Position on Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List for June 28, 2025\n\nAs of May 13, 2025, I've analyzed the available information to forecast who is likely to occupy the second position on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List by June 28, 2025.\n\n## Current Status (May 2025)\n\nAccording to the most recent Forbes data from early May 2025, the current top billionaire rankings are:\n\n1. Elon Musk - $386.5 billion (increased by $46 billion in the last month)[1]\n2. Jeff Bezos (holding second place for the second consecutive month)[1]\n3. Mark Zuckerberg[1]\n4. Larry Ellison[1]\n5. Warren Buffett[1]\n\nJeff Bezos currently occupies the second position, with his wealth primarily tied to Amazon's stock performance. Earlier data from April 2025 showed Bezos and Zuckerberg with very similar net worths of approximately $215-216 billion each[4], indicating a close race for the second position.\n\n## Key Trends and Market Factors\n\nSeveral important trends could influence the rankings by late June:\n\n**Stock Market Volatility:** The market has been experiencing volatility in response to President Trump's tariff plans and recession concerns[1]. This uncertainty is causing business leaders to pause new ventures and investments, which could disproportionately affect different billionaires depending on their portfolio composition.\n\n**Tech Stock Performance:** The wealth of top billionaires like Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg is heavily influenced by technology stock performance. Recent months have shown significant growth in tech valuations, with tech leaders collectively accounting for over $600 billion of the $1.5 trillion increase among the world's wealthiest individuals[3].\n\n**Tesla's Recent Recovery:** Tesla stock recovered from an early April plunge to end the month up about 7%, significantly boosting Musk's fortune[1]. This demonstrates how quickly these rankings can change based on individual company performance.\n\n## Forecast Analysis for June 28, 2025\n\nBased on the available information, I assess the following probabilities for the second position on June 28:\n\n1. **Jeff Bezos (50%)** - Currently holds the position and has maintained it for two consecutive months[1]. Amazon's diverse business model provides some insulation against market volatility.\n\n2. **Mark Zuckerberg (30%)** - Was very close to Bezos in wealth as of early April[4]. Meta's continued investments in AI and virtual reality could drive stock growth if these sectors gain momentum.\n\n3. **Larry Ellison (10%)** - Currently in fourth place[1]. Oracle's enterprise focus might provide stability during economic uncertainty.\n\n4. **Elon Musk (5%)** - While currently in first place, significant Tesla volatility could potentially drop him to second if the company faces setbacks.\n\n5. **Warren Buffett (3%)** - His more diversified portfolio through Berkshire Hathaway offers stability, but growth is typically slower than tech-focused billionaires.\n\n6. **Someone else (2%)** - Including potential rapid wealth increases from other billionaires just outside the top 5.\n\n## Uncertainties and Limitations\n\nSeveral factors create uncertainty in this forecast:\n\n- The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List is updated daily based on stock price changes, making it inherently volatile\n- Potential major business announcements, acquisitions, or stock sales could significantly alter wealth positions\n- Geopolitical events or policy changes affecting specific industries could impact billionaire wealth disproportionately\n- The ongoing market reaction to President Trump's economic policies creates additional uncertainty\n\nThis forecast assumes no major regulatory actions targeting specific companies and no significant personal wealth transfers (such as major charitable donations) from any of the top billionaires.\n\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is no longer world's second richest person, he was taken over by..., his net worth is...**\nMark Zuckerberg has surpassed Jeff Bezos as the world's second-richest person, with a net worth of USD 212 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Zuckerberg's fortune increased by USD 846 million on May 5, thanks to a rise in Meta's stock, while Bezos saw a drop of USD 2.9 billion in his net worth. Zuckerberg is the only one among the top three billionaires to see gains recently, adding USD 4.63 billion to his wealth in 2025. Meta expects its second-quarter revenue to fall between USD 42.5 billion and USD 45.5 billion, which is slightly higher than market expectations. Elon Musk continues to top the list with a total net worth of USD 331 billion, thanks to a jump in Tesla's stock price after Musk announced his reduced involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com](https:\/\/www.india.com\/news\/world\/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-is-no-longer-worlds-second-richest-person-he-was-taken-over-by-mark-zuckerberg-net-worth-is-usd-212-billion-7817117\/)\n\n**Forbes 2025 List of Richest People in Each US State**\nForbes has released its 2025 list of the richest people in each state in the US, with a record total of $2 trillion in combined wealth.

    "forecast":{
        "0":"(a) Time left until outcome: 46 days (from May 13, 2025 to June 28, 2025)\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Jeff Bezos would remain in second place according to Forbes' May 2025 data.\n(c) Unexpected scenario: A significant drop in Tesla stock combined with strong performance of Meta\/Facebook could result in Elon Musk falling to second place while Mark Zuckerberg rises to first.\n\nBased on the search results and recent news, I'll provide my professional assessment of who is likely to occupy second place in the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on June 28, 2025.\n\n## Current Billionaire Rankings\n\nAs of May 2025, the top billionaires according to Forbes' Real-Time list are:\n\n1. Elon Musk - $386.5 billion (increased by $46 billion in April)[1]\n2. Jeff Bezos - $201.6 billion (according to May 11, 2025 data)\n3. Mark Zuckerberg - $190-$212 billion (sources vary)\n4. Larry Ellison - $176.9 billion\n5. Warren Buffett - $166.4 billion\n\nHowever, there's significant volatility in these positions. According to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index (not Forbes), Mark Zuckerberg has just surpassed Jeff Bezos for the #2 position as of May 5, 2025, with a net worth of $212 billion compared to Bezos's declining wealth.\n\n## Key Factors Affecting the June 28 Ranking\n\n**Stock Market Performance**: The wealth of these billionaires is primarily tied to their companies' stock performance. Tesla, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle stock fluctuations will be the primary determinants of the June ranking.\n\n**Economic Conditions**: The search results mention market volatility in response to President Trump's tariff plans and recession concerns, which could disproportionately affect different billionaires depending on their portfolio composition.\n\n**Recent Trends**: Elon Musk's wealth increased significantly ($46 billion) in April 2025, while Jeff Bezos saw a drop in Amazon's stock price (4% in April). Mark Zuckerberg has been gaining ground rapidly.\n\n## Analysis of Top Contenders\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg**: His wealth has been on an upward trajectory, recently surpassing Bezos according to Bloomberg (though not yet in Forbes' ranking). Meta's investments in AI and increased revenue forecasts ($42.5-45.5 billion for Q2) suggest continued growth potential.\n\n**Jeff Bezos**: Currently holds the #2 position in Forbes but is showing signs of slipping. Amazon has experienced some stock price decline recently, and Bezos has moved to Florida, potentially indicating lifestyle changes that might affect his business focus.\n\n**Larry Ellison**: His wealth increased by $1.9 billion in April due to Oracle's stock performance and his involvement in AI infrastructure development. While currently in fourth place, he has the potential to move up if tech sector trends continue.\n\n**Elon Musk**: While firmly in first place now, Tesla stock is notoriously volatile. Any significant drop could potentially move him to second place, though the gap between him and others is substantial ($386.5B vs ~$200B).\n\n**Warren Buffett**: Reports indicate he will retire at the end of 2025, which could affect Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. His diversified portfolio offers stability but typically slower growth than tech-focused billionaires.\n\n## Forecast Rationale\n\nThe second position on June 28 will likely be determined by:\n\n1. The relative performance of Amazon vs. Meta stock over the next 46 days\n2. Whether Tesla maintains its strong position, keeping Musk firmly in first\n3. Oracle's performance in the AI infrastructure space\n\nMark Zuckerberg appears to have momentum, having just overtaken Bezos according to Bloomberg. However, Forbes' methodology may differ slightly, and the status quo (Bezos at #2) remains a strong possibility given the relatively small gap between their fortunes.\n\nWhile the unexpected scenario of Musk dropping to second is possible, it would require a massive decline in Tesla stock (over $180 billion) or extraordinary growth from whoever would take first place.\n\nLarry Ellison shows growing wealth but would need significant gains to overcome the approximately $25 billion gap with Zuckerberg and Bezos.\n\n## Final Probabilities\n\nLarry Ellison: 12%\nElon Musk: 6%\nMark Zuckerberg: 42%\nWarren Buffett: 3%\nJeff Bezos: 35%\nSomeone else: 2%"
