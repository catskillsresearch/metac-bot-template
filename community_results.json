Milei's top campaign promise [was](https:\/\/www.freiheit.org\/one-year-javier-mileis-economic-policy) to fight inflation. Since then, the inflation rate has steadily come down to 2.4% for November 2024. Argentina's YoY inflation rate was 211% for December 2023, the highest in the world, and rose further to [292% for April 2024](https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/argentina\/inflation-cpi), but has since fallen to 166%.\n\nHowever, despite the drop in inflation, the annual inflation rate for 2025 is projected by [the IMF](https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Countries\/ARG) to be 62.7% for 2025 as of December 2024. Additionally, poverty [has risen](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/articles\/ceqn751x19no) in the country due to the short-term shock caused by slashing subsidies in transportation, fuel and electricity, as well as the elimination of thousands of government jobs.\n\nAccording to [economist Juan D'Amico](https:\/\/medium.com\/@JDEconomics\/milei-has-outperformed-even-the-most-bullish-inflation-forecasts-for-argentina-in-2024-what-to-e0a8939f2142), forecasts have consistently been wrong to the high side on Argentina's inflation. For example, a group of economists opposed to Milei had forecasted 2024 inflation of 400%, while even some of the more optimistic forecasts were around 240%.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

        "1":"# Forecasting Analysis: Will Jerome Powell cease to hold office as Fed Chair before 2026?\n\nJerome Powell currently serves as Chair of the Federal Reserve, with his term set to expire on May 15, 2026[2][3]. As a forecasting analyst, I'll evaluate the likelihood of him leaving this position before 2026 by examining institutional frameworks, historical precedents, and current political dynamics.\n\n## Current Status and Legal Framework\n\nJerome Powell was sworn in for his second term as Chair of the Federal Reserve on May 23, 2022, after being re-nominated by President Biden in November 2021 and confirmed by the Senate on May 12, 2022[2]. His term as Chair ends on May 15, 2026, while his position as a Board member extends until January 31, 2028[2][4].\n\nThe Federal Reserve system is designed with significant institutional protections for leadership tenure:\n\n- Federal law explicitly states that presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair[3]\n- The Federal Reserve's independence is considered crucial for economic stability[3]\n- Powell himself has stated he would not step down if asked by a president[3]\n\n## Political and Economic Factors\n\nSeveral factors could potentially influence Powell's tenure:\n\n**Political Support:**\nRepublican Senator John Kennedy has publicly defended Powell, stating, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman\"[3]. This suggests bipartisan recognition of the Fed's independence.\n\n**Economic Consequences of Intervention:**\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee has warned that undermining central bank independence could lead to \"higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring\"[3]. This economic reality creates strong disincentives for any administration to attempt removing Powell prematurely.\n\n**Historical Precedent:**\nWhile Fed chairs have historically been reappointed across administrations (such as Alan Greenspan serving under four presidents), the position is generally respected as independent from political interference during a chair's term[5].\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available evidence, several factors make it unlikely that Powell will cease to hold office before 2026:\n\n1. **Strong Legal Protections**: The legal framework explicitly prevents presidents from firing Fed chairs[3]\n\n2. **Institutional Independence**: The Federal Reserve's independence is widely recognized as crucial for economic stability[3]\n\n3. **Powell's Own Position**: Powell has publicly stated he would not resign if asked[3]\n\n4. **Bipartisan Support**: There appears to be cross-party recognition of the importance of Fed independence[3]\n\nThe primary scenarios that could lead to Powell leaving before 2026 would be:\n- Voluntary resignation (which he has indicated he would not do)\n- Health issues or other personal reasons\n- An unprecedented legal challenge to Fed independence (with uncertain outcomes)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the available information, there is a low probability that Jerome Powell will cease to hold office as Chair of the Federal Reserve before his term ends on May 15, 2026. The strong legal and institutional protections for the Fed chair position, combined with bipartisan support for central bank independence and Powell's own stated intention to serve his full term, all suggest continuity in leadership through the end of his appointed term.\n\nThe most significant uncertainty in this forecast relates to potential unprecedented political pressures that could emerge, though these would face substantial legal and institutional barriers.",
        "2":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- After the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, there has been no formal Israeli government established in the territory. Since the October 2023 invasion, Israel has exerted significant military control over parts of Gaza, but this has remained de facto and not the establishment of a formal civilian government[2].\n- As of May 2025, the Israeli government has approved plans to capture and potentially occupy all of Gaza for an indefinite period. These plans include a \"sustained physical presence\" and possible annexation, but do not yet constitute the formal establishment of a government or official annexation as defined by the resolution criteria[1][2].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- On May 5, 2025, Israeli cabinet ministers approved a plan to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory indefinitely. The plan involves expanded military operations and possible forcible displacement of Palestinians[2].\n- Amnesty International and other observers have reported that Israel's plans now include establishing a \"sustained physical presence\" and possibly annexing parts of Gaza, but these remain at the planning or approval stage and have not yet resulted in formal governmental structures or legal annexation[1].\n- International actors, including the United Arab Emirates, have discussed provisional international administration for Gaza, indicating that Israeli direct governmental control is not the only scenario under consideration[1].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Amnesty International (May 2025) reports on Israeli plans for expanded military presence and possible annexation, but no confirmation of established civilian government[1].\n- PBS\/AP (May 2025) provides detailed coverage of Israeli cabinet decisions regarding the capture and indefinite occupation of Gaza, but no evidence of formal governmental establishment or annexation at this time[2].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The Israeli government's intentions may change rapidly, especially in response to developments on the ground or international diplomatic pressure.\n- Information on internal Israeli policy deliberations may not be fully available to the public.\n- Formal annexation or government establishment could occur quickly if policy shifts.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the current trajectory\u2014recent cabinet approval for capturing and remaining in Gaza, open discussion of annexation and prolonged occupation, but no formal government establishment or annexation as of May 2025\u2014the probability that Israel will establish direct governmental control of the Gaza Strip (as defined by the resolution criteria) at some point in 2025 appears to be **moderate but less than 50%**. The likelihood is increased by recent political moves, but substantial international opposition, the complexity of governance, and lack of precedent since 2005 are significant dampening factors.\n\n**Forecast:**  \n- Probability Israel establishes direct governmental control of the Gaza Strip in 2025: **30-45%**.\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "3":"# ICE Deportation Forecast Analysis: FY 2025 vs FY 2024\n\nTo assess whether ICE deportations in FY 2025 will reach at least twice the FY 2024 level (542,968 or more), I'll analyze current trends, policy changes, and operational factors.\n\n## Historical Context and Current Trends\n\nICE reported 271,000 deportations in FY 2024, marking a 10-year high and surpassing the previous Trump-era peak from FY 2019[5]. This represented a significant increase from previous years, with FY 2024 showing approximately 43% growth over FY 2023 levels.\n\nRecent quarterly data shows acceleration in deportation activity:\n- In Q3 FY 2024, ICE removed nearly 68,000 noncitizens[2]\n- This reflected a 69% increase over Q3 FY 2023 removals[2]\n- Q3 FY 2024 removals alone represented more than 140% of total ICE removals for all of FY 2023[2]\n\nThe most recent data from mid-April 2025 indicates ICE arrest rates have approximately doubled since FY 2024, increasing from 310 to about 650 per day[4]. This significant escalation in arrests suggests a potential corresponding increase in deportations, as arrests typically precede removal proceedings.\n\n## Key Policy and Operational Changes\n\nSeveral factors are influencing current deportation rates:\n\n1. **Enforcement Priorities**: ICE has publicly emphasized its \"commitment to keeping communities safe and focusing enforcement resources on those who pose threats to public safety and national security\"[2]. This strategic focus may allow for more efficient use of resources.\n\n2. **Process Improvements**: The agency has implemented measures to \"streamline the deportation process\" and enhanced diplomatic efforts to increase acceptance of deportees by various countries[5]. This includes:\n   - Increased deportation flights to traditional migrant-sending countries in Latin America\n   - Expanded deportations to countries in Africa and Asia, including China, which previously did not accept U.S. deportations[5]\n\n3. **Interior vs. Border Enforcement**: In FY 2024, approximately 82% of deportations involved migrants first apprehended by Customs and Border Protection, rather than those arrested by ICE in the interior[5]. Any shift toward increased interior enforcement could significantly affect overall deportation numbers.\n\n4. **Resource Allocation**: ICE continues to optimize \"its resources to enforce U.S. immigration laws in the U.S. interior and remove individuals and families who have no legal basis to stay in the country\"[2].\n\n## Forecast Assessment\n\nBased on available data through May 2025, several indicators suggest deportations will increase in FY 2025 compared to FY 2024, but reaching double the previous year's total faces significant challenges:\n\n**Factors supporting substantial increases:**\n- The doubling of daily ICE arrest rates (from 310 to 650) as of mid-April 2025[4]\n- Continued emphasis on enforcement and removal operations\n- Enhanced diplomatic arrangements with receiving countries\n- Demonstrated quarter-over-quarter growth in deportation numbers through FY 2024\n\n**Limiting factors:**\n- Logistical and resource constraints in processing double the previous year's deportations\n- Historical precedent showing even during previous administrations with strong deportation rhetoric, actual numbers rarely doubled year-over-year\n- The high baseline of 271,484 deportations in FY 2024 makes a doubling to 542,968 particularly challenging\n\nWhile current trends show significant growth in enforcement activities, the data available as of May 2025 suggests that while deportations will likely increase substantially in FY 2025, reaching double the FY 2024 level would require unprecedented acceleration beyond what's currently evidenced in the available statistics.\n\n## Data Limitations\n\nSeveral limitations affect this forecast:\n1. Available data only covers the early months of FY 2025\n2. Potential policy implementation delays could affect the pace of deportations\n3. Judicial challenges might impact enforcement capabilities\n4. Resource constraints may limit the practical maximum deportation capacity\n\nICE continues to update its enforcement and removal statistics, with the most recent comprehensive data available through its statistics portal[1][3]. Future quarterly releases will provide clearer indicators of whether the current growth trajectory is sufficient to reach the doubling threshold."

Milei's top campaign promise [was](https:\/\/www.freiheit.org\/one-year-javier-mileis-economic-policy) to fight inflation. Since then, the inflation rate has steadily come down to 2.4% for November 2024. Argentina's YoY inflation rate was 211% for December 2023, the highest in the world, and rose further to [292% for April 2024](https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/argentina\/inflation-cpi), but has since fallen to 166%.\n\nHowever, despite the drop in inflation, the annual inflation rate for 2025 is projected by [the IMF](https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Countries\/ARG) to be 62.7% for 2025 as of December 2024. Additionally, poverty [has risen](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/articles\/ceqn751x19no) in the country due to the short-term shock caused by slashing subsidies in transportation, fuel and electricity, as well as the elimination of thousands of government jobs.\n\nAccording to [economist Juan D'Amico](https:\/\/medium.com\/@JDEconomics\/milei-has-outperformed-even-the-most-bullish-inflation-forecasts-for-argentina-in-2024-what-to-e0a8939f2142), forecasts have consistently been wrong to the high side on Argentina's inflation. For example, a group of economists opposed to Milei had forecasted 2024 inflation of 400%, while even some of the more optimistic forecasts were around 240%.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

In the event of an indefinite leave Metaculus may make a determination as to the question resolution, and may resolve the question as **Ambiguous**.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Analysis: Will Jerome Powell cease to hold office as Fed Chair before 2026?\n\nJerome Powell currently serves as Chair of the Federal Reserve, with his term set to expire on May 15, 2026[2][3]. As a forecasting analyst, I'll evaluate the likelihood of him leaving this position before 2026 by examining institutional frameworks, historical precedents, and current political dynamics.\n\n## Current Status and Legal Framework\n\nJerome Powell was sworn in for his second term as Chair of the Federal Reserve on May 23, 2022, after being re-nominated by President Biden in November 2021 and confirmed by the Senate on May 12, 2022[2]. His term as Chair ends on May 15, 2026, while his position as a Board member extends until January 31, 2028[2][4].\n\nThe Federal Reserve system is designed with significant institutional protections for leadership tenure:\n\n- Federal law explicitly states that presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair[3]\n- The Federal Reserve's independence is considered crucial for economic stability[3]\n- Powell himself has stated he would not step down if asked by a president[3]\n\n## Political and Economic Factors\n\nSeveral factors could potentially influence Powell's tenure:\n\n**Political Support:**\nRepublican Senator John Kennedy has publicly defended Powell, stating, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman\"[3]. This suggests bipartisan recognition of the Fed's independence.\n\n**Economic Consequences of Intervention:**\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee has warned that undermining central bank independence could lead to \"higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring\"[3]. This economic reality creates strong disincentives for any administration to attempt removing Powell prematurely.\n\n**Historical Precedent:**\nWhile Fed chairs have historically been reappointed across administrations (such as Alan Greenspan serving under four presidents), the position is generally respected as independent from political interference during a chair's term[5].\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available evidence, several factors make it unlikely that Powell will cease to hold office before 2026:\n\n1. **Strong Legal Protections**: The legal framework explicitly prevents presidents from firing Fed chairs[3]\n\n2. **Institutional Independence**: The Federal Reserve's independence is widely recognized as crucial for economic stability[3]\n\n3. **Powell's Own Position**: Powell has publicly stated he would not resign if asked[3]\n\n4. **Bipartisan Support**: There appears to be cross-party recognition of the importance of Fed independence[3]\n\nThe primary scenarios that could lead to Powell leaving before 2026 would be:\n- Voluntary resignation (which he has indicated he would not do)\n- Health issues or other personal reasons\n- An unprecedented legal challenge to Fed independence (with uncertain outcomes)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the available information, there is a low probability that Jerome Powell will cease to hold office as Chair of the Federal Reserve before his term ends on May 15, 2026. The strong legal and institutional protections for the Fed chair position, combined with bipartisan support for central bank independence and Powell's own stated intention to serve his full term, all suggest continuity in leadership through the end of his appointed term.\n\nThe most significant uncertainty in this forecast relates to potential unprecedented political pressures that could emerge, though these would face substantial legal and institutional barriers.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n",

The timeline and method for actual implementation, as well as the existence of legal challenges or appeals, are immaterial.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- After the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, there has been no formal Israeli government established in the territory. Since the October 2023 invasion, Israel has exerted significant military control over parts of Gaza, but this has remained de facto and not the establishment of a formal civilian government[2].\n- As of May 2025, the Israeli government has approved plans to capture and potentially occupy all of Gaza for an indefinite period. These plans include a \"sustained physical presence\" and possible annexation, but do not yet constitute the formal establishment of a government or official annexation as defined by the resolution criteria[1][2].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- On May 5, 2025, Israeli cabinet ministers approved a plan to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory indefinitely. The plan involves expanded military operations and possible forcible displacement of Palestinians[2].\n- Amnesty International and other observers have reported that Israel's plans now include establishing a \"sustained physical presence\" and possibly annexing parts of Gaza, but these remain at the planning or approval stage and have not yet resulted in formal governmental structures or legal annexation[1].\n- International actors, including the United Arab Emirates, have discussed provisional international administration for Gaza, indicating that Israeli direct governmental control is not the only scenario under consideration[1].\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Amnesty International (May 2025) reports on Israeli plans for expanded military presence and possible annexation, but no confirmation of established civilian government[1].\n- PBS\/AP (May 2025) provides detailed coverage of Israeli cabinet decisions regarding the capture and indefinite occupation of Gaza, but no evidence of formal governmental establishment or annexation at this time[2].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The Israeli government's intentions may change rapidly, especially in response to developments on the ground or international diplomatic pressure.\n- Information on internal Israeli policy deliberations may not be fully available to the public.\n- Formal annexation or government establishment could occur quickly if policy shifts.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the current trajectory\u2014recent cabinet approval for capturing and remaining in Gaza, open discussion of annexation and prolonged occupation, but no formal government establishment or annexation as of May 2025\u2014the probability that Israel will establish direct governmental control of the Gaza Strip (as defined by the resolution criteria) at some point in 2025 appears to be **moderate but less than 50%**. The likelihood is increased by recent political moves, but substantial international opposition, the complexity of governance, and lack of precedent since 2005 are significant dampening factors.\n\n**Forecast:**  \n- Probability Israel establishes direct governmental control of the Gaza Strip in 2025: **30-45%**.\n\n## References\n\n1.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of expulsions or removals [reported](https:\/\/www.ice.gov\/spotlight\/statistics) by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for FY 2025 is at least double the number shown for FY 2024 at the time. If the number reported\u00a0for FY 2025 is less than double that of FY 2024, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe number shown at the time of this question for FY 2024 is 271,484 (271,484 [Title 8](https:\/\/uscode.house.gov\/browse\/prelim@title8\\&edition=prelim) Removals and 0 [Title 42](https:\/\/uscode.house.gov\/browse\/prelim@title42\\&edition=prelim) Expulsions).

This represented a significant increase from previous years, with FY 2024 showing approximately 43% growth over FY 2023 levels.\n\nRecent quarterly data shows acceleration in deportation activity:\n- In Q3 FY 2024, ICE removed nearly 68,000 noncitizens[2]\n- This reflected a 69% increase over Q3 FY 2023 removals[2]\n- Q3 FY 2024 removals alone represented more than 140% of total ICE removals for all of FY 2023[2]\n\nThe most recent data from mid-April 2025 indicates ICE arrest rates have approximately doubled since FY 2024, increasing from 310 to about 650 per day[4]. This significant escalation in arrests suggests a potential corresponding increase in deportations, as arrests typically precede removal proceedings.\n\n## Key Policy and Operational Changes\n\nSeveral factors are influencing current deportation rates:\n\n1. **Enforcement Priorities**: ICE has publicly emphasized its \"commitment to keeping communities safe and focusing enforcement resources on those who pose threats to public safety and national security\"[2]. This strategic focus may allow for more efficient use of resources.\n\n2. **Process Improvements**: The agency has implemented measures to \"streamline the deportation process\" and enhanced diplomatic efforts to increase acceptance of deportees by various countries[5]. This includes:\n   - Increased deportation flights to traditional migrant-sending countries in Latin America\n   - Expanded deportations to countries in Africa and Asia, including China, which previously did not accept U.S. deportations[5]\n\n3. **Interior vs. Border Enforcement**: In FY 2024, approximately 82% of deportations involved migrants first apprehended by Customs and Border Protection, rather than those arrested by ICE in the interior[5]. Any shift toward increased interior enforcement could significantly affect overall deportation numbers.\n\n4. **Resource Allocation**: ICE continues to optimize \"its resources to enforce U.S. immigration laws in the U.S. interior and remove individuals and families who have no legal basis to stay in the country\"[2].\n\n## Forecast Assessment\n\nBased on available data through May 2025, several indicators suggest deportations will increase in FY 2025 compared to FY 2024, but reaching double the previous year's total faces significant challenges:\n\n**Factors supporting substantial increases:**\n- The doubling of daily ICE arrest rates (from 310 to 650) as of mid-April 2025[4]\n- Continued emphasis on enforcement and removal operations\n- Enhanced diplomatic arrangements with receiving countries\n- Demonstrated quarter-over-quarter growth in deportation numbers through FY 2024\n\n**Limiting factors:**\n- Logistical and resource constraints in processing double the previous year's deportations\n- Historical precedent showing even during previous administrations with strong deportation rhetoric, actual numbers rarely doubled year-over-year\n- The high baseline of 271,484 deportations in FY 2024 makes a doubling to 542,968 particularly challenging\n\nWhile current trends show significant growth in enforcement activities, the data available as of May 2025 suggests that while deportations will likely increase substantially in FY 2025, reaching double the FY 2024 level would require unprecedented acceleration beyond what's currently evidenced in the available statistics.\n\n## Data Limitations\n\nSeveral limitations affect this forecast:\n1. Available data only covers the early months of FY 2025\n2. Potential policy implementation delays could affect the pace of deportations\n3. Judicial challenges might impact enforcement capabilities\n4. Resource constraints may limit the practical maximum deportation capacity\n\nICE continues to update its enforcement and removal statistics, with the most recent comprehensive data available through its statistics portal[1][3]. Future quarterly releases will provide clearer indicators of whether the current growth trajectory is sufficient to reach the doubling threshold.\n\nToday is 2025-05-11\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100\n\n"

        "0":"(a) **Time until resolution:**  \nThe December 2025 inflation data will be released in January 2026, so about **8 months remain** until the outcome is known.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nAs of early 2025, Argentina's annual inflation rate has fallen sharply from nearly 300% in April 2024 to around 55.9% in March 2025[2]. Monthly inflation is now consistently below 3%[3][5]. The most recent forecasts from major institutions and private analysts cluster around **30% for year-end 2025**[1][2][3][5]. The government's own market expectations survey projects around 23.3% inflation for 2025[5]. If these trends continue and current policies are maintained, **the status quo suggests a high probability that YoY inflation will be very near or just under 30%**.\n\n(c) **Scenario for a No outcome (Inflation \u2265 30% YoY):**  \nIf Argentina faces a **policy reversal**\u2014such as monetary easing, political pressure to restore subsidies, or renewed Central Bank financing of deficits\u2014disinflation could stall or reverse. External shocks, like a spike in global food or energy prices, or a currency crisis (potentially triggered by capital flight or loss of market confidence), could also drive inflation back above 30% YoY by December 2025. Even without a crisis, inflation inertia or lagged pass-through from previous devaluations could keep the annual figure above the threshold.\n\n(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome (Inflation < 30% YoY):**  \nIf the Milei administration **sustains tight fiscal and monetary policies** through the remainder of the year, and political risks remain contained, Argentina\u2019s disinflation could continue. With monthly inflation now around 2\u20132.7% and trending down[3][5], and many forecasts showing a further drop, it is plausible for YoY inflation to slip **just below 30%** by December 2025\u2014especially if there are further improvements in price stability and no major external shocks.\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Momentum:** The pace of inflation reduction has been much faster than most forecasters anticipated, reflecting the administration\u2019s aggressive reforms and credible commitment to tough fiscal\/monetary discipline[1][3][5].\n- **Forecast convergence:** Most up-to-date projections\u2014BBVA Research, Trading Economics, and the Central Bank\u2019s survey\u2014expect YoY inflation to be right around 23\u201330% at the end of 2025[1][2][3][5]. These forecasts are more optimistic (lower) than the IMF\u2019s, which are generally slower to update and sometimes overshoot in volatile environments.\n- **Risks:** Argentina remains highly vulnerable to domestic political backlash (from rising poverty and social unrest) and external shocks. Inflation history in Argentina is volatile, and reversals can happen quickly if expectations or government resolve waver. However, the track record since late 2023 suggests an ability to outperform expectations if policy discipline persists[1][3][5].\n- **Status quo bias:** Most of the time, the world changes gradually. Given the strong downward momentum and broad forecast agreement on ~30% as the new normal, it is more likely than not that this level holds\u2014unless a major shock intervenes.\n\n---\n\n## Final Probability\n\n**Probability: 65%**\n\nArgentina\u2019s YoY inflation for December 2025 is more likely than not to be **below 30%**, but substantial uncertainty remains due to the country\u2019s history of shocks and volatility[1][2][3][5].",
        "1":"(a) **Time until resolution:**  \nThere are just over seven months remaining before January 1, 2026. This is the period in which Jerome Powell could potentially leave office and satisfy the question\u2019s \"Yes\" criteria.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  \nIf current conditions persist, Jerome Powell will remain Chair of the Federal Reserve through the end of 2025, with his term set to expire on May 15, 2026[2][3]. All recent public appearances\u2014such as speeches in April and May 2025\u2014show him actively serving in his role and discussing policy outlooks[1][2][3].\n\n(c) **Scenario for a 'No' outcome:**  \nThe \"No\" outcome resolves if Powell continues as Chair through January 1, 2026. This is the default scenario, as there are strong institutional, legal, and historical precedents for Federal Reserve chairs completing their terms absent extraordinary circumstances.\n\n(d) **Scenario for a 'Yes' outcome:**  \nA \"Yes\" could be triggered if Powell leaves office before January 1, 2026, due to:\n- Voluntary resignation (which he has stated he will not do if pressured politically)\n- Health issues or incapacitation\n- Unanticipated personal circumstances\n- An unprecedented legal or political event challenging the Fed\u2019s independence (highly unlikely given legal protections and recent reaffirmations by political leaders)\n\n## Rationale\n\nJerome Powell is demonstrably still serving as Chair of the Federal Reserve as of May 2025, with no evidence of plans to resign early[1][2][3]. The legal framework offers strong protections\u2014presidents cannot directly fire or demote the Fed Chair[3]. Powell himself has indicated he would not step down if asked by a president, and recent statements and actions by political figures (including comments from Donald Trump and bipartisan members of Congress) reinforce respect for the Fed\u2019s institutional independence.\n\nThe most probable causes for an early departure\u2014health or unforeseen personal reasons\u2014lack substantiating evidence as of now. Historically, no Fed chair has been removed for political reasons mid-term, and to do so would require extraordinary circumstances and face significant legal and institutional resistance.\n\nGiven the short time until the forecast window closes, the strong status quo bias, and the lack of any credible signals of imminent removal or resignation, the base rate for early departure is extremely low.\n\n## Final Probability\n\nProbability: **4%**",
        "2":"(a) Time left until outcome is known: 7 months, 19 days (until December 31, 2025)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No - Israel currently has military presence in Gaza but has not established a formal government or annexed the territory\n\n(c) Scenario for No outcome: International pressure and diplomatic negotiations lead Israel to pursue an alternative arrangement for Gaza governance, such as an internationally-supervised administration. Military operations continue but formal governmental control or annexation is avoided.\n\n(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Following the recently approved plans, Israel proceeds to capture all of Gaza, establishes a formal transitional government headed by Israeli officials to administer the territory, or officially annexes at least 50% of Gaza's area before the end of 2025.\n\nAs a forecaster, I need to carefully evaluate the evidence while giving appropriate weight to the status quo, recognizing that major political changes often take longer than anticipated.\n\nBased on the most recent information, Israel has taken significant steps toward potentially establishing direct governmental control of Gaza. On May 5, 2025, the Israeli Cabinet approved plans to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory for an unspecified period[2]. This represents a notable escalation from previous positions and indicates serious consideration of formal control.\n\nHowever, several factors suggest caution in forecasting a definite \"Yes\" outcome:\n\nFirst, the status quo remains that Israel does not have formal governmental control of Gaza. Since withdrawing in 2005, Israel has maintained a blockade but avoided establishing a civilian government there[2]. This represents a 20-year precedent against formal control.\n\nSecond, the recent plans appear to focus primarily on military operations rather than civilian governance. While the plans include capturing territory and establishing a \"sustained physical presence,\" they don't explicitly commit to establishing a formal government structure as defined in the resolution criteria[1][2].\n\nThird, international opposition to such a move would be substantial. Amnesty International has already condemned these plans[1], and the broader international community would likely apply significant pressure against formal annexation or governmental control.\n\nFourth, the implementation timeline remains uncertain. The defense official cited indicates that operations wouldn't begin until after an expected visit by U.S. President Trump later this month, leaving limited time in 2025 for the establishment of formal governmental structures[2].\n\nFifth, alternative governance arrangements are still being discussed. Previous reports mentioned UAE discussions about a provisional international administration, suggesting other pathways are being considered.\n\nOn the other hand, several factors increase the probability of a \"Yes\" outcome:\n\nThe recently approved plans explicitly call for Israel to \"capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time\"[2]. This represents a concrete policy decision rather than mere speculation.\n\nThe plans appear to include components that move toward the resolution criteria, including \"annexing territory\" and establishing a \"sustained physical presence\"[1].\n\nThe Israeli military chief has called up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers, suggesting serious preparation for expanded operations[2].\n\nThe reference to potential displacement of Palestinians to southern Gaza suggests comprehensive territorial control is being contemplated[2].\n\nWeighing these factors and giving appropriate weight to status quo persistence, I assess that while there is a significant chance of Israel establishing direct governmental control of Gaza in 2025, it remains less likely than not. The most probable outcome is continued military operations without formal governmental establishment or annexation.\n\nProbability: 40%",
        "3":"(a) Time until outcome known: The outcome will be known after the end of FY 2025, which runs from October 1, 2024, to September 30, 2025. As of today (May 12, 2025), we have approximately 4.5 months of data from FY 2025, with about 4.5 months remaining.\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: If current deportation rates continued without significant change, ICE would not reach twice the FY 2024 level (542,968 deportations) by the end of FY 2025.\n\n(c) No outcome scenario: Despite increased enforcement rhetoric and higher arrest rates in early FY 2025, logistical constraints, legal challenges, and resource limitations prevent ICE from sustaining the dramatic acceleration needed to double deportations. The agency achieves a significant increase over FY 2024, perhaps 30-50% higher, but falls well short of the doubling threshold.\n\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: The increased arrest rates (from 310 to 650 per day) reported in mid-March 2025 continue accelerating throughout the remainder of FY 2025. ICE successfully expands detention capacity, streamlines removal processes, and secures additional cooperation from receiving countries, enabling them to sustain the necessary pace to exceed 542,968 deportations by September 30, 2025.\n\nLooking at the available data, I need to assess whether ICE deportations will reach at least twice the FY 2024 level in FY 2025.\n\nICE reported 271,484 deportations in FY 2024, representing a 10-year high that surpassed even the Trump-era peak from FY 2019[5]. To reach a \"Yes\" outcome, ICE would need to deport at least 542,968 individuals in FY 2025.\n\nRecent data shows significant increases in enforcement activity. ICE arrest rates have approximately doubled since FY 2024, increasing from 310 to about 650 per day as of mid-March 2025[3]. This represents a substantial escalation in enforcement operations that could potentially translate to higher deportation numbers.\n\nHowever, several factors suggest caution in projecting a doubling of deportations:\n\nFirst, historical precedent indicates that even during administrations with strong deportation rhetoric, actual year-over-year doubling is rare. During the previous Trump administration, despite campaign promises of mass deportations, the total deportations over four years (1.5 million) were half those of Obama's first term and similar to Obama's second term and Biden's term[5].\n\nSecond, there are significant operational constraints to doubling deportations. While arrest rates have increased, the processing pipeline\u2014including detention capacity, immigration court proceedings, and coordination with receiving countries\u2014faces bottlenecks that limit how quickly deportations can be executed.\n\nThird, the baseline of 271,484 deportations in FY 2024 is already historically high, making a doubling particularly challenging. This would require unprecedented operational capacity and efficiency.\n\nOn the other hand, there are factors supporting potential significant increases:\n\nThe Q3 FY 2024 data showed nearly 68,000 removals, reflecting a 69% increase over the same quarter in FY 2023[2]. This demonstrates ICE's recent capacity to substantially increase deportation rates.\n\nICE has reported success in streamlining deportation processes and securing increased cooperation from receiving countries, including nations that historically resisted accepting deportees[5].\n\nWeighing these factors, while I expect deportations to increase significantly in FY 2025 compared to FY 2024, a complete doubling faces substantial operational and logistical hurdles. The data suggests an increase in the 30-70% range is more plausible than a 100% increase, particularly given the already elevated baseline from FY 2024.\n\nProbability: 25%"
