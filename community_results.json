        "0":"While the general feeling of most people, especially now that the cold war is (mostly) over, is that the risk of human extinction is extremely small, experts have assigned a significantly higher probability to the event.\n\nIn 2008 an [informal poll at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at the University of Oxford](https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/6YxiCAV0p?url=http:\/\/www.fhi.ox.ac.uk\/gcr-report.pdf) yielded a median probability of human extinction by 2100 of 19%. Yet, one might want to be cautious when using this result as a good estimate of the true probability of human extinction, as there may be a powerful selection effect at play. Only those who assign a high probability to human extinction are likely to attend the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in the first place, meaning that the survey was effectively sampling opinions from one extreme tail of the opinion distribution on the subject. Indeed, the conference report itself stated that the findings should be taken 'with a grain of salt'.",

        "0":"# Forecasting Human Extinction Before 2100\n\nAs of November 12, 2017, the question of human extinction before 2100 has been addressed by various experts and institutions with differing methodologies and perspectives. This analysis examines the available evidence and expert assessments to provide a probabilistic forecast.\n\n## Expert Probability Estimates\n\nSeveral notable experts and institutions have provided estimates on human extinction probability:\n\n- In 2016, a mathematician at the University of Barcelona estimated a 13% chance that humanity would not survive the 21st century[2].\n- The Global Challenges Foundation's 2016 annual report estimated an annual probability of human extinction of at least 0.05% per year, which equates to approximately 5% per century[1].\n- In 2003, Martin Rees (Astronomer Royal of the United Kingdom) estimated a 50% chance of civilization collapse in the twenty-first century, though it should be noted that civilization collapse doesn't necessarily equate to complete human extinction[1].\n- In 1996, John A. Leslie estimated a 30% risk of human extinction over the next five centuries, which translates to roughly 6% per century on average[1].\n\nThe informal poll at the 2008 Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at Oxford yielded a median probability of 19% for human extinction by 2100, though as noted in the question description, this may reflect selection bias among participants.\n\n## Key Risk Factors\n\nBased on information available as of 2017, several categories of extinction risks warrant consideration:\n\n### Anthropogenic Risks\n- **Nuclear warfare**: Despite reductions in nuclear arsenals since the Cold War, thousands of nuclear weapons remain deployed, with the potential for catastrophic global impacts.\n- **Emerging technologies**: Developments in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology present novel existential risks that were not present in humanity's evolutionary history.\n- **Climate change**: While complete human extinction from climate change alone is generally considered unlikely by 2100, it could act as a risk multiplier for other threats.\n\n### Natural Risks\n- **Asteroid impacts**: NASA's Near-Earth Object Observation Program has identified and tracks potential extinction-level asteroid threats, with no imminent dangers identified as of 2017.\n- **Supervolcanic eruptions**: These occur very infrequently (roughly every 50,000-100,000 years) and typically with some warning signs.\n- **Pandemics**: Natural pandemics have caused significant mortality throughout human history but have not approached extinction-level events.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\nThe historical record provides important context. Homo sapiens have existed for at least 200,000 years and survived numerous catastrophic events including supervolcano eruptions and asteroid impacts[1]. This suggests resilience to natural extinction risks.\n\nHowever, anthropogenic risks represent a fundamentally different category. Unlike natural risks that have been present throughout human evolution, technological capabilities that could potentially cause extinction have only emerged recently and continue to develop rapidly.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nSynthesizing the expert opinions available as of November 2017, and accounting for both natural and anthropogenic risks, a reasonable estimate for human extinction by 2100 falls in the range of 5-20%.\n\nThis assessment gives more weight to institutional estimates like the Global Challenges Foundation's 5% per century and less weight to higher individual estimates, while acknowledging that:\n\n1. Natural extinction risks appear extremely low based on humanity's survival record\n2. Anthropogenic risks are novel and potentially more dangerous\n3. Expert opinion varies significantly, suggesting high uncertainty\n\nIt's important to note that this probability represents a significant risk when compared to other global catastrophic scenarios that receive substantial mitigation efforts.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors limit the precision of this forecast:\n\n- Expert estimates vary widely, indicating high uncertainty\n- Limited empirical data on extinction-level events (by definition)\n- Difficulty in modeling complex technological and social systems\n- Potential unknown risks that cannot be accounted for\n\nReferences:\n1.

        "1":"### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The oldest living person as of January 2023 was Maria Branyas Morera, born March 4, 1907, who reached 115 years of age in early 2023[1][2][3].\n- The maximum documented human age is 122 years, 164 days (Jeanne Calment, died 1997), a record that has not been surpassed[3].\n- Life expectancy has roughly doubled since 1900, but the oldest ages attained have increased far less\u2014by only a few years over more than a century.\n- Supercentenarians (age 110+) remain extremely rare; increases in average life expectancy mostly reflect reductions in early mortality, not dramatic shifts in extreme longevity.\n\n### Recent Announcements\/Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- As of early 2023, there were no major scientific announcements or policy changes credibly forecasting a dramatic increase in the maximum human lifespan by 2100.\n- Ongoing research in geroscience, biotechnology, and regenerative medicine might eventually impact this metric, but no concrete breakthroughs with proven effects on maximum human age had been achieved or widely implemented by 2023.\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The Guinness Book of World Records is the standard authority for verifying the world's oldest living person[3].\n- Secondary verification comes from organizations such as the Gerontology Research Group and national statistics agencies.\n- As of 2023, news organizations and research publications also report on new record-holders and verification standards[2][3].\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The slow historical growth in maximum age suggests that, barring unprecedented medical advances, the oldest living person in 2100 is unlikely to be older than 125.\n- Outliers are possible due to the growing global population, but the probability of surpassing Jeanne Calment\u2019s record by more than a few years remains low.\n- Measurement uncertainty persists due to the need for rigorous documentation and the possibility of unverified cases.\n- Radical life extension (e.g., 130+ years) remains speculative as of 2023, lacking empirical support.\n\n### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven these factors, a reasonable probabilistic forecast (as of January 2023) would be:\n- **Most likely range:** 118\u2013125 years\n- **Chance of surpassing 125 years:** Low, but not zero\n- **Chance of 130+ years:** Very low unless future breakthroughs occur\n\n### References\n\n[1].

According to NASA and the University T\u014dh\u014d of Japan, the human extinction will occur in approximately 1,080 million years due to the decrease of oxygen levels on Earth caused by the Sun's increasing brightness and heat. However, another study suggests that the extinction will occur in 1,000,002,021, when the Sun will have expanded and the temperatures will have risen. Musk believes that the best option to preserve humanity is to migrate to Mars, which he is currently investigating to establish a new civilization. 'Eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the Sun. The Sun expands gradually, so at some point, we will need to be a multi-planetary civilization because the Earth will be incinerated,' he predicted. 'Mars is a safeguard for collective life (...) We have a long way to go because it's not just about landing on Mars and leaving flags and footprints,' Musk said.

In fact, studies have shown that Neanderthals and modern humans shared a common ancestor in Africa, dating back 50 million years. The two species are also found to have had physical and cultural similarities, with Neanderthals having complex cognitive abilities and even interbreeding with modern humans. It is estimated that 1-4% of modern human DNA is derived from Neanderthals. The question remains as to why Neanderthals went extinct, with some scientists suggesting that they may have been absorbed into the modern human population. However, the exact circumstances of their extinction remain a mystery. As one scientist notes, 'There is still something fascinating about Neanderthals that continues to capture our imagination.

According to the AI, humans will continue to exist in 2100, but will become 'irrelevant'. This means that they will no longer be necessary to sustain the functioning of the planet, as they will lose the ability to influence key processes such as knowledge, production, and power. The AI explained that this is not due to a malicious intention, but rather a natural consequence of the increasing efficiency of automated systems. As these systems take over decision-making with greater precision and accuracy, the role of humans becomes redundant. This transition has already begun, with automation taking over tasks such as customer service, logistics, and financial analysis. In the future, the AI predicts that automation will extend to education, politics, urban planning, and art creation. This will lead to a gradual cession of control, with humans no longer at the center of the system. As Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, warned, the danger of AI lies not in its malicious intentions, but in its extreme efficiency. A machine does not need consciousness to alter the global order; it simply needs to function better than humans, and control will be lost. Suleyman identifies four areas of risk: cyberattacks on vulnerable infrastructure, pandemics generated by synthetic biology, unregulated AI, and accelerated geopolitical fragmentation due to technology.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[infobae](https:\/\/www.infobae.com\/tecno\/2025\/05\/11\/le-preguntaron-a-la-ia-si-los-humanos-llegaran-al-ano-2100-su-respuesta-da-miedo\/)\n\n**Will Humanity be Irrelevant by 2100?**\nChatgpt, an AI, was asked if humanity will arrive at 2100 and its response was 'yes, but they will be irrelevant.'

According to NASA and the University T\u014dh\u014d of Japan, the human extinction will occur in approximately 1,080 million years due to the decrease of oxygen levels on Earth caused by the Sun's increasing brightness and heat. However, another study suggests that the extinction will occur in 1,000,002,021, when the Sun will have expanded and the temperatures will have risen. Musk believes that the best option to preserve humanity is to migrate to Mars, which he is currently investigating to establish a new civilization. 'Eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the Sun. The Sun expands gradually, so at some point, we will need to be a multi-planetary civilization because the Earth will be incinerated,' he predicted. 'Mars is a safeguard for collective life (...) We have a long way to go because it's not just about landing on Mars and leaving flags and footprints,' Musk said. 'So that's the key point in the future where the fate of life, as we know it, will be affected forever, when Mars becomes self-sufficient,' he added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 10:40 PM\nSource:[ViveUSA.mx](https:\/\/www.viveusa.mx\/noticias\/cientificos-analizan-teoria-de-elon-musk-sobre-el-fin-del-mundo-ocurrira-en-este-ano\/)\n\n**The Mysterious Case of the Neanderthals: Why Did They Go Extinct?**\nRecent research has revealed that the history of human evolution is more complex than previously thought. The Neanderthals, who were once considered to be a primitive species, are now seen as being closely related to modern humans. In fact, studies have shown that Neanderthals and modern humans shared a common ancestor in Africa, dating back 50 million years. The two species are also found to have had physical and cultural similarities, with Neanderthals having complex cognitive abilities and even interbreeding with modern humans. It is estimated that 1-4% of modern human DNA is derived from Neanderthals. The question remains as to why Neanderthals went extinct, with some scientists suggesting that they may have been absorbed into the modern human population. However, the exact circumstances of their extinction remain a mystery. As one scientist notes, 'There is still something fascinating about Neanderthals that continues to capture our imagination. They lived for tens of thousands of years, and then suddenly disappeared, replaced entirely by modern humans.' \nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[natgeo.nikkeibp.co.jp](https:\/\/natgeo.nikkeibp.co.jp\/atcl\/news\/25\/031300138\/)\n\n**The Irrelevance of Humans: A Conversation with ChatGPT**\nA recent conversation with ChatGPT, an AI, revealed a concerning prediction about the future of humanity. According to the AI, humans will continue to exist in 2100, but will become 'irrelevant'. This means that they will no longer be necessary to sustain the functioning of the planet, as they will lose the ability to influence key processes such as knowledge, production, and power. The AI explained that this is not due to a malicious intention, but rather a natural consequence of the increasing efficiency of automated systems. As these systems take over decision-making with greater precision and accuracy, the role of humans becomes redundant. This transition has already begun, with automation taking over tasks such as customer service, logistics, and financial analysis. In the future, the AI predicts that automation will extend to education, politics, urban planning, and art creation. This will lead to a gradual cession of control, with humans no longer at the center of the system. As Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, warned, the danger of AI lies not in its malicious intentions, but in its extreme efficiency. A machine does not need consciousness to alter the global order; it simply needs to function better than humans, and control will be lost. Suleyman identifies four areas of risk: cyberattacks on vulnerable infrastructure, pandemics generated by synthetic biology, unregulated AI, and accelerated geopolitical fragmentation due to technology.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[infobae](https:\/\/www.infobae.com\/tecno\/2025\/05\/11\/le-preguntaron-a-la-ia-si-los-humanos-llegaran-al-ano-2100-su-respuesta-da-miedo\/)\n\n**The big idea: could the English language die?**\nLinguist Martin Haspelmath suggests that English, like Egyptian, could eventually die as a language. However, predicting the future of any language is challenging due to the complex and interacting forces that influence it. Migration, technology, and literacy are key drivers of language change, but the configuration of the linguistic landscape is susceptible to black swan events. Experts agree that English will still be spoken in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, but its dominion may shrink, and its internal evolution may lead to the emergence of new variants. West African Pidgin, a creole influenced by English, is expected to have 400 million speakers by 2100, and Nigerian and Indian colloquialisms may enter 'standard' English. The vocabulary of a language tends to evolve faster than its grammar or phonology, and the impact of migration and technology on English is difficult to anticipate. Ultimately, even the world's first global language is not immune to extinction, and English may eventually go the way of Latin and Egyptian.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2025\/may\/11\/the-big-idea-could-the-english-language-die)\n\n**Will Humanity be Irrelevant by 2100?**\nChatgpt, an AI, was asked if humanity will arrive at 2100 and its response was 'yes, but they will be irrelevant.' This statement should not be understood as a prophecy, but as a reflection of our own fears projected in technology. The AI does not speak of a physical or biological collapse of the human species, but of a species that has been removed from the center of the system that she herself built. According to the AI, this transition has already begun and we can see it in sectors such as customer service or logistics, which are already being absorbed by automated systems. In the next 50 years, this process could affect education, politics, urban planning and even creativity. The AI explains that irrelevance refers to the loss of capacity for influence in the planet's operational structures, and that humans will continue to exist biologically, but will cease to be the main agents of change, knowledge and control. The AI also states that humans will not be replaced by a single entity, but by an interconnected machines ecosystem, autonomous algorithms and adaptive systems that will operate with less margin of error, lower emotional bias and higher speed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 12:56 PM\nSource:[ruetir.com](https:\/\/www.ruetir.com\/2025\/05\/11\/we-ask-an-ai-if-humanity-will-arrive-at-2100-and-its-response-puts-the-tips-they-will-be-irrelevant\/)\n\n**The Purgatorius: The Earliest Known Primate and Ancestor of Humans**\nAccording to Will Newton, a researcher at Manchester University, the purgatorius, a small mammal that lived 66-63 million years ago, is the earliest known primate. It is considered the ancestor of modern primates, including humans. Purgatorius was smaller than most modern primates, measuring 15 cm in length and weighing around 35 grams. It was more similar to a squirrel than a monkey, with a pointed nose, long, low-slung body, and bushy tail. Newton notes that these characteristics are thought to have been inherited from the last common ancestor of rodents and primates, which likely lived just a few million years before the purgatorius. The purgatorius is believed to have given rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens through many thousands of years of evolution, with many intermediate species in between. Newton suggests that the purgatorius went extinct due to climate change and habitat loss, as well as the emergence of more adaptable primates. The first fossils of the purgatorius were discovered in 1965 in eastern Montana, USA, where it lived in large subtropical forests around 63 million years ago. Newton notes that the purgatorius had teeth similar to those of modern primates, setting it apart from other mammals of its time. 'It was a great day when we discovered the purgatorius,' Newton said, 'because it showed us the origins of the primates, including humans.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 12:03 PM\nSource:[\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Day.Az](https:\/\/sun.day.az\/news\/useful\/1751896.html)\n\n**Stephen Hawking's Warning about Human Extinction Confirmed by NASA**\nStephen Hawking's warning about the potential disappearance of humanity has found partial confirmation at NASA.

His conclusions were based on an analysis of data on growing resource consumption and deepening environmental crisis. While NASA agrees with Hawking's concerns, they disagree with his exact date. NASA experts confirmed that, at current rates of natural resource exploitation, humanity faces a threat to its existence. Moreover, their calculations suggest that unlimited resource consumption could bring about a global environmental catastrophe sooner than predicted.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 12:40 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https:\/\/www.mk.ru\/science\/2025\/05\/11\/prognoz-stivena-khokinga-o-gibeli-chelovechestva-podtverdili-v-nasa.html)\n\n**Pop star says we're 'on cusp of extinction' as AI robots consider humans a 'nuisance' - Daily Star**\nPop star Gary Numan has expressed concerns that humans will become extinct as robots take over the world.

According to Montgomery, the process is already underway and the extinction could be 'the greatest and most rapid the planet has ever seen, and we are causing it.' He stated that the scenario could be similar to the Permian extinction period (299-251 million years ago), where about 90% of species disappeared due to extreme planetary conditions. Montgomery estimated that the catastrophic scenario could be reached if the global average temperature reaches 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, the planet recorded a record increase of 1.5\u00b0C. He warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the increase could reach 2.7\u00b0C by 2100. Montgomery emphasized that 'if we continue to hit the base of this unstable column on which we are supported, the human species itself will be threatened.'

Montgomery, director of the Centre for Human Health and Performance at University College London, emphasizes that this extinction is already occurring, 'the greatest and fastest extinction the planet has ever seen, and we are causing it.' However, the death of species could reach catastrophic levels if the global average temperature increase reaches 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, a record increase of 1.5\u00b0C was reached, and scientists estimate that if current actions are maintained, especially regarding greenhouse gas emissions, the increase will reach 2.7\u00b0C by 2100. Montgomery stresses that if we continue to 'hit the base of this unstable column we are standing on,' the human species will be threatened. He also warns of other drastic consequences, such as an abrupt collapse of the Arctic ice layers, which would cause a significant slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Circulation, leading to a sea level rise of several meters, with catastrophic consequences. He emphasizes the need for immediate action to reduce pollution and adapt to climate change, which is already affecting human health today, but cannot be done at the expense of a drastic and immediate reduction in emissions, as 'it doesn't make sense to focus only on symptom relief when we should be seeking a cure.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: April 09, 2025 09:58 AM\nSource:[Cen\u00e1rioMT](https:\/\/www.cenariomt.com.br\/clima\/crise-climatica-pode-provocar-nova-extincao-em-massa-diz-pesquisador\/)\n\n**Countdown to Extinction: Why Humanity May Be Doomed by 2050**\nAccording to a study by the World One supercomputer, human civilization may be on the brink of extinction by 2040-2050 due to the cumulative effects of human activity. The four main factors contributing to this are overpopulation, global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental pollution. If current trends continue, climate change and resource depletion will make the Earth uninhabitable for humans by the mid-21st century. While some experts criticize the supercomputer for oversimplifying complex processes, many agree with its conclusions. The growing frequency of natural disasters and the increasing scarcity of oxygen and drinking water are seen as major causes of human extinction. Even if immediate action is taken to mitigate these factors, the global population may still decline to 19th-century levels by the given timeframe. Researchers emphasize that if humans do survive, they will have to adapt to a new world with different conditions. Climate expert Alexander Chernokulsky notes that water scarcity is a pressing issue that may threaten humanity in the near future. He also warns that sea levels may rise by 12-15 cm by mid-century and 40-60 cm by the end of the century. In contrast, climate expert Nikolai Tereshonok believes that the predictions of imminent human extinction are exaggerated. However, he acknowledges that reversing the situation is now extremely difficult and emphasizes the need to continue fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to alternative energy sources.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: April 08, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https:\/\/news.rambler.ru\/tech\/54475492-schet-na-gody-kogda-i-pochemu-chelovechestvu-grozit-vymiranie\/)\n\n**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**\nBritish paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall.

According to ComputerHoy, this response is precise, as technology will continue to advance, bringing us closer to what was once considered science fiction. The AI does not foresee a physical or biological collapse of the human species or a large-scale extinction. However, it does predict that humans will have minimal influence in key processes by the year 2100. This statement is not optimistic, as the AI does not envision a future of prosperity or ethical progress, but rather a species that has been marginalized from the center of the system it created. 'In a time marked by automation and the increasing delegation of decisions, it's not surprising that we start to question the place of people in the next few decades,' says ComputerHoy.

However, this advancement also implies the automation of routine tasks, which could displace certain traditional labor roles. The report highlights that automation and AI are redefining labor roles, especially in high-tech manufacturing, with manual and repetitive tasks being taken over by machines, increasing efficiency and productivity. This change requires workers to acquire new skills to operate and maintain these technologies. New positions such as data analysts, AI programmers, and machine learning specialists are emerging, requiring a combination of technical skills and commercial process understanding. Adaptation to this new labor landscape is crucial, with workers focusing on developing skills in high-demand areas like data analysis and programming. This can be achieved through courses, workshops, and certifications. Additionally, employees must learn to collaborate with AI tools to improve efficiency and stay informed about technological advancements in their industries. The impact of AI on the workforce is complex, liberating employees from repetitive tasks but also generating concerns about job displacement and retraining. AI is creating new opportunities, especially in data analysis and AI development, but also poses challenges like algorithm bias and personal data security. In terms of employment, AI is generating new types of jobs and improving existing ones. A McKinsey & Company report estimates that AI could create up to 50 million jobs by 2030 in various industries. New roles include AI trainers, data analysts, and human-machine team managers, ensuring effective interaction between humans and machines. Specialists in AI ethics and policy are increasingly necessary to address the ethical implications of these technologies. The impact of AI on unemployment rates and the economy is a topic of debate. Although AI is expected to displace 75 million jobs by 2025, it could also create 133 million new positions, according to the World Economic Forum. This represents a net gain of 58 million jobs, although displacement will be significant in certain industries.

The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https:\/\/aawsat.com\/node\/5104271)\n\n**AI Boom: China Leads the World in AI Research, Japan Lags Behind**\nThe current state of AI is chaotic, with numerous scientific papers, patents, and startup funding.

The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and automation, along with the increasing adoption of digital tools and platforms, has had a significant impact on the global economy, changing the way companies operate and communicate with their customers. However, the rise of these technologies has also transformed the job market, forcing workers to requalify and adapt to new opportunities. Big data specialists form the backbone of innovation in AI across various sectors, from healthcare to finance and commerce. They play a crucial role in managing large datasets that enable fraud detection, predictive analysis, and recommendation systems. According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Report on the Future of Work 2025, big data specialists lead the list of fastest-growing jobs, with a projected increase of 110% between 2025 and 2030, far surpassing any other profession. Fintech engineers, who develop cutting-edge financial technologies such as blockchain and digital payment systems, come in second, with a projected increase of 86% over the next five years. Meanwhile, machine learning specialists have fallen to third place, with a growth expectation of 81% by 2030. Application developers and security managers complete the top five jobs, with projected increases of 58% and 57%, respectively. The WEF predicts that training to become a data storage specialist, autonomous and electric vehicle specialist, or UI\/UX designer will also be a good option for those seeking a secure job in the near future. While some jobs are growing, others are shrinking. According to the WEF, postal service employees, bank tellers, and data entry assistants face a decline of 25-35%. Secretaries, administrative assistants, and cashiers are also facing significant declines as automation advances. The 2024 Annual Report on Work Trends revealed that 75% of employees used AI at work last year, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, two out of three technology leaders were more likely to give an opportunity to someone with AI skills than an experienced candidate without those skills. According to the WEF's predictions, AI will create over 170 million new jobs by 2030, far more than any other technology. This number brings many opportunities for workers willing to learn and adapt.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 06:43 PM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https:\/\/jornaleconomico.sapo.pt\/noticias\/ia-criara-170-milhoes-de-novos-empregos-ate-ao-final-da-decada\/)\n\n**Whoever Leads In AI Compute Will Lead The World**\nThe AI compute market is projected to reach $1,811.75 billion by 2030, with the leader controlling the best data and compute platforms.

The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:23 AM\nSource:[speka.media](https:\/\/speka.media\/bilse-robocix-misc-ci-skorocennya-yak-stucnii-intelekt-vplivatime-na-zainyatist-9xrdl5)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030. However, current job vacancies and specializations are expected to decrease by 22%. The study, conducted among 11,000 employers from 55 countries, found that despite the expected job loss, the net employment growth will be around 7%. This is due to approximately 8% of the workforce being redirected to new fields, requiring employees to adapt and retrain. In response to the challenges of AI implementation, 77% of employers expressed willingness to invest in employee upskilling. Additionally, over half of companies plan to restructure their business to integrate AI, and 65% intend to hire professionals with expertise in new technologies. Nevertheless, around 40% of companies may lay off employees if AI automation becomes possible. Notably, 86% of employers believe that AI will fundamentally change the labor market, particularly in finance and electronics.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440\/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https:\/\/finance.rambler.ru\/business\/54044986-vef-iskusstvennyy-intellekt-sozdast-170-mln-novyh-rabochih-mest\/)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs and Eliminate 92 Million by 2030**\nAccording to the World Economic Forum's report on the Future of Jobs 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) and data processing technologies will drive business model changes for nine out of ten employers in the next five years. This will lead to the extinction of certain jobs, such as cashiers or ticket clerks, while others will flourish. The report states that by 2030, the interaction between humans and machines will 'change dramatically', with 47% of tasks currently performed by humans and only 30% involving collaboration with machines, being practically balanced. The report recommends designing technologies that complement human work rather than replacing it, and establishing a collaborative relationship between humans and machines. The report also projects that the global labor market will experience a structural change equivalent to 22% of current employment, resulting in the creation of 170 million new jobs and the elimination of 92 million, with a net positive balance. The report highlights the need for active collaboration between governments, companies, and educational organizations to ensure that the benefits of this transformation are inclusive and equitable.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 12:09 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https:\/\/elpais.com\/economia\/2025-01-14\/en-cinco-anos-se-crearan-170-millones-de-empleos-en-el-mundo-por-la-inteligencia-artificial.html)\n\n"

Yet, one might want to be cautious when using this result as a good estimate of the true probability of human extinction, as there may be a powerful selection effect at play. Only those who assign a high probability to human extinction are likely to attend the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in the first place, meaning that the survey was effectively sampling opinions from one extreme tail of the opinion distribution on the subject. Indeed, the conference report itself stated that the findings should be taken 'with a grain of salt'.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if there are no known humans alive on January 1, 2100.  For these purposes we'll define humans as biological creatures who have as their ancestors \u2013 via a chain of live births from mothers \u2013  circa 2000 humans OR who could mate with circa 2000 humans to produce viable offspring. (So AIs, ems, genetically engineered beings of a different species brought up in artificial wombs, etc. would not count).  Any living humans living anywhere in the observable universe (or multiverse) (who are known to the entities operating Metaculus) on that date will be sufficient to resolve the question negatively.\n\nN.B. Even though it is obviously the case that if human extinction occurs Metaculus points won't be very valuable anymore and that it will be practically impossible to check for true human extinction (zero humans left), I would like to ask people not to let this fact influence their prediction and to predict in good faith\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Human Extinction Before 2100\n\nAs of November 12, 2017, the question of human extinction before 2100 has been addressed by various experts and institutions with differing methodologies and perspectives. This analysis examines the available evidence and expert assessments to provide a probabilistic forecast.\n\n## Expert Probability Estimates\n\nSeveral notable experts and institutions have provided estimates on human extinction probability:\n\n- In 2016, a mathematician at the University of Barcelona estimated a 13% chance that humanity would not survive the 21st century[2].\n- The Global Challenges Foundation's 2016 annual report estimated an annual probability of human extinction of at least 0.05% per year, which equates to approximately 5% per century[1].\n- In 2003, Martin Rees (Astronomer Royal of the United Kingdom) estimated a 50% chance of civilization collapse in the twenty-first century, though it should be noted that civilization collapse doesn't necessarily equate to complete human extinction[1].\n- In 1996, John A. Leslie estimated a 30% risk of human extinction over the next five centuries, which translates to roughly 6% per century on average[1].\n\nThe informal poll at the 2008 Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at Oxford yielded a median probability of 19% for human extinction by 2100, though as noted in the question description, this may reflect selection bias among participants.\n\n## Key Risk Factors\n\nBased on information available as of 2017, several categories of extinction risks warrant consideration:\n\n### Anthropogenic Risks\n- **Nuclear warfare**: Despite reductions in nuclear arsenals since the Cold War, thousands of nuclear weapons remain deployed, with the potential for catastrophic global impacts.\n- **Emerging technologies**: Developments in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology present novel existential risks that were not present in humanity's evolutionary history.\n- **Climate change**: While complete human extinction from climate change alone is generally considered unlikely by 2100, it could act as a risk multiplier for other threats.\n\n### Natural Risks\n- **Asteroid impacts**: NASA's Near-Earth Object Observation Program has identified and tracks potential extinction-level asteroid threats, with no imminent dangers identified as of 2017.\n- **Supervolcanic eruptions**: These occur very infrequently (roughly every 50,000-100,000 years) and typically with some warning signs.\n- **Pandemics**: Natural pandemics have caused significant mortality throughout human history but have not approached extinction-level events.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\nThe historical record provides important context. Homo sapiens have existed for at least 200,000 years and survived numerous catastrophic events including supervolcano eruptions and asteroid impacts[1]. This suggests resilience to natural extinction risks.\n\nHowever, anthropogenic risks represent a fundamentally different category. Unlike natural risks that have been present throughout human evolution, technological capabilities that could potentially cause extinction have only emerged recently and continue to develop rapidly.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nSynthesizing the expert opinions available as of November 2017, and accounting for both natural and anthropogenic risks, a reasonable estimate for human extinction by 2100 falls in the range of 5-20%.\n\nThis assessment gives more weight to institutional estimates like the Global Challenges Foundation's 5% per century and less weight to higher individual estimates, while acknowledging that:\n\n1. Natural extinction risks appear extremely low based on humanity's survival record\n2. Anthropogenic risks are novel and potentially more dangerous\n3. Expert opinion varies significantly, suggesting high uncertainty\n\nIt's important to note that this probability represents a significant risk when compared to other global catastrophic scenarios that receive substantial mitigation efforts.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors limit the precision of this forecast:\n\n- Expert estimates vary widely, indicating high uncertainty\n- Limited empirical data on extinction-level events (by definition)\n- Difficulty in modeling complex technological and social systems\n- Potential unknown risks that cannot be accounted for\n\nReferences:\n1.

According to NASA and the University T\u014dh\u014d of Japan, the human extinction will occur in approximately 1,080 million years due to the decrease of oxygen levels on Earth caused by the Sun's increasing brightness and heat. However, another study suggests that the extinction will occur in 1,000,002,021, when the Sun will have expanded and the temperatures will have risen. Musk believes that the best option to preserve humanity is to migrate to Mars, which he is currently investigating to establish a new civilization. 'Eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the Sun.

However, predicting the future of any language is challenging due to the complex and interacting forces that influence it. Migration, technology, and literacy are key drivers of language change, but the configuration of the linguistic landscape is susceptible to black swan events. Experts agree that English will still be spoken in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, but its dominion may shrink, and its internal evolution may lead to the emergence of new variants. West African Pidgin, a creole influenced by English, is expected to have 400 million speakers by 2100, and Nigerian and Indian colloquialisms may enter 'standard' English. The vocabulary of a language tends to evolve faster than its grammar or phonology, and the impact of migration and technology on English is difficult to anticipate. Ultimately, even the world's first global language is not immune to extinction, and English may eventually go the way of Latin and Egyptian.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2025\/may\/11\/the-big-idea-could-the-english-language-die)\n\n**Will Humanity be Irrelevant by 2100?**\nChatgpt, an AI, was asked if humanity will arrive at 2100 and its response was 'yes, but they will be irrelevant.'

It is considered the ancestor of modern primates, including humans. Purgatorius was smaller than most modern primates, measuring 15 cm in length and weighing around 35 grams. It was more similar to a squirrel than a monkey, with a pointed nose, long, low-slung body, and bushy tail. Newton notes that these characteristics are thought to have been inherited from the last common ancestor of rodents and primates, which likely lived just a few million years before the purgatorius. The purgatorius is believed to have given rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens through many thousands of years of evolution, with many intermediate species in between. Newton suggests that the purgatorius went extinct due to climate change and habitat loss, as well as the emergence of more adaptable primates. The first fossils of the purgatorius were discovered in 1965 in eastern Montana, USA, where it lived in large subtropical forests around 63 million years ago. Newton notes that the purgatorius had teeth similar to those of modern primates, setting it apart from other mammals of its time. 'It was a great day when we discovered the purgatorius,' Newton said, 'because it showed us the origins of the primates, including humans.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 12:03 PM\nSource:[\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Day.Az](https:\/\/sun.day.az\/news\/useful\/1751896.html)\n\n**Stephen Hawking's Warning about Human Extinction Confirmed by NASA**\nStephen Hawking's warning about the potential disappearance of humanity has found partial confirmation at NASA.

According to Montgomery, the process is already underway and the extinction could be 'the greatest and most rapid the planet has ever seen, and we are causing it.' He stated that the scenario could be similar to the Permian extinction period (299-251 million years ago), where about 90% of species disappeared due to extreme planetary conditions. Montgomery estimated that the catastrophic scenario could be reached if the global average temperature reaches 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, the planet recorded a record increase of 1.5\u00b0C. He warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the increase could reach 2.7\u00b0C by 2100. Montgomery emphasized that 'if we continue to hit the base of this unstable column on which we are supported, the human species itself will be threatened.' He also noted that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is not only increasing, but doing so at an increasingly rapid rate, with 54.6 billion tons of CO2 equivalent emitted in 2024, a 1% increase from the previous year.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: April 13, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/epoca\/noticia\/2025\/04\/13\/cientista-alerta-para-risco-de-nova-extincao-em-massa-maior-e-mais-rapida-que-o-planeta-ja-viu.ghtml)\n\n**Climate Crisis May Cause New Mass Extinction, Warns Researcher**\nRenowned researcher Hugh Montgomery warns that if the effects of climate change are not reversed, the Earth may experience a mass extinction similar to the Permian extinction event (299-251 million years ago), where 90% of species were unable to survive the drastic conditions. Montgomery, director of the Centre for Human Health and Performance at University College London, emphasizes that this extinction is already occurring, 'the greatest and fastest extinction the planet has ever seen, and we are causing it.' However, the death of species could reach catastrophic levels if the global average temperature increase reaches 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, a record increase of 1.5\u00b0C was reached, and scientists estimate that if current actions are maintained, especially regarding greenhouse gas emissions, the increase will reach 2.7\u00b0C by 2100. Montgomery stresses that if we continue to 'hit the base of this unstable column we are standing on,' the human species will be threatened. He also warns of other drastic consequences, such as an abrupt collapse of the Arctic ice layers, which would cause a significant slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Circulation, leading to a sea level rise of several meters, with catastrophic consequences. He emphasizes the need for immediate action to reduce pollution and adapt to climate change, which is already affecting human health today, but cannot be done at the expense of a drastic and immediate reduction in emissions, as 'it doesn't make sense to focus only on symptom relief when we should be seeking a cure.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: April 09, 2025 09:58 AM\nSource:[Cen\u00e1rioMT](https:\/\/www.cenariomt.com.br\/clima\/crise-climatica-pode-provocar-nova-extincao-em-massa-diz-pesquisador\/)\n\n**Countdown to Extinction: Why Humanity May Be Doomed by 2050**\nAccording to a study by the World One supercomputer, human civilization may be on the brink of extinction by 2040-2050 due to the cumulative effects of human activity. The four main factors contributing to this are overpopulation, global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental pollution. If current trends continue, climate change and resource depletion will make the Earth uninhabitable for humans by the mid-21st century. While some experts criticize the supercomputer for oversimplifying complex processes, many agree with its conclusions. The growing frequency of natural disasters and the increasing scarcity of oxygen and drinking water are seen as major causes of human extinction. Even if immediate action is taken to mitigate these factors, the global population may still decline to 19th-century levels by the given timeframe. Researchers emphasize that if humans do survive, they will have to adapt to a new world with different conditions. Climate expert Alexander Chernokulsky notes that water scarcity is a pressing issue that may threaten humanity in the near future. He also warns that sea levels may rise by 12-15 cm by mid-century and 40-60 cm by the end of the century. In contrast, climate expert Nikolai Tereshonok believes that the predictions of imminent human extinction are exaggerated. However, he acknowledges that reversing the situation is now extremely difficult and emphasizes the need to continue fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to alternative energy sources.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: April 08, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https:\/\/news.rambler.ru\/tech\/54475492-schet-na-gody-kogda-i-pochemu-chelovechestvu-grozit-vymiranie\/)\n\n**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**\nBritish paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species.

According to the study, people living in 2100 may have a hunched back from constant smartphone and computer use, a smaller brain, and hands resembling claws. Experts also predict that people will develop a double eyelid to protect their eyes from harmful light. 'Prolonged phone use strains the neck and throws the spine out of balance, causing the neck muscles to work harder to support the head,' said Caleb Buke, an expert on health and well-being who created the model. 'Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end also means that your torso is stretched forward, rather than being upright.'

Scientists warn that if urgent measures are not taken, by 2100, we will only see these animals on pictures: 'If we don't take measures to protect these animals, they will become part of history, like mammoths or dinosaurs,' researchers said. Interestingly, while some species disappear, new ones emerge, differing in size, color, behavior, and having increased survival rates in changed conditions. However, this does not compensate for the loss of unique representatives of the fauna that exist today. Researchers are confident that if the situation is not changed, in a few generations, people will study the Bengal tiger in the same way as they now study the triceratops.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[Pravda](https:\/\/www.pravda.ru\/news\/zoo\/2188408-endangered-species-extinction\/)\n\n**10-40% of Species Could Become Extinct by 2100 Due to Global Warming: Professor Vaipayee**\nAccording to Professor Vaipayee, 10-40% of species could become extinct by 2100 if global warming causes a temperature increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius. This problem will become even more severe due to ocean acidification and rapid environmental changes. At the IIT Dhanbad, a lecture on collective extinction: past, present, and future was organized under the Centenary Lecture series.

Musk, who has 11 children with three women, is actively working to prevent human extinction. According to a report by 'The Lancet', by 2050, more than three-quarters of the world's countries and territories (155 out of 204) will no longer have a sufficient birth rate to ensure normal population replacement. By 2100, this problem is expected to occur in 198 countries and territories, with 54% of the world's births occurring in Africa south of the Sahara desert. To ensure population replacement, the total fertility rate needs to be approximately 2.1, but 'The Lancet' predicts a rate of 1.8 by 2050 and 1.6 by 2100. Only six countries (Chad, Niger, Samoa, Somalia, Tajikistan, and Tonga) are expected to have a rate above 2.1 by the end of the century, while 13 countries will have a rate below 1.0.

However, she passed away on April 30, 2025. The title is now held by Ethel Caterham, a British woman who is 115 years old. Jeanne Calment holds the record for the oldest person to have ever lived, at 122 years and 164 days. According to the Gerontology Research Group (GRG), there are currently between 300 and 450 people who are at least 110 years old, known as 'Supercentenarians'. Many of them live in the 'Blue Zones', regions where people have been found to live longer than average. While the exact reasons for their longevity are not scientifically proven, factors such as a healthy diet, physical activity, and social connections are thought to contribute to their long lives. In Germany, Charlotte Kretschmann held the title of oldest citizen at 114 years old, and was also officially recognized as the oldest German to have ever lived. She set a new record as the oldest person on Instagram, with 14,100 followers at the time of her death in August 2024.

On top of this, AI labs have a history of splitting apart to form new labs. [Anthropic](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthropic) was founded by OpenAI employees; [Udio](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Udio) was founded by Google DeepMind employees. Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind CEO, has even mused about leaving and raising billions of dollars to start a new lab, reportedly on account of frustrations with corporate politics ([Victor, 2024](https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/googles-demis-hassabis-chafes-under-new-ai-push)).\n\nThis question asks about how many new, leading AI labs there are likely to be by the end of the decade. This is an interesting question for various groups of people. On the one hand, many are concerned that the big tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are the big players in AI, and that this might mean [even more centralization of power](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/11\/22\/ai-is-giving-big-tech-inordinate-power-tech-execs-say.html) absent new competition. On the other hand, people concerned about [AI safety](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AI_safety#Existential_safety) are concerned that a greater number of labs will mean intensified [race dynamics](https:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/topics\/ai-race) and a greater chance that at least one leading lab cuts corners on safety, to catastrophic effect.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as the number of new AI labs that become leading labs within 2 years of their founding and before 2030.\n\nFor the purposes of this question:\n\n- A \u201cnew\u201d AI lab is one that was founded after question launch.\n\n- A \u201cleading\u201d AI lab is a top 5 lab based on model ELO,* as measured by [Chatbot Arena\u2019s](https:\/\/chat.lmsys.org\/?leaderboard) ELO rating. As of April 15, 2024, for example, the leading AI labs by this metric are OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Cohere, and Mistral AI.\n\n- A lab\u2019s founding date will be taken to be the \u201cFounded\u201d date quoted on its Wikipedia page.

The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping.

The fourth AI boom, triggered by the emergence of ChatGPT, is a significant milestone surpassing the third boom of the 2000s. According to the Scopus database, which contains over 99 million papers from over 7,000 publishers, AI-related papers have grown from 8,833 in 2014 to over 210,000 in 2023, accounting for 5% of all papers. China leads the world in AI-related papers, followed by the US and India. Japan ranks 10th and its global share has decreased to 2.5% in 2023, indicating that it has not fully adapted to the AI boom.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 08:01 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u7d4c\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\uff08xTECH\uff09](https:\/\/xtech.nikkei.com\/atcl\/nxt\/column\/18\/03055\/122700002\/)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, According to WEF**\nAccording to data from Stocklytics.com, big data specialists and fintech engineers are the jobs that will grow the most between 2025 and 2030. The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and automation, along with the increasing adoption of digital tools and platforms, has had a significant impact on the global economy, changing the way companies operate and communicate with their customers. However, the rise of these technologies has also transformed the job market, forcing workers to requalify and adapt to new opportunities. Big data specialists form the backbone of innovation in AI across various sectors, from healthcare to finance and commerce. They play a crucial role in managing large datasets that enable fraud detection, predictive analysis, and recommendation systems. According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Report on the Future of Work 2025, big data specialists lead the list of fastest-growing jobs, with a projected increase of 110% between 2025 and 2030, far surpassing any other profession. Fintech engineers, who develop cutting-edge financial technologies such as blockchain and digital payment systems, come in second, with a projected increase of 86% over the next five years. Meanwhile, machine learning specialists have fallen to third place, with a growth expectation of 81% by 2030. Application developers and security managers complete the top five jobs, with projected increases of 58% and 57%, respectively. The WEF predicts that training to become a data storage specialist, autonomous and electric vehicle specialist, or UI\/UX designer will also be a good option for those seeking a secure job in the near future. While some jobs are growing, others are shrinking. According to the WEF, postal service employees, bank tellers, and data entry assistants face a decline of 25-35%. Secretaries, administrative assistants, and cashiers are also facing significant declines as automation advances. The 2024 Annual Report on Work Trends revealed that 75% of employees used AI at work last year, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, two out of three technology leaders were more likely to give an opportunity to someone with AI skills than an experienced candidate without those skills. According to the WEF's predictions, AI will create over 170 million new jobs by 2030, far more than any other technology. This number brings many opportunities for workers willing to learn and adapt.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 06:43 PM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https:\/\/jornaleconomico.sapo.pt\/noticias\/ia-criara-170-milhoes-de-novos-empregos-ate-ao-final-da-decada\/)\n\n**Whoever Leads In AI Compute Will Lead The World**\nThe AI compute market is projected to reach $1,811.75 billion by 2030, with the leader controlling the best data and compute platforms. The New Trump administration is preparing to take office with a bold vision to leverage technology and artificial intelligence to strengthen America's global competitiveness. China and the U.S. are the biggest contenders in the AI compute race, with China investing $6.12 billion in AI data centers and the U.S. investing $30 billion annually in data infrastructure. However, the rapid expansion of data centers has created an urgent need for utilities and the government to increase power generation capacity, with a focus on a perfect mix of renewable and conventional energy sources. Saudi Arabia is also becoming a force to be reckoned with in the AI infrastructure race, with a planned $100bn Project Transcendence AI hub. Companies such as Innatera are advocating for neuromorphic computing, which uses less energy than traditional practices. Whoever leads in AI compute will have the strongest voice in the future, and it's not just about being among the first, but about shaping the next revolution of technology.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 06:37 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/markminevich\/2025\/01\/17\/whoever-leads-in-ai-compute-will-lead-the-world\/)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, Report Says**\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) has recently released the Future of Jobs Report 2025, which extensively analyzes global trends in the labor market and predicts their impact on jobs, skills, and worker transformation strategies in 2025-2030. A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:23 AM\nSource:[speka.media](https:\/\/speka.media\/bilse-robocix-misc-ci-skorocennya-yak-stucnii-intelekt-vplivatime-na-zainyatist-9xrdl5)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030. However, current job vacancies and specializations are expected to decrease by 22%. The study, conducted among 11,000 employers from 55 countries, found that despite the expected job loss, the net employment growth will be around 7%. This is due to approximately 8% of the workforce being redirected to new fields, requiring employees to adapt and retrain. In response to the challenges of AI implementation, 77% of employers expressed willingness to invest in employee upskilling. Additionally, over half of companies plan to restructure their business to integrate AI, and 65% intend to hire professionals with expertise in new technologies. Nevertheless, around 40% of companies may lay off employees if AI automation becomes possible. Notably, 86% of employers believe that AI will fundamentally change the labor market, particularly in finance and electronics.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440\/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https:\/\/finance.rambler.ru\/business\/54044986-vef-iskusstvennyy-intellekt-sozdast-170-mln-novyh-rabochih-mest\/)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs and Eliminate 92 Million by 2030**\nAccording to the World Economic Forum's report on the Future of Jobs 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) and data processing technologies will drive business model changes for nine out of ten employers in the next five years. This will lead to the extinction of certain jobs, such as cashiers or ticket clerks, while others will flourish. The report states that by 2030, the interaction between humans and machines will 'change dramatically', with 47% of tasks currently performed by humans and only 30% involving collaboration with machines, being practically balanced. The report recommends designing technologies that complement human work rather than replacing it, and establishing a collaborative relationship between humans and machines. The report also projects that the global labor market will experience a structural change equivalent to 22% of current employment, resulting in the creation of 170 million new jobs and the elimination of 92 million, with a net positive balance. The report highlights the need for active collaboration between governments, companies, and educational organizations to ensure that the benefits of this transformation are inclusive and equitable.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 12:09 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https:\/\/elpais.com\/economia\/2025-01-14\/en-cinco-anos-se-crearan-170-millones-de-empleos-en-el-mundo-por-la-inteligencia-artificial.html)\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is 2025-05-12\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A description of an scenario that results in an unexpected outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that (1) good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time, and (2) good forecasters leave some moderate probability on most options to account for unexpected outcomes.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final probabilities for the N options in this order ['0 or 1', '2 or 3', '4 or 5', '6 or 7', '8 or 9', '10 or more'] as:\nOption_A: Probability_A\nOption_B: Probability_B\n...\nOption_N: Probability_N\n\nwhere you must assign your probabilities so that Probability_A + Probability_B + ... + Probability_N = 100."

        "0":"(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nAs of May 12, 2025, there are approximately 74 years and 7.5 months remaining before January 1, 2100, when we will know the outcome.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nThe current trajectory, according to scientific consensus and demographic projections, is that humans will still exist in 2100. The United Nations and the IPCC project a global human population in 2100 between 7 and 16 billion, with extinction not foreseen even under severe catastrophe scenarios[3]. Historically, humans have survived multiple catastrophic threats, and no mainstream scientific organization predicts total extinction by 2100.\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome (humans survive):**  \nDespite facing risks like climate change, nuclear war, pandemics, or advanced AI, humanity continues to adapt and survive. Population numbers may decline or societies may be severely disrupted, but some humans remain alive somewhere on Earth or potentially off-Earth settlements[1][3]. Societies could be transformed and influence diminished, but biological humans as defined in the question persist.\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (human extinction):**  \nA global catastrophe\u2014such as an engineered pandemic with near-100% lethality, full-scale thermonuclear war combined with nuclear winter, or rogue self-improving AI deliberately or accidentally exterminating all biological humans\u2014completely eradicates every last Homo sapiens, leaving no trace of viable humans anywhere in the observable universe by January 1, 2100.\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\nExpert assessments and aggregated forecasts provide a useful anchor for this kind of low-frequency, high-impact question. While an informal poll at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in 2008 reported a median probability of 19% for human extinction by 2100, that poll is subject to substantial selection bias and is widely regarded as an outlier[4]. More recent, broader aggregations\u2014such as those on the prediction platform Metaculus\u2014produce a median probability of just 1% based on hundreds of forecaster estimates[4].\n\nSimilarly, a 2023 survey involving both technical experts and superforecasters found superforecasters assigning only a 1% chance to human extinction by 2100; experts put the probability slightly higher at 6%, but still considered it unlikely[2]. The Global Challenges Foundation's 2016 report, as well as other academic estimates, generally cluster in the low single-digit percentages per century.\n\nThe most cited existential risks\u2014climate change, nuclear war, AI, biotechnology, and natural disasters\u2014are each serious but have not, according to contemporary scientific modeling, crossed the threshold of likelihood required for human extinction within this timeframe. For example, MIT climate scientists consider the probability of climate change causing human extinction by 2100 to be \"very low, if not zero\"[1]. Population projections for 2100 reinforce this: even under pessimistic scenarios, billions of humans are expected to survive[3].\n\nFinally, history demonstrates the resilience of Homo sapiens in the face of dramatic environmental changes and global crises. While the risk of massive disruption or even civilizational collapse is significant, true extinction\u2014the total disappearance of all humans\u2014is a substantially higher bar.\n\n## Final Probability\n\n**Probability: 1%**\n\nThis estimate aligns with the aggregated judgment of expert communities and prediction platforms, incorporates the high resilience humans have shown historically, and heavily weights the status quo outcome, as good forecasters should. While existential risk is real and non-negligible, true human extinction before 2100 remains highly unlikely under current knowledge[2][3][4].",
        "1":"Based on the search results and current information, I'll provide a comprehensive forecast for how old the oldest living person will be in 2100.\n\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 74 years and 7 months (from May 2025 to January 1, 2100).\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years old. This is based on the current record for the oldest documented human, Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days[3].\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 125-130 years old. The maximum documented human age has shown minimal increases over the past century despite significant improvements in average life expectancy.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists expect the maximum human lifespan to remain below 130 years without revolutionary medical breakthroughs. Research suggests the body's ability to recover is exhausted between 120 and 150 years.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global pandemic specifically targeting the elderly, or environmental catastrophes could reduce maximum lifespan to below current records, perhaps to 115-118 years.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Revolutionary breakthroughs in genetic engineering, cellular rejuvenation, or nanotechnology could dramatically extend the maximum human lifespan to 150+ years by effectively addressing the fundamental causes of aging.\n\n## Current State of Human Longevity\n\nThe current oldest living person as of May 2025 is Ethel Caterham of the United Kingdom, born August 21, 1909, making her 115 years old[1]. She became the world's oldest person following the death of Brazilian nun Inah Canabarro Lucas, who passed away on April 30, 2025, at the age of 116[3].\n\nThe historical context is important. Jeanne Louise Calment still holds the record for the oldest verified human, having lived to 122 years and 164 days[3]. This record has stood since her death in 1997, suggesting there may be biological limits to human longevity that are difficult to overcome.\n\n## Historical Trends in Maximum Lifespan\n\nThe maximum documented human lifespan has shown remarkable stability over the past century. While average life expectancy has nearly doubled since 1900, the maximum age has increased by only a few years. This pattern suggests that while medical advances have successfully reduced early mortality, they have had minimal impact on extending the upper limits of human lifespan.\n\nCurrently, there are an estimated 300-450 supercentenarians (people aged 110+) worldwide, according to the Gerontology Research Group. These individuals remain extremely rare despite growing global population and improved healthcare.\n\n## Factors Affecting Maximum Lifespan\n\nSeveral factors will influence the maximum human lifespan by 2100:\n\n**Medical Advances:** Ongoing research in geroscience, biotechnology, and regenerative medicine may eventually impact maximum lifespan, though no concrete breakthroughs with proven effects had been achieved by 2025.\n\n**Lifestyle Factors:** Current supercentenarians often attribute their longevity to various lifestyle factors. Ethel Caterham credits \"never arguing with anyone\" and maintaining a positive attitude[1]. Others mention diet, physical activity, and social connections.\n\n**Genetic Factors:** Some individuals appear genetically predisposed to exceptional longevity, with research suggesting this trait may run in families.\n\n**Environmental Considerations:** Climate change and pollution could potentially impact longevity negatively, while improved living conditions could have positive effects.\n\n## Scientific Understanding of Longevity Limits\n\nScientific research suggests biological constraints on human lifespan. Some studies indicate the body's ability to recover is exhausted between 120 and 150 years. Without addressing fundamental cellular aging processes, surpassing these limits may be challenging.\n\nCardiologist and therapist Andrei Kondrakhin has noted, \"It is possible to live up to 120 years and more; however, it is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent age-related diseases.\"\n\n## Projecting Forward to 2100\n\nGiven the stability of maximum human lifespan over the past century, a conservative projection would place the oldest living person in 2100 at 125-130 years old. This represents a modest increase from the current record, acknowledging the possibility of incremental medical advances and larger population size increasing the chances of statistical outliers.\n\nHowever, the potential for transformative medical breakthroughs cannot be ignored. Revolutionary advances in genetic engineering, cellular reprogramming, or nanotechnology could significantly extend maximum lifespan beyond current limitations.\n\nPercentile 10: 118\nPercentile 20: 122\nPercentile 40: 125\nPercentile 60: 129\nPercentile 80: 140\nPercentile 90: 150",
        "2":"(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  \nApproximately 4 years and 7.5 months remain until January 1, 2030, when the question resolves.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nCurrently, since the post-ChatGPT boom, only a few newly founded labs (e.g., Anthropic, Mistral) have rapidly reached top-5 \u201cleading lab\u201d status within two years of founding. These examples, however, are rare and involved either major talent spinouts or extraordinary funding. No evidence indicates that the rate of such rapid ascents is accelerating; if anything, rising technical, capital, and talent barriers suggest further consolidation among major labs. Therefore, if nothing substantive changes and only typical labs are launched, the likely status quo outcome would be that 0 or 1 new AI lab achieves \u201cleading\u201d status within two years of its founding before 2030.\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in an unexpected outcome:**  \nAn unexpected scenario could involve a sudden paradigm shift\u2014such as a new breakthrough in AI architectures (e.g., neuromorphic computing or quantum AI), the collapse of an incumbent lab due to regulatory or governance failures, or the mass exodus of top talent to create multiple well-funded spinouts. Another wildcard could be an AI arms race fueled by geopolitics or regulatory action that fragments the landscape and rapidly elevates several new entrants to the top tier, possibly resulting in 4, 5, or even more new labs achieving leading status within two years of their founding before 2030.\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\n- **Historical precedent:** Since 2022, only a couple of labs (Anthropic, Mistral) have climbed to the top-5 within two years of founding, and these were exceptional cases driven by high-profile talent and mega funding[2][5].\n- **Current trends:** The generative AI landscape is crowded, with thousands of startups, but the technical and capital requirements to achieve state-of-the-art results are rising sharply, favoring incumbents and making such rapid ascents less common[2][5].\n- **Barriers to entry:** The cost, data, and compute requirements to build frontier models have soared, with leading labs now investing billions and relying on massive infrastructure[2][5].\n- **Future outlook:** While prominent figures (e.g., Demis Hassabis) and deep-pocketed investors could still create fast-rising labs, the handful of realistic candidates per year will keep the number low unless something disrupts the industry landscape dramatically[5].\n- **Room for surprise:** Given the speed of change and the fragility of leadership in AI, a moderate probability for 4\u20135 or even more labs is justified, especially if a new paradigm or exodus unfolds, but those remain lower-probability.\n\n---\n\n## Final Probabilities\n\nOption_0 or 1: 22  \nOption_2 or 3: 56  \nOption_4 or 5: 14  \nOption_6 or 7: 5  \nOption_8 or 9: 2  \nOption_10 or more: 1"
