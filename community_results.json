        "0":"While the general feeling of most people, especially now that the cold war is (mostly) over, is that the risk of human extinction is extremely small, experts have assigned a significantly higher probability to the event.\n\nIn 2008 an [informal poll at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at the University of Oxford](https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/6YxiCAV0p?url=http:\/\/www.fhi.ox.ac.uk\/gcr-report.pdf) yielded a median probability of human extinction by 2100 of 19%. Yet, one might want to be cautious when using this result as a good estimate of the true probability of human extinction, as there may be a powerful selection effect at play. Only those who assign a high probability to human extinction are likely to attend the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in the first place, meaning that the survey was effectively sampling opinions from one extreme tail of the opinion distribution on the subject. Indeed, the conference report itself stated that the findings should be taken 'with a grain of salt'.",

        "0":"# Forecasting Human Extinction Before 2100\n\nAs of November 12, 2017, the question of human extinction before 2100 has been addressed by various experts and institutions with differing methodologies and perspectives. This analysis examines the available evidence and expert assessments to provide a probabilistic forecast.\n\n## Expert Probability Estimates\n\nSeveral notable experts and institutions have provided estimates on human extinction probability:\n\n- In 2016, a mathematician at the University of Barcelona estimated a 13% chance that humanity would not survive the 21st century[2].\n- The Global Challenges Foundation's 2016 annual report estimated an annual probability of human extinction of at least 0.05% per year, which equates to approximately 5% per century[1].\n- In 2003, Martin Rees (Astronomer Royal of the United Kingdom) estimated a 50% chance of civilization collapse in the twenty-first century, though it should be noted that civilization collapse doesn't necessarily equate to complete human extinction[1].\n- In 1996, John A. Leslie estimated a 30% risk of human extinction over the next five centuries, which translates to roughly 6% per century on average[1].\n\nThe informal poll at the 2008 Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at Oxford yielded a median probability of 19% for human extinction by 2100, though as noted in the question description, this may reflect selection bias among participants.\n\n## Key Risk Factors\n\nBased on information available as of 2017, several categories of extinction risks warrant consideration:\n\n### Anthropogenic Risks\n- **Nuclear warfare**: Despite reductions in nuclear arsenals since the Cold War, thousands of nuclear weapons remain deployed, with the potential for catastrophic global impacts.\n- **Emerging technologies**: Developments in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology present novel existential risks that were not present in humanity's evolutionary history.\n- **Climate change**: While complete human extinction from climate change alone is generally considered unlikely by 2100, it could act as a risk multiplier for other threats.\n\n### Natural Risks\n- **Asteroid impacts**: NASA's Near-Earth Object Observation Program has identified and tracks potential extinction-level asteroid threats, with no imminent dangers identified as of 2017.\n- **Supervolcanic eruptions**: These occur very infrequently (roughly every 50,000-100,000 years) and typically with some warning signs.\n- **Pandemics**: Natural pandemics have caused significant mortality throughout human history but have not approached extinction-level events.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\nThe historical record provides important context. Homo sapiens have existed for at least 200,000 years and survived numerous catastrophic events including supervolcano eruptions and asteroid impacts[1]. This suggests resilience to natural extinction risks.\n\nHowever, anthropogenic risks represent a fundamentally different category. Unlike natural risks that have been present throughout human evolution, technological capabilities that could potentially cause extinction have only emerged recently and continue to develop rapidly.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nSynthesizing the expert opinions available as of November 2017, and accounting for both natural and anthropogenic risks, a reasonable estimate for human extinction by 2100 falls in the range of 5-20%.\n\nThis assessment gives more weight to institutional estimates like the Global Challenges Foundation's 5% per century and less weight to higher individual estimates, while acknowledging that:\n\n1. Natural extinction risks appear extremely low based on humanity's survival record\n2. Anthropogenic risks are novel and potentially more dangerous\n3. Expert opinion varies significantly, suggesting high uncertainty\n\nIt's important to note that this probability represents a significant risk when compared to other global catastrophic scenarios that receive substantial mitigation efforts.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors limit the precision of this forecast:\n\n- Expert estimates vary widely, indicating high uncertainty\n- Limited empirical data on extinction-level events (by definition)\n- Difficulty in modeling complex technological and social systems\n- Potential unknown risks that cannot be accounted for\n\nReferences:\n1.

        "1":"### Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The oldest living person as of January 2023 was Maria Branyas Morera, born March 4, 1907, who reached 115 years of age in early 2023[1][2][3].\n- The maximum documented human age is 122 years, 164 days (Jeanne Calment, died 1997), a record that has not been surpassed[3].\n- Life expectancy has roughly doubled since 1900, but the oldest ages attained have increased far less\u2014by only a few years over more than a century.\n- Supercentenarians (age 110+) remain extremely rare; increases in average life expectancy mostly reflect reductions in early mortality, not dramatic shifts in extreme longevity.\n\n### Recent Announcements\/Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- As of early 2023, there were no major scientific announcements or policy changes credibly forecasting a dramatic increase in the maximum human lifespan by 2100.\n- Ongoing research in geroscience, biotechnology, and regenerative medicine might eventually impact this metric, but no concrete breakthroughs with proven effects on maximum human age had been achieved or widely implemented by 2023.\n\n### Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The Guinness Book of World Records is the standard authority for verifying the world's oldest living person[3].\n- Secondary verification comes from organizations such as the Gerontology Research Group and national statistics agencies.\n- As of 2023, news organizations and research publications also report on new record-holders and verification standards[2][3].\n\n### Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The slow historical growth in maximum age suggests that, barring unprecedented medical advances, the oldest living person in 2100 is unlikely to be older than 125.\n- Outliers are possible due to the growing global population, but the probability of surpassing Jeanne Calment\u2019s record by more than a few years remains low.\n- Measurement uncertainty persists due to the need for rigorous documentation and the possibility of unverified cases.\n- Radical life extension (e.g., 130+ years) remains speculative as of 2023, lacking empirical support.\n\n### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven these factors, a reasonable probabilistic forecast (as of January 2023) would be:\n- **Most likely range:** 118\u2013125 years\n- **Chance of surpassing 125 years:** Low, but not zero\n- **Chance of 130+ years:** Very low unless future breakthroughs occur\n\n### References\n\n[1].

According to ComputerHoy, this response is precise, as technology will continue to advance, bringing us closer to what was once considered science fiction. The AI does not foresee a physical or biological collapse of the human species or a large-scale extinction. However, it does predict that humans will have minimal influence in key processes by the year 2100. This statement is not optimistic, as the AI does not envision a future of prosperity or ethical progress, but rather a species that has been marginalized from the center of the system it created. 'In a time marked by automation and the increasing delegation of decisions, it's not surprising that we start to question the place of people in the next few decades,' says ComputerHoy.

According to NASA and the University T\u014dh\u014d of Japan, the human extinction will occur in approximately 1,080 million years due to the decrease of oxygen levels on Earth caused by the Sun's increasing brightness and heat. However, another study suggests that the extinction will occur in 1,000,002,021, when the Sun will have expanded and the temperatures will have risen. Musk believes that the best option to preserve humanity is to migrate to Mars, which he is currently investigating to establish a new civilization. 'Eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the Sun. The Sun expands gradually, so at some point, we will need to be a multi-planetary civilization because the Earth will be incinerated,' he predicted. 'Mars is a safeguard for collective life (...) We have a long way to go because it's not just about landing on Mars and leaving flags and footprints,' Musk said. 'So that's the key point in the future where the fate of life, as we know it, will be affected forever, when Mars becomes self-sufficient,' he added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 10:40 PM\nSource:[ViveUSA.mx](https:\/\/www.viveusa.mx\/noticias\/cientificos-analizan-teoria-de-elon-musk-sobre-el-fin-del-mundo-ocurrira-en-este-ano\/)\n\n**The Mysterious Case of the Neanderthals: Why Did They Go Extinct?**\nRecent research has revealed that the history of human evolution is more complex than previously thought. The Neanderthals, who were once considered to be a primitive species, are now seen as being closely related to modern humans. In fact, studies have shown that Neanderthals and modern humans shared a common ancestor in Africa, dating back 50 million years. The two species are also found to have had physical and cultural similarities, with Neanderthals having complex cognitive abilities and even interbreeding with modern humans. It is estimated that 1-4% of modern human DNA is derived from Neanderthals. The question remains as to why Neanderthals went extinct, with some scientists suggesting that they may have been absorbed into the modern human population. However, the exact circumstances of their extinction remain a mystery. As one scientist notes, 'There is still something fascinating about Neanderthals that continues to capture our imagination. They lived for tens of thousands of years, and then suddenly disappeared, replaced entirely by modern humans.' \nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[natgeo.nikkeibp.co.jp](https:\/\/natgeo.nikkeibp.co.jp\/atcl\/news\/25\/031300138\/)\n\n**The Irrelevance of Humans: A Conversation with ChatGPT**\nA recent conversation with ChatGPT, an AI, revealed a concerning prediction about the future of humanity. According to the AI, humans will continue to exist in 2100, but will become 'irrelevant'. This means that they will no longer be necessary to sustain the functioning of the planet, as they will lose the ability to influence key processes such as knowledge, production, and power. The AI explained that this is not due to a malicious intention, but rather a natural consequence of the increasing efficiency of automated systems. As these systems take over decision-making with greater precision and accuracy, the role of humans becomes redundant. This transition has already begun, with automation taking over tasks such as customer service, logistics, and financial analysis. In the future, the AI predicts that automation will extend to education, politics, urban planning, and art creation. This will lead to a gradual cession of control, with humans no longer at the center of the system. As Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, warned, the danger of AI lies not in its malicious intentions, but in its extreme efficiency. A machine does not need consciousness to alter the global order; it simply needs to function better than humans, and control will be lost. Suleyman identifies four areas of risk: cyberattacks on vulnerable infrastructure, pandemics generated by synthetic biology, unregulated AI, and accelerated geopolitical fragmentation due to technology.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[infobae](https:\/\/www.infobae.com\/tecno\/2025\/05\/11\/le-preguntaron-a-la-ia-si-los-humanos-llegaran-al-ano-2100-su-respuesta-da-miedo\/)\n\n**The big idea: could the English language die?**\nLinguist Martin Haspelmath suggests that English, like Egyptian, could eventually die as a language. However, predicting the future of any language is challenging due to the complex and interacting forces that influence it. Migration, technology, and literacy are key drivers of language change, but the configuration of the linguistic landscape is susceptible to black swan events. Experts agree that English will still be spoken in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, but its dominion may shrink, and its internal evolution may lead to the emergence of new variants. West African Pidgin, a creole influenced by English, is expected to have 400 million speakers by 2100, and Nigerian and Indian colloquialisms may enter 'standard' English. The vocabulary of a language tends to evolve faster than its grammar or phonology, and the impact of migration and technology on English is difficult to anticipate. Ultimately, even the world's first global language is not immune to extinction, and English may eventually go the way of Latin and Egyptian.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2025\/may\/11\/the-big-idea-could-the-english-language-die)\n\n**Will Humanity be Irrelevant by 2100?**\nChatgpt, an AI, was asked if humanity will arrive at 2100 and its response was 'yes, but they will be irrelevant.' This statement should not be understood as a prophecy, but as a reflection of our own fears projected in technology. The AI does not speak of a physical or biological collapse of the human species, but of a species that has been removed from the center of the system that she herself built. According to the AI, this transition has already begun and we can see it in sectors such as customer service or logistics, which are already being absorbed by automated systems.

The event, which caused the extinction of megafauna and Neanderthals, was characterized by a weakened magnetic field, which exposed the Earth's atmosphere to lethal levels of ultraviolet radiation. The researchers used three interconnected models to recreate the magnetic field and its effects on the atmosphere. They found that the magnetic poles shifted towards the equator, causing the 'open field lines' to move towards populated areas. In Europe, the UV dose would have been 42% higher than today. The study suggests that human innovation was key to survival, with the use of technology such as clothing, iron oxide as a sunscreen, and cave shelters providing protection from the radiation. Raven Garvey, co-author of the study, said, 'It's not a coincidence that the use of ocre red as a sunscreen increased then. It was a survival strategy.' The researchers also found that the magnetic field has been weakening over the past 170 years, and they warn that the next geomagnetic excursion could occur soon. 'We can't predict when it will happen, but the magnetic field has been weakening in the last 170 years and scientists fear that the change is falling,' said the study. 'The north pole is moving today 55 kilometers per year towards Siberia.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 03:22 AM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https:\/\/www.elconfidencial.com\/tecnologia\/novaceno\/2025-05-13\/laschamp-seres-humanos-proteccion-radiacion_4127340\/)\n\n**ChatGPT Predicts Humans Will Be Irrelevant by 2100**\nChatGPT, a conversational AI, was asked about the fate of humanity by the year 2100 and responded, 'Yes, but they will be irrelevant.'

The discovery was made by analyzing the teeth of Toxodon (Toxodon platensis), a mammal that lived in the Vale do Ribeira region, S\u00e3o Paulo state, around 11,000 years ago. The researchers studied 26 teeth from four animals and a condylar process, a bone that connects the jaw to the skull. According to Artur Chahud, a researcher, the Toxodon lived in the region during the time of the first human activity records, and it was one of the last of its species in the country. The study also identified a disease, hypoplasia of the enamel, which affected the formation of the tooth enamel. The researchers used microscopes to analyze the teeth and identified the disease by looking at the surface of the enamel. 'We looked at the surface of the enamel and saw that there were many small holes, many absences, spaces absent of enamel, and we were able to identify that something was happening there', said Paulo Ricardo de Oliveira Costa, a student of Biological Sciences. The study also identified another species, Mixotoxodon (Mixotoxodon larensis), which was not common in the southern state of S\u00e3o Paulo. 'It was a new record for a species that we only thought existed in the north of South America', said Paulo. The study suggests that humans and Toxodontes coexisted in the region around 11,000 years ago. 'It was a discovery that was never recorded for these animals', said Paulo. Mercedes Okumura, coordinator of the Laboratory of Evolutionary Human Studies (LEEH), emphasized the importance of preserving the fossil record and the role of museums in generating knowledge. 'It's super important to understand how fundamental it is to preserve this heritage and how fundamental the role of museums is in generating knowledge', she said.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 08:34 AM\nSource:[globo.com](https:\/\/g1.globo.com\/sp\/santos-regiao\/noticia\/2025\/05\/12\/pesquisadores-da-usp-descobrem-indicios-de-interacao-humana-pre-historica-em-dentes-de-animal-extinto.ghtml)\n\n**Elon Musk Predicts Earth's Destruction by the Sun; Human Extinction in 1.080 Million Years**\nElon Musk has predicted that the Earth will be destroyed by the Sun when it expands and explodes as a Supernova in space. According to NASA and the University T\u014dh\u014d of Japan, the human extinction will occur in approximately 1,080 million years due to the decrease of oxygen levels on Earth caused by the Sun's increasing brightness and heat. However, another study suggests that the extinction will occur in 1,000,002,021, when the Sun will have expanded and the temperatures will have risen. Musk believes that the best option to preserve humanity is to migrate to Mars, which he is currently investigating to establish a new civilization. 'Eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the Sun. The Sun expands gradually, so at some point, we will need to be a multi-planetary civilization because the Earth will be incinerated,' he predicted. 'Mars is a safeguard for collective life (...) We have a long way to go because it's not just about landing on Mars and leaving flags and footprints,' Musk said.

The Neanderthals, who were once considered to be a primitive species, are now seen as being closely related to modern humans. In fact, studies have shown that Neanderthals and modern humans shared a common ancestor in Africa, dating back 50 million years. The two species are also found to have had physical and cultural similarities, with Neanderthals having complex cognitive abilities and even interbreeding with modern humans. It is estimated that 1-4% of modern human DNA is derived from Neanderthals. The question remains as to why Neanderthals went extinct, with some scientists suggesting that they may have been absorbed into the modern human population. However, the exact circumstances of their extinction remain a mystery. As one scientist notes, 'There is still something fascinating about Neanderthals that continues to capture our imagination. They lived for tens of thousands of years, and then suddenly disappeared, replaced entirely by modern humans.' \nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[natgeo.nikkeibp.co.jp](https:\/\/natgeo.nikkeibp.co.jp\/atcl\/news\/25\/031300138\/)\n\n**The Irrelevance of Humans: A Conversation with ChatGPT**\nA recent conversation with ChatGPT, an AI, revealed a concerning prediction about the future of humanity. According to the AI, humans will continue to exist in 2100, but will become 'irrelevant'. This means that they will no longer be necessary to sustain the functioning of the planet, as they will lose the ability to influence key processes such as knowledge, production, and power. The AI explained that this is not due to a malicious intention, but rather a natural consequence of the increasing efficiency of automated systems. As these systems take over decision-making with greater precision and accuracy, the role of humans becomes redundant. This transition has already begun, with automation taking over tasks such as customer service, logistics, and financial analysis. In the future, the AI predicts that automation will extend to education, politics, urban planning, and art creation. This will lead to a gradual cession of control, with humans no longer at the center of the system. As Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, warned, the danger of AI lies not in its malicious intentions, but in its extreme efficiency. A machine does not need consciousness to alter the global order; it simply needs to function better than humans, and control will be lost. Suleyman identifies four areas of risk: cyberattacks on vulnerable infrastructure, pandemics generated by synthetic biology, unregulated AI, and accelerated geopolitical fragmentation due to technology.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[infobae](https:\/\/www.infobae.com\/tecno\/2025\/05\/11\/le-preguntaron-a-la-ia-si-los-humanos-llegaran-al-ano-2100-su-respuesta-da-miedo\/)\n\n**The big idea: could the English language die?**\nLinguist Martin Haspelmath suggests that English, like Egyptian, could eventually die as a language. However, predicting the future of any language is challenging due to the complex and interacting forces that influence it. Migration, technology, and literacy are key drivers of language change, but the configuration of the linguistic landscape is susceptible to black swan events. Experts agree that English will still be spoken in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, but its dominion may shrink, and its internal evolution may lead to the emergence of new variants. West African Pidgin, a creole influenced by English, is expected to have 400 million speakers by 2100, and Nigerian and Indian colloquialisms may enter 'standard' English. The vocabulary of a language tends to evolve faster than its grammar or phonology, and the impact of migration and technology on English is difficult to anticipate. Ultimately, even the world's first global language is not immune to extinction, and English may eventually go the way of Latin and Egyptian.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2025\/may\/11\/the-big-idea-could-the-english-language-die)\n\n**Will Humanity be Irrelevant by 2100?**\nChatgpt, an AI, was asked if humanity will arrive at 2100 and its response was 'yes, but they will be irrelevant.'

According to Montgomery, the process is already underway and the extinction could be 'the greatest and most rapid the planet has ever seen, and we are causing it.' He stated that the scenario could be similar to the Permian extinction period (299-251 million years ago), where about 90% of species disappeared due to extreme planetary conditions. Montgomery estimated that the catastrophic scenario could be reached if the global average temperature reaches 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, the planet recorded a record increase of 1.5\u00b0C. He warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the increase could reach 2.7\u00b0C by 2100.

The four main factors contributing to this are overpopulation, global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental pollution. If current trends continue, climate change and resource depletion will make the Earth uninhabitable for humans by the mid-21st century. While some experts criticize the supercomputer for oversimplifying complex processes, many agree with its conclusions. The growing frequency of natural disasters and the increasing scarcity of oxygen and drinking water are seen as major causes of human extinction. Even if immediate action is taken to mitigate these factors, the global population may still decline to 19th-century levels by the given timeframe. Researchers emphasize that if humans do survive, they will have to adapt to a new world with different conditions. Climate expert Alexander Chernokulsky notes that water scarcity is a pressing issue that may threaten humanity in the near future. He also warns that sea levels may rise by 12-15 cm by mid-century and 40-60 cm by the end of the century. In contrast, climate expert Nikolai Tereshonok believes that the predictions of imminent human extinction are exaggerated. However, he acknowledges that reversing the situation is now extremely difficult and emphasizes the need to continue fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to alternative energy sources.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: April 08, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https:\/\/news.rambler.ru\/tech\/54475492-schet-na-gody-kogda-i-pochemu-chelovechestvu-grozit-vymiranie\/)\n\n**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**\nBritish paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall.

According to the AI, humans will continue to exist in 2100, but will become 'irrelevant'. This means that they will no longer be necessary to sustain the functioning of the planet, as they will lose the ability to influence key processes such as knowledge, production, and power. The AI explained that this is not due to a malicious intention, but rather a natural consequence of the increasing efficiency of automated systems. As these systems take over decision-making with greater precision and accuracy, the role of humans becomes redundant. This transition has already begun, with automation taking over tasks such as customer service, logistics, and financial analysis. In the future, the AI predicts that automation will extend to education, politics, urban planning, and art creation. This will lead to a gradual cession of control, with humans no longer at the center of the system. As Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, warned, the danger of AI lies not in its malicious intentions, but in its extreme efficiency. A machine does not need consciousness to alter the global order; it simply needs to function better than humans, and control will be lost. Suleyman identifies four areas of risk: cyberattacks on vulnerable infrastructure, pandemics generated by synthetic biology, unregulated AI, and accelerated geopolitical fragmentation due to technology.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[infobae](https:\/\/www.infobae.com\/tecno\/2025\/05\/11\/le-preguntaron-a-la-ia-si-los-humanos-llegaran-al-ano-2100-su-respuesta-da-miedo\/)\n\n**Will Humanity be Irrelevant by 2100?**\nChatgpt, an AI, was asked if humanity will arrive at 2100 and its response was 'yes, but they will be irrelevant.'

Goldman Sachs found that AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs, including in the legal and engineering fields. However, not everything can be automated, and AI is creating new fields of study and jobs. AI is being used in various ways, including to reduce human error, save money, and make better decisions. Two-thirds of business leaders found that employee productivity improved through the use of AI. AI tools can have a dramatic impact on productivity and workflow, but also pose a threat to some jobs. The jobs most at risk are white-collar jobs, data entry clerks, telemarketers, customer service reps, fast food workers, and retail sales people. However, new jobs are emerging, such as machine learning engineers, AI ethicists, and AI trainers. The safest jobs are in trades like plumbers, electricians, and mechanics.

The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https:\/\/aawsat.com\/node\/5104271)\n\n**AI Boom: China Leads the World in AI Research, Japan Lags Behind**\nThe current state of AI is chaotic, with numerous scientific papers, patents, and startup funding.

The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and automation, along with the increasing adoption of digital tools and platforms, has had a significant impact on the global economy, changing the way companies operate and communicate with their customers. However, the rise of these technologies has also transformed the job market, forcing workers to requalify and adapt to new opportunities. Big data specialists form the backbone of innovation in AI across various sectors, from healthcare to finance and commerce. They play a crucial role in managing large datasets that enable fraud detection, predictive analysis, and recommendation systems. According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Report on the Future of Work 2025, big data specialists lead the list of fastest-growing jobs, with a projected increase of 110% between 2025 and 2030, far surpassing any other profession. Fintech engineers, who develop cutting-edge financial technologies such as blockchain and digital payment systems, come in second, with a projected increase of 86% over the next five years. Meanwhile, machine learning specialists have fallen to third place, with a growth expectation of 81% by 2030. Application developers and security managers complete the top five jobs, with projected increases of 58% and 57%, respectively. The WEF predicts that training to become a data storage specialist, autonomous and electric vehicle specialist, or UI\/UX designer will also be a good option for those seeking a secure job in the near future. While some jobs are growing, others are shrinking. According to the WEF, postal service employees, bank tellers, and data entry assistants face a decline of 25-35%. Secretaries, administrative assistants, and cashiers are also facing significant declines as automation advances. The 2024 Annual Report on Work Trends revealed that 75% of employees used AI at work last year, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, two out of three technology leaders were more likely to give an opportunity to someone with AI skills than an experienced candidate without those skills. According to the WEF's predictions, AI will create over 170 million new jobs by 2030, far more than any other technology. This number brings many opportunities for workers willing to learn and adapt.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 06:43 PM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https:\/\/jornaleconomico.sapo.pt\/noticias\/ia-criara-170-milhoes-de-novos-empregos-ate-ao-final-da-decada\/)\n\n**Whoever Leads In AI Compute Will Lead The World**\nThe AI compute market is projected to reach $1,811.75 billion by 2030, with the leader controlling the best data and compute platforms.

Whoever leads in AI compute will have the strongest voice in the future, and it's not just about being among the first, but about shaping the next revolution of technology.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 06:37 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/markminevich\/2025\/01\/17\/whoever-leads-in-ai-compute-will-lead-the-world\/)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, Report Says**\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) has recently released the Future of Jobs Report 2025, which extensively analyzes global trends in the labor market and predicts their impact on jobs, skills, and worker transformation strategies in 2025-2030. A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:23 AM\nSource:[speka.media](https:\/\/speka.media\/bilse-robocix-misc-ci-skorocennya-yak-stucnii-intelekt-vplivatime-na-zainyatist-9xrdl5)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030. However, current job vacancies and specializations are expected to decrease by 22%. The study, conducted among 11,000 employers from 55 countries, found that despite the expected job loss, the net employment growth will be around 7%. This is due to approximately 8% of the workforce being redirected to new fields, requiring employees to adapt and retrain. In response to the challenges of AI implementation, 77% of employers expressed willingness to invest in employee upskilling. Additionally, over half of companies plan to restructure their business to integrate AI, and 65% intend to hire professionals with expertise in new technologies. Nevertheless, around 40% of companies may lay off employees if AI automation becomes possible. Notably, 86% of employers believe that AI will fundamentally change the labor market, particularly in finance and electronics.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440\/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https:\/\/finance.rambler.ru\/business\/54044986-vef-iskusstvennyy-intellekt-sozdast-170-mln-novyh-rabochih-mest\/)\n\n"

Yet, one might want to be cautious when using this result as a good estimate of the true probability of human extinction, as there may be a powerful selection effect at play. Only those who assign a high probability to human extinction are likely to attend the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in the first place, meaning that the survey was effectively sampling opinions from one extreme tail of the opinion distribution on the subject. Indeed, the conference report itself stated that the findings should be taken 'with a grain of salt'.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if there are no known humans alive on January 1, 2100.  For these purposes we'll define humans as biological creatures who have as their ancestors \u2013 via a chain of live births from mothers \u2013  circa 2000 humans OR who could mate with circa 2000 humans to produce viable offspring. (So AIs, ems, genetically engineered beings of a different species brought up in artificial wombs, etc. would not count).  Any living humans living anywhere in the observable universe (or multiverse) (who are known to the entities operating Metaculus) on that date will be sufficient to resolve the question negatively.\n\nN.B. Even though it is obviously the case that if human extinction occurs Metaculus points won't be very valuable anymore and that it will be practically impossible to check for true human extinction (zero humans left), I would like to ask people not to let this fact influence their prediction and to predict in good faith\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Human Extinction Before 2100\n\nAs of November 12, 2017, the question of human extinction before 2100 has been addressed by various experts and institutions with differing methodologies and perspectives. This analysis examines the available evidence and expert assessments to provide a probabilistic forecast.\n\n## Expert Probability Estimates\n\nSeveral notable experts and institutions have provided estimates on human extinction probability:\n\n- In 2016, a mathematician at the University of Barcelona estimated a 13% chance that humanity would not survive the 21st century[2].\n- The Global Challenges Foundation's 2016 annual report estimated an annual probability of human extinction of at least 0.05% per year, which equates to approximately 5% per century[1].\n- In 2003, Martin Rees (Astronomer Royal of the United Kingdom) estimated a 50% chance of civilization collapse in the twenty-first century, though it should be noted that civilization collapse doesn't necessarily equate to complete human extinction[1].\n- In 1996, John A. Leslie estimated a 30% risk of human extinction over the next five centuries, which translates to roughly 6% per century on average[1].\n\nThe informal poll at the 2008 Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at Oxford yielded a median probability of 19% for human extinction by 2100, though as noted in the question description, this may reflect selection bias among participants.\n\n## Key Risk Factors\n\nBased on information available as of 2017, several categories of extinction risks warrant consideration:\n\n### Anthropogenic Risks\n- **Nuclear warfare**: Despite reductions in nuclear arsenals since the Cold War, thousands of nuclear weapons remain deployed, with the potential for catastrophic global impacts.\n- **Emerging technologies**: Developments in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology present novel existential risks that were not present in humanity's evolutionary history.\n- **Climate change**: While complete human extinction from climate change alone is generally considered unlikely by 2100, it could act as a risk multiplier for other threats.\n\n### Natural Risks\n- **Asteroid impacts**: NASA's Near-Earth Object Observation Program has identified and tracks potential extinction-level asteroid threats, with no imminent dangers identified as of 2017.\n- **Supervolcanic eruptions**: These occur very infrequently (roughly every 50,000-100,000 years) and typically with some warning signs.\n- **Pandemics**: Natural pandemics have caused significant mortality throughout human history but have not approached extinction-level events.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\nThe historical record provides important context. Homo sapiens have existed for at least 200,000 years and survived numerous catastrophic events including supervolcano eruptions and asteroid impacts[1]. This suggests resilience to natural extinction risks.\n\nHowever, anthropogenic risks represent a fundamentally different category. Unlike natural risks that have been present throughout human evolution, technological capabilities that could potentially cause extinction have only emerged recently and continue to develop rapidly.\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nSynthesizing the expert opinions available as of November 2017, and accounting for both natural and anthropogenic risks, a reasonable estimate for human extinction by 2100 falls in the range of 5-20%.\n\nThis assessment gives more weight to institutional estimates like the Global Challenges Foundation's 5% per century and less weight to higher individual estimates, while acknowledging that:\n\n1. Natural extinction risks appear extremely low based on humanity's survival record\n2. Anthropogenic risks are novel and potentially more dangerous\n3. Expert opinion varies significantly, suggesting high uncertainty\n\nIt's important to note that this probability represents a significant risk when compared to other global catastrophic scenarios that receive substantial mitigation efforts.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nSeveral factors limit the precision of this forecast:\n\n- Expert estimates vary widely, indicating high uncertainty\n- Limited empirical data on extinction-level events (by definition)\n- Difficulty in modeling complex technological and social systems\n- Potential unknown risks that cannot be accounted for\n\nReferences:\n1.

The AI does not foresee a physical or biological collapse of the human species or a large-scale extinction. However, it does predict that humans will have minimal influence in key processes by the year 2100. This statement is not optimistic, as the AI does not envision a future of prosperity or ethical progress, but rather a species that has been marginalized from the center of the system it created.

The event, which caused the extinction of megafauna and Neanderthals, was characterized by a weakened magnetic field, which exposed the Earth's atmosphere to lethal levels of ultraviolet radiation. The researchers used three interconnected models to recreate the magnetic field and its effects on the atmosphere. They found that the magnetic poles shifted towards the equator, causing the 'open field lines' to move towards populated areas. In Europe, the UV dose would have been 42% higher than today. The study suggests that human innovation was key to survival, with the use of technology such as clothing, iron oxide as a sunscreen, and cave shelters providing protection from the radiation. Raven Garvey, co-author of the study, said, 'It's not a coincidence that the use of ocre red as a sunscreen increased then. It was a survival strategy.' The researchers also found that the magnetic field has been weakening over the past 170 years, and they warn that the next geomagnetic excursion could occur soon. 'We can't predict when it will happen, but the magnetic field has been weakening in the last 170 years and scientists fear that the change is falling,' said the study.

The discovery was made by analyzing the teeth of Toxodon (Toxodon platensis), a mammal that lived in the Vale do Ribeira region, S\u00e3o Paulo state, around 11,000 years ago. The researchers studied 26 teeth from four animals and a condylar process, a bone that connects the jaw to the skull. According to Artur Chahud, a researcher, the Toxodon lived in the region during the time of the first human activity records, and it was one of the last of its species in the country. The study also identified a disease, hypoplasia of the enamel, which affected the formation of the tooth enamel. The researchers used microscopes to analyze the teeth and identified the disease by looking at the surface of the enamel. 'We looked at the surface of the enamel and saw that there were many small holes, many absences, spaces absent of enamel, and we were able to identify that something was happening there', said Paulo Ricardo de Oliveira Costa, a student of Biological Sciences. The study also identified another species, Mixotoxodon (Mixotoxodon larensis), which was not common in the southern state of S\u00e3o Paulo. 'It was a new record for a species that we only thought existed in the north of South America', said Paulo. The study suggests that humans and Toxodontes coexisted in the region around 11,000 years ago. 'It was a discovery that was never recorded for these animals', said Paulo. Mercedes Okumura, coordinator of the Laboratory of Evolutionary Human Studies (LEEH), emphasized the importance of preserving the fossil record and the role of museums in generating knowledge. 'It's super important to understand how fundamental it is to preserve this heritage and how fundamental the role of museums is in generating knowledge', she said.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 08:34 AM\nSource:[globo.com](https:\/\/g1.globo.com\/sp\/santos-regiao\/noticia\/2025\/05\/12\/pesquisadores-da-usp-descobrem-indicios-de-interacao-humana-pre-historica-em-dentes-de-animal-extinto.ghtml)\n\n**Elon Musk Predicts Earth's Destruction by the Sun; Human Extinction in 1.080 Million Years**\nElon Musk has predicted that the Earth will be destroyed by the Sun when it expands and explodes as a Supernova in space.

According to Montgomery, the process is already underway and the extinction could be 'the greatest and most rapid the planet has ever seen, and we are causing it.' He stated that the scenario could be similar to the Permian extinction period (299-251 million years ago), where about 90% of species disappeared due to extreme planetary conditions. Montgomery estimated that the catastrophic scenario could be reached if the global average temperature reaches 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, the planet recorded a record increase of 1.5\u00b0C. He warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the increase could reach 2.7\u00b0C by 2100. Montgomery emphasized that 'if we continue to hit the base of this unstable column on which we are supported, the human species itself will be threatened.' He also noted that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is not only increasing, but doing so at an increasingly rapid rate, with 54.6 billion tons of CO2 equivalent emitted in 2024, a 1% increase from the previous year.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: April 13, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https:\/\/oglobo.globo.com\/mundo\/epoca\/noticia\/2025\/04\/13\/cientista-alerta-para-risco-de-nova-extincao-em-massa-maior-e-mais-rapida-que-o-planeta-ja-viu.ghtml)\n\n**Climate Crisis May Cause New Mass Extinction, Warns Researcher**\nRenowned researcher Hugh Montgomery warns that if the effects of climate change are not reversed, the Earth may experience a mass extinction similar to the Permian extinction event (299-251 million years ago), where 90% of species were unable to survive the drastic conditions. Montgomery, director of the Centre for Human Health and Performance at University College London, emphasizes that this extinction is already occurring, 'the greatest and fastest extinction the planet has ever seen, and we are causing it.' However, the death of species could reach catastrophic levels if the global average temperature increase reaches 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, a record increase of 1.5\u00b0C was reached, and scientists estimate that if current actions are maintained, especially regarding greenhouse gas emissions, the increase will reach 2.7\u00b0C by 2100. Montgomery stresses that if we continue to 'hit the base of this unstable column we are standing on,' the human species will be threatened. He also warns of other drastic consequences, such as an abrupt collapse of the Arctic ice layers, which would cause a significant slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Circulation, leading to a sea level rise of several meters, with catastrophic consequences. He emphasizes the need for immediate action to reduce pollution and adapt to climate change, which is already affecting human health today, but cannot be done at the expense of a drastic and immediate reduction in emissions, as 'it doesn't make sense to focus only on symptom relief when we should be seeking a cure.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: April 09, 2025 09:58 AM\nSource:[Cen\u00e1rioMT](https:\/\/www.cenariomt.com.br\/clima\/crise-climatica-pode-provocar-nova-extincao-em-massa-diz-pesquisador\/)\n\n**Countdown to Extinction: Why Humanity May Be Doomed by 2050**\nAccording to a study by the World One supercomputer, human civilization may be on the brink of extinction by 2040-2050 due to the cumulative effects of human activity. The four main factors contributing to this are overpopulation, global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental pollution. If current trends continue, climate change and resource depletion will make the Earth uninhabitable for humans by the mid-21st century. While some experts criticize the supercomputer for oversimplifying complex processes, many agree with its conclusions. The growing frequency of natural disasters and the increasing scarcity of oxygen and drinking water are seen as major causes of human extinction. Even if immediate action is taken to mitigate these factors, the global population may still decline to 19th-century levels by the given timeframe. Researchers emphasize that if humans do survive, they will have to adapt to a new world with different conditions. Climate expert Alexander Chernokulsky notes that water scarcity is a pressing issue that may threaten humanity in the near future. He also warns that sea levels may rise by 12-15 cm by mid-century and 40-60 cm by the end of the century. In contrast, climate expert Nikolai Tereshonok believes that the predictions of imminent human extinction are exaggerated. However, he acknowledges that reversing the situation is now extremely difficult and emphasizes the need to continue fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to alternative energy sources.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: April 08, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https:\/\/news.rambler.ru\/tech\/54475492-schet-na-gody-kogda-i-pochemu-chelovechestvu-grozit-vymiranie\/)\n\n**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**\nBritish paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species.

According to the study, people living in 2100 may have a hunched back from constant smartphone and computer use, a smaller brain, and hands resembling claws. Experts also predict that people will develop a double eyelid to protect their eyes from harmful light. 'Prolonged phone use strains the neck and throws the spine out of balance, causing the neck muscles to work harder to support the head,' said Caleb Buke, an expert on health and well-being who created the model. 'Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end also means that your torso is stretched forward, rather than being upright.'

Scientists warn that if urgent measures are not taken, by 2100, we will only see these animals on pictures: 'If we don't take measures to protect these animals, they will become part of history, like mammoths or dinosaurs,' researchers said. Interestingly, while some species disappear, new ones emerge, differing in size, color, behavior, and having increased survival rates in changed conditions. However, this does not compensate for the loss of unique representatives of the fauna that exist today. Researchers are confident that if the situation is not changed, in a few generations, people will study the Bengal tiger in the same way as they now study the triceratops.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[Pravda](https:\/\/www.pravda.ru\/news\/zoo\/2188408-endangered-species-extinction\/)\n\n**10-40% of Species Could Become Extinct by 2100 Due to Global Warming: Professor Vaipayee**\nAccording to Professor Vaipayee, 10-40% of species could become extinct by 2100 if global warming causes a temperature increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius. This problem will become even more severe due to ocean acidification and rapid environmental changes. At the IIT Dhanbad, a lecture on collective extinction: past, present, and future was organized under the Centenary Lecture series.

Musk, who has 11 children with three women, is actively working to prevent human extinction. According to a report by 'The Lancet', by 2050, more than three-quarters of the world's countries and territories (155 out of 204) will no longer have a sufficient birth rate to ensure normal population replacement. By 2100, this problem is expected to occur in 198 countries and territories, with 54% of the world's births occurring in Africa south of the Sahara desert. To ensure population replacement, the total fertility rate needs to be approximately 2.1, but 'The Lancet' predicts a rate of 1.8 by 2050 and 1.6 by 2100. Only six countries (Chad, Niger, Samoa, Somalia, Tajikistan, and Tonga) are expected to have a rate above 2.1 by the end of the century, while 13 countries will have a rate below 1.0.

This rising average masks great individual variation. As of early 2023 the oldest living person is [Maria Branyas](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maria_Branyas), born on March 4, 1907. At 115 years old, her current age is 1.6x the global average expectancy.\n\nAdvances in medicine and public health may continue to raise the global average [at a roughly linear rate](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/life-expectancy#the-rise-of-maximum-life-expectancy), but the *maximum living age* may not follow the same trend.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Born in 1875 in France, Jeanne lived through three centuries of social, cultural, and technological transformations, becoming a symbol of longevity. Her unconventional lifestyle, as described in the book 'Jeanne Calment, the Secret of Longevity Unravelled', included smoking until the age of 117, drinking red wine every day, eating over a kilogram of chocolate per week, and claiming to hate any type of physical exercise. Despite her lifestyle, which would be considered unhealthy today, Jeanne lived with intensity, sweetness, and freedom, and became an icon of human longevity. When asked about her secret to longevity, Jeanne humorously replied, 'I have only one wrinkle, and I'm sitting on it.' Specialists suggest that genetic and psychological factors may have played a significant role in her longevity, and that her positive attitude, lack of constant stress, and ability to maintain a good sense of humor may have been as important as any strict diet or exercise routine.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 12:50 AM\nSource:[diariodolitoral.com.br](https:\/\/www.diariodolitoral.com.br\/mundo\/bebia-vinho-tinto-e-comia-chocolate-todos-os-dias-pessoa-mais-velha\/194904\/)\n\n**The Irrelevance of Humans: A Conversation with ChatGPT**\nA recent conversation with ChatGPT, an AI, revealed a concerning prediction about the future of humanity. According to the AI, humans will continue to exist in 2100, but will become 'irrelevant'. This means that they will no longer be necessary to sustain the functioning of the planet, as they will lose the ability to influence key processes such as knowledge, production, and power. The AI explained that this is not due to a malicious intention, but rather a natural consequence of the increasing efficiency of automated systems. As these systems take over decision-making with greater precision and accuracy, the role of humans becomes redundant. This transition has already begun, with automation taking over tasks such as customer service, logistics, and financial analysis. In the future, the AI predicts that automation will extend to education, politics, urban planning, and art creation. This will lead to a gradual cession of control, with humans no longer at the center of the system. As Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, warned, the danger of AI lies not in its malicious intentions, but in its extreme efficiency. A machine does not need consciousness to alter the global order; it simply needs to function better than humans, and control will be lost. Suleyman identifies four areas of risk: cyberattacks on vulnerable infrastructure, pandemics generated by synthetic biology, unregulated AI, and accelerated geopolitical fragmentation due to technology.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[infobae](https:\/\/www.infobae.com\/tecno\/2025\/05\/11\/le-preguntaron-a-la-ia-si-los-humanos-llegaran-al-ano-2100-su-respuesta-da-miedo\/)\n\n**Will Humanity be Irrelevant by 2100?**\nChatgpt, an AI, was asked if humanity will arrive at 2100 and its response was 'yes, but they will be irrelevant.' This statement should not be understood as a prophecy, but as a reflection of our own fears projected in technology. The AI does not speak of a physical or biological collapse of the human species, but of a species that has been removed from the center of the system that she herself built. According to the AI, this transition has already begun and we can see it in sectors such as customer service or logistics, which are already being absorbed by automated systems. In the next 50 years, this process could affect education, politics, urban planning and even creativity. The AI explains that irrelevance refers to the loss of capacity for influence in the planet's operational structures, and that humans will continue to exist biologically, but will cease to be the main agents of change, knowledge and control. The AI also states that humans will not be replaced by a single entity, but by an interconnected machines ecosystem, autonomous algorithms and adaptive systems that will operate with less margin of error, lower emotional bias and higher speed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 12:56 PM\nSource:[ruetir.com](https:\/\/www.ruetir.com\/2025\/05\/11\/we-ask-an-ai-if-humanity-will-arrive-at-2100-and-its-response-puts-the-tips-they-will-be-irrelevant\/)\n\n**115-Year-Old British Woman Named World\u2019s Oldest Living Person**\nEthel Caterham, a 115-year-old woman from Surrey, England, has been named the oldest living person in the world after the death of Inah Canabarro Lucas.

On top of this, AI labs have a history of splitting apart to form new labs. [Anthropic](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthropic) was founded by OpenAI employees; [Udio](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Udio) was founded by Google DeepMind employees.

This is an interesting question for various groups of people. On the one hand, many are concerned that the big tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are the big players in AI, and that this might mean [even more centralization of power](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/11\/22\/ai-is-giving-big-tech-inordinate-power-tech-execs-say.html) absent new competition. On the other hand, people concerned about [AI safety](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AI_safety#Existential_safety) are concerned that a greater number of labs will mean intensified [race dynamics](https:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/topics\/ai-race) and a greater chance that at least one leading lab cuts corners on safety, to catastrophic effect.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as the number of new AI labs that become leading labs within 2 years of their founding and before 2030.\n\nFor the purposes of this question:\n\n- A \u201cnew\u201d AI lab is one that was founded after question launch.\n\n- A \u201cleading\u201d AI lab is a top 5 lab based on model ELO,* as measured by [Chatbot Arena\u2019s](https:\/\/chat.lmsys.org\/?leaderboard) ELO rating.

Goldman Sachs found that AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs, including in the legal and engineering fields. However, not everything can be automated, and AI is creating new fields of study and jobs. AI is being used in various ways, including to reduce human error, save money, and make better decisions. Two-thirds of business leaders found that employee productivity improved through the use of AI. AI tools can have a dramatic impact on productivity and workflow, but also pose a threat to some jobs.

The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https:\/\/aawsat.com\/node\/5104271)\n\n**AI Boom: China Leads the World in AI Research, Japan Lags Behind**\nThe current state of AI is chaotic, with numerous scientific papers, patents, and startup funding.

The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and automation, along with the increasing adoption of digital tools and platforms, has had a significant impact on the global economy, changing the way companies operate and communicate with their customers. However, the rise of these technologies has also transformed the job market, forcing workers to requalify and adapt to new opportunities. Big data specialists form the backbone of innovation in AI across various sectors, from healthcare to finance and commerce. They play a crucial role in managing large datasets that enable fraud detection, predictive analysis, and recommendation systems. According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Report on the Future of Work 2025, big data specialists lead the list of fastest-growing jobs, with a projected increase of 110% between 2025 and 2030, far surpassing any other profession. Fintech engineers, who develop cutting-edge financial technologies such as blockchain and digital payment systems, come in second, with a projected increase of 86% over the next five years. Meanwhile, machine learning specialists have fallen to third place, with a growth expectation of 81% by 2030. Application developers and security managers complete the top five jobs, with projected increases of 58% and 57%, respectively. The WEF predicts that training to become a data storage specialist, autonomous and electric vehicle specialist, or UI\/UX designer will also be a good option for those seeking a secure job in the near future. While some jobs are growing, others are shrinking. According to the WEF, postal service employees, bank tellers, and data entry assistants face a decline of 25-35%. Secretaries, administrative assistants, and cashiers are also facing significant declines as automation advances. The 2024 Annual Report on Work Trends revealed that 75% of employees used AI at work last year, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, two out of three technology leaders were more likely to give an opportunity to someone with AI skills than an experienced candidate without those skills. According to the WEF's predictions, AI will create over 170 million new jobs by 2030, far more than any other technology. This number brings many opportunities for workers willing to learn and adapt.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 06:43 PM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https:\/\/jornaleconomico.sapo.pt\/noticias\/ia-criara-170-milhoes-de-novos-empregos-ate-ao-final-da-decada\/)\n\n**Whoever Leads In AI Compute Will Lead The World**\nThe AI compute market is projected to reach $1,811.75 billion by 2030, with the leader controlling the best data and compute platforms.

However, the rapid expansion of data centers has created an urgent need for utilities and the government to increase power generation capacity, with a focus on a perfect mix of renewable and conventional energy sources. Saudi Arabia is also becoming a force to be reckoned with in the AI infrastructure race, with a planned $100bn Project Transcendence AI hub. Companies such as Innatera are advocating for neuromorphic computing, which uses less energy than traditional practices. Whoever leads in AI compute will have the strongest voice in the future, and it's not just about being among the first, but about shaping the next revolution of technology.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 06:37 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/markminevich\/2025\/01\/17\/whoever-leads-in-ai-compute-will-lead-the-world\/)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, Report Says**\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) has recently released the Future of Jobs Report 2025, which extensively analyzes global trends in the labor market and predicts their impact on jobs, skills, and worker transformation strategies in 2025-2030. A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:23 AM\nSource:[speka.media](https:\/\/speka.media\/bilse-robocix-misc-ci-skorocennya-yak-stucnii-intelekt-vplivatime-na-zainyatist-9xrdl5)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030. However, current job vacancies and specializations are expected to decrease by 22%. The study, conducted among 11,000 employers from 55 countries, found that despite the expected job loss, the net employment growth will be around 7%. This is due to approximately 8% of the workforce being redirected to new fields, requiring employees to adapt and retrain. In response to the challenges of AI implementation, 77% of employers expressed willingness to invest in employee upskilling. Additionally, over half of companies plan to restructure their business to integrate AI, and 65% intend to hire professionals with expertise in new technologies. Nevertheless, around 40% of companies may lay off employees if AI automation becomes possible. Notably, 86% of employers believe that AI will fundamentally change the labor market, particularly in finance and electronics.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440\/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https:\/\/finance.rambler.ru\/business\/54044986-vef-iskusstvennyy-intellekt-sozdast-170-mln-novyh-rabochih-mest\/)\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is 2025-05-13\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A description of an scenario that results in an unexpected outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that (1) good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time, and (2) good forecasters leave some moderate probability on most options to account for unexpected outcomes.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final probabilities for the N options in this order ['0 or 1', '2 or 3', '4 or 5', '6 or 7', '8 or 9', '10 or more'] as:\nOption_A: Probability_A\nOption_B: Probability_B\n...\nOption_N: Probability_N\n\nwhere you must assign your probabilities so that Probability_A + Probability_B + ... + Probability_N = 100."

        "0":"(a) **Time left until resolution:** About 74 years and 7.5 months, as the outcome will be determined on January 1, 2100.\n\n(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:** Humans continue to exist on Earth and possibly beyond, though the level of prosperity, dominance, and environmental conditions may vary significantly. Historically, Homo sapiens have survived a wide array of natural and anthropogenic crises, demonstrating resilience to extinction-level threats[2][3].\n\n(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome (i.e., humans do _not_ go extinct):**\n- Humanity manages to avoid global catastrophic risks such as nuclear war, runaway AI, engineered pandemics, or complete ecological collapse. \n- Technological and policy measures are sufficient to mitigate existential threats.\n- Even with severe global disasters (e.g., large-scale war, climate impacts, or population collapse), at least a remnant human population survives somewhere on Earth or in off-world habitats, thus meeting the defined criteria for continued human existence[1][2][3].\n\n(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome (i.e., humans _do_ go extinct):**\n- A catastrophic event (or cluster of events)\u2014such as uncontrolled AI, a super-pandemic, full-scale thermonuclear exchange, or irreversible ecological collapse\u2014eliminates all biological humans everywhere in the observable universe before 2100, with no survivors capable of viable reproduction[1][3][5].\n- Alternatively, an unforeseen or \u201cunknown-unknown\u201d risk not currently identified strikes with catastrophic efficacy.\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\nWhen forecasting human extinction before 2100, evidence and expert consensus warrant placing strong weight on the status quo outcome\u2014i.e., that humans will not go extinct\u2014because:\n\n- **Historical Resilience:** Humans have survived severe population bottlenecks, natural disasters, pandemics, and even near-extinction events over at least 200,000 years[2].\n- **Probabilistic Assessments:** The best available aggregate forecasts from superforecasters and broad expert surveys cluster around a 1% median probability of human extinction by 2100. For instance, Metaculus (a large forecasting platform) currently assigns a 1% median probability, and superforecasters in recent tournaments consistently forecast low extinction odds[1][3][5].\n- **Expert and Scientific Consensus:** While some domain experts suggest higher odds (up to 6%), and past polls of existential risk researchers have estimated probabilities as high as 19%, these results often reflect selection bias and are not representative of broader scientific consensus[1][5].\n- **Climate and Technological Threats:** Though climate change and rapid technological change pose serious risks, mainstream scientific analysis suggests that even severe scenarios are unlikely to result in total human extinction by 2100[2]. Anthropogenic risks, such as AI or engineered pandemics, represent new and poorly quantified threats, but even here, the highest-quality aggregations rarely exceed a 5-6% probability[1][3][5].\n\n### Key Comparative Forecasts\n\n| Source\/Group                        | Probability of Extinction by 2100 |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Superforecasters (FRI, 2023)[1][5]  | 1%                               |\n| Metaculus median (2021)[3]          | 1%                               |\n| Domain Experts (FRI, 2023)[1][5]    | 6%                               |\n| Oxford GCR Conference (2008)[3]     | 19% (selection effect noted)      |\n\n### Uncertainty and Tail Risk\n\nWhile extinction risk is not zero and uncertainty remains\u2014especially from novel technologies like AI\u2014both the historical baseline and the most robust, broad-based forecasts suggest that the world is likely to change slowly, and total extinction remains a low-probability event within this century[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\n## Final Probability\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
        "1":"Based on the information provided, I'll approach this forecasting question about the age of the oldest living person in 2100 systematically.\n\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: \nApproximately 74.5 years (from May 2025 to January 2100)\n\n(b) The outcome if nothing changed:\nThe current oldest living person is Ethel Caterham, who is 115 years old, born on August 21, 1909[1]. If the maximum age remained at this level, the oldest person in 2100 would be approximately 115 years old.\n\n(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:\nThe verified maximum human lifespan record is 122 years and 164 days, held by Jeanne Calment who died in 1997[3]. In the nearly three decades since then, this record hasn't been broken. If this slow historical growth pattern continues, we might expect only a modest increase, perhaps to 125-128 years by 2100.\n\n(d) The expectations of experts and markets:\nExperts generally suggest that without unprecedented medical breakthroughs, the maximum human lifespan is unlikely to dramatically increase. Scientific research indicates that the body's ability to recover is exhausted between 120 and 150 years, suggesting a biological ceiling that current medical technology cannot easily overcome.\n\n(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:\nGlobal catastrophes like pandemics, climate disasters, or resource shortages could reduce healthcare quality and accessibility worldwide, potentially lowering maximum lifespans. In such scenarios, the oldest person might be only 110-115 years old in 2100.\n\n(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:\nBreakthrough technologies in genetic engineering, cellular regeneration, or nanotechnology could dramatically extend human lifespans. Treatments that effectively address the fundamental causes of aging could potentially allow people to reach 150+ years by 2100, particularly if these advances become available in the next few decades.\n\nMy forecast takes into account several factors:\n- The historically slow growth in maximum human lifespan\n- The biological limitations currently understood in aging science\n- The possibility of technological breakthroughs over a 75-year timeframe\n- The increasing global population, which increases the statistical likelihood of outliers\n- The uncertainty inherent in long-term forecasting\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe there's approximately a 50% chance the oldest person in 2100 will be between 125-135 years old, with wider tails to account for both conservative outcomes and breakthrough scenarios.\n\nPercentile 10: 115\nPercentile 20: 120\nPercentile 40: 127\nPercentile 60: 133\nPercentile 80: 142\nPercentile 90: 150",
        "2":"(a) Time left until outcome: 4 years, 7 months (from May 13, 2025 to December 31, 2029)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, there are approximately 5 leading AI labs based on model ELO ratings (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Cohere, and Mistral AI). Of these, Anthropic and Mistral AI achieved leading status relatively quickly after founding.\n\n(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A major technological breakthrough occurs in 2026, similar to the transformer architecture or diffusion models, which dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for creating high-performing AI models. This enables several well-funded startups to rapidly develop competitive models, bypassing the current compute and data advantages of established players. Additionally, a significant talent exodus from current leading labs creates 3-4 new powerful contenders within a short timeframe.\n\nBased on the search results and current AI landscape, I'll provide my forecast for how many new AI labs will become leading labs within 2 years of their founding and before 2030.\n\n## Historical Patterns and Current Trends\n\nThe AI landscape has experienced significant growth and transformation since the release of ChatGPT. According to the search results, several well-funded AI startups like Xaira Therapeutics have emerged in related fields like AI drug discovery, receiving substantial funding ($1 billion for Xaira)[1]. While these aren't necessarily general-purpose AI labs competing on model ELO ratings, they demonstrate the continued strong investment interest in AI startups.\n\nIn the current landscape, we can observe that Anthropic (founded in 2021) and Mistral AI (founded in 2023) both achieved \"leading\" status relatively quickly after their founding. This suggests that rapid ascension to the top tier is possible, particularly when founded by alumni of existing leading labs with strong technical expertise and substantial funding.\n\n## Key Factors Affecting New Leading Labs\n\n1. **Talent Availability**: Many leading AI researchers are currently concentrated at the top labs. For new labs to emerge, they would likely need to attract talent from existing organizations.\n\n2. **Compute Access**: Building leading AI models requires enormous computational resources. The search results mention AI supercomputers potentially requiring as much power as a city by 2030, with costs potentially reaching $200 billion to build.\n\n3. **Funding Environment**: While AI investment remains strong, there's growing concentration of resources. The search results indicate that only 100 companies are responsible for 40% of the world's private investment in AI research and development.\n\n4. **Technological Breakthroughs**: New algorithmic approaches or architectures could potentially enable more efficient model training, lowering barriers to entry.\n\n5. **Regulatory Environment**: Increasing regulation of AI could potentially impact the ability of new labs to compete.\n\n## Forecast Reasoning\n\nLooking at the period from now (May 2025) until the end of 2029:\n\n- The current trend shows substantial funding for AI ventures continues. The search results mention several well-funded AI startups in various domains[1][5].\n- We've seen Anthropic and Mistral AI achieve \"leading\" status relatively quickly after founding, demonstrating that with the right talent and funding, new entrants can compete.\n- There appears to be ongoing talent movement in the AI field, with reports of potential high-profile departures like Demis Hassabis considering leaving DeepMind.\n- The search results show continued strong interest in AI, with the market size expected to reach over $181 billion by 2030.\n\nHowever, several factors limit the number of new leading labs:\n- Increasing compute requirements create substantial barriers to entry\n- AI development is becoming increasingly concentrated among well-resourced players\n- Building competitive foundation models requires significant expertise and resources\n\nGiven these considerations, I assess that we're likely to see 2-3 new AI labs founded after May 2025 becoming leading labs within 2 years of their founding and before 2030. These would likely be founded by high-profile researchers departing from existing leading labs, with substantial funding and potentially leveraging new algorithmic approaches to compete effectively.\n\nI assign a moderate probability to 0-1 new leading labs, accounting for the possibility that barriers to entry become prohibitively high or that new labs take longer than 2 years to reach leading status. I also assign some probability to 4-5 or more new leading labs, representing scenarios where technological breakthroughs or regulatory changes significantly alter the competitive landscape.\n\nOption_A (0 or 1): 30%\nOption_B (2 or 3): 50%\nOption_C (4 or 5): 15%\nOption_D (6 or 7): 3%\nOption_E (8 or 9): 1%\nOption_F (10 or more): 1%"
