        "0":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- In August 2024, Sri Lanka\u2019s Telecommunications Regulatory Commission granted Starlink a license to operate, signaling an initial regulatory green light for satellite broadband services in the country[4].\n- Starlink service was officially announced to launch in Sri Lanka in April 2025, with government officials and the Director General of the regulator confirming these plans[5].\n- Starlink\u2019s Sri Lanka residential service page is live, listing service and hardware pricing in Sri Lankan rupees, indicating technical and commercial readiness[3].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policy Changes\n\n- As of May 2025, reports indicate the Sri Lankan government is stalling Starlink\u2019s rollout due to unresolved security and sovereignty concerns, despite earlier regulatory approval and public launch plans[2].\n- There is no public indication that these concerns have been resolved as of May 16, 2025.\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The [Starlink Availability Map][1] is the definitive source for determining if Sri Lanka is listed as \"Available\" before July 1, 2025.\n- Local and international news sources tracking regulatory decisions and Starlink\u2019s rollout provide context on political developments[2][4][5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The regulatory stall introduces significant uncertainty. While technical and initial regulatory milestones have been met, political factors could prevent Starlink\u2019s map from showing Sri Lanka as \"Available\" in time.\n- In other countries, similar stalls have been resolved within weeks or months, but some remain unresolved for longer periods.\n- The Starlink map\u2019s update timing may lag behind actual service commencement or regulatory resolution.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- Given the initial regulatory approval, technical readiness, and planned April 2025 launch, the probability of Starlink listing Sri Lanka as \"Available\" before July 1, 2025, would have been high.\n- The recent regulatory stall as of mid-May 2025, with no sign of imminent resolution, significantly reduces the probability.\n- Barring rapid negotiations, the probability is now best assessed as **moderate but uncertain**\u2014roughly a 40\u201355% chance that Sri Lanka will appear as \"Available\" on the Starlink map before July 1, 2025, depending on how quickly the government\u2019s concerns are addressed.\n\n## References\n\n[1].

This initiative aims to eliminate barriers to internet access in rural, remote, or areas with poor infrastructure, allowing more people to connect without relying on traditional mobile phone networks. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, has been recognized for its ability to provide connectivity in areas where terrestrial networks do not reach. The new feature will allow users in remote areas without access to traditional mobile networks to send text messages, share their location, and even contact emergency services without the need for a nearby mobile phone tower. This improvement will make a significant difference in rural areas and other remote regions where internet connections are limited or non-existent. However, not all devices will have access to this free service, and it will depend on the device model and software update installed. 'T-Mobile SpaceX' will appear on the screen when the phone connects to the Starlink satellite network. It is essential to note that devices must have the latest software version installed to access this network. Initially, this connectivity will only allow text messaging, location sharing, and emergency service contact. In a second phase, the functionality is expected to expand to include voice calls and internet navigation, increasing the utility of the Starlink network.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 14, 2025 10:42 AM\nSource:[El Cronista](https:\/\/www.cronista.com\/espana\/actualidad-es\/elon-musk-ofrece-internet-gratis-todos-estos-celulares-se-pueden-conectar-sin-costo-a-starlink\/)\n\n**Apple's iOS 18.5 Launches with Starlink-Powered Satellite Messaging**\nApple has released iOS 18.5, which includes a free trial of Starlink-powered satellite messaging for T-Mobile users with iPhone 13 models.

This move is expected to bring significant changes to sectors such as education, healthcare, and disaster management. According to a statement from the office of Muhammad Yunus, who serves as the 'chief advisor' to the interim government, the license was granted to allow Starlink to operate nationwide for 10 years. The statement read, 'A decision was made to issue the license in favor of the company (Starlink).' It is reported that the introduction of Starlink may take place as early as May. The system is expected to bring 'revolutionary changes' to the country's education, healthcare, business, and disaster management sectors. Bangladesh has become the second country in South Asia to grant approval for Starlink operations, following Sri Lanka. The system aims to provide uninterrupted, high-quality internet services to hard-to-reach areas, including islands, remote hills, and coastal areas prone to disasters.

According to the Omani Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, it has granted a license to Starlink Muscat to provide broadband internet services in Oman using satellite communications systems. The service will cover all geographic areas of Oman, including areas with full service speeds of up to 100 Mbps, as well as innovative solutions for connecting communication towers in difficult terrain, which will contribute to the digital transformation, in addition to serving various economic sectors such as oil and gas, mining, tourism, and agriculture. The launch of the service will have several benefits, including: promoting competition among licensed telecommunications companies, providing multiple options for beneficiaries, improving quality and speed, and providing an enhanced environment for a digital community, as well as serving various business sectors. Anyone, natural or legal, who wants to obtain these services will benefit from Starlink services. The Sultanate of Oman issued a royal decree on June 20, 2023, granting a first-class license to Starlink Muscat and establishing and operating a satellite communications system to provide public fixed telecommunications services. Oman was the first country in the Middle East to announce the launch of satellite internet in 2024. Starlink is the world's first and largest satellite constellation using a low Earth orbit to provide broadband internet capable of supporting streaming, online gaming, video calls, and more, according to its official website. The network provides high-speed internet and shorter data transfer times between the user and the satellite for users around the world. According to the website, most internet services come from a single satellite that orbits the Earth at a distance of 35,786 kilometers. As a result, the time it takes to transfer data between the user and the satellite takes a long time, making it almost impossible to support streaming, online gaming, video calls, or other high-data-rate activities.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 27, 2025 08:44 PM\nSource:[CNN Arabic](https:\/\/arabic.cnn.com\/middle-east\/article\/2025\/03\/28\/starlinks-high-speed-low-latency-internet-is-now-available-in-oman)\n\n**TRCSL denies suspension of 'Starlink' satellite broadband service**\nThe Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) has denied reports that it plans to suspend the 'Starlink' satellite broadband service.

The company has been in talks with the regulatory body, Nepal Telecommunications Authority, and has presented a demo of its service. However, the main issue is that the existing law requires a minimum of 20% local participation, which Starlink is not willing to comply with. The company has already been granted a license to operate in India, where there is no such requirement. In Bhutan, Starlink has been operating since 2014, but the service is only available to a limited number of users due to its high cost. In other South Asian countries, such as Maldives, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, Starlink has been granted licenses to operate, but the service is not yet available. The Nepali government is studying the possibility of amending the existing law to allow foreign companies like Starlink to operate in the country. Meanwhile, Chinese companies are also interested in providing satellite-based internet services in Nepal.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 06:09 AM\nSource:[eKantipur](https:\/\/ekantipur.com\/technology\/2025\/02\/27\/neighboring-countries-towards-satellite-internet-when-in-nepal-44-45.html)\n\n**Bharti Mittal beats Mukesh Ambani and..., Airtel to launch satellite broadband service before Starlink, preparation is done by...**\nAirtel-backed OneWeb has applied for fast-track approval from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to launch its satellite broadband service in India.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https:\/\/www.starlink.com\/us\/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- In August 2024, Sri Lanka\u2019s Telecommunications Regulatory Commission granted Starlink a license to operate, signaling an initial regulatory green light for satellite broadband services in the country[4].\n- Starlink service was officially announced to launch in Sri Lanka in April 2025, with government officials and the Director General of the regulator confirming these plans[5].\n- Starlink\u2019s Sri Lanka residential service page is live, listing service and hardware pricing in Sri Lankan rupees, indicating technical and commercial readiness[3].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policy Changes\n\n- As of May 2025, reports indicate the Sri Lankan government is stalling Starlink\u2019s rollout due to unresolved security and sovereignty concerns, despite earlier regulatory approval and public launch plans[2].\n- There is no public indication that these concerns have been resolved as of May 16, 2025.\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- The [Starlink Availability Map][1] is the definitive source for determining if Sri Lanka is listed as \"Available\" before July 1, 2025.\n- Local and international news sources tracking regulatory decisions and Starlink\u2019s rollout provide context on political developments[2][4][5].\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The regulatory stall introduces significant uncertainty. While technical and initial regulatory milestones have been met, political factors could prevent Starlink\u2019s map from showing Sri Lanka as \"Available\" in time.\n- In other countries, similar stalls have been resolved within weeks or months, but some remain unresolved for longer periods.\n- The Starlink map\u2019s update timing may lag behind actual service commencement or regulatory resolution.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- Given the initial regulatory approval, technical readiness, and planned April 2025 launch, the probability of Starlink listing Sri Lanka as \"Available\" before July 1, 2025, would have been high.\n- The recent regulatory stall as of mid-May 2025, with no sign of imminent resolution, significantly reduces the probability.\n- Barring rapid negotiations, the probability is now best assessed as **moderate but uncertain**\u2014roughly a 40\u201355% chance that Sri Lanka will appear as \"Available\" on the Starlink map before July 1, 2025, depending on how quickly the government\u2019s concerns are addressed.\n\n## References\n\n[1].

This initiative aims to eliminate barriers to internet access in rural, remote, or areas with poor infrastructure, allowing more people to connect without relying on traditional mobile phone networks. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, has been recognized for its ability to provide connectivity in areas where terrestrial networks do not reach. The new feature will allow users in remote areas without access to traditional mobile networks to send text messages, share their location, and even contact emergency services without the need for a nearby mobile phone tower. This improvement will make a significant difference in rural areas and other remote regions where internet connections are limited or non-existent. However, not all devices will have access to this free service, and it will depend on the device model and software update installed.

This initiative aims to eliminate barriers to internet access in rural, remote, or areas with poor infrastructure, allowing more people to connect without relying on traditional mobile phone networks. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, has been recognized for its ability to provide connectivity in areas where terrestrial networks do not reach. The new feature will allow users in remote areas without access to traditional mobile networks to send text messages, share their location, and even contact emergency services without the need for a nearby mobile phone tower. This improvement will make a significant difference in rural areas and other remote regions where internet connections are limited or non-existent. However, not all devices will have access to this free service, and it will depend on the device model and software update installed. 'T-Mobile SpaceX' will appear on the screen when the phone connects to the Starlink satellite network. It is essential to note that devices must have the latest software version installed to access this network. Initially, this connectivity will only allow text messaging, location sharing, and emergency service contact. In a second phase, the functionality is expected to expand to include voice calls and internet navigation, increasing the utility of the Starlink network.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 14, 2025 10:42 AM\nSource:[El Cronista](https:\/\/www.cronista.com\/espana\/actualidad-es\/elon-musk-ofrece-internet-gratis-todos-estos-celulares-se-pueden-conectar-sin-costo-a-starlink\/)\n\n**Apple's iOS 18.5 Launches with Starlink-Powered Satellite Messaging**\nApple has released iOS 18.5, which includes a free trial of Starlink-powered satellite messaging for T-Mobile users with iPhone 13 models.

Starlink Awaits a Will While the Region Finds a Way**\nPakistan has been stuck in regulatory limbo with SpaceX's Starlink, despite announcing and retracting timelines for the service. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has given Starlink a temporary registration, but a full license will not be issued until the company secures permanent registration and clears technical and security checks. In contrast, neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India have approved Starlink, with Bangladesh granting a pair of ten-year operating licenses and Sri Lanka issuing a national service-provider license. India has taken a pragmatic approach, partnering with local giants while capping license tenure. Pakistan's regulators say they are being thorough, but the delay has real-world costs, with over half of the country's citizens still having no fixed broadband. The regional scorecard is stark, with Pakistan being the outlier.

According to the Omani Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, it has granted a license to Starlink Muscat to provide broadband internet services in Oman using satellite communications systems. The service will cover all geographic areas of Oman, including areas with full service speeds of up to 100 Mbps, as well as innovative solutions for connecting communication towers in difficult terrain, which will contribute to the digital transformation, in addition to serving various economic sectors such as oil and gas, mining, tourism, and agriculture. The launch of the service will have several benefits, including: promoting competition among licensed telecommunications companies, providing multiple options for beneficiaries, improving quality and speed, and providing an enhanced environment for a digital community, as well as serving various business sectors. Anyone, natural or legal, who wants to obtain these services will benefit from Starlink services. The Sultanate of Oman issued a royal decree on June 20, 2023, granting a first-class license to Starlink Muscat and establishing and operating a satellite communications system to provide public fixed telecommunications services. Oman was the first country in the Middle East to announce the launch of satellite internet in 2024. Starlink is the world's first and largest satellite constellation using a low Earth orbit to provide broadband internet capable of supporting streaming, online gaming, video calls, and more, according to its official website. The network provides high-speed internet and shorter data transfer times between the user and the satellite for users around the world. According to the website, most internet services come from a single satellite that orbits the Earth at a distance of 35,786 kilometers. As a result, the time it takes to transfer data between the user and the satellite takes a long time, making it almost impossible to support streaming, online gaming, video calls, or other high-data-rate activities.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 27, 2025 08:44 PM\nSource:[CNN Arabic](https:\/\/arabic.cnn.com\/middle-east\/article\/2025\/03\/28\/starlinks-high-speed-low-latency-internet-is-now-available-in-oman)\n\n**TRCSL denies suspension of 'Starlink' satellite broadband service**\nThe Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) has denied reports that it plans to suspend the 'Starlink' satellite broadband service.

The company has been in talks with the regulatory body, Nepal Telecommunications Authority, and has presented a demo of its service. However, the main issue is that the existing law requires a minimum of 20% local participation, which Starlink is not willing to comply with. The company has already been granted a license to operate in India, where there is no such requirement. In Bhutan, Starlink has been operating since 2014, but the service is only available to a limited number of users due to its high cost. In other South Asian countries, such as Maldives, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, Starlink has been granted licenses to operate, but the service is not yet available.

        "0":"# Assessing Starlink's Availability in Sri Lanka by July 2025\n\nAs of May 16, 2025, we have approximately 45 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline to determine whether Starlink's website will show Sri Lanka as available. The current situation presents a complex regulatory landscape with significant hurdles that need to be overcome.\n\n## Current Regulatory Status\n\nStarlink received initial regulatory approval in Sri Lanka back in 2024, with the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) granting them an operating license in August of that year. This suggested strong initial progress and commitment to entering the Sri Lankan market. Following this approval, Starlink has shown clear signs of technical and commercial readiness by updating its pricing structure for Sri Lanka, with residential connections priced at LKR 15,000 monthly and hardware costs of LKR 105,000.\n\nHowever, this progress has been significantly stalled. In March 2025, the Sri Lankan government suspended the Starlink rollout due to unresolved national security concerns. Deputy Minister of Information Technology Eranga Weeraratne explained that the suspension was due to the lack of a guaranteed mechanism for Sri Lankan authorities to access data in cases of unlawful activity. The original TRCSL license did not include such access provisions for legal data interception, which the government now considers essential.\n\n## The Core Dispute\n\nThe central issue blocking Starlink's launch is the government's insistence on having data interception rights for security purposes. As stated by government officials, \"There may be instances in which Starlink satellite communication services being used for any unlawful act by some individuals. Then, the Sri Lankan security apparatus should have the right to obtain data related to such communication for legal action.\"\n\nThis impasse is not merely a minor regulatory hurdle but a fundamental clash between:\n- The Sri Lankan government's security and sovereignty concerns\n- Starlink's global operational model and potential data privacy commitments\n\nThe most recent update from May 15, 2025, confirms that Sri Lanka continues to stall Starlink over these security and sovereignty concerns. This indicates the dispute remains active and unresolved just 45 days before our deadline.\n\n## Regional and Historical Context\n\nStarlink has made varying degrees of progress in other South Asian countries, with Bangladesh recently granting Starlink operating licenses and India approving Starlink entry with certain regulatory requirements. This regional momentum could potentially create pressure on Sri Lanka to resolve issues more quickly.\n\nIt's worth noting that Starlink originally targeted a 2023 launch in Sri Lanka according to its availability map updates from 2024, indicating that delays in regulatory approval have already pushed back the timeline significantly. Despite the current suspension, Starlink's availability map suggests the company still aims to launch its service in Sri Lanka in 2025.\n\n## Potential Scenarios\n\n**Path to Resolution:** For Starlink to show Sri Lanka as available before July 1, negotiations between Starlink\/SpaceX, the TRCSL, and government security agencies would need to rapidly conclude with an agreement that satisfies the government's data interception requirements. This would enable Starlink to officially launch service and update its availability map accordingly.\n\n**Continued Stalemate:** If the Sri Lankan government maintains its current stance and Starlink is unwilling or unable to meet the demands for data interception rights, this regulatory impasse could persist or lengthen, preventing Starlink from activating or publicly listing availability in Sri Lanka by July 1.\n\n## Timing Considerations\n\nWith only 45 days remaining until the deadline, the timeline for resolution is extremely tight:\n- Discussions are reportedly still at a preliminary stage between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink\n- Implementing technical solutions for data interception after an agreement would require additional time\n- Bureaucratic processes for final approval could further extend the timeline\n- Political negotiations involving national security considerations typically move slower than commercial agreements\n\nThe hardline stance taken as recently as May 15 suggests that negotiations have not made substantial progress in resolving the core issues.\n\n## Likelihood Assessment\n\nSeveral factors reduce the probability of Starlink showing Sri Lanka as available by July 1:\n- The regulatory hurdles involving national security are substantial and discussions remain preliminary\n- The government has publicly hardened its position very recently (May 15)\n- The 45-day window is extremely limited for resolving complex security concerns\n- Regulatory processes involving national security typically favor the status quo and move slowly\n\nSupporting factors for a resolution include:\n- Economic incentives for Sri Lanka to introduce competition in telecommunications\n- Starlink's technical readiness and completed pricing structure\n- Regional momentum with successful launches in neighboring countries\n- Potential political pressure to deliver on the previously announced 2025 launch target\n\nThe outcome remains uncertain, but the substantial nature of the security concerns, recent government statements, and the typically slow pace of regulatory negotiations involving national security issues suggest that resolution within 45 days faces significant challenges.\n\n### Probability: 35%"
