For most of the preceedin years this matched the top players in the American Football Conference (AFC) against those in the National Football Conference (NFC). However, as of December 2024 it features a series of skill competitions, such as passing challenges and precision drills, as well as a flag football game between the NFC and AFC rosters instead of a traditional full-contact game.\n* In the NBA, [it used to feature](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NBA_All-Star_Game#Rosters_selection) a game between two 12-player squads picked from each of the two conferences. This was also changed in December 2024, with the [new format](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_NBA_All-Star_Game) splitting the 24 players into three teams of 8 that will compete in a tournament with the winners of the Rising Stars challenge.\n* In MLB, [this is](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game) a a traditional matchup between the American League and National League. Starters are chosen through fan voting, while pitchers and reserves are selected by a combination of player votes and selections by the Commissioner's Office. Each MLB team is guaranteed at least one representative.\n* In NHL, [the format](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NHL_All-Star_Game#Formats) has changed multiple times, going from a game between two teams each selected from one of the conferences, to a single elimination tournament between four teams, representing the league's four divisions. The NHL decided to not run an All-Star game in 2025 and instead hold a new Four Nations Face-Off tournament as a preview for the league's return to Olympic participation in 2026.\n\nIn 2018, sports betting was broadly legalized in the US with the overturning of the [Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Professional_and_Amateur_Sports_Protection_Act_of_1992) by the Supreme Court.

If this were enacted this would count for purposes of this question, since it nullifies California's ability to enforce Proposition 12's space requirements for pigs and veal calves, even though it still allows California to enforce Prop 12's space requirements for egg-laying hens."

        "0":"## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Since the 2018 legalization of sports betting, gambling-related suspensions in the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL have increased significantly. For example, eleven NFL players have been suspended for gambling violations since 2022, and similar patterns are seen in other leagues[1][3][5].\n- All leagues enforce strict anti-gambling rules, with penalties ranging from fines to lifetime bans[5].\n- As of December 2024, no All-Star (past or present) from any of these leagues has been banned or suspended due to sports betting[1][3][5].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The NFL's gambling policy prohibits any form of gambling on league property, with recent suspensions highlighting enforcement[4].\n- NBA, MLB, and NHL maintain similarly strict policies, with publicized consequences for violations[5].\n- The expansion of legal sports betting, especially via mobile apps, has made infractions both easier to commit and to detect, prompting calls for even stricter enforcement[3][5].\n\n## Key Differences and their Impact\n\n- All-Star players are typically more aware of risks, face more scrutiny, and have more to lose, which may deter rule-breaking.\n- However, the growing normalization and access to betting platforms increases the chance of accidental or deliberate violations\u2014even among high-profile athletes[3][5].\n- The increased focus on enforcement and use of technology by leagues may heighten the probability that any infractions are detected.\n- The absence of any known All-Star suspensions to date suggests either greater caution or luck; this is a key difference from the overall rise in betting-related suspensions among non-All-Star players[1][3].\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- The probability of at least one All-Star from the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL being suspended or banned for sports betting before 2026 is **not negligible**, given recent trends.\n- However, the fact that no All-Star has been caught to date, despite rising enforcement and incidents among other players, suggests the risk is **less than 50% but not extremely low** for the next year.\n- A reasonable forecast might place this probability in the **20\u201335% range**, reflecting the increased prevalence of betting-related suspensions, the size of the All-Star pool, the heightened enforcement, but also the unique incentives and scrutiny around All-Star-caliber athletes.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The main limitation is that only suspensions that are detected and officially announced will count.\n- The All-Star pool is relatively large, but each player is under intense public and league scrutiny.\n- The situation could change suddenly if a single high-profile incident occurs.\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Official league announcements and press releases (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL)\n- Major sports news outlets and real-time tracking sites for suspensions[2]\n- Policy summaries and legal analyses of league gambling regulations[5]\n\n## References\n\n1.

        "1":"### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The United States has had a long-standing interest in Greenland, dating back to at least the mid-20th century, motivated by its strategic Arctic location and natural resources[3][5].\n- The most prominent recent episode occurred in 2019, when then-President Trump publicly expressed a desire to purchase Greenland, but Denmark and Greenland promptly and firmly rejected the idea[3][5].\n- As of early 2025, US interest has intensified: President Trump has not ruled out acquiring Greenland and has made statements about using tariffs or even military force, citing national security concerns[1][2][4].\n- Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark; its government controls domestic affairs, but Denmark retains authority over foreign and defense policy[5].\n\n### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- In January 2025, President Trump threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it blocked US efforts to acquire Greenland[2].\n- Greenland\u2019s leaders, representing all major parties, issued a joint statement after the March 2025 election, declaring US attempts at annexation \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and reaffirming that Greenland is \u201cnot for sale\u201d[2].\n- Denmark\u2019s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has reiterated that Greenland is not for sale, emphasizing cooperation with the US on Arctic security but rejecting any negotiations about sovereignty[1][2].\n- The European Union has publicly supported Denmark\u2019s territorial integrity, with the European Council President in February 2025 underscoring the importance of Danish sovereignty[2].\n- An opinion poll in January 2025 found that 85% of Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the United States[2].\n- Greenland\u2019s outgoing Prime Minister and Denmark\u2019s PM have both characterized recent US actions (including planned visits) as \u201chighly aggressive\u201d and \u201cnot respectful\u201d[2].\n- The US administration is reportedly calculating the cost of taking over Greenland, but expert analysis suggests actions are more likely to involve economic offers than any formal negotiation on sovereignty[4].\n\n### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Official government statements from Denmark, Greenland, and the United States.\n- Reports and polling data from January\u2013April 2025, as cited above.\n- Parliamentary briefings and analysis from think tanks specializing in Arctic security[2][4].\n\n### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- All available evidence as of January 31, 2025, indicates no movement toward formal negotiations. The positions of Denmark, Greenland, and the EU are unified against any sovereignty transfer[1][2][4].\n- There is no precedent for such a transfer between Western democracies in recent history, and public opposition in Greenland is overwhelming[2].\n- While the US is applying pressure and exploring options, back channel discussions or economic engagement are not sufficient to meet the resolution criteria, which require a formal, public announcement by both governments.\n\n### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the above, the probability that the United States and Denmark will publicly announce formal negotiations over the transfer of Greenland\u2019s sovereignty before 2026 is extremely low (well below 5%). The unified opposition of both Denmark and Greenland, bolstered by EU support and public sentiment in Greenland, are decisive obstacles. No evidence as of January 31, 2025, suggests a reversal or softening of these positions.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n1.

        "2":"# Forecasting the Legality of Polymarket or Manifold for Real-Money Betting in the US in 2025\n\nAs of January 10, 2025, the regulatory landscape for prediction markets in the United States remains in flux, with important developments that could influence the legality of platforms like Polymarket and Manifold for real-money betting in the coming year.\n\n## Current Status and Historical Context\n\nThe legal status of prediction markets in the US has been characterized by significant regulatory challenges and evolving jurisprudence. Currently, prediction market winnings are taxable and treated as ordinary income for tax purposes, similar to traditional gambling winnings[1]. However, the operational legality of these platforms remains contested.\n\nA pivotal development occurred in September 2024 when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, allowing it to offer Congressional Control Contracts[1]. While the CFTC initially secured an emergency stay, the D.C. Circuit subsequently denied this motion in October 2024, enabling Kalshi to offer contracts before the 2024 US elections[1]. This judicial precedent represents a potential pathway for other prediction markets seeking legal operation.\n\nNotably, Kalshi expanded its offerings to include sports contracts in January 2025, indicating some regulatory flexibility at the federal level[1]. However, this expansion has not eliminated state-level resistance.\n\n## Regulatory Challenges and State Opposition\n\nDespite federal-level developments, significant opposition persists at the state level:\n\n- At least six states\u2014Illinois, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Ohio\u2014have issued cease and desist letters directing prediction markets to stop offering their services[2]\n- State regulators argue that prediction market activities resemble unauthorized sports wagering[5]\n- Operators like Kalshi maintain that their operations are legally sound under federal oversight by the CFTC, asserting their business model is founded on peer-to-peer swaps rather than traditional sports betting[5]\n\n## Factors Supporting Potential Legalization in 2025\n\nSeveral factors suggest increased possibility for legalization of real-money prediction markets in 2025:\n\n1. **Precedent-Setting Legal Victories**: Kalshi's court victory against the CFTC established a significant legal precedent that could benefit other prediction market platforms[1]\n\n2. **Regulatory Dialogue**: CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham has expressed interest in moving toward resolution, stating: \"The CFTC must take a forward-looking approach to shifts in market structure to ensure our markets remain vibrant and resilient while protecting all participants\"[1]\n\n3. **Planned Roundtable Discussions**: The CFTC is planning prediction markets roundtable discussions that could establish \"clear rules of the road and safeguards\"[1]\n\n## Factors Against Legalization in 2025\n\nCounterbalancing factors suggest continued challenges:\n\n1. **State-Level Resistance**: The aggressive cease-and-desist actions by multiple states indicate strong resistance that could delay or prevent legalization[2]\n\n2. **Unresolved Federal Litigation**: The case between KalshEx and CFTC remains unresolved as of early 2025, with the court expressing concerns about both arguments while appearing skeptical of the CFTC's broad interpretation of its regulatory authority[1]\n\n3. **Regulatory Classification Dispute**: Fundamental disagreement persists about whether prediction markets constitute gambling (state purview) or regulated commodity trading (federal purview)[5]\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available information as of January 10, 2025, I estimate the following probabilities:\n\n- **35-45% probability** that real-money betting on either Polymarket or Manifold will become legal in at least one US state in 2025\n\nThis assessment reflects:\n- The positive precedent set by Kalshi's legal victories\n- The CFTC's apparent openness to dialogue and potential regulatory accommodation\n- The significant counterbalance of state-level opposition\n- The requirement for a specific change in law or policy (not just risk acceptance by the platforms)\n\nThe most likely pathway would be through:\n1. A favorable court ruling extending Kalshi's precedent to other platforms\n2. A CFTC no-action letter specifically addressing Polymarket or Manifold\n3. Individual state legislation carving out exceptions for prediction markets\n\nThe probability remains moderate rather than high due to the continued state-level resistance and the need for specific policy changes rather than just regulatory tolerance.",
        "3":"To forecast whether California's Proposition 12 will remain in effect on January 1, 2026, I'll analyze its current status, implementation effects, and ongoing challenges.\n\n## Current Status of Proposition 12\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 12, which establishes minimum space requirements for confining veal calves, breeding pigs, and egg-laying hens, officially took effect on January 1, 2024[4]. This followed a series of legal challenges that culminated in a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the law[4]. The proposition prohibits the sale in California of certain cuts of pork and veal, as well as eggs, from livestock whose confinement does not meet specific minimum space requirements, even if those animals were raised outside of California[4].\n\nKey requirements include:\n- 24 square feet of space for breeding pigs (sows)[4]\n- 43 square feet of floor space for veal calves[2]\n- 1 to 1.5 square feet of cage-free space for laying hens[2]\n\n## Market and Economic Impacts\n\nSince implementation, significant economic impacts have been observed:\n\n- According to USDA data, pork prices in California have increased dramatically: bacon by 16%, pork ribs by 17%, pork loin by 41%, and pork shoulder by 17%[2][5].\n- California's consumption of fresh pork has decreased from 13% to approximately 10% of U.S. production in just one year[2].\n- California produces only 0.06% of the nation's hogs (82,000 out of 133 million annually) while consuming about 10% of U.S. pork production[2].\n\nThese economic effects are creating pressure from multiple stakeholders to reconsider the law.\n\n## Current Challenges to Proposition 12\n\nSeveral significant challenges to Proposition 12 are currently in progress:\n\n1. **Federal Legislative Efforts**: House Republicans are attempting to overturn Proposition 12 through the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (Farm Bill). The proposed legislation would prevent states from imposing production standards on products not physically raised in that state[5].\n\n2. **GOP-Sponsored Bill**: There is a GOP-sponsored bill explicitly aimed at undoing Proposition 12 that would affect the requirements for giving certain livestock animals specific amounts of space[3].\n\n3. **Industry Concerns**: Pig farmers are uncertain about making massive infrastructure investments to comply with California's standards, which they fear could change with future ballot initiatives[5].\n\n4. **Federal Administration Concerns**: USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has warned Congress that \"there's nothing preventing any state from doing what California did,\" and without action, \"we're going to have chaos in the marketplace\"[5].\n\n## Factors Supporting Proposition 12's Continuation\n\n1. **Voter Support**: Proposition 12 was approved by 63% of California voters in the 2018 election, indicating strong public support[4].\n\n2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The Supreme Court has already ruled on the constitutionality of the law, making further legal challenges on the same grounds unlikely to succeed[4].\n\n3. **State Sovereignty**: California may resist federal attempts to override its state laws, potentially leading to further legal battles if federal legislation passes.\n\n## Factors Supporting Proposition 12's Repeal\n\n1. **Economic Pressure**: The significant price increases for pork products and resulting decrease in consumption create economic incentives for change[2][5].\n\n2. **Bipartisan Concerns**: USDA Secretary Vilsack's concerns about market chaos suggest that opposition to Proposition 12 may not be strictly partisan[5].\n\n3. **Industry Opposition**: Major agricultural organizations like American Farm Bureau Federation and National Pork Producers Council continue to oppose the law, citing concerns about arbitrary standards that don't align with veterinary science and industry practices[4][5].\n\n4. **Federal Legislative Momentum**: The inclusion of provisions targeting Proposition 12 in the Farm Bill indicates significant federal legislative interest in overriding the state law[5].\n\n## Forecast Considerations\n\nThe question of whether Proposition 12 will remain in effect on January 1, 2026, hinges on several key factors:\n\n1. Whether federal legislation overriding state production standards will pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law before 2026.\n\n2. The possibility of new legal challenges based on different grounds than those already addressed by the Supreme Court.\n\n3. Whether California might modify the law in response to economic pressures and implementation challenges.\n\n4. The outcome of the 2024 presidential and congressional elections, which could significantly affect federal policy priorities.\n\nThe significant economic impacts already observed, combined with active legislative efforts at the federal level and statements from the USDA Secretary, suggest substantial pressure against Proposition 12's continuation in its current form. However, the law has already survived significant legal challenges and has strong voter support in California."

Despite rules in place, betting remains a significant problem, with many examples of players and teams being affected. The English Football Association (FA) has banned individuals involved in football from betting on competitions or related matters, and sharing privileged information to benefit bettors. Punishments for violating these rules can be severe, with cases such as Kynan Isaac, who was banned for 10 years for taking a yellow card on purpose, and Ivan Toney, who was suspended for 8 months for betting against his own team. The FA, the Betting Commission, and bookmakers work together to detect rule-breakers. In 2023, a study found that betting logos appeared up to 3,500 times in a single Premier League match, with an average of one appearance every 16 seconds. The Premier League has decided to ban betting sponsorships from the front of jerseys starting from the 2026\/2027 season, but critics argue that this is like 'putting a band-aid on a broken leg' as betting logos can still appear on sleeves or advertisements. The solution to this problem seems to be long and complex, requiring education, harsh penalties, and the responsibility of clubs and federations to address the issue.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: April 18, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https:\/\/www1.folha.uol.com.br\/colunas\/marina-izidro\/2025\/04\/apesar-de-regras-futebol-na-inglaterra-tambem-sofre-com-bets.shtml)\n\n**Pete Rose: A baseball legend and a symbol of controversy - The Cincinnati Herald**\nPete Rose, a baseball legend and a symbol of controversy, holds the record for most base hits in baseball history with 4,256.

Hooper had been under investigation since last year for his involvement in sports betting and had been unable to participate in any games during the 2024 season. He had already received a notice of termination in May 2024 and appealed the decision. The MLB office stated that while they did not find any evidence that Hooper directly bet on games or attempted to manipulate the outcome, he failed to meet the high level of moral standards expected of an MLB umpire. Hooper shared a betting account with a professional poker player and friend who had bet on baseball 141 times, totaling around $214,000, and made a profit of $35,000. Hooper deleted messages with his friend that could have been used as evidence in the investigation, which the MLB office saw as an attempt to obstruct the investigation. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated that Hooper's actions were 'very inappropriate' and that he had a 'high level of moral responsibility' as an umpire. The MLB rulebook states that players, umpires, and officials who bet on games will be permanently banned, and those who bet on other sports will be suspended for one year.

According to The Guardian, 'Denmark was supposed to hold the chairmanship, but in a sign that Copenhagen is trying to reboot its relationship with Greenland, a former Danish colony that remains part of the Danish kingdom, the chairmanship has been passed to Greenland.' The Arctic Council requires consensus among the eight Arctic states, including the US, Russia, Canada, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Greenland, and Sweden, for all decisions and statements. This move comes after US President Donald Trump suggested sending American troops to Greenland in April, stating that it could be a way to 'assert rights' to the island. Trump had previously expressed interest in buying Greenland from Denmark in 2019, but was rejected. In 2025, Trump was told that Greenland is not for sale, but Denmark is willing to cooperate more with the US. Greenland's new Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, has stated that the US will not get the island, saying 'it belonged to no one yesterday, it belongs to no one today, and it will belong to no one tomorrow.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 13, 2025 02:40 AM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https:\/\/iz.ru\/1885234\/2025-05-13\/grenlandia-vozglavila-arkticeskii-sovet-ot-imeni-danii)\n\n**Greenland Takes Over Arctic Council Chairmanship from Norway, Representing Denmark**\nGreenland has officially taken over the chairmanship of the Arctic Council from Norway, representing Denmark. The transfer took place in the Norwegian city of Troms\u00f8, where Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Science, Vivian Motzfeldt, accepted a symbolic hammer as a symbol of the transfer of leadership from Norway's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Espen Barth Eide. According to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greenland, Greenland's new leadership of the Arctic Council from Denmark symbolizes a reboot of relations between Greenland and Copenhagen, particularly in the context of past territorial ambitions expressed by former US President Donald Trump. Greenland has identified several key priorities during its chairmanship, including support for indigenous peoples of the Arctic, sustainable development of the region, promotion of 'green' energy, and measures to preserve the climate and biodiversity. Motzfeldt emphasized that the Arctic should remain a space where any conflicts are resolved through peaceful and diplomatic means. Greenland expressed its readiness to cooperate with all participating countries of the Council and expects a reciprocal approach. Additionally, it was announced that the post of Chairman of the Committee of Senior Officials of the Arctic Council will be held by a representative of Greenland, Kenneth H\u00f8eg, and his deputy will be a delegate from the Faroe Islands. It is worth noting that earlier it was reported that the potential offer to buy Greenland from the United States could be around $2.2 billion.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 10:49 PM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https:\/\/aif.ru\/politics\/grenlandiya-ot-imeni-danii-prinyala-predsedatelstvo-v-arkticheskom-sovete)\n\n**Denmark Takes Over Arctic Council Presidency Amid Tensions and Trump's Greenland Ambitions**\nDenmark has taken over the rotating presidency of the Arctic Council from Norway, amidst increased security tensions in the region and US President Donald Trump's ambitions to annex Greenland.

Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory in Denmark, which has rejected Trump's statements about buying the island.

According to The Guardian, 'Denmark was supposed to hold the chairmanship, but in a sign that Copenhagen is trying to reboot its relationship with Greenland, a former Danish colony that remains part of the Danish kingdom, the chairmanship has been passed to Greenland.' The Arctic Council requires consensus among the eight Arctic states, including the US, Russia, Canada, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Greenland, and Sweden, for all decisions and statements. This move comes after US President Donald Trump suggested sending American troops to Greenland in April, stating that it could be a way to 'assert rights' to the island. Trump had previously expressed interest in buying Greenland from Denmark in 2019, but was rejected. In 2025, Trump was told that Greenland is not for sale, but Denmark is willing to cooperate more with the US.

According to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greenland, Greenland's new leadership of the Arctic Council from Denmark symbolizes a reboot of relations between Greenland and Copenhagen, particularly in the context of past territorial ambitions expressed by former US President Donald Trump. Greenland has identified several key priorities during its chairmanship, including support for indigenous peoples of the Arctic, sustainable development of the region, promotion of 'green' energy, and measures to preserve the climate and biodiversity. Motzfeldt emphasized that the Arctic should remain a space where any conflicts are resolved through peaceful and diplomatic means. Greenland expressed its readiness to cooperate with all participating countries of the Council and expects a reciprocal approach. Additionally, it was announced that the post of Chairman of the Committee of Senior Officials of the Arctic Council will be held by a representative of Greenland, Kenneth H\u00f8eg, and his deputy will be a delegate from the Faroe Islands.

The move comes as US President Donald Trump has made claims on Greenland, and the Arctic Council is expected to face 'even greater challenges' in the next two years, including Trump's continued threats to take control of Greenland and unstable relations between the US and its Arctic neighbors. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said, 'The Arctic is very sought after because it is the shortest route for missiles, aircraft, and so on between Russia and North America, and this has always been on our agenda.' The Arctic Council, established in 1996, is a high-level intergovernmental forum that promotes cooperation in the region, particularly in environmental protection. Member countries include Denmark, Iceland, Canada, Norway, Russia, the US, Finland, and Sweden.

This move would highlight Trump's interest in the strategically important territory, which he has repeatedly expressed a desire to acquire. The sources said that the consideration involves transferring Greenland from the US European Command's area of responsibility to the US Northern Command. While it may seem logical to place Greenland under the Northern Command's jurisdiction, given its location as part of the North American continent, it is also a Danish semi-autonomous territory with cultural and historical ties to Europe. Some of the discussions took place before Trump's return to the White House this year. However, several US officials are concerned because Trump has repeatedly claimed that the US 'needs' Greenland and has refused to rule out the possibility of taking military action to obtain it. In a recent interview on NBC, Trump said, 'I'm not ruling out any possibilities, I'm not saying I'll do it, but I'm not ruling out any possibilities.' He added, 'We really need Greenland, it has a very small population, we will take care of them, we will love them, etc. We need it for international security.' The US Northern Command is primarily responsible for protecting US territory and currently handles tasks such as the South Border Task Force. Trump's comments have also caused significant friction with Denmark and Greenland. Placing Greenland under the US Northern Command's jurisdiction would at least symbolically separate Greenland from Denmark, with Denmark still being responsible for it under the US European Command. A source said that Danish officials are worried that this move could convey the message that Greenland is no longer part of Denmark. A US official said that supporters of the move believe that despite having a US military base on the island, Greenland is sometimes overlooked by the US European Command due to its distance from the command center in Central Europe. The island is seen as an important outpost for the US to compete with Russia and other countries for access to the Arctic - a key national security priority for both parties. However, for the US Northern Command, Greenland is an important location for any potential enemy aircraft flying towards the US. In the context of Russia and other adversaries seeking to expand their influence in the region, the US intelligence community's annual threat assessment report mentions Greenland four times in its unclassified version. The discussion about bringing Greenland under the Northern Command's jurisdiction took place at a time when US and Danish officials were engaged in another high-profile dispute over Greenland. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said this week that he plans to 'summon' the US ambassador to Denmark for talks. Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that Washington has ordered US intelligence agencies to increase surveillance of Greenland, asking them to further understand the island's independence movement and its attitude towards US resource extraction. Rasmussen told reporters at an EU foreign ministers' informal meeting in Warsaw on July 7: 'I read the article in The Wall Street Journal, and it made me very worried because we won't spy on our friends.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 01:25 AM\nSource:[\u5149\u660e\u7f51](https:\/\/mil.gmw.cn\/2025-05\/12\/content_38019370.htm)\n\n**US Plans to Sign 'Free Association Agreement' with Greenland, Sparking Concerns Over Sovereignty**\nThe US government has been secretly strengthening its espionage activities in Greenland, a Danish autonomous territory.

The then-Prime Minister of Greenland Mute Egede said that the island wants to be independent but have close ties with the US and Denmark. The Financial Times wrote that President Trump and Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen had a tense conversation, during which Frederiksen again stated that Greenland is not for sale. On February 4, Mute Egede appointed general elections in Greenland for March 11 in the face of constantly growing pressure from Donald Trump. On March 4, President Trump delivered his annual address to Congress, during which he said that Washington would support Greenland's right to self-determination and would make it part of the United States if the island's population wants it. On March 12, the opposition party Demokraatit won the parliamentary elections in Greenland, receiving 29.9% of the votes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 09, 2025 08:08 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https:\/\/nv.ua\/world\/geopolitics\/ssha-vedut-zakrytye-peregovory-po-osobomu-statusu-grenlandii-50512793.html)\n\n**Greenland's Sovereignty to be Decided by Sled Dog Racing Competition**\nUS President Donald Trump and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen have agreed, following a phone call where tensions were eased after recent disputes, that Vice President JD Vance and new Greenland Prime Minister Jens Frederiksen Nielsen will compete in a sled dog racing competition to decide Greenland's sovereignty. According to the agreement, Denmark will cede sovereignty to the US, and Greenland will gain independence from Copenhagen. Italy has offered to host the competition, with Vice Premier Matteo Salvini stating, 'It will be a perfect opportunity to showcase Italian excellence ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: April 01, 2025 02:10 PM\nSource:[ilcaffegeopolitico.net](https:\/\/ilcaffegeopolitico.net\/997474\/groenlandia-la-sovranita-sull-isola-sara-decisa-da-una-gara-di-cani-da-slitta)\n\n**Denmark Urges US to Renegotiate Defense Cooperation in Greenland**\nDenmark has urged the United States to renegotiate the terms of their defense cooperation in Greenland without altering the island's sovereignty. The Danish Foreign Minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, stated that the 1951 defense agreement offers 'a wide margin of maneuver' and that Denmark is committed to maintaining the Arctic as a region of low tension. The Danish government's stance coincides with Washington's view that the current status quo in the Arctic is unsustainable following the start of the war in Ukraine, but Denmark defends alternative solutions that do not involve changes to Greenland's sovereignty. Rasmussen said, 'If that's what the United States wants, let's talk about it.' The Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, also responded to the US Vice President's comments, calling his tone 'inappropriate.' Rasmussen rejected accusations of passivity from the US Vice President, highlighting that Denmark's policy has been guided by the consensus to maintain the Arctic as a region of low tension, a situation that he considers to be outdated. Denmark emphasized that Greenland is part of NATO and protected by its security guarantees, and Rasmussen mentioned recent defense investments in the territory as evidence of Denmark's commitment to its strategic role in the North Atlantic. The US Vice President, JD Vance, visited Greenland and stated that the US 'has no other option' but to negotiate the island's incorporation if it were to become independent from Denmark through a referendum. Vance argued that the decisions made by the Danish government in recent years have resulted in a lack of investment in the local population and infrastructure security in Greenland. 'Our message to Denmark is very simple: you haven't done a good job with the people of Greenland. You haven't invested enough in the people of Greenland and you haven't invested enough in the security architecture of this incredible and beautiful land filled with incredible people. That has to change,' Vance said. The US Vice President also stated that the transfer of control to the US would not only guarantee greater security in the region but also benefit the Greenlanders economically, and that under US administration, Greenland could achieve a higher level of development and stability. 'We could make them much safer, we could provide much more protection and I think they would do much better economically,' Vance said.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 29, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[infobae](https:\/\/www.infobae.com\/america\/mundo\/2025\/03\/29\/dinamarca-insto-a-estados-unidos-a-renegociar-el-acuerdo-de-defensa-sobre-groenlandia-sin-alterar-su-soberania\/)\n\n**US Interest in Greenland Sparks Independence Movement**\nThe renewed interest of the US in Greenland has strengthened the movement for independence and the country's position in future negotiations on separation from Denmark, said the leading party in the country, which advocates for independence, citing Reuters. The Arctic island will vote on March 11 in elections, where independence has become a central issue after recent statements by US President Donald Trump that Denmark should transfer control to the US due to Greenland's strategic value for American security. 'Trump's statements and the new line from the US administration have undoubtedly given the independence movement here more momentum,' said Reuters' J\u00f8rgen B\u00f8ttelSEN, a candidate in the March 11 elections from the Naleraq party. Naleraq will strive for a defense agreement with the US and a so-called 'free association' with Denmark or another country, possibly the US, in the event of independence, B\u00f8ttelSEN said. The Naleraq party, the most active party in Greenland advocating for independence, aims to use the 2009 law, which granted the territory significant autonomy, including the right to negotiate full independence. If this is approved, negotiations with Denmark will begin, although any agreement will require the approval of the Danish parliament and a referendum in Greenland. The ruling party Siumut, which previously considered independence a long-term goal, has recently announced plans to hold a referendum after the elections next month. Trump's comments sparked a political crisis in Copenhagen, where the government acknowledged that it had neglected Greenland's defense for a long time. Last week, Danish lawmakers agreed to allocate around $2 billion to strengthen military presence in Greenland.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 11:59 AM\nSource:[unn.ua](https:\/\/unn.ua\/news\/u-hrenlandii-zaiavyly-pro-poshtovkh-rukhu-za-nezalezhnist-cherez-interes-ssha)\n\n**Why Trump is pushing for Greenland to join the US: What it means for Russia**\nUS President Donald Trump has been pushing for Greenland to join the United States, with some European officials describing his approach as 'aggressive' and 'conflict-oriented'. According to the Financial Times, Trump focused solely on demanding that Greenland be transferred to the US, ignoring other issues. The move could have significant implications for Russia, with political analyst Dmitry Evstafiev warning that it could lead to a new era of globalization in the Arctic, where Russia would face off against the US. 'For Russia, the main risk is that if this project of Trump's is implemented, then America becomes a player in the Arctic, equal in scale to Russia,' Evstafiev said. 'Today, America is not a player in the Arctic. The Arctic infrastructure of America is quite poor compared to Canada. If such an integration takes place in a soft form of a new Euro-Atlantic front... America becomes our main competitor in the battle for the Arctic.' Trump's proposal has been met with criticism from European leaders, with the European Commission refusing to comment on the matter. Denmark has conducted military exercises on the island in response to Trump's comments. The idea of Greenland joining the US is not new, with the US having previously proposed purchasing the island in 1867 and 1946. Trump has hinted at using force to achieve this goal, with Politico suggesting that such a scenario could be one of the shortest armed conflicts in history. 'We must officially start negotiations with Denmark on creating a sovereign state of Greenland,' said Siumut deputy Kuuno Fenger, calling for Greenland to gain independence before it's too late. 'There are many opportunities that people need to know about before we hold a referendum. That's why my party has submitted a proposal to parliament to activate our right to self-determination.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 10:52 PM\nSource:[URA.RU](https:\/\/ura.news\/news\/1052880245)\n\n**Grenlandic MP Calls for Negotiations with Denmark on Sovereignty**\nGrenlandic MP Siimun Kuuno Fenchner, from the ruling coalition party Siumut, believes that representatives of the island should start negotiations with Denmark about Greenland's sovereignty. 'My personal opinion is that we should officially start negotiations with Denmark to create a sovereign state of Greenland,' Fenchner said. He added that the people of Greenland should be informed about the various possibilities before a referendum on the island's status. 'That's why my party has proposed to parliament that we should activate our right to self-determination,' Fenchner concluded. This comes after US President-elect Donald Trump stated on December 23, 2024, that the country's national security interests require control and ownership of Greenland. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lekke Rasmussen also stated on January 9 that Greenland could become an independent country, but noted that 'it's unlikely that it would have ambitions to become a subject of the United States.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 04:59 AM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https:\/\/rossaprimavera.ru\/news\/c389d53d)\n\n**Grenlandic MP Calls for Talks on Independence from Denmark**\nGrenlandic MP Siut Kuuno Fenchner has called for official talks with Denmark to begin as soon as possible to discuss the island's independence.

'My personal opinion is that we should officially start negotiations with Denmark to create a sovereign state of Greenland. There are many opportunities that people need to know about before we hold a referendum. That's why my party has proposed a motion that we should activate our right to self-determination,' Fenchner said in an interview with RIA Novosti. Fenchner also mentioned that Greenland has plans to extend its defense agreement with the US without Denmark's involvement, and that Greenland may sign separate agreements with both Denmark and the EU. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953 and remains part of the kingdom, with autonomy and self-governance granted in 2009. In late December 2024, the Danish defense minister announced plans to significantly increase defense spending on the world's largest island, following US President Donald Trump's statement on acquiring Greenland.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 04:05 AM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https:\/\/www.kommersant.ru\/doc\/7443642)\n\n",

Both companies have revised their annual financial forecasts downward. DraftKings has reduced its revenue forecast by $200 million to $6.4 billion, and its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) forecast by $100 million to $900 million. Flutter has also reduced its adjusted EBITDA forecast for the US market by $180 million to $1.13 billion. The main blow to margins came from the March NCAA March Madness tournament, which CEO of Flutter Peter Jackson called 'historic', with all favorites winning in the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 rounds, a rare occurrence in the tournament's history. This significantly reduced the income of bookmakers after the February Super Bowl, which had worked in their favor. Since the legalization of sports betting in 2018, the US market has shown rapid growth, reaching $14 billion in revenue in 2023, according to the American Gaming Association. FanDuel and DraftKings have long held the lead, but in recent quarters have begun to lose market share. According to Barclays, Flutter's market share has fallen from 62% in the first quarter of 2023 to 48% in the first quarter of 2024, while DraftKings has fallen from 39% to 31%. Analysts note that competitors such as BetMGM, Bet365, and Fanatics are actively closing the gap with capital and an aggressive marketing strategy. Additionally, investors are beginning to pay more attention to the instability of margins in the sports betting segment rather than just revenue growth. As OBOZ.UA reported, March 2025 was a historic month for online casinos in the US, with a total gross revenue of $905.6 million in seven states where digital casino platforms are legalized, a 26.2% increase from the same period last year.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 04:49 PM\nSource:[\u041e\u0411\u041e\u0417\u0420\u0415\u0412\u0410\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c](https:\/\/finance.obozrevatel.com\/bukmekeryi-ssha-zhaluyutsya-na-udachu-igrokov-vyiigryishej-vse-bolshe-deneg-vse-menshe.htm)\n\n**Recession Odds Fall Below 50% On Polymarket As Crypto Bettors Digest US-China Trade Deal News**\nThe odds of a US recession in 2025 have fallen below 50% on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market, following the US-China trade deal announcement.

Industry insiders argue that the ban will have a ripple effect, decimating the industry and impacting farmers, laborers, and businesses in rural communities. While animal advocates welcome the ban, citing animal welfare concerns, the Australian Livestock Exporters' Council disputes these claims, stating that exporters have improved significantly since reforms in 2018. The industry warns that the ban will lead to a decline in sheep prices, reduced income for farmers, and potentially even the slaughter of sheep due to lack of demand. Shearers, who can earn up to $750 per day, will also face inconsistent work and potential unemployment. 'It's not really good having groups of shearers just sitting around,' said WA Shearing Industry Association president Darren Spencer. 'The ban doesn't come into effect until 2028, but farmers are making decisions now on what they do,' he added. 'Right across our membership here, most contractors have got a lot less work,' Spencer said. 'Live sheep export is fundamentally cruel and it cannot be fixed. Literally millions of sheep have died and all have suffered through this trade in live animals,' an Animals Australia spokesperson said.

The decision comes after a heated debate between animal rights and productive sectors, following a 2022 Constitutional Court mandate. The project aims to regulate the rights of non-human animals and responds to a 2022 court ruling recognizing animals as subjects of rights. The Lopda project was presented by the Ombudsman's Office in August 2022 and includes measures such as the prohibition of cruel practices and the regulation of animal production. However, after the first debate on August 1, 2024, the Biodiversity Commission introduced modifications that generated criticism from animal rights groups. The decision not to archive the Lopda has sparked divided reactions, with some groups demanding its archive, calling it 'regressive' and contrary to the Constitutional Court's mandate. Others, including productive sectors, have defended the modifications, arguing that the original project would increase food production costs and affect food sovereignty. The project will now return to the Biodiversity Commission for adjustments, with a new report to be presented within 90 days, after which it will return to the Plenary for its final debate. If approved, the norm will be sent to the Executive for its approval or veto.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 11:17 PM\nSource:[El Diario - Manabita](https:\/\/www.eldiario.ec\/proyecto-de-ley-de-derechos-de-los-animales-regresa-a-comision-tras-votacion-20250512\/)\n\n**Advocating for California's animals**\nStaff and volunteers from Marin Humane attended Animal Advocacy Day at the California state Capitol to advocate for three key issues: closing the puppy mill pipeline, increasing access to veterinary care, and enhancing animal protection.

The state of California has defended its law, with Steve Lyle, spokesperson for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, stating, 'The state\u2019s voters \u201coverwhelmingly adopted Proposition 12 and California will defend its law.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[sfchronicle.com](https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/politics\/article\/trump-california-prop-12-pork-20058810.php)\n\n**Trump's Appointed Agriculture Secretary Vows to Repeal Controversial California Animal Welfare Law**\nDonald Trump has appointed Brooke Rollins as the new US Secretary of Agriculture. During a hearing in the US Senate on January 23, Rollins stated that she will work to repeal a law in California that imposes stricter animal welfare requirements, particularly in pig production. The law, known as Proposition 12, has been controversial among pig farmers. Rollins said, 'I am a strong supporter of federalism, which means that states have the right to self-determination. However, in this specific case, it is clear that it is not just about California, but also about other states and parts of the agricultural industry, including family farms with pigs. Iowa, as well as many other states, have been severely affected by this. Yes, I would like to cooperate with you on this, and I look forward to it.' The law, which was passed in 2018, requires a minimum of 2.2 square meters per pregnant sow, which is more than twice the current standard. The law has caused significant discontent among American pig producer associations. However, with a 5-4 majority, the US Supreme Court approved California's Higher Animal Welfare Act in 2023, which was then implemented. The law not only affects pig producers in California but also producers from other states who want to sell to California must comply with the requirements.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 12:20 PM\nSource:[bondebladet.no](https:\/\/www.bondebladet.no\/kontroversiell-dyrevelferdslov-i-california-kan-bli-skrotet-med-donald-trumps-foretrukne-landbruks-og-matminister\/s\/5-150-101502)\n\n"

For most of the preceedin years this matched the top players in the American Football Conference (AFC) against those in the National Football Conference (NFC). However, as of December 2024 it features a series of skill competitions, such as passing challenges and precision drills, as well as a flag football game between the NFC and AFC rosters instead of a traditional full-contact game.\n* In the NBA, [it used to feature](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NBA_All-Star_Game#Rosters_selection) a game between two 12-player squads picked from each of the two conferences. This was also changed in December 2024, with the [new format](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_NBA_All-Star_Game) splitting the 24 players into three teams of 8 that will compete in a tournament with the winners of the Rising Stars challenge.\n* In MLB, [this is](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game) a a traditional matchup between the American League and National League. Starters are chosen through fan voting, while pitchers and reserves are selected by a combination of player votes and selections by the Commissioner's Office. Each MLB team is guaranteed at least one representative.\n* In NHL, [the format](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NHL_All-Star_Game#Formats) has changed multiple times, going from a game between two teams each selected from one of the conferences, to a single elimination tournament between four teams, representing the league's four divisions. The NHL decided to not run an All-Star game in 2025 and instead hold a new Four Nations Face-Off tournament as a preview for the league's return to Olympic participation in 2026.\n\nIn 2018, sports betting was broadly legalized in the US with the overturning of the [Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Professional_and_Amateur_Sports_Protection_Act_of_1992) by the Supreme Court. Since then gambling-related suspensions and bans [have](https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2023\/07\/24\/sport\/nfl-gambling-suspension-eyioma-uwazurike-spt-intl\/index.html) [dramatically](https:\/\/frontofficesports.com\/nbas-lifetime-ban-highlights-surge-in-gambling-related-incidents\/) [increased](https:\/\/www.mlb.com\/news\/mlb-announces-sports-betting-violation-suspensions) across sports. However, as of December 2024, this has not included any All-Stars.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament. [Learn more and compete for the $2,500 prize pool](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/c\/future-perfect\/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, after January 1, 2025 and before January 1, 2026, any player who has ever been selected as an All-Star in the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL is banned or suspended due to sports betting.\n\n* Any suspension due to sports betting for any amount of time or number of games will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Every player that has been selected for an All-Star or Pro Bowl roster counts, including reserves and pitchers, independently of their participation in the event. For example, if a player was selected and then was replaced due to injury or other commitments, he still counts. Only current players are included, former All-Star players (for example players who are now managers or coaches) do not count.\n* The ban or suspension has to happen after the player has been selected for the corresponding roster. Players that were suspended before they were selected will not resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* The main reason for the suspension or the ban has to be sports betting as mentioned in the official organization statement or as confirmed by [credible sources](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/faq\/#definitions).\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Since the 2018 legalization of sports betting, gambling-related suspensions in the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL have increased significantly. For example, eleven NFL players have been suspended for gambling violations since 2022, and similar patterns are seen in other leagues[1][3][5].\n- All leagues enforce strict anti-gambling rules, with penalties ranging from fines to lifetime bans[5].\n- As of December 2024, no All-Star (past or present) from any of these leagues has been banned or suspended due to sports betting[1][3][5].\n\n## Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- The NFL's gambling policy prohibits any form of gambling on league property, with recent suspensions highlighting enforcement[4].\n- NBA, MLB, and NHL maintain similarly strict policies, with publicized consequences for violations[5].\n- The expansion of legal sports betting, especially via mobile apps, has made infractions both easier to commit and to detect, prompting calls for even stricter enforcement[3][5].\n\n## Key Differences and their Impact\n\n- All-Star players are typically more aware of risks, face more scrutiny, and have more to lose, which may deter rule-breaking.\n- However, the growing normalization and access to betting platforms increases the chance of accidental or deliberate violations\u2014even among high-profile athletes[3][5].\n- The increased focus on enforcement and use of technology by leagues may heighten the probability that any infractions are detected.\n- The absence of any known All-Star suspensions to date suggests either greater caution or luck; this is a key difference from the overall rise in betting-related suspensions among non-All-Star players[1][3].\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- The probability of at least one All-Star from the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL being suspended or banned for sports betting before 2026 is **not negligible**, given recent trends.\n- However, the fact that no All-Star has been caught to date, despite rising enforcement and incidents among other players, suggests the risk is **less than 50% but not extremely low** for the next year.\n- A reasonable forecast might place this probability in the **20\u201335% range**, reflecting the increased prevalence of betting-related suspensions, the size of the All-Star pool, the heightened enforcement, but also the unique incentives and scrutiny around All-Star-caliber athletes.\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- The main limitation is that only suspensions that are detected and officially announced will count.\n- The All-Star pool is relatively large, but each player is under intense public and league scrutiny.\n- The situation could change suddenly if a single high-profile incident occurs.\n\n## Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Official league announcements and press releases (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL)\n- Major sports news outlets and real-time tracking sites for suspensions[2]\n- Policy summaries and legal analyses of league gambling regulations[5]\n\n## References\n\n1.

Despite rules in place, betting remains a significant problem, with many examples of players and teams being affected. The English Football Association (FA) has banned individuals involved in football from betting on competitions or related matters, and sharing privileged information to benefit bettors. Punishments for violating these rules can be severe, with cases such as Kynan Isaac, who was banned for 10 years for taking a yellow card on purpose, and Ivan Toney, who was suspended for 8 months for betting against his own team. The FA, the Betting Commission, and bookmakers work together to detect rule-breakers. In 2023, a study found that betting logos appeared up to 3,500 times in a single Premier League match, with an average of one appearance every 16 seconds. The Premier League has decided to ban betting sponsorships from the front of jerseys starting from the 2026\/2027 season, but critics argue that this is like 'putting a band-aid on a broken leg' as betting logos can still appear on sleeves or advertisements. The solution to this problem seems to be long and complex, requiring education, harsh penalties, and the responsibility of clubs and federations to address the issue.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: April 18, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https:\/\/www1.folha.uol.com.br\/colunas\/marina-izidro\/2025\/04\/apesar-de-regras-futebol-na-inglaterra-tambem-sofre-com-bets.shtml)\n\n**Pete Rose: A baseball legend and a symbol of controversy - The Cincinnati Herald**\nPete Rose, a baseball legend and a symbol of controversy, holds the record for most base hits in baseball history with 4,256.

Rose's thirst for winning at any cost ultimately led to his ban from baseball in 1989, after he accepted a lifetime ban for betting on baseball, including betting on the Reds.

The MLB office announced on February 4 that Hooper has been fired for violating the league's betting rules, and he will not be eligible to return to work until the 2026 Spring Camp. Hooper had been under investigation since last year for his involvement in sports betting and had been unable to participate in any games during the 2024 season. He had already received a notice of termination in May 2024 and appealed the decision. The MLB office stated that while they did not find any evidence that Hooper directly bet on games or attempted to manipulate the outcome, he failed to meet the high level of moral standards expected of an MLB umpire. Hooper shared a betting account with a professional poker player and friend who had bet on baseball 141 times, totaling around $214,000, and made a profit of $35,000. Hooper deleted messages with his friend that could have been used as evidence in the investigation, which the MLB office saw as an attempt to obstruct the investigation. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated that Hooper's actions were 'very inappropriate' and that he had a 'high level of moral responsibility' as an umpire.

Porter had others place bets on himself and made sure the bets won by checking out of games with an injury. This incident led to a larger investigation into gambling and alleged game manipulation in pro sports, and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier is now under investigation. According to NBA spokesperson Mike Bass, the league was alerted to suspicious betting activity from a game against the New Orleans Pelicans in March 2023, but found no wrongdoing. However, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York is now investigating the matter, and the NBA is cooperating. Rozier has not been charged, but the league is taking a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to players gambling on themselves.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[thespun.com](https:\/\/thespun.com\/nba\/federal-prosecutors-investigating-nba-star-for-illegal-betting)\n\n**Best Sports Betting Picks Today: NBA, NHL Predictions for January 29, 2025**\nJimmy Butler's indefinite ban from the Miami Heat has left the team facing a crucial matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavaliers will need leading scorer Donovan Mitchell to bounce back from his poor shooting performance in the previous meeting. Cleveland's Max Strus believes the team has the resiliency to bounce back, saying, 'When things don't go well, this group kind of takes things personal and has the resiliency to bounce back.' The Heat, led by Tyler Herro, will look to even the season series with Miami. The Cavaliers have lost three of their last four games and nine times overall, and will need to regroup to take on the conference-leading team.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[deadspin.com](https:\/\/deadspin.com\/best-sports-betting-picks-today-nba-nhl-predictions-for-january-29-2025\/)\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is 2025-05-13\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100",

Greenland has control over its domestic affairs while Denmark retains authority over foreign affairs and military matters. The geographic location of Greenland, as well as its deposits of oil and minerals, makes it a valuable strategic and economic asset.\u00a0\n\n\n\n[<u>President Trump has publicly expressed a desire to obtain Greenland as an American possession<\/u>](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/articles\/crkezj07rzro). The transfer of sovereignty of Greenland would mark an unprecedented move of territorial expansion and exchange between Western powers.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThe question will resolve as Yes if the governments of both the United States and Denmark, separately or jointly, announce formal negotiations over the possible transfer of sovereignty of Greenland to the United States before January 1, 2026.\n\n\\- This question will resolve to Yes only if the United States and Danish governments formally and publicly announce negotiations, such as via a press conference, official statement, etc.\n\n\\- This question will not resolve to Yes if it is only reported via news organizations that there are back channel, private, or other non-public negotiations\/discussions occurring between officials in the two governments.\n\n\\- Metaculus will resolve this question according to official announcements from the United States and Denmark before January 1, 2026, Eastern Time.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n### 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- The United States has had a long-standing interest in Greenland, dating back to at least the mid-20th century, motivated by its strategic Arctic location and natural resources[3][5].\n- The most prominent recent episode occurred in 2019, when then-President Trump publicly expressed a desire to purchase Greenland, but Denmark and Greenland promptly and firmly rejected the idea[3][5].\n- As of early 2025, US interest has intensified: President Trump has not ruled out acquiring Greenland and has made statements about using tariffs or even military force, citing national security concerns[1][2][4].\n- Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark; its government controls domestic affairs, but Denmark retains authority over foreign and defense policy[5].\n\n### 2. Recent Announcements and Policies\n\n- In January 2025, President Trump threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it blocked US efforts to acquire Greenland[2].\n- Greenland\u2019s leaders, representing all major parties, issued a joint statement after the March 2025 election, declaring US attempts at annexation \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and reaffirming that Greenland is \u201cnot for sale\u201d[2].\n- Denmark\u2019s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has reiterated that Greenland is not for sale, emphasizing cooperation with the US on Arctic security but rejecting any negotiations about sovereignty[1][2].\n- The European Union has publicly supported Denmark\u2019s territorial integrity, with the European Council President in February 2025 underscoring the importance of Danish sovereignty[2].\n- An opinion poll in January 2025 found that 85% of Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the United States[2].\n- Greenland\u2019s outgoing Prime Minister and Denmark\u2019s PM have both characterized recent US actions (including planned visits) as \u201chighly aggressive\u201d and \u201cnot respectful\u201d[2].\n- The US administration is reportedly calculating the cost of taking over Greenland, but expert analysis suggests actions are more likely to involve economic offers than any formal negotiation on sovereignty[4].\n\n### 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Official government statements from Denmark, Greenland, and the United States.\n- Reports and polling data from January\u2013April 2025, as cited above.\n- Parliamentary briefings and analysis from think tanks specializing in Arctic security[2][4].\n\n### 4. Limitations and Uncertainties\n\n- All available evidence as of January 31, 2025, indicates no movement toward formal negotiations. The positions of Denmark, Greenland, and the EU are unified against any sovereignty transfer[1][2][4].\n- There is no precedent for such a transfer between Western democracies in recent history, and public opposition in Greenland is overwhelming[2].\n- While the US is applying pressure and exploring options, back channel discussions or economic engagement are not sufficient to meet the resolution criteria, which require a formal, public announcement by both governments.\n\n### Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the above, the probability that the United States and Denmark will publicly announce formal negotiations over the transfer of Greenland\u2019s sovereignty before 2026 is extremely low (well below 5%). The unified opposition of both Denmark and Greenland, bolstered by EU support and public sentiment in Greenland, are decisive obstacles. No evidence as of January 31, 2025, suggests a reversal or softening of these positions.\n\n---\n\n#### References\n1.

Denmark appointed Viviann Mouzelat, the Foreign Minister of Greenland, as the new president of the council, a gathering of eight countries bordering the Arctic. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory in Denmark, which has rejected Trump's statements about buying the island. In response to a question about negotiations with the US, Mouzelat reiterated her government's commitment to becoming an independent state while still working with Trump's administration. She said, 'I think we were very clear in our policy, that we don't want to be Danish, but we don't want to be American either... Our cooperation with the new administration is very strong.' During Norway's two-year tenure as chair, the Arctic Council faced pressure on how to deal with Trump and Russia's war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest country in the Arctic, previously held the presidency before Norway. The council was one of the few places where Western countries worked closely with Russia, but members decided to suspend their work with Russia shortly after Moscow launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mouzelat said, 'The Arctic must remain a region where tensions are resolved through diplomacy, where the rights of indigenous peoples are protected, and where cooperation prevails.' She added, 'This is more important than ever.

The move comes as US President Donald Trump has made claims on Greenland, and the Arctic Council is expected to face 'even greater challenges' in the next two years, including Trump's continued threats to take control of Greenland and unstable relations between the US and its Arctic neighbors. Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said, 'The Arctic is very sought after because it is the shortest route for missiles, aircraft, and so on between Russia and North America, and this has always been on our agenda.' The Arctic Council, established in 1996, is a high-level intergovernmental forum that promotes cooperation in the region, particularly in environmental protection.

This move would highlight Trump's interest in the strategically important territory, which he has repeatedly expressed a desire to acquire. The sources said that the consideration involves transferring Greenland from the US European Command's area of responsibility to the US Northern Command. While it may seem logical to place Greenland under the Northern Command's jurisdiction, given its location as part of the North American continent, it is also a Danish semi-autonomous territory with cultural and historical ties to Europe. Some of the discussions took place before Trump's return to the White House this year. However, several US officials are concerned because Trump has repeatedly claimed that the US 'needs' Greenland and has refused to rule out the possibility of taking military action to obtain it. In a recent interview on NBC, Trump said, 'I'm not ruling out any possibilities, I'm not saying I'll do it, but I'm not ruling out any possibilities.' He added, 'We really need Greenland, it has a very small population, we will take care of them, we will love them, etc. We need it for international security.' The US Northern Command is primarily responsible for protecting US territory and currently handles tasks such as the South Border Task Force. Trump's comments have also caused significant friction with Denmark and Greenland. Placing Greenland under the US Northern Command's jurisdiction would at least symbolically separate Greenland from Denmark, with Denmark still being responsible for it under the US European Command. A source said that Danish officials are worried that this move could convey the message that Greenland is no longer part of Denmark. A US official said that supporters of the move believe that despite having a US military base on the island, Greenland is sometimes overlooked by the US European Command due to its distance from the command center in Central Europe. The island is seen as an important outpost for the US to compete with Russia and other countries for access to the Arctic - a key national security priority for both parties. However, for the US Northern Command, Greenland is an important location for any potential enemy aircraft flying towards the US. In the context of Russia and other adversaries seeking to expand their influence in the region, the US intelligence community's annual threat assessment report mentions Greenland four times in its unclassified version. The discussion about bringing Greenland under the Northern Command's jurisdiction took place at a time when US and Danish officials were engaged in another high-profile dispute over Greenland. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said this week that he plans to 'summon' the US ambassador to Denmark for talks. Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that Washington has ordered US intelligence agencies to increase surveillance of Greenland, asking them to further understand the island's independence movement and its attitude towards US resource extraction. Rasmussen told reporters at an EU foreign ministers' informal meeting in Warsaw on July 7: 'I read the article in The Wall Street Journal, and it made me very worried because we won't spy on our friends.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 01:25 AM\nSource:[\u5149\u660e\u7f51](https:\/\/mil.gmw.cn\/2025-05\/12\/content_38019370.htm)\n\n**US Plans to Sign 'Free Association Agreement' with Greenland, Sparking Concerns Over Sovereignty**\nThe US government has been secretly strengthening its espionage activities in Greenland, a Danish autonomous territory.

The US's actions have been criticized by experts, who see it as a form of 'aggressive expansionism' that would undermine global stability.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[news.cri.cn](https:\/\/news.cri.cn\/20250511\/a64ad5ff-7960-13e3-972a-e6423032231e.html)\n\n**US Considers Transferring Greenland to Northern Command, Raising Concerns Among Danish Officials**\nThe US is considering transferring the responsibility of Greenland from the European Command (EUCOM) to the Northern Command (NORTHCOM), which is responsible for the country's defense. This move, according to sources, is part of a plan to strengthen the US's presence in the Arctic region. Donald Trump, who has long been interested in Greenland, has stated, 'We have an urgent need for Greenland. The population is small, we will take care of it. But we need it for international security.' However, this move has raised concerns among Danish officials, who see it as a potential threat to their country's sovereignty. 'We see this as a signal that the US is preparing to take control of Greenland,' said a source. The US has also increased its intelligence operations on the island, with the aim of monitoring independence movements and assessing local sentiment on the exploitation of resources by the US. This move has further strained relations between the US and Denmark.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 05:19 PM\nSource:[il Giornale.it](https:\/\/www.ilgiornale.it\/news\/politica-estera\/obiettivo-groenlandia-washington-studia-cambio-comando-e-2477462.html)\n\n**Denmark and Neighboring Countries to Meet on Arctic Security Amid Trump's Greenland Plans**\nThe leaders of Denmark, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Norway will meet on Monday to discuss security in the Arctic, announced the Danish government, as US President Donald Trump seeks to take control of Greenland. 'Even though our countries meet in different parts of the world, it is natural that we, in this circle, meet to discuss the current security situation in the Arctic and the North Atlantic,' said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in a statement released on Sunday. The meeting will take place in Torshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands, with Frederiksen, Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Icelandic Prime Minister Kristrun Frostadottir, and Faroese Prime Minister Aksel Johannesen in attendance. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re will participate via video conference. Trump has repeatedly stated that he wants to take control of Greenland, citing security reasons and refusing to rule out the use of force. This has caused concern in other Arctic regions, including Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, and has also led to strong tensions with Danish and Greenlandic leaders, who have emphasized that the Arctic territory will decide its own future and that the US 'will not get Greenland'.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 05:13 PM\nSource:[Le Journal de Montreal](https:\/\/www.journaldemontreal.com\/2025\/05\/11\/le-danemark-organise-un-sommet-sur-la-securite-de-larctique)\n\n**Trump's Plan to Take Control of Greenland: A Geopolitical Struggle**\nUS President Trump has proposed a new plan to take control of Greenland, a Danish territory, by transferring its military command from the European Command (EUCOM) to the North American Command (NORTHCOM), effectively placing Greenland under the US mainland defense umbrella. He also wants to sign a 'Compact of Free Association' (COFA) with Greenland, effectively bringing the territory under US influence. Greenland's unique geographical location and rich resources make it a strategic location, and the US has long considered it a priority. However, China and Russia are also eyeing the territory, and Greenland is caught in a geopolitical struggle, facing challenges to its sovereignty, climate change, and more. Danish Foreign Minister has publicly condemned the US for sending a large number of intelligence agents to Greenland to gather information, and has threatened to take countermeasures, putting the US-Denmark diplomatic relationship to the test. Trump's government has been criticized for its lack of efficiency and failure to deliver on its promises, and the author suggests that the US should focus on building relationships and finding a peaceful solution, rather than relying on military power.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 10:43 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https:\/\/www.chinatimes.com\/opinion\/20250511002672-262110)\n\n**US Considers Alternative to Annexing Greenland: A Free Association Agreement**\nThe US is considering an alternative to annexing Greenland, a free association agreement, but Greenland would need to gain independence from Denmark.

The US considers Greenland strategically important due to its large mineral reserves, including rare earth elements necessary for high-tech and military production. The US is also helping Greenland to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on Denmark, which may be achieved through state agencies such as the US Development Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank of the US.

The authorities of Greenland and Panama reject the idea of joining the US. On January 20, Trump announced in his inaugural address that the US would return the Panama Canal and announced 'expansion' of US territory, possibly referring to its claims on Greenland and Canada. The then-Prime Minister of Greenland Mute Egede said that the island wants to be independent but have close ties with the US and Denmark. The Financial Times wrote that President Trump and Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen had a tense conversation, during which Frederiksen again stated that Greenland is not for sale. On February 4, Mute Egede appointed general elections in Greenland for March 11 in the face of constantly growing pressure from Donald Trump. On March 4, President Trump delivered his annual address to Congress, during which he said that Washington would support Greenland's right to self-determination and would make it part of the United States if the island's population wants it.

The Danish Foreign Minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, stated that the 1951 defense agreement offers 'a wide margin of maneuver' and that Denmark is committed to maintaining the Arctic as a region of low tension. The Danish government's stance coincides with Washington's view that the current status quo in the Arctic is unsustainable following the start of the war in Ukraine, but Denmark defends alternative solutions that do not involve changes to Greenland's sovereignty. Rasmussen said, 'If that's what the United States wants, let's talk about it.' The Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, also responded to the US Vice President's comments, calling his tone 'inappropriate.' Rasmussen rejected accusations of passivity from the US Vice President, highlighting that Denmark's policy has been guided by the consensus to maintain the Arctic as a region of low tension, a situation that he considers to be outdated. Denmark emphasized that Greenland is part of NATO and protected by its security guarantees, and Rasmussen mentioned recent defense investments in the territory as evidence of Denmark's commitment to its strategic role in the North Atlantic. The US Vice President, JD Vance, visited Greenland and stated that the US 'has no other option' but to negotiate the island's incorporation if it were to become independent from Denmark through a referendum. Vance argued that the decisions made by the Danish government in recent years have resulted in a lack of investment in the local population and infrastructure security in Greenland. 'Our message to Denmark is very simple: you haven't done a good job with the people of Greenland. You haven't invested enough in the people of Greenland and you haven't invested enough in the security architecture of this incredible and beautiful land filled with incredible people. That has to change,' Vance said. The US Vice President also stated that the transfer of control to the US would not only guarantee greater security in the region but also benefit the Greenlanders economically, and that under US administration, Greenland could achieve a higher level of development and stability. 'We could make them much safer, we could provide much more protection and I think they would do much better economically,' Vance said.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 29, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[infobae](https:\/\/www.infobae.com\/america\/mundo\/2025\/03\/29\/dinamarca-insto-a-estados-unidos-a-renegociar-el-acuerdo-de-defensa-sobre-groenlandia-sin-alterar-su-soberania\/)\n\n**US Interest in Greenland Sparks Independence Movement**\nThe renewed interest of the US in Greenland has strengthened the movement for independence and the country's position in future negotiations on separation from Denmark, said the leading party in the country, which advocates for independence, citing Reuters. The Arctic island will vote on March 11 in elections, where independence has become a central issue after recent statements by US President Donald Trump that Denmark should transfer control to the US due to Greenland's strategic value for American security. 'Trump's statements and the new line from the US administration have undoubtedly given the independence movement here more momentum,' said Reuters' J\u00f8rgen B\u00f8ttelSEN, a candidate in the March 11 elections from the Naleraq party. Naleraq will strive for a defense agreement with the US and a so-called 'free association' with Denmark or another country, possibly the US, in the event of independence, B\u00f8ttelSEN said. The Naleraq party, the most active party in Greenland advocating for independence, aims to use the 2009 law, which granted the territory significant autonomy, including the right to negotiate full independence. If this is approved, negotiations with Denmark will begin, although any agreement will require the approval of the Danish parliament and a referendum in Greenland. The ruling party Siumut, which previously considered independence a long-term goal, has recently announced plans to hold a referendum after the elections next month. Trump's comments sparked a political crisis in Copenhagen, where the government acknowledged that it had neglected Greenland's defense for a long time. Last week, Danish lawmakers agreed to allocate around $2 billion to strengthen military presence in Greenland.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 11:59 AM\nSource:[unn.ua](https:\/\/unn.ua\/news\/u-hrenlandii-zaiavyly-pro-poshtovkh-rukhu-za-nezalezhnist-cherez-interes-ssha)\n\n**Why Trump is pushing for Greenland to join the US: What it means for Russia**\nUS President Donald Trump has been pushing for Greenland to join the United States, with some European officials describing his approach as 'aggressive' and 'conflict-oriented'. According to the Financial Times, Trump focused solely on demanding that Greenland be transferred to the US, ignoring other issues. The move could have significant implications for Russia, with political analyst Dmitry Evstafiev warning that it could lead to a new era of globalization in the Arctic, where Russia would face off against the US. 'For Russia, the main risk is that if this project of Trump's is implemented, then America becomes a player in the Arctic, equal in scale to Russia,' Evstafiev said. 'Today, America is not a player in the Arctic. The Arctic infrastructure of America is quite poor compared to Canada. If such an integration takes place in a soft form of a new Euro-Atlantic front... America becomes our main competitor in the battle for the Arctic.' Trump's proposal has been met with criticism from European leaders, with the European Commission refusing to comment on the matter. Denmark has conducted military exercises on the island in response to Trump's comments. The idea of Greenland joining the US is not new, with the US having previously proposed purchasing the island in 1867 and 1946. Trump has hinted at using force to achieve this goal, with Politico suggesting that such a scenario could be one of the shortest armed conflicts in history. 'We must officially start negotiations with Denmark on creating a sovereign state of Greenland,' said Siumut deputy Kuuno Fenger, calling for Greenland to gain independence before it's too late.

These could range from the [winner of the US presidential election](https:\/\/polymarket.com\/event\/presidential-election-winner-2024) to [bird flu being designated a pandemic](https:\/\/kalshi.com\/markets\/kxnewoutbreakph5n1\/new-bird-flu-pandemic) or [an AI winning the International Mathematical Olympiad](https:\/\/manifold.markets\/Austin\/will-an-ai-get-gold-on-any-internat). Similar to Metaculus, prediction markets harness the wisdom of the crowds to provide [accurate](https:\/\/www.astralcodexten.com\/p\/prediction-market-faq) probabilistic estimates for future events.\n\nPrediction markets are tightly controlled in the US, with very few of them (e.g., [Kalshi](https:\/\/kalshi.com\/)) being approved by the CFTC. The largest prediction market as of the writing of this question, [Polymarket](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Polymarket) was fined by the CTFC in 2022 and stopped offering access to US customers. Another large prediction market, [Manifold](https:\/\/manifold.markets\/) allows users to bet almost exclusively using play money.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, in the calendar year 2025, Polymarket or Manifold can legally offer markets in the United States using real money.\n\n* This has to be legal in at least one US state.\n* A public change in law or government policy must occur for this to resolve as **Yes**, which could include but is not limited to court decisions, public CFTC [<u>no-action letters<\/u>](https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/LawRegulation\/CFTCStaffLetters\/index.htm), executive orders, or new laws. For example, if Manifold or Polymarket were to decide to accept risk under the status quo, satisfying the other criteria with no preceding change in law or government policy, that would not be sufficient. In the event the circumstances are unclear Metaculus may resolve the question as **ambiguous**.\n* For the purposes of this question, real money includes anything that can be legally exchanged for fiat currency. For example, if Polymarket launched \"Polymarket chips\" that one could at any point legally both buy and sell using USD and it was legal to bet on Polymarket using those chips, this question would resolve as **Yes** (in the same way that gambling in a casino with chips is gambling with real money). Similarly any legal cryptocurrencies or crypto tokens (e.g., USDC) would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* If Polymarket or Manifold markets operate using a custom currency (e.g., Manifold sweepcash), to resolve as **Yes** they have to explicitly state that users can exchange fiat currency for the custom currency and vice versa. Manifold's workaround that gives \"free\" sweepcash for mana purchases does not suffice to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Polymarket or Manifold restricting withdrawals only to money that has been previously traded would *not* prevent this question from resolving as **Yes**. A restriction that would allow only money that has been won from a market resolution to be withdrawn, however, *would* prevent this question from resolving as **Yes**.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting the Legality of Polymarket or Manifold for Real-Money Betting in the US in 2025\n\nAs of January 10, 2025, the regulatory landscape for prediction markets in the United States remains in flux, with important developments that could influence the legality of platforms like Polymarket and Manifold for real-money betting in the coming year.\n\n## Current Status and Historical Context\n\nThe legal status of prediction markets in the US has been characterized by significant regulatory challenges and evolving jurisprudence. Currently, prediction market winnings are taxable and treated as ordinary income for tax purposes, similar to traditional gambling winnings[1]. However, the operational legality of these platforms remains contested.\n\nA pivotal development occurred in September 2024 when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, allowing it to offer Congressional Control Contracts[1]. While the CFTC initially secured an emergency stay, the D.C. Circuit subsequently denied this motion in October 2024, enabling Kalshi to offer contracts before the 2024 US elections[1]. This judicial precedent represents a potential pathway for other prediction markets seeking legal operation.\n\nNotably, Kalshi expanded its offerings to include sports contracts in January 2025, indicating some regulatory flexibility at the federal level[1]. However, this expansion has not eliminated state-level resistance.\n\n## Regulatory Challenges and State Opposition\n\nDespite federal-level developments, significant opposition persists at the state level:\n\n- At least six states\u2014Illinois, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Ohio\u2014have issued cease and desist letters directing prediction markets to stop offering their services[2]\n- State regulators argue that prediction market activities resemble unauthorized sports wagering[5]\n- Operators like Kalshi maintain that their operations are legally sound under federal oversight by the CFTC, asserting their business model is founded on peer-to-peer swaps rather than traditional sports betting[5]\n\n## Factors Supporting Potential Legalization in 2025\n\nSeveral factors suggest increased possibility for legalization of real-money prediction markets in 2025:\n\n1. **Precedent-Setting Legal Victories**: Kalshi's court victory against the CFTC established a significant legal precedent that could benefit other prediction market platforms[1]\n\n2. **Regulatory Dialogue**: CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham has expressed interest in moving toward resolution, stating: \"The CFTC must take a forward-looking approach to shifts in market structure to ensure our markets remain vibrant and resilient while protecting all participants\"[1]\n\n3. **Planned Roundtable Discussions**: The CFTC is planning prediction markets roundtable discussions that could establish \"clear rules of the road and safeguards\"[1]\n\n## Factors Against Legalization in 2025\n\nCounterbalancing factors suggest continued challenges:\n\n1. **State-Level Resistance**: The aggressive cease-and-desist actions by multiple states indicate strong resistance that could delay or prevent legalization[2]\n\n2. **Unresolved Federal Litigation**: The case between KalshEx and CFTC remains unresolved as of early 2025, with the court expressing concerns about both arguments while appearing skeptical of the CFTC's broad interpretation of its regulatory authority[1]\n\n3. **Regulatory Classification Dispute**: Fundamental disagreement persists about whether prediction markets constitute gambling (state purview) or regulated commodity trading (federal purview)[5]\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the available information as of January 10, 2025, I estimate the following probabilities:\n\n- **35-45% probability** that real-money betting on either Polymarket or Manifold will become legal in at least one US state in 2025\n\nThis assessment reflects:\n- The positive precedent set by Kalshi's legal victories\n- The CFTC's apparent openness to dialogue and potential regulatory accommodation\n- The significant counterbalance of state-level opposition\n- The requirement for a specific change in law or policy (not just risk acceptance by the platforms)\n\nThe most likely pathway would be through:\n1. A favorable court ruling extending Kalshi's precedent to other platforms\n2. A CFTC no-action letter specifically addressing Polymarket or Manifold\n3. Individual state legislation carving out exceptions for prediction markets\n\nThe probability remains moderate rather than high due to the continued state-level resistance and the need for specific policy changes rather than just regulatory tolerance.\n\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Top 18 Online Casinos for Real Money in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland 2025**\nIn 2025, finding the best online casino for real money in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland is becoming increasingly complex.

Both companies have revised their annual financial forecasts downward. DraftKings has reduced its revenue forecast by $200 million to $6.4 billion, and its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) forecast by $100 million to $900 million. Flutter has also reduced its adjusted EBITDA forecast for the US market by $180 million to $1.13 billion. The main blow to margins came from the March NCAA March Madness tournament, which CEO of Flutter Peter Jackson called 'historic', with all favorites winning in the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 rounds, a rare occurrence in the tournament's history. This significantly reduced the income of bookmakers after the February Super Bowl, which had worked in their favor. Since the legalization of sports betting in 2018, the US market has shown rapid growth, reaching $14 billion in revenue in 2023, according to the American Gaming Association. FanDuel and DraftKings have long held the lead, but in recent quarters have begun to lose market share. According to Barclays, Flutter's market share has fallen from 62% in the first quarter of 2023 to 48% in the first quarter of 2024, while DraftKings has fallen from 39% to 31%. Analysts note that competitors such as BetMGM, Bet365, and Fanatics are actively closing the gap with capital and an aggressive marketing strategy. Additionally, investors are beginning to pay more attention to the instability of margins in the sports betting segment rather than just revenue growth. As OBOZ.UA reported, March 2025 was a historic month for online casinos in the US, with a total gross revenue of $905.6 million in seven states where digital casino platforms are legalized, a 26.2% increase from the same period last year.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 04:49 PM\nSource:[\u041e\u0411\u041e\u0417\u0420\u0415\u0412\u0410\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c](https:\/\/finance.obozrevatel.com\/bukmekeryi-ssha-zhaluyutsya-na-udachu-igrokov-vyiigryishej-vse-bolshe-deneg-vse-menshe.htm)\n\n**Recession Odds Fall Below 50% On Polymarket As Crypto Bettors Digest US-China Trade Deal News**\nThe odds of a US recession in 2025 have fallen below 50% on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market, following the US-China trade deal announcement.

[Learn more and compete for the $2,500 prize pool](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/c\/future-perfect\/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if California\u2019s 2018 Proposition 12, \"Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals Act\", is in effect on January 1, 2026. This question will resolve as **No** if it is not in effect for any reason, including but not limited to being overturned by a federal bill, being suspended by a court, or repealed by the California legislature.\n\nIf any portion of Proposition 12 is not in effect then the question will as **No**. The official ballot summary of Proposition 12 is:\n\n> * Establishes new minimum space requirements for confining veal calves, breeding pigs, and egg-laying hens.\n> * Requires egg-laying hens be raised in cage-free environment after December 31, 2021.\n> * Prohibits certain commercial sales of specified meat and egg products derived from animals confined in noncomplying manner.\n> * Defines sales violations as unfair competition.\n> * Creates good faith defense for sellers relying upon written certification by suppliers that meat and egg products comply with new confinement standards.\n> * Requires State of California to issue implementing regulations.\n\n(Source: Page 68 of the [California Official Voter Information Guide](https:\/\/vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov\/2018\/general\/pdf\/complete-vig.pdf) for 2018)\n\nThe US House of Representative's Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (also known as the Farm Bill) is an example of legislation that, if it were enacted, would count. In section 12007 (viewable [here](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/118th-congress\/house-bill\/8467\/text)), it says:\n\n> \\[N]o State or subdivision thereof may enact or enforce, directly or indirectly, as a condition for sale or consumption, any condition or standard of production on products derived from covered livestock not physically raised in such State or subdivision that is in addition to, or different from, the conditions or standards of production in the State in which the production occurs.\n\nIn its definition of \"covered livestock,\" the House Farm Bill specifies that covered livestock includes any domestic animal raised for the purpose of slaughter for human consumption, but it specifically does not include domestic animals raised for egg production. If this were enacted this would count for purposes of this question, since it nullifies California's ability to enforce Proposition 12's space requirements for pigs and veal calves, even though it still allows California to enforce Prop 12's space requirements for egg-laying hens.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\nTo forecast whether California's Proposition 12 will remain in effect on January 1, 2026, I'll analyze its current status, implementation effects, and ongoing challenges.\n\n## Current Status of Proposition 12\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 12, which establishes minimum space requirements for confining veal calves, breeding pigs, and egg-laying hens, officially took effect on January 1, 2024[4]. This followed a series of legal challenges that culminated in a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the law[4]. The proposition prohibits the sale in California of certain cuts of pork and veal, as well as eggs, from livestock whose confinement does not meet specific minimum space requirements, even if those animals were raised outside of California[4].\n\nKey requirements include:\n- 24 square feet of space for breeding pigs (sows)[4]\n- 43 square feet of floor space for veal calves[2]\n- 1 to 1.5 square feet of cage-free space for laying hens[2]\n\n## Market and Economic Impacts\n\nSince implementation, significant economic impacts have been observed:\n\n- According to USDA data, pork prices in California have increased dramatically: bacon by 16%, pork ribs by 17%, pork loin by 41%, and pork shoulder by 17%[2][5].\n- California's consumption of fresh pork has decreased from 13% to approximately 10% of U.S. production in just one year[2].\n- California produces only 0.06% of the nation's hogs (82,000 out of 133 million annually) while consuming about 10% of U.S. pork production[2].\n\nThese economic effects are creating pressure from multiple stakeholders to reconsider the law.\n\n## Current Challenges to Proposition 12\n\nSeveral significant challenges to Proposition 12 are currently in progress:\n\n1. **Federal Legislative Efforts**: House Republicans are attempting to overturn Proposition 12 through the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 (Farm Bill). The proposed legislation would prevent states from imposing production standards on products not physically raised in that state[5].\n\n2. **GOP-Sponsored Bill**: There is a GOP-sponsored bill explicitly aimed at undoing Proposition 12 that would affect the requirements for giving certain livestock animals specific amounts of space[3].\n\n3. **Industry Concerns**: Pig farmers are uncertain about making massive infrastructure investments to comply with California's standards, which they fear could change with future ballot initiatives[5].\n\n4. **Federal Administration Concerns**: USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has warned Congress that \"there's nothing preventing any state from doing what California did,\" and without action, \"we're going to have chaos in the marketplace\"[5].\n\n## Factors Supporting Proposition 12's Continuation\n\n1. **Voter Support**: Proposition 12 was approved by 63% of California voters in the 2018 election, indicating strong public support[4].\n\n2. **Supreme Court Precedent**: The Supreme Court has already ruled on the constitutionality of the law, making further legal challenges on the same grounds unlikely to succeed[4].\n\n3. **State Sovereignty**: California may resist federal attempts to override its state laws, potentially leading to further legal battles if federal legislation passes.\n\n## Factors Supporting Proposition 12's Repeal\n\n1. **Economic Pressure**: The significant price increases for pork products and resulting decrease in consumption create economic incentives for change[2][5].\n\n2. **Bipartisan Concerns**: USDA Secretary Vilsack's concerns about market chaos suggest that opposition to Proposition 12 may not be strictly partisan[5].\n\n3. **Industry Opposition**: Major agricultural organizations like American Farm Bureau Federation and National Pork Producers Council continue to oppose the law, citing concerns about arbitrary standards that don't align with veterinary science and industry practices[4][5].\n\n4. **Federal Legislative Momentum**: The inclusion of provisions targeting Proposition 12 in the Farm Bill indicates significant federal legislative interest in overriding the state law[5].\n\n## Forecast Considerations\n\nThe question of whether Proposition 12 will remain in effect on January 1, 2026, hinges on several key factors:\n\n1. Whether federal legislation overriding state production standards will pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law before 2026.\n\n2. The possibility of new legal challenges based on different grounds than those already addressed by the Supreme Court.\n\n3. Whether California might modify the law in response to economic pressures and implementation challenges.\n\n4. The outcome of the 2024 presidential and congressional elections, which could significantly affect federal policy priorities.\n\nThe significant economic impacts already observed, combined with active legislative efforts at the federal level and statements from the USDA Secretary, suggest substantial pressure against Proposition 12's continuation in its current form. However, the law has already survived significant legal challenges and has strong voter support in California.\n\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Fears major law change could 'cut the guts' out of entire rural industry: 'It can't be fixed'**\nThe Australian Labor Government's plan to ban live sheep exports in 2028 is feared to 'cut the guts' out of the rural industry, particularly the merino wool industry in Western Australia. Industry insiders argue that the ban will have a ripple effect, decimating the industry and impacting farmers, laborers, and businesses in rural communities. While animal advocates welcome the ban, citing animal welfare concerns, the Australian Livestock Exporters' Council disputes these claims, stating that exporters have improved significantly since reforms in 2018. The industry warns that the ban will lead to a decline in sheep prices, reduced income for farmers, and potentially even the slaughter of sheep due to lack of demand. Shearers, who can earn up to $750 per day, will also face inconsistent work and potential unemployment. 'It's not really good having groups of shearers just sitting around,' said WA Shearing Industry Association president Darren Spencer. 'The ban doesn't come into effect until 2028, but farmers are making decisions now on what they do,' he added. 'Right across our membership here, most contractors have got a lot less work,' Spencer said. 'Live sheep export is fundamentally cruel and it cannot be fixed.

The decision comes after a heated debate between animal rights and productive sectors, following a 2022 Constitutional Court mandate. The project aims to regulate the rights of non-human animals and responds to a 2022 court ruling recognizing animals as subjects of rights. The Lopda project was presented by the Ombudsman's Office in August 2022 and includes measures such as the prohibition of cruel practices and the regulation of animal production. However, after the first debate on August 1, 2024, the Biodiversity Commission introduced modifications that generated criticism from animal rights groups. The decision not to archive the Lopda has sparked divided reactions, with some groups demanding its archive, calling it 'regressive' and contrary to the Constitutional Court's mandate. Others, including productive sectors, have defended the modifications, arguing that the original project would increase food production costs and affect food sovereignty. The project will now return to the Biodiversity Commission for adjustments, with a new report to be presented within 90 days, after which it will return to the Plenary for its final debate. If approved, the norm will be sent to the Executive for its approval or veto.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 11:17 PM\nSource:[El Diario - Manabita](https:\/\/www.eldiario.ec\/proyecto-de-ley-de-derechos-de-los-animales-regresa-a-comision-tras-votacion-20250512\/)\n\n**Advocating for California's animals**\nStaff and volunteers from Marin Humane attended Animal Advocacy Day at the California state Capitol to advocate for three key issues: closing the puppy mill pipeline, increasing access to veterinary care, and enhancing animal protection.

Rollins stated, 'Under a proper system of government, \u201cwe don\u2019t have states telling our producers how they can raise their livestock,\u201d Prop 12, she said, is \u201cnot just affecting California. It\u2019s affecting multitudes of other states.\u201d The pork industry is hoping that with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, they can pass the legislation to preempt the state law. However, the legislation has been met with opposition from animal-protection groups and some Republicans, who argue that the law is effective and valuable. Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action, stated, 'I\u2019m disappointed that the incoming secretary of agriculture wants to nullify a lopsided state election that has triggered implementation of a very effective and valuable law.' The state of California has defended its law, with Steve Lyle, spokesperson for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, stating, 'The state\u2019s voters \u201coverwhelmingly adopted Proposition 12 and California will defend its law.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[sfchronicle.com](https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/politics\/article\/trump-california-prop-12-pork-20058810.php)\n\n**Trump's Appointed Agriculture Secretary Vows to Repeal Controversial California Animal Welfare Law**\nDonald Trump has appointed Brooke Rollins as the new US Secretary of Agriculture. During a hearing in the US Senate on January 23, Rollins stated that she will work to repeal a law in California that imposes stricter animal welfare requirements, particularly in pig production. The law, known as Proposition 12, has been controversial among pig farmers. Rollins said, 'I am a strong supporter of federalism, which means that states have the right to self-determination. However, in this specific case, it is clear that it is not just about California, but also about other states and parts of the agricultural industry, including family farms with pigs. Iowa, as well as many other states, have been severely affected by this. Yes, I would like to cooperate with you on this, and I look forward to it.' The law, which was passed in 2018, requires a minimum of 2.2 square meters per pregnant sow, which is more than twice the current standard. The law has caused significant discontent among American pig producer associations. However, with a 5-4 majority, the US Supreme Court approved California's Higher Animal Welfare Act in 2023, which was then implemented. The law not only affects pig producers in California but also producers from other states who want to sell to California must comply with the requirements.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 12:20 PM\nSource:[bondebladet.no](https:\/\/www.bondebladet.no\/kontroversiell-dyrevelferdslov-i-california-kan-bli-skrotet-med-donald-trumps-foretrukne-landbruks-og-matminister\/s\/5-150-101502)\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is 2025-05-13\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100"

        "0":"(a) Time left: Approximately 7.5 months until the outcome is known (May 13, 2025 to January 1, 2026)\n(b) Status quo outcome: No All-Star from NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL has been banned or suspended for sports betting\n(c) No outcome scenario: All-Star players continue to be more cautious than average players due to their higher profiles and greater financial incentives to follow rules, resulting in no violations through the end of 2025\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: An All-Star player inadvertently violates betting rules (perhaps betting from a team facility) or deliberately participates in a betting scheme, leading to a suspension before 2026\n\nAs a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the likelihood of an All-Star from one of the major sports leagues being suspended for gambling violations before 2026.\n\n## Historical Context and Current Environment\n\nSports betting has experienced dramatic growth since its broad legalization in 2018. The search results show numerous gambling-related suspensions have occurred across major sports leagues, particularly in the NFL. For instance, in 2022, Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley was suspended for the entire season for betting on NFL games[2][4]. Since 2022, at least eleven NFL players have faced gambling-related suspensions.\n\nThe leagues maintain strict gambling policies:\n- NFL players can bet on non-NFL events through legal sportsbooks but cannot place bets from team facilities or when traveling with the team[4]\n- The NBA, MLB, and NHL allow players to bet on other sports without restriction, as long as it's through regulated channels in legal states[5]\n\nNotably, however, no All-Stars have been suspended for gambling violations as of December 2024.\n\n## Risk Factors and Considerations\n\nSeveral factors increase the risk of an All-Star being suspended:\n\n1. **Increased Accessibility**: Sports betting is now legal in 38 states as of March 2024, making it easily accessible through mobile apps[4]\n\n2. **High Detection Capability**: Leagues have sophisticated monitoring systems in partnership with sportsbooks to detect unusual betting patterns[2][4]\n\n3. **Large Pool of Potential Violators**: The question encompasses all past All-Stars from four major sports leagues who are still active players, representing hundreds of individuals\n\n4. **Recent Precedents**: We've seen high-profile cases like MLB umpire Pat Hoberg's suspension for allegedly sharing a betting account with a poker player, showing leagues are actively enforcing policies\n\nHowever, several factors decrease the likelihood:\n\n1. **Status Quo Persistence**: Despite increased betting availability, no All-Star has been caught violating betting rules so far, suggesting they may be more cautious\n\n2. **Risk Asymmetry**: All-Stars have more to lose financially and reputationally from violations than average players\n\n3. **Awareness**: High-profile athletes likely receive additional education about gambling policies and may have financial advisors helping them avoid violations\n\n4. **Time Constraint**: The question only covers approximately 7.5 months, limiting the window for a violation to occur\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nThe search results show several relevant recent developments:\n\n- The NCAA is considering lifting its ban on professional sports betting while maintaining the ban on college sports betting[3]\n- The NFL has revised its gambling policy to create clearer distinctions between different types of violations[4]\n- MLB recently suspended Braves player Jurickson Profar for 80 games, though for PED use rather than gambling\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nGiven the historical data and current environment, I must consider both the base rate (no All-Star suspensions so far) and the increased risk factors. The status quo suggests a less than 50% probability, but the question's 7.5-month timeframe, the large pool of potential violators, and the heightened enforcement environment create meaningful risk.\n\nConsidering the status quo deserves significant weight\u2014the world changes slowly most of the time\u2014but we must account for the clear trend of increasing gambling violations across sports.\n\nProbability: 25%",
        "1":"Based on the search results and the current date (May 13, 2025), I'll provide a professional forecasting assessment regarding formal negotiations between the United States and Denmark over Greenland's sovereignty.\n\n(a) Time left until outcome is known: approximately 7.5 months (until January 1, 2026)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: No formal negotiations announced between the US and Denmark regarding transfer of Greenland's sovereignty\n\n(c) Scenario resulting in No outcome: Denmark and Greenland continue to firmly reject US overtures; US pursues alternative approaches like military repositioning or free association agreements without formal sovereignty negotiations; tensions remain but diplomatic channels focus on Arctic cooperation rather than territorial transfer\n\n(d) Scenario resulting in Yes outcome: Economic or geopolitical pressure from the US becomes overwhelming; Denmark agrees to formal talks to defuse tensions; Greenland's independence movement gains momentum and pushes for formal three-way negotiations as a path to sovereignty that includes US recognition\n\n## Current Situation Assessment\n\nThe evidence indicates strong opposition from both Denmark and Greenland to any sovereignty transfer to the United States. Recent developments from January through May 2025 show escalating tensions rather than movement toward formal negotiations:\n\n- Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has consistently emphasized that \"Greenland is not for sale\" and has characterized US approaches as \"unacceptable pressure\" and \"not respectful\"[3]\n\n- Greenland's leaders across all political parties issued a joint statement after their March 2025 election describing US annexation statements as \"unacceptable\"[3]\n\n- Public sentiment in Greenland remains firmly against US control, with 85% of Greenlanders opposing becoming part of the United States according to a January 2025 poll[3]\n\n- European Union leaders, including European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa, have expressed support for preserving Denmark's territorial integrity[3]\n\n## Recent US Approaches\n\nThe Trump administration has pursued several strategies regarding Greenland, but none have led to formal negotiation announcements:\n\n1. Economic pressure: Trump has threatened to impose \"very high\" tariffs on Denmark if it blocks US efforts to take control of Greenland[3]\n\n2. Military considerations: The US is reportedly considering transferring Greenland from European Command to Northern Command's jurisdiction, which Danish officials view with concern\n\n3. Free association proposals: The US has explored a \"Compact of Free Association\" (COFA) model as an alternative to direct sovereignty transfer, but this would still require Greenland's independence from Denmark first\n\n4. Intelligence activities: Reports indicate increased US intelligence operations in Greenland, causing diplomatic friction with Denmark\n\n## Key Factors Affecting Probability\n\n1. **Fundamental opposition**: Both Danish and Greenlandic governments remain firmly opposed to sovereignty transfer, with no signs of softening their stance[3][2]\n\n2. **Greenlandic independence movement**: While there is support for eventual independence from Denmark, Greenlandic leaders have explicitly rejected becoming part of the United States[3]\n\n3. **International pressure**: The European Union has backed Denmark's position, complicating any US attempt to isolate Denmark in negotiations[3]\n\n4. **Alternative US strategies**: The US appears to be exploring approaches that don't require formal sovereignty negotiations, such as military repositioning and association agreements\n\n## Probability Assessment\n\nThe status quo strongly suggests that formal negotiations are highly unlikely. For negotiations to be announced:\n\n1. Denmark would need to dramatically reverse its clear and consistent position\n2. Greenland would need to overcome overwhelming public opposition to US control\n3. The US would need to offer concessions attractive enough to overcome fundamental sovereignty concerns\n\nWhile the US continues to apply pressure through various means, there is no evidence that either Denmark or Greenland is moving toward accepting formal negotiations over sovereignty transfer. The evidence instead points to Denmark and Greenland strengthening their resistance, with Denmark increasing defense spending in Greenland and both parties receiving international support for their position.\n\nThe most probable outcome remains that no formal negotiations will be announced before January 1, 2026. Alternative US approaches (military repositioning, economic pressure, free association proposals) may continue or intensify, but these do not meet the criteria for a \"Yes\" outcome as defined in the question.\n\nProbability: 5%",
        "2":"(a) Time left until outcome: About 7 months (May 13, 2025 to December 31, 2025)\n(b) Status quo outcome: Neither Polymarket nor Manifold can legally offer real-money betting in the US\n(c) No outcome scenario: Continued state-level opposition blocks regulatory progress, with more states issuing cease-and-desist orders, and the CFTC maintains restrictive policies toward prediction markets not already approved\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: A favorable court ruling extends Kalshi's precedent to other platforms, or the CFTC issues a no-action letter specifically addressing Polymarket or Manifold, allowing real-money operations in at least one state\n\nThe landscape for prediction markets in the United States is currently in a state of significant flux. Based on the available information, I can provide a comprehensive assessment of whether Polymarket or Manifold will become legal for real-money betting in the US in 2025.\n\n## Current Regulatory Environment\n\nThe prediction market space has seen notable developments in recent years, particularly with Kalshi's legal victory against the CFTC in September 2024. This ruling allowed Kalshi to offer Congressional Control Contracts before the 2024 US elections, establishing an important precedent[1]. Following this victory, Kalshi expanded its offerings to include sports contracts in January 2025, indicating some regulatory flexibility at the federal level[1].\n\nHowever, significant challenges remain at the state level, with at least six states\u2014Illinois, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Ohio\u2014having issued cease and desist letters directing prediction markets to stop offering their services[2]. These state regulators argue that prediction market activities resemble unauthorized sports wagering, while operators maintain their operations are legally sound under federal oversight by the CFTC[4].\n\n## Recent Market Developments\n\nDespite regulatory challenges, prediction markets have demonstrated significant market potential:\n\n- Polymarket and Kalshi reportedly took in over $40 million in wagers on the papal conclave's outcome in May 2025\n- Polymarket has been active in tracking recession odds, with over $5 million wagered on US recession probability bets\n- The CFTC invited public comments on prediction markets offering sports contracts ahead of a roundtable discussion set for April 30, 2025, indicating ongoing regulatory consideration[5]\n\n## Path to Legalization\n\nFor real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold to become legal in the US in 2025, a specific change in law or government policy must occur. Several potential pathways exist:\n\n1. **Federal Court Rulings**: The ongoing case between KalshEx and CFTC could establish precedent favorable to prediction markets[1]\n\n2. **CFTC Regulatory Action**: The CFTC's planned prediction markets roundtable discussions may establish \"clear rules of the road and safeguards\" that could benefit platforms like Polymarket or Manifold[1]\n\n3. **State-Level Authorization**: Despite federal-level developments, state-specific authorization would still be needed for full legality\n\n## Factors Weighing Against Legalization\n\nSeveral significant obstacles remain:\n\n1. **Active State Opposition**: Multiple states have taken aggressive regulatory action against prediction markets, reflecting substantial regulatory resistance[2][4]\n\n2. **Unresolved Litigation**: The core case between KalshEx and CFTC remains unresolved as of early 2025[1]\n\n3. **Regulatory Classification Dispute**: Fundamental disagreement persists about whether prediction markets constitute gambling (state purview) or regulated commodity trading (federal purview)[4][5]\n\n4. **Global Regulatory Concerns**: Polymarket has faced increasing international scrutiny, with Singapore, Thailand, and France implementing restrictions or blocks\n\n## Forecasting the Outcome\n\nThe question requires a specific change in law or government policy for a \"Yes\" resolution. While there are positive signs in the evolving regulatory landscape, especially at the federal level, the persistent state-level opposition presents a significant barrier.\n\nThe most likely path to legalization would involve either:\n- A federal court ruling that explicitly extends to platforms like Polymarket or Manifold\n- A specific CFTC no-action letter addressing these platforms\n- Individual state legislation carving out exceptions\n\nGiven the status quo bias and the need for specific policy changes rather than just risk acceptance by the platforms, I must weigh the significant state-level resistance against the momentum created by Kalshi's precedent and the CFTC's apparent openness to dialogue.\n\nProbability: 30%",
        "3":"(a) Time until outcome: ~7.5 months (from May 13, 2025 to January 1, 2026)\n(b) Status quo outcome: Yes - Proposition 12 remains in effect\n(c) No scenario: The Food Security and Farm Protection Act passes Congress and is signed into law before January 2026, nullifying California's ability to enforce Proposition 12\n(d) Yes scenario: Legislative efforts to overturn Proposition 12 fail to pass Congress or are vetoed, allowing the law to remain fully in effect\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 12, the \"Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals Act,\" is currently a fully implemented law in the state. To forecast whether it will remain in effect on January 1, 2026, I need to evaluate the current status of the law, ongoing challenges, and potential pathways for change.\n\n## Current Status of Proposition 12\n\nProposition 12 became fully effective on January 1, 2024, following a significant legal challenge that reached the Supreme Court[1]. The law establishes the state's Animal Care Program and requires third-party certification for producers[1]. Under Proposition 12, all pork producers must be registered with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA)[1]. The law sets specific space requirements for farm animals and prohibits the sale of products in California from animals confined in non-compliant conditions, regardless of where they were raised[4].\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld Proposition 12's constitutionality in 2023, rejecting arguments that it violated the dormant Commerce Clause[3][5]. This ruling was significant, as the pork industry had pursued multiple legal challenges, ultimately losing 12 straight cases in federal courts[5]. The egg industry and veal industry have generally accepted and supported the standards, while the pork industry has remained opposed[5].\n\n## Current Challenges to the Law\n\nDespite being upheld by the Supreme Court, Proposition 12 faces significant legislative challenges:\n\n1. **Federal Legislative Efforts**: The Food Security and Farm Protection Act (S. 1326) has been introduced in the Senate, which would create a private right of action to invalidate state agricultural regulations that affect interstate commerce[1]. This bill specifically targets laws like Proposition 12.\n\n2. **Farm Bill Provisions**: House Republicans are attempting to include provisions in the Farm Bill that would prevent states from imposing production standards on products not physically raised in that state[1].\n\n3. **Political Support for Repeal**: Current USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has expressed concerns about \"chaos in the marketplace\" without federal action[1]. Additionally, Trump's nominee for Agriculture Secretary, Brooke Rollins, has explicitly stated she would work to repeal Proposition 12[1].\n\n## Market Impact and Industry Pressure\n\nImplementation of Proposition 12 has had significant economic effects:\n\n- Pork prices in California have reportedly increased substantially since implementation[1].\n- California's consumption of fresh pork has decreased from approximately 13% to 10% of U.S. production in just one year[1].\n- California produces only a tiny fraction of the nation's hogs while consuming about 10% of U.S. pork production[1].\n\nThese economic impacts create pressure from consumers and industry to reconsider or modify the law.\n\n## Factors Supporting Proposition 12's Continuation\n\nSeveral factors support Proposition 12 remaining in effect:\n\n1. **Current Legal Status**: The law has already survived significant legal challenges, including at the Supreme Court level[3][5].\n\n2. **Strong Public Support**: Proposition 12 was approved by 63% of California voters, indicating substantial public backing[5].\n\n3. **State Sovereignty Principles**: California has a history of defending its state laws against federal interference.\n\n4. **Implementation Progress**: The law is already fully implemented, with compliance systems in place[1].\n\n## Forecasting Analysis\n\nWhen forecasting, I need to consider both the status quo (Proposition 12 remaining in effect) and the pathways to change (federal legislation overriding it).\n\nThe most likely path to Proposition 12 being nullified would be through federal legislation like the Food Security and Farm Protection Act. For this to happen before January 1, 2026:\n\n1. The legislation would need to pass both houses of Congress\n2. It would need to be signed into law by the President\n3. It would need to withstand potential legal challenges\n\nGiven the relatively short timeframe (7.5 months), the complexities of the legislative process, and the fact that similar efforts have failed in the past, there are significant obstacles to this occurring. Federal legislation moves slowly, especially on contentious issues.\n\nHowever, there is clearly organized opposition to Proposition 12, with industry groups, some lawmakers, and even the USDA Secretary expressing concerns about its effects. The economic impacts are creating pressure for change.\n\nTaking into account the status quo bias (that laws, once implemented, tend to remain in effect), the Supreme Court's validation of the law, the challenges of passing federal legislation in a limited timeframe, but also recognizing the significant organized opposition, I believe Proposition 12 is more likely than not to remain in effect on January 1, 2026.\n\nProbability: 65%"
