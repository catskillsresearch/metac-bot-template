        "0":"According to [Bloomberg](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2024-03-28\/electric-cars-pass-adoption-tipping-point-in-31-countries?srnd=green), once 5% of new car sales are fully electric, it can be a pivotal tipping point, signaling the start of mass adoption of a new technology:\n\n> New technologies \u2014 from televisions to smartwatches \u2014 follow an S-shaped adoption curve. Sales move at a crawl during the early-adopter phase, before hooking into a wave of mainstream acceptance. The transition often hinges on overcoming initial barriers such as cost, a lack of infrastructure and consumer skepticism. The tipping point signals the flattening of these barriers. While each country\u2019s journey to 5% plays out differently, timelines converge in the years that follow.\n\n> \u201cOnce enough sales occur, you kind of have a virtuous cycle,\u201d said Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at BloombergNEF. \u201cMore EVs popping up means more people seeing them as mainstream, automakers more willing to invest in the market, and the charging infrastructure expanding on a good trajectory.\n\nMarket shares in other countries have been as follows:\n\n| Country     | EV sales in Q4 2023 | EV market shr Q4 '24 (%) | First quarter at 5% tipping point |\n| ----------- | ------------------: | -----------------------: | --------------------------------: |\n| Norway      |              25,028 |                     79.6 |                           2013 Q3 |\n| Iceland     |               3,507 |                     58.4 |                           2019 Q1 |\n| Denmark     |              21,890 |                     44.9 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| Sweden      |              31,780 |                     39.8 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| Finland     |               6,686 |                     35.3 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Netherlands |              29,199 |                     35.1 |                           2018 Q4 |\n| Ireland     |               1,164 |                     33.9 |                           2019 Q4 |\n| Belgium     |              25,752 |                     25.3 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Portugal    |              11,265 |                     24.3 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Switzerland |              16,581 |                     23.9 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| China       |           1,879,600 |                     23.8 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Austria     |              13,083 |                     23.3 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| Israel      |               6,772 |                     22.9 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| France      |              98,755 |                     20.3 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| New Zealand |               7,435 |                     20.0 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Germany     |             138,390 |                     19.6 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| UK          |              79,602 |                     17.6 |                           2020 Q2 |\n| Thailand    |              23,864 |                     12.6 |                           2023 Q1 |\n| Turkey      |              36,026 |                     12.0 |                           2023 Q3 |\n| Romania     |               3,655 |                     10.8 |                           2021 Q4 |\n| Slovenia    |               1,126 |                     10.7 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| Australia   |              21,571 |                      9.5 |                           2022 Q3 |\n| Canada      |              38,160 |                      9.4 |                           2022 Q1 |\n| Spain       |              20,666 |                      8.7 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| US          |             313,822 |                      8.1 |                           2021 Q4 |\n| Estonia     |                 400 |                      7.5 |                           2023 Q2 |\n| South Korea |              36,009 |                      6.9 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Hungary     |               1,614 |                      6.5 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| Bulgaria    |                 551 |                      5.8 |                           2023 Q4 |\n| Italy       |              21,033 |                      5.4 |                           2023 Q4 |\n| Greece      |               1,579 |                      5.3 |                           2023 Q2 |\n\nArgonne National Laboratory tracks monthly electric vehicle sales figures in its [Light Duty Electric Drive Vehicles Monthly Sales Updates](https:\/\/www.anl.gov\/esia\/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates).\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

        "2":"Progress in artificial intelligence has surged in recent years with generative AI tool adoption [surging in the corporate world](https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/capabilities\/quantumblack\/our-insights\/the-state-of-ai), and use by a significant portion of the US public for [writing](https:\/\/today.yougov.com\/topics\/technology\/survey-results\/daily\/2024\/08\/08\/c472d\/1) and for [help in making decisions](https:\/\/today.yougov.com\/topics\/technology\/survey-results\/daily\/2024\/11\/21\/b9187\/1).\n\nThe rapid AI development has raised questions about the potential of achieving [artificial general intelligence](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_general_intelligence) (AGI). Definitions of AGI vary, but in general most definitions align with the interpretation of an AI system operating at or above human level in a broad range of tasks. A number of thinkers have [expressed concern](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence) about risks to humanity posed by the development of AGI and a majority of Americans described their feelings about advances in AI development as \"cautious\" in a [March 2024 survey](https:\/\/today.yougov.com\/technology\/articles\/49099-americans-2024-poll-ai-top-feeling-caution). However, some top AI labs have explicitly targeted AGI development as a goal they are pursuing, including [OpenAI](https:\/\/openai.com\/index\/planning-for-agi-and-beyond\/), [DeepMind](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/23778745\/demis-hassabis-google-deepmind-ai-alphafold-risks), and [Meta](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/1\/18\/24042354\/mark-zuckerberg-meta-agi-reorg-interview).\n\nThere is much uncertainty and [disagreement](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2024\/12\/9\/24316969\/mustafa-suleyman-sam-altman-microsoft-openai-agi) about when AGI will be achieved, in part because of the varying definitions. While fuzzy definitions might make it difficult to clearly discern when AGI has arrived (for example, see a [recent claim](https:\/\/www.windowscentral.com\/software-apps\/we-have-already-achieved-agi-openai-employee-claims) from December 2024 that AGI has already been achieved) one metric that may be clearer is when a leading AI lab will first publicly claim to have developed AGI.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

        "2":"* A lab will be considered to have claimed to have created AGI if the company or an official representative states publicly that the company considers an AI system they have created to be artificial general intelligence. An official representative must be clearly speaking on behalf of the company.\n* A public claim or statement of opinion by lab leadership that they have developed an AI system that they consider to be AGI will also be sufficient to resolve the question as **Yes**. Lab leadership will be considered to be the chief executive of each organization, or equivalent, or their nearest equivalent successor in the event they depart the company or eliminate the CEO position. If an organization is structured such that its AI lab is part of a larger organization and the AI lab has a clear chief executive, in most cases we will count both the chief executive of the organization and the chief executive of its AI lab. As of December 19, 2024, this is the comprehensive list of qualifying leadership:\n  * OpenAI: CEO Sam Altman\n  * Anthropic: CEO Dario Amodei\n  * Google and DeepMind: CEO Sundar Pichai and CEO Demis Hassabis\n  * Microsoft and Microsoft AI: CEO Satya Nadella and CEO Mustafa Suleyman\n  * NVIDIA: CEO Jensen Huang\n  * xAI: CEO Elon Musk\n  * Meta: CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n  * Mistral: CEO Arthur Mensch\n  * Databricks: CEO Ali Ghodsi\n  * World Labs: CEO Fei-Fei Li\n  * Safe Superintelligence: CEO Daniel Gross\n  * Hugging Face: CEO Clem Delangue\n  * Scale AI: CEO Alexandr Wang\n  * Magic.dev: CEO Eric Steinberger\n  * Amazon: CEO Andy Jassy\n  * Apple: CEO Tim Cook\n  * Netflix: Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters\n  * IBM: CEO Arvind Krishna&#x20;\n* A statement will generally qualify if it represents a claim, position, or opinion of the organization or top leadership. For example, a CEO stating their belief that the organization has created AGI would resolve the question as **Yes**, including in informal settings such as podcast appearances, interviews, or X.com. Statements that do not clearly attribute a position to the organization or CEO are not sufficient. For example, if a CEO were to say \"I think that the AI system we have developed would satisfy some definitions of AGI\" that would **not** be sufficient, because it does not clearly state a belief in having developed AGI under a definition they hold, only that they believe it satisfies definitions of AGI that others hold.\n* There are no requirements on the AI system that is referred to as AGI, there need not be public details, access, or announcements about such a system. However, a statement must refer to a system that the lab claims it has developed. A statement such as \"We are currently developing AGI\" or \"We are currently training AGI\" is not sufficient. Claims will generally be taken at face value, for example a claim that AGI has been developed will be sufficient, even if there is evidence to the contrary indicating that the system has not been completed.\n* Metaculus will assess potentially qualifying statements and reporting and make a determination as to whether the criteria were satisfied.

Key Historical Trends and Current Status**\n\n- In Q1 2025, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for approximately 7.5% of new light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S., up from 7% in Q1 2024[1][3].\n- U.S. BEV sales volume remains on an upward trajectory, growing 11.4% year over year in Q1 2025, though market share gains have been modest as overall new vehicle sales also rise[1][3].\n- The U.S. reached the 5% \u201ctipping point\u201d for BEV share in Q4 2021. Historically, many international markets have crossed from 5% to above 10% BEV share within two to four years[1].\n\n**2. Recent Announcements and Policy Environment**\n\n- Major automakers such as GM, Honda, and Stellantis are launching new BEV models, with GM nearly doubling its EV volume year over year in Q1 2025[1][2].\n- The U.S. market is seeing a surge in hybrid sales as well, which may compete with BEVs for eco-conscious buyers and moderate BEV share gains[2].\n- While federal and some state incentives remain, there have been no recent national-level policy changes likely to cause a sharp, near-term spike in BEV share.\n\n**3. Authoritative Data Sources**\n\n- Argonne National Laboratory\u2019s Light Duty Electric Drive Vehicles Monthly Sales Updates is the definitive source for monthly BEV and total LDV sales and will be used for official question resolution.\n- Industry data from Kelley Blue Book and Cox Automotive supplements Argonne\u2019s reporting[1][2][3].\n\n**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**\n\n- Measurement depends on Argonne\u2019s reporting cadence and industry definitions.\n- If overall new vehicle sales surge, BEV share could stagnate despite rising BEV volume.\n- The pace of BEV adoption could accelerate if a new, popular mass-market model launches or if policy incentives change, but current evidence suggests steady, not explosive, growth.\n\n**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**\n\nGiven the current trajectory\u20147.5% BEV share in Q1 2025, historical annual gains of about 0.5\u20131 percentage point, and no major accelerants visible\u2014the probability that BEVs will make up more than 10% of U.S. new light-duty vehicle sales in any month before October 2025 appears below 50%. A reasonable forecast would place the likelihood in the 25\u201340% range, barring an unexpected surge in BEV demand or supportive policy changes before fall 2025.\n\n## References\n\n[1].

        "1":"# FC Barcelona Femen\u00ed's 2024\/25 Season Outlook as of February 2025\n\nAs of February 27, 2025, FC Barcelona Femen\u00ed is in the midst of their 2024-25 campaign, competing in multiple competitions including Liga F (Spanish domestic league) and the UEFA Women's Champions League. This analysis examines their prospects for winning both major titles based on available information.\n\n## Current Status in Liga F\n\nBarcelona entered the 2024-25 season as the defending Liga F champions and has maintained their dominant position in the Spanish league. Their impressive attacking prowess is evident from multiple high-scoring victories, including a 10-1 win against Granada and a 9-0 away victory against Real Betis[1][4]. \n\nThe team's offensive strength is largely driven by striker Ewa Pajor, who has been in exceptional form this season[1]. As the campaign progresses, Barcelona continues to demonstrate their superiority in the domestic competition, though they have suffered at least one surprising domestic defeat, losing 3-1 to Real Madrid[1].\n\n## Champions League Campaign\n\nIn the 2024-25 UEFA Women's Champions League, Barcelona began as the defending champions and has shown strong performances in the competition. Their group stage included a dominant 9-0 victory over Hammarby, demonstrating their attacking capabilities on the European stage[1][4].\n\nHowever, Barcelona has faced more significant challenges in European competition, including a 2-0 defeat to Manchester City in what appears to be a crucial Champions League match[1]. This suggests that while Barcelona remains one of the favorites, they face strong competition from other elite European clubs.\n\n## Key Factors Affecting Title Prospects\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. **Scoring power**: Barcelona's attack has been formidable, regularly scoring multiple goals in matches across competitions[1][4].\n2. **Championship experience**: As defending champions in both competitions, the team has proven their ability to handle pressure in crucial matches[1].\n3. **Home support**: Barcelona has enjoyed strong home attendance, particularly for key matches, with over 35,000 fans attending their match against Real Madrid[1].\n\n### Challenges\n\n1. **European competition**: The defeat to Manchester City highlights the increased difficulty of winning the Champions League compared to domestic competitions[1].\n2. **Defensive vulnerabilities**: Despite their offensive strength, Barcelona has conceded multiple goals in some matches, suggesting potential defensive weaknesses[1][4].\n3. **Fixture congestion**: Competing in five tournaments (Liga F, Copa de la Reina, Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, UEFA Champions League, and Copa Catalunya) could lead to fatigue as the season progresses[1].\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on information available as of February 27, 2025, Barcelona remains the favorite to win Liga F, given their historical dominance and strong performances this season. Their position in the league table (though specific details are not available for the February timeframe) likely shows them with a substantial lead over competitors.\n\nFor the Champions League, the assessment is more nuanced. While Barcelona entered as defending champions with a strong squad, the competition from teams like Manchester City and potentially Chelsea presents significant challenges. The knockout stage results up to February 27 would be crucial in determining their prospects.\n\nGiven Barcelona's status as one of the elite women's football clubs and their recent history of success, they would have a good but not certain chance of achieving the double. Their domestic title appears more secure than their European prospects based on the information available.\n\n## Measurement Limitations\n\nSeveral factors limit this assessment:\n\n1. The specific league standings as of February 27, 2025, are not provided in the search results.\n2. The exact stage of the Champions League reached by February 27 is not explicitly stated.\n3. Detailed information about injuries, team form, and remaining fixtures as of February 27 is limited.\n\nBarcelona's pursuit of both titles will likely be determined by their performance in key matches against direct competitors in Liga F and their ability to overcome the European elite in the Champions League knockout stages.",
        "2":"## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Generative AI adoption and research progress have surged since 2022, with labs like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Meta explicitly targeting AGI as a research goal[5][3].\n- No major AI lab has yet made a formal, top-leadership claim of AGI as defined by the resolution criteria.\n- Surveys of AI experts show wide disagreement: while a majority (76%) believe AGI is \"unlikely\" to result from simply scaling current methods, a substantial minority and some prominent lab leaders predict AGI could arrive as early as 2025\u20132028[2][4].\n- Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) publicly stated in late 2024 that AGI is now \"just an engineering problem\" and could be achieved in 2025, reflecting increasing confidence among some leaders[5].\n- Technical progress in large language models, autonomous agents, and robotics fuels the perception of rapid approach to AGI, but as of late 2024, these systems still lack general human-level flexibility and autonomy[4].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta, and xAI have all publicly discussed AGI timelines, with some leaders (Altman, Musk) suggesting 2025\u20132028 as plausible dates[2][5].\n- There have been isolated claims from employees or outside commentators that AGI has been achieved, but none from qualifying lab leaders or in the requisite formal capacity as of December 2024[2].\n- No significant new regulations or standards have been set requiring labs to announce AGI, but growing societal and governmental scrutiny may influence lab communication strategies.\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Leadership interviews (e.g., Altman interview, Y Combinator[5])\n- Industry surveys and meta-analyses of AGI predictions[2][4]\n- Public statements and official blogs from major labs (OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta)\n- Media reports on AI industry milestones and claims[1][3]\n\n## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement\n\n- **Definition ambiguity:** AGI remains a contested and fuzzy concept; what constitutes a \"claim\" depends on interpretation and context[5].\n- **Incentives and caution:** Labs may hesitate to make official AGI claims due to reputational, regulatory, or commercial concerns.\n- **Survey uncertainty:** Expert timelines vary widely; while confidence in near-term AGI is rising, most still expect it later (post-2030)[2][4].\n- **Benchmarking:** No universally accepted test for AGI exists, making claims subject to debate even if made.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- The probability that a major AI lab will claim to have developed AGI in 2025 is **substantially higher than in previous years**, likely in the range of 10\u201330% given current trends and recent leadership rhetoric, but **most experts still expect formal AGI claims to occur later**, unless there is a strategic or competitive incentive for a lab to make such a declaration[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1].

        "3":"# Forecasting Analysis: Will President Trump Invoke the Insurrection Act Before 2026?\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, several factors suggest an increased probability that President Trump may formally invoke the Insurrection Act before 2026. This analysis examines the current situation, key indicators, and provides a probabilistic assessment.\n\n## Current Status and Recent Developments\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the United States, claiming \"America's sovereignty is under attack.\"[3] This executive order directed the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit reports within 90 days (by April 20, 2025) that include recommendations on whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.[2][3]\n\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807 gives the president authority to deploy the National Guard or federal armed forces to address \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States.\"[2] This represents a significant potential escalation in the administration's approach to border security and immigration enforcement.\n\n## Comparative Analysis and Key Indicators\n\n### Historical Precedent and Legal Framework\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been invoked relatively rarely in American history. While the Act provides broad authority, it exists in tension with the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prevents the federal military from acting as a police force unless explicitly authorized by Congress or the Constitution.[2]\n\n### Administration Signals and Rhetoric\n\nSeveral indicators suggest an elevated probability of invocation:\n\n1. **Direct Consideration in Executive Order**: The explicit mention of the Insurrection Act in the January 20 executive order demonstrates that invoking the Act is under active consideration at the highest levels of the administration.[2][3]\n\n2. **National Emergency Declaration**: The declaration of a national emergency at the southern border creates a framework that could be used to justify more extreme measures.[3]\n\n3. **Cabinet-Level Assessment**: The assignment of this assessment to the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security indicates serious consideration rather than merely rhetorical posturing.[2]\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the information available as of January 31, 2025, I assess the probability of President Trump formally invoking the Insurrection Act before January 1, 2026, as follows:\n\n**Probability: 55-65%**\n\nThis assessment is based on:\n\n- The explicit consideration of the Insurrection Act in official executive actions\n- The administration's characterization of the situation at the southern border as a crisis requiring extraordinary measures\n- The formal process established to evaluate invoking the Act\n- The administration's demonstrated willingness to use executive authority expansively\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nThis forecast faces several key uncertainties:\n\n1. **Cabinet Recommendations**: The content of the recommendations from the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, due April 20, 2025, will significantly influence the likelihood of invocation.\n\n2. **Evolving Border Situation**: Changes in migration patterns or border security incidents could substantially shift the administration's calculus.\n\n3. **Legal and Political Resistance**: Potential legal challenges or political opposition could affect the administration's decision-making.\n\n4. **Alternative Policy Approaches**: The administration may find other policy mechanisms to achieve similar objectives without formally invoking the Insurrection Act.\n\nThis forecast should be updated as new information becomes available, particularly after the submission of the cabinet-level recommendations in April 2025."

According to recent data, the majority of new cars registered in Europe now use alternative propulsion methods, including hybrids. The dominance of pure combustion engines is broken. However, the cost of EVs is still around 20% higher than comparable combustion engines, which is why many governments offer incentives to encourage their purchase. In some European countries, such as Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Portugal, the market share of EVs is growing rapidly, with over 50% of new cars registered in these countries being electric. These countries offer generous incentives, including tax breaks and subsidies, to encourage the adoption of EVs. In contrast, Tesla, a manufacturer that only produces EVs, has seen a significant decline in sales, with a 37% drop in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. However, the data for the first quarter of 2025 shows that the number of EVs registered in Europe is growing, with a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This growth is particularly pronounced in countries that have previously been slow to adopt EVs, such as Germany and Italy. 'The prospects for EVs in 2025 have brightened,' said a spokesperson for the International Energy Agency.

Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, said, 'The challenge is consumers are more price-sensitive than they typically have been and are looking for lower-price alternatives.' In contrast, sales of traditional gas-powered vehicles rose 10% in April. Dealers reported growing inventories of unsold EVs, reflecting slower consumer uptake following years of high demand.

This highlights the significant technological progress made by China in this field, despite the technological challenges imposed by the US decisions to ban China from obtaining advanced semiconductor chips, as well as the protectionist measures that coincide with the trade war led by US President Donald Trump. China's production of electric vehicles has led to its dominance of the global market, with a 60% market share, surpassing Europe and the US combined. The Chinese company BYD has led the charge in the electric vehicle industry, with a significant increase in sales, reaching 4.27 million electric and hybrid vehicles. Other Chinese companies, such as Li Auto and Leapmotor, have also seen significant increases in sales. However, some well-known brands, such as Nio and Xpeng, have failed to meet their targets despite a significant increase in demand at the end of the year. A recent report by Bloomberg highlighted that countries that are more open to Chinese companies entering their markets have seen higher rates of adoption of electric vehicles compared to countries that impose strict tariffs. The report also noted that the competition from Chinese companies has forced Western companies to improve their offers and launch more competitive electric vehicle models. The adoption of electric vehicles in emerging markets has begun to surpass that of developed countries, with Thailand now surpassing the US in the percentage of electric vehicle adoption, and Brazil advancing ahead of Japan in this regard. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 05:14 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629](https:\/\/alroya.om\/post\/365479\/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC-10-%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9)\n\n**Is Lucid Group (LCID) the High Growth EV Stock to Invest In?**\nThe electric vehicle (EV) market is facing challenges despite growth.

Mickey Anderson, a dealership chain owner, said, 'I think the natural demand is probably half that,' referring to past EV demand artificially inflated by discounts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 08:33 PM\nSource:[WND](https:\/\/www.wnd.com\/2025\/05\/zapped-electric-vehicle-sales-nosedive-as-republicans-take-buzzsaw-to-biden-mandate\/)\n\n**China Leads the Electric Vehicle Market with 10 Million Cars Produced in 2024**\nChina has maintained its dominance in the electric vehicle market, producing 10 million cars in 2024 alone, with expectations of a significant increase in this number during the current year 2025. This highlights the significant technological progress made by China in this field, despite the technological challenges imposed by the US decisions to ban China from obtaining advanced semiconductor chips, as well as the protectionist measures that coincide with the trade war led by US President Donald Trump. China's production of electric vehicles has led to its dominance of the global market, with a 60% market share, surpassing Europe and the US combined. The Chinese company BYD has led the charge in the electric vehicle industry, with a significant increase in sales, reaching 4.27 million electric and hybrid vehicles. Other Chinese companies, such as Li Auto and Leapmotor, have also seen significant increases in sales. However, some well-known brands, such as Nio and Xpeng, have failed to meet their targets despite a significant increase in demand at the end of the year. A recent report by Bloomberg highlighted that countries that are more open to Chinese companies entering their markets have seen higher rates of adoption of electric vehicles compared to countries that impose strict tariffs. The report also noted that the competition from Chinese companies has forced Western companies to improve their offers and launch more competitive electric vehicle models. The adoption of electric vehicles in emerging markets has begun to surpass that of developed countries, with Thailand now surpassing the US in the percentage of electric vehicle adoption, and Brazil advancing ahead of Japan in this regard. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 05:14 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629](https:\/\/alroya.om\/post\/365479\/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC-10-%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9)\n\n**US Automotive Market Shows Resilience in First Quarter of 2025**\nThe US automotive sector has maintained its dynamism in the first quarter of 2025, despite the political issues surrounding the economy. According to the sales figures for new cars from January to April, there is a general growth trend, although with important nuances that need to be analyzed. In the first four months, a total of 5,386,547 units were sold, representing a 5.3% increase compared to the same period last year, when 5,116,523 vehicles were sold. The growth in April was particularly notable, with 1,465,356 new vehicles sold, a 10.0% increase compared to the same month last year. This increase is attributed to a combination of factors, including a growing demand from consumers, who are concerned about potential price increases in the near future and a decrease in inventory levels. The imposition of a 25% tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the US on April 3 has also contributed to the trend. The uncertainty caused by this tariff has led to a surge in sales, with many consumers opting to buy now rather than later. The trend is expected to continue, with the sales of light trucks (including pickups and SUVs) increasing by 15.2% in April and 8.3% in the first four months. In contrast, traditional passenger cars continue to lose ground, with sales falling by 9.7% in April and 6.1% in the first four months. General Motors experienced a notable increase of 19.6%, while Ford grew by 13.3%, thanks in part to its incentive program that extended price discounts to the general public. Stellantis also saw an increase of 3.9% after adopting similar incentives. Tesla, on the other hand, suffered a significant decline of 19.6%, indicating that the brand continues to face a shift in consumer preference both in the US and Europe. Toyota saw an increase of 10.2% in April, driven by its electrified vehicles, while Lexus achieved its best April sales ever. Honda also had a strong month, with an increase of 18.1%, supported by the good sales of its electrified models and the Acura brand, which also set a record for April. Nissan reported a slight decline of 2.4%, while Subaru maintained its positive trend for 33 consecutive months with a discreet increase of 0.3%. Mazda celebrated a growth of 21.0%, adding 12 months of increases, and Mitsubishi advanced by 7.5%. Hyundai and Kia continued their winning streak, with increases of 18.5% and 13.8% respectively in April. The strength of their hybrid and electric vehicles remains a fundamental pillar, leading to both companies registering record monthly sales for the seventh consecutive month. Even their luxury brand, Genesis, set a new record for sales in April. Finally, European brands had a mixed performance in April: Volkswagen decreased by 14.2%, Mercedes-Benz grew by a slight 1.2%, BMW stood out with an increase of 16.1%, Audi fell by 3.7%, and Volvo experienced a healthy growth of 22.6%. In general, the US automotive market in the first four months of 2025 shows a notable resilience, although clearly influenced by external factors such as trade policies and consumer response to these.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 06, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[as](https:\/\/us.as.com\/autos\/actualidad\/a-que-se-debe-el-fuerte-aumento-en-ventas-de-autos-en-ee-uu-en-2025\/)\n\n**US Electric Vehicle Sales See 10.6% Growth in Q1 2025**\nIn the US, 294,250 electric vehicles were sold in the first quarter of 2025, a 10.6% increase from the same period in 2024. According to the Kelley Blue Book EV Sales Report, pure electric vehicles accounted for 7.5% of total sales in the US, up from 7% in the same period last year. The report notes that General Motors is driving electric vehicle growth, while Tesla's sales are declining. The authors of the report highlight that the latest numbers show uneven growth, with new models from Acura, Audi, Chevrolet, Honda, and Porsche contributing to higher sales, while established products are experiencing a decline. The report also notes that the market is becoming increasingly competitive, with more options available to customers. Looking ahead to the rest of 2025, the authors predict that the electric vehicle market in the US will be uncertain, despite the introduction of new products and incentives. They cite the potential impact of new auto tariffs, which could be a significant challenge for many automakers, as well as the ongoing trade war with China, which is a major supplier of battery materials for electric vehicles. Additionally, the report notes that there are speculations that the new government may reverse the electric vehicle incentives introduced during the Biden era.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: April 11, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[electrive.net](https:\/\/www.electrive.net\/2025\/04\/11\/q1-zahlen-e-auto-geschaeft-in-den-usa-zieht-um-10-prozent-an\/)\n\n**US grids must harness electric vehicle growth to tackle load risks**\nThe rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) in the US is expected to significantly impact the country's electricity demand, with estimates suggesting that EVs will add between 100 and 185 terawatt-hours (TWh) to US electricity demand by 2030. Experts predict that EV adoption will be driven by manufacturers introducing more affordable EVs to the public, with EVs expected to make up 30% of all US light-duty vehicle sales by 2030 and 60% by 2040. To mitigate the strain on the grid, grid operators are exploring new grid management measures, including managed and flexible EV charging, which can reduce the strain on the grid and improve grid reliability. According to Jaron Weston, manager of the California Energy Commission's Zero Emission Vehicle Acceleration Branch, 'Through vehicle-to-grid integration, electric vehicles represent substantially more potential for grid benefits than any other distributed resource.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[Reuters](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/energy\/us-grids-must-harness-electric-vehicle-growth-tackle-load-risks-2025-03-18\/)\n\n**Despite everything, US EV sales are up 28% this year**\nDespite announcements from automakers planning for more gasoline and hybrid cars, global EV sales are up 30% this year, with the US seeing a 28% increase. Analysts at Rho Motion attribute the growth to American drivers taking advantage of the final months of IRA tax breaks before they are expected to be pulled later this year. Charles Lester, Rho Motion data manager, said, 'American drivers bought 30 percent more electric vehicles than they had by this time last year, making use of the final months of IRA tax breaks before the incentives are expected to be pulled later this year.' The European Union saw a 29% growth, while Germany and the UK saw a 40% increase. China led the way with a 35% growth, and a 73% increase year over year due to the lunar new year falling in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 12, 2025 12:01 AM\nSource:[Ars Technica](https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/cars\/2025\/03\/despite-everything-us-ev-sales-are-up-28-this-year\/)\n\n**Electric Vehicles Are Taking Over: Discover the Surprising Stats You Need to Know**\nElectric vehicles (EVs) made up approximately 20% of global light-duty vehicle sales in 2024, totaling 17.1 million units. Annual EV sales are projected to exceed 60 million by the mid-2030s. Government incentives, technological advancements, and affordability are driving the shift towards EVs. China is anticipated to have about 75% of its vehicle sales as electric by 2030. Next-gen solid-state batteries are set to enhance EV performance with faster charging and extended range. The demand for minerals like lithium and copper is expected to surge significantly, indicating a growing supply chain focus. As the EV market continues to grow, manufacturers like Ford and Kia are launching BEV models targeted at lower price points, making electric vehicles more accessible to the masses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[lanoticiadigital.com.ar](https:\/\/lanoticiadigital.com.ar\/news-en\/electric-vehicles-are-taking-over-discover-the-surprising-stats-you-need-to-know\/121398\/)\n\n**Every Fourth Car Sold in the US in 2025 Will Be Electric, Predicts Cox Automotive**\nAccording to Cox Automotive analysts, 2025 will be the strongest year for the automotive industry since the pandemic, with every fourth car sold in the US being electric. This prediction is based on a study of 2557 car buyers and 526 dealers in the US. The study found that, excluding Stellantis and Tesla, almost all car manufacturers reported an increase in sales in 2024, with General Motors, Honda, and Mazda showing significant growth. The number of people considering buying a used electric car has also increased, from 62% in 2021 to 77% in 2024. Electric vehicles made up 7.5% of the market in 2024, but are expected to reach 10% in 2025. Meanwhile, sales of internal combustion engine cars are expected to decline to a record low of 75%, with 15% of the market going to pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In 2025, 15 new electric car models are expected to be released, and most buyers will try to purchase them before the new US administration's tax credit of $7500 is reduced. While the lack of charging infrastructure is currently a major obstacle to the development of the electric car market, 86% of dealers have pledged to continue investing in this area in 2025, which should help alleviate the problem. Additionally, electric cars are expected to become more accessible, with increased availability of credit and a potential decrease in interest rates if the economy stabilizes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 07:08 PM\nSource:[zerkalo.az](https:\/\/zerkalo.az\/v-2025-godu-kazhdyj-chetvyortyj-prodannyj-v-ssha-avtomobil-budet-elektricheskim\/)\n\n**US New Energy Vehicle Sales Reach 20% of Total Market for First Time**\nFor the first time, new energy vehicles in the US accounted for 20% of the total sales of new cars and trucks in 2024. This milestone marks significant progress for 'green' vehicles in the US market, although the growth rate is slower than many had expected. According to Motor Intelligence, over 3.2 million new energy vehicles were sold in the US in 2024, including 1.9 million hybrid vehicles and 1.3 million electric vehicles. Meanwhile, traditional gasoline-powered car sales fell below 80% for the first time, dropping to 79.8%, a new low in modern automotive history. In the electric vehicle market, Tesla continues to lead, but its market share has declined slightly. According to Cox Automotive, Tesla's sales declined in 2024, with its market share falling from 55% in 2023 to around 49%. However, Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 remained the best-selling electric vehicles in 2024. The top five electric vehicle manufacturers are Tesla, Hyundai Motor Group (including Kia), General Motors, Ford Motor, and BMW, with market shares of 49%, 9.3%, 8.7%, 7.5%, and 4.1%, respectively. These brands continue to compete fiercely in the market, driving the diversification of the electric vehicle market. The US electric vehicle market is highly competitive, with varying performances from different brands. According to Kelley Blue Book, 24 out of 68 mainstream electric vehicle models tracked by Cox saw year-over-year sales growth, 17 were new launches, and 27 saw sales declines. Looking ahead, Cox Automotive predicts that US electric vehicle sales will reach a new high in 2025, accounting for around 10% of new car sales. If hybrid vehicles are included, it is estimated that one in four new cars sold will be a new energy vehicle. However, analysis suggests that potential policy changes from the Trump administration could impact new energy vehicle sales. Currently, consumers who purchase electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles can enjoy a federal tax credit of up to $7,500. However, Trump may cancel this subsidy and other support policies for electric vehicles.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 12:48 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https:\/\/k.sina.com.cn\/article_7096020371_1a6f4ad9301901giwo.html)\n\n**Electric Vehicles Account for 20% of US Car Sales in 2024**\nAccording to Motor Intelligence, 1.3 million electric vehicles were sold in the US in 2024, accounting for 20% of total new car sales.

This is up from 13.4% in the second quarter and 12.5% at the start of the year. Experts attribute this growth to Canada's more favorable policies and incentives for EVs, as well as a more pragmatic approach to adoption. In contrast, the US has seen stalling EV buying rates, with only 10% of new vehicle sales being ZEVs. S&P Global Mobility expects ZEVs to account for 15.2% of light-duty vehicle sales in 2024, reaching nearly 267,000 units. However, the real test will be in 2025, when incentives are reduced in provinces like Quebec and BC. If Canada can continue to grow its percentage of new vehicles that are ZEV, it will indicate that the maturation of the electric vehicle has come to a point where it can support itself.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[autoserviceworld.com](https:\/\/www.autoserviceworld.com\/ev-world-charting-electric-vehicle-popularity\/)\n\n",

Experts believe that the upcoming technological breakthrough will surpass the Industrial Revolution in scale and associated risks. The authors of the report have modeled two possible scenarios: a hypothetical company, OpenBrain, which surpasses its competitors, such as DeepCent, and achieves a breakthrough in creating AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) between 2025 and 2027. By 2027, OpenBrain's AGI models, Agent-2 and Agent-3, become capable of self-learning without human intervention, and the company loses control over the processes. The report warns that humanity is at a crossroads: either countries will agree to limit the development of AGI, or the world will face an uncontrollable superintelligence with unpredictable consequences.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: April 27, 2025 03:32 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https:\/\/tsn.ua\/ru\/nauka_it\/iskusstvennyy-intellekt-mozhet-postavit-pod-ugrozu-suschestvovanie-chelovechestva-uzhe-cherez-neskolko-let-2817104.html)\n\n**WE'RE NOT READY FOR AGI\u200a -- \u200aAND MOST OF YOU ARE TOO STUPID TO NOTICE ( short blog)**\nThe author argues that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is already here, but most people are too distracted or unaware to notice.

While significant progress has been made, achieving human-level AI by 2025 is a daunting task. Researchers are grappling with challenges such as understanding human consciousness, generalizing from limited data, and ensuring that AGI aligns with human values. If achieved, AGI could automate jobs, revolutionize healthcare, and accelerate scientific discoveries, but also poses existential risks. To prepare for the potential impact of AGI, individuals, organizations, and governments must invest in education and reskilling programs, establish ethical guidelines, and work together to share knowledge and resources. The development of AGI is a moral and philosophical challenge that requires caution, curiosity, and a commitment to the greater good.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 04, 2025 09:01 AM\nSource:[DEV Community](https:\/\/dev.to\/levitation_infotech\/the-2025-agi-countdown-are-we-on-the-brink-of-human-level-ai-2o65)\n\n**Challenges Facing the Development of Artificial General Intelligence**\nA report by 475 researchers in the field found that 76% of them believe that achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is 'unlikely' or 'very unlikely'. This setback is a major challenge for the tech industries that expected that improvements in current models through more data and power would lead to AGI. Since the 2022 AI boom, expectations have focused on increasing resources to surpass human intelligence. However, despite the significant increase in funding, progress has slowed significantly. According to Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, 'since the release of GPT-4, it has become clear that the expansion of models has been gradual and costly. Companies have already invested heavily, and they cannot retreat due to financial pressure.' The innovative basic structure called 'Transformers', developed by Google scientists in 2017, has contributed to the improvement of AI model capabilities. However, continuous expansion requires massive resources of power and money. The AI-generated sector attracted around $56 billion in venture capital in 2024, with a significant portion of this money being used to build massive data centers that have increased carbon emissions threefold since 2018. With the depletion of usable human data by the end of this decade, companies will be forced to either use data generated by AI itself or collect user data, exposing models to additional error risks. Despite this, the limitation of current models is not only due to resources but also to structural limitations in the way these models are trained.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 31, 2025 03:31 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https:\/\/arabic.rt.com\/technology\/1659485-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A\/)\n\n**Kevin Veyl: AGI is on the Verge of Being Developed**\nKevin Veyl, the CPO of OpenAI, believes that AGI is on the verge of being developed and will be available this year.

He also discusses the two different approaches to improving AI: the GPT series, which focuses on scaling up pre-training, and the O series, which focuses on improving reasoning abilities. Veyl announces that OpenAI plans to combine these two approaches in GPT-5. He also talks about the economic implications of AI development, predicting that the cost of intelligence will decrease exponentially. Veyl also discusses the potential risks of AI development, including the creation of a cognitive illusion of superintelligence and the potential for robots to become a threat to humanity. He also talks about the future of education, predicting that AI will become a personal tutor for every child.

At a high-profile summit in Paris, France has prioritized AI 'action' in 2025, shifting the focus away from safety concerns. Anne Bouverot, AI envoy for President Emmanuel Macron, said, 'We don't want to spend our time talking only about the risks. There's the very real opportunity aspect as well.' Max Tegmark, head of the Future of Life Institute, warned that France should not miss the opportunity to act, saying, 'There is a big fork in the road here at the Paris summit and it should be embraced.' The Global Risk and AI Safety Preparedness (GRASP) platform has been launched to map major risks linked to AI and solutions being developed around the world. The International AI Safety Report has outlined risks such as fake content online, biological attacks, and cyberattacks. Yoshua Bengio, coordinator of the report, fears a possible 'loss of control' by humans over AI systems, potentially motivated by 'their own will to survive.' Experts warn that the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) could lead to a loss of control over AI systems, with some predicting that AGI could be achieved by 2026 or 2027. 'At worst, these American or Chinese companies lose control over this, and then after that Earth will be run by machines,' said Tegmark. Stuart Russell, a computer science professor, said one of his greatest fears is 'weapons systems where the AI that is controlling that weapon system is deciding who to attack, when to attack, and so on.' Tegmark said the solution is to treat the AI industry the same way all other industries are, with government-appointed experts ensuring that AI systems are safe and do not pose a risk to human control.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:45 AM\nSource:[The News International](https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/latest\/1280957-experts-warn-of-ai-loss-of-control-urge-regulation)\n\n**AI Medicine to be Tested in 2025, Says Researcher**\nDemis Hassabis, founder of Isomorphic Labs, a startup founded by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, announced that they will have a medicine designed by artificial intelligence in clinical trials by the end of 2025. The company is working on oncology, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases, and Hassabis believes that they will have their first medicine by the end of the year. 'We're looking at oncology, cardiovascular, neurodegeneration, all the big areas of diseases, and I think we'll have our first medicine by the end of this year,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times at the World Economic Forum. Hassabis also mentioned that the development of medicines can be accelerated by 10 times, which would be a revolution in human health. Isomorphic Labs was spun off from Google's AI research arm, Google DeepMind, in 2021, but remains a subsidiary of Alphabet. The startup has attracted major pharmaceutical partners, who are eager to reduce costs and increase efficiency in the expensive process of developing medicines. Hassabis also mentioned that the prototype of Google's AI assistant, known as Project Astra, will likely be launched for consumers this year. He described a future where 'billions' of AI agents will be 'negotiating with each other on behalf of the seller and the customer,' and said that this would require a reevaluation of the web. Hassabis also called for more caution and coordination among the main developers of AI, warning that the technology could threaten human civilization if it gets out of control or is misused by 'malicious actors... for harmful purposes.' The ultimate goal of Google DeepMind is to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) or 'a system capable of exhibiting all the cognitive abilities that humans have,' according to Hassabis, who said that despite the 'hype' on social media, it will still take 5-10 years to achieve.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 09:03 AM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https:\/\/www1.folha.uol.com.br\/tec\/2025\/01\/remedio-desenvolvido-por-ia-sera-testado-ate-o-final-do-ano-diz-vencedor-do-nobel.shtml)\n\n**The Future of AI: A Roadmap to AGI**\nLeopold Aschenbrenner, a researcher at OpenAI, has written a detailed description of what will happen in the field of AI in the next 10 years.

By the end of the decade, they will become smarter than humans, and we will have a super-intelligence in the true sense of the word. According to Aschenbrenner, the transition to AGI will be rapid, and we will reach a point where predicting events will become difficult. He also notes that the current rate of progress in AI is unsustainable and that we will soon reach a point where we will need to automate the research process itself. Aschenbrenner emphasizes that models simply want to learn and that they are not malicious. He also highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of current AI systems and the potential risks associated with their development. He notes that the two main players in this process are Nvidia and TSMC, and that the US and China will soon realize the importance of controlling the export of GPU and will impose strict regulations. He also warns that the development of AGI will be a game-changer and that the first to achieve it will have a significant advantage over others. Finally, he notes that the development of AGI will also raise questions about the alignment of AI models with human values and the potential risks associated with their development.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 05:01 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https:\/\/habr.com\/ru\/companies\/raft\/articles\/875830\/)\n\n**AI Expert Stuart Russell: AGI Requires Conceptual Breakthrough, Unlikely to Appear in 2026**\nStuart J.

However, to compensate for the costly measure, Republicans plan to make significant cuts in public spending. The first target is Medicaid, a public health insurance program for low-income Americans. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has unveiled its portion of the measures, aiming to achieve $880 billion in federal spending reductions over the next decade. Most of these savings come from reducing the scope of Medicaid and eliminating incentives for renewable energy adopted under Joe Biden. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these measures would reduce the number of people with health insurance by at least 8.6 million by 2034. The Democratic counterpart to Brett Guthrie, the committee's Republican chairman, denounced the cuts as 'catastrophic' and warned that millions of Americans would lose their health coverage, hospitals would close, and seniors would not have access to necessary care. Another committee is set to discuss reductions in food aid for the poorest Americans, which could reach several hundred billion dollars. If adopted by committees in the coming days, the text could head to the House floor in the coming weeks, before being examined by the Senate. However, if the bill faces opposition from Democrats, the divisions within the Republican camp may also derail it. Moderates fear that significant cuts to Medicaid could pose an electoral risk before the mid-term elections in November 2026. Some conservatives, on the other hand, think the cuts do not go far enough, and threaten not to vote for the text unless their demands are met. One of them, Texas Representative Chip Roy, said he hopes Republican leaders will develop a backup plan, as he will not vote for the current bill as is.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[LExpress.fr](https:\/\/www.lexpress.fr\/monde\/semaine-cruciale-au-congres-americain-pour-trump-et-son-programme-B54VI5EXMFEUFDAROT4SW2B3MM\/)\n\n**Extend Trump's tax cuts, pay for it by repealing Biden's climate handouts**\nPresident Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is set to expire at the end of the year, and Democrats are pushing for a $4.5 trillion tax increase. Republicans, who were elected with a mandate to end the 'lunacy of Bidenomics' and make America competitive again, must extend and expand the Trump tax cuts while preventing any tax hikes. Trump recently warned Republicans that a tax increase would ruin their chances of success in 2026. If the tax cuts expire, an automatic $4.5 trillion tax hike will land on working families, with the average taxpayer facing a 22 percent tax hike. Republicans must use the budget framework to extend and expand the Trump tax cuts through a final Reconciliation bill. This is the test of whether they intend to do anything with the mandate they were given. By extending the tax cuts, Republicans can prevent higher taxes on 40 million families and 26 million small businesses, and promote a stronger economy and more opportunity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[The Hill](https:\/\/thehill.com\/opinion\/finance\/5293551-extend-trumps-tax-cuts-pay-for-it-by-repealing-bidens-climate-handouts\/)\n\n**Holland & Knight Defense Situation Report: April 2025**\nThe US Congress is working on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), with the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) and Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) expected to mark up the bill in late spring or early summer. The FY 2026 NDAA will include provisions for defense spending, including a topline funding request of $1.01 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOD request is for $892.6 billion plus $119.3 billion, which would be added to the overall FY 2026 funding should congressional Republicans pass a reconciliation bill. The HASC has released a reconciliation bill with 11 primary funding objectives, including improving capacity across the maritime industrial base and integrated air and missile defense.

The DOD has also announced several initiatives, including the Software Fast Track (SWFT) Initiative, which aims to reform the way the DOD acquires, tests, and authorizes secure software. Additionally, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Army to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy, including streamlining force structure, eliminating wasteful spending, and reforming the acquisition process. President Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at acquisition reform, including 'Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base,' which directs the defense secretary to provide a plan for accomplishing this goal by giving a 'first preference' for acquisition of commercial solutions and a 'general preference' for use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 02:48 AM\nSource:[Lexology](https:\/\/www.lexology.com\/library\/detail.aspx?g=5c0fbe1a-4699-47e3-a3fb-0decbc199b9a)\n\n**US Treasury Secretary Warns Congress of Potential Debt Default in August**\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Congress that if no action is taken, the US government may be unable to pay its debt as early as August. Bessent urged Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling before July 15. In a letter to House Speaker Johnson, Bessent stated that after evaluating the April tax situation, the Treasury Department believes that it is likely to exhaust all means and cash by August to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt. 'Given that Congress will be in recess during the summer, I urge Congress to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling before the recess begins on July 15 to ensure the US fulfills its responsibility to pay its debts.' Bessent emphasized that any default on US debt would have a significant impact on the US financial system, as well as harm US national security and international leadership. The US Congress is currently discussing President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction plan, which is expected to be a critical period in the coming weeks, and is closely related to the X date. The US Treasury Department currently has a debt of over $36 trillion, exceeding the debt ceiling. In 2023, Congress passed a law temporarily allowing the government to disregard the debt ceiling until January 1 of this year. Since then, the Treasury Department has begun using extraordinary measures to prevent Washington from defaulting on its debt. The US Congressional Budget Office had previously stated in March that the X date may occur as early as August. At a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee on the Trump administration's budget proposal, Bessent said that Congress will eventually raise or suspend the debt ceiling again, and the Trump administration will not use any 'stopgap measures' to avoid the debt ceiling issue.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 04:03 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u5947\u6469\u80a1\u5e02](https:\/\/tw.stock.yahoo.com\/news\/%E8%B2%9D%E6%A3%AE%E7%89%B9%E8%AD%A6%E5%91%8A%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%83%E7%A8%B1-%E8%8B%A5%E4%B8%8D%E6%8E%A1%E5%8F%96%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%80%E5%BF%AB8%E6%9C%88%E7%84%A1%E5%8A%9B%E5%84%9F%E9%82%84%E5%82%B5%E5%8B%99-000344508.html)\n\n**Trump proposes major Medicare drug plan changes**\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. The order would implement a 'most favored nation' policy, tying the prices of certain Medicare-covered drugs to those paid by other developed countries. This move could offer meaningful relief from high out-of-pocket drug costs for the 53 million people enrolled in Medicare Part D. According to a 2024 RAND Corporation report, U.S. prescription drug prices in 2022 were nearly three times higher than those in 33 other developed countries. Diane Daniels, founder of Medicare Nation, says, 'People may have forgotten that President Trump initiated the 'American Patients First' blueprint in May of 2018, which aimed to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs for Americans.' The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has already allowed HHS to negotiate with drug manufacturers, and Medicare has negotiated lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. Starting in January 2026, 10 Medicare Part D negotiated prescription medications are set to offer beneficiaries a 38%-79% discount on these medications. The IRA also introduced a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs beginning in 2025. Tom Clark, a Social Security and Medicare consultant, says, 'Beginning this year, persons with Medicare Part D plans have a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for covered medications.' The potential implementation of the 'most favored nation' approach could have far-reaching implications for Medicare beneficiaries, but the pharmaceutical industry has historically opposed such pricing reforms. 'Trump's executive order will expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country, which has predominantly been a ball of red tape,' said Daniels. 'How the executive order will work alongside current tariffs is another issue.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 01:17 PM\nSource:[TheStreet](https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/retirement\/trump-proposes-major-medicare-drug-plan-changes)\n\n**Sheinbaum Defends T-MEC Amid Trump's Commercial War**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that her government will defend the North American Trade Agreement (T-MEC) with the US and Canada, amidst a commercial war launched by US President Donald Trump. The trade agreement, which has been in place since 1994 and was renewed as T-MEC in 2020, is crucial for Mexico's economy, which sends over 80% of its exports to the US, totaling $531 billion in 2024. 'We will defend the T-MEC because it has been beneficial for the three countries. If President Trump makes a different proposal, we will be prepared for any circumstance, but obviously we want the T-MEC to remain in place,' Sheinbaum said. She highlighted that the T-MEC is set to be reviewed every six years, with the first review scheduled for July 2026. Sheinbaum also noted that Trump stated in comments made on Tuesday that the current agreement 'is much better' than the old NAFTA. 'In his statement (Trump) says, 'it will be reviewed in 2026' and we will see what happens. So far, we have no other signal that the T-MEC is going to disappear,' Sheinbaum said. She added that despite Trump's tariff offensive since taking office, the benefits of the trade agreement remain in place for most of Mexico's exported goods. 'The T-MEC has remained in place in many areas, with the exception of some issues in the automotive and steel and aluminum sectors, which we are working on,' Sheinbaum argued. In 2023, Mexico surpassed China to become the US's largest trading partner, a position that could be consolidated amidst the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has kept the threat of new tariffs against Mexico and Canada, accusing them of not doing enough to combat fentanyl trafficking and irregular migration at the border.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[rotativo.com.mx](https:\/\/rotativo.com.mx\/nacionales\/mexico\/vamos-defender-t-mec-dice-presidenta-mexico_1527323_102.html)\n\n**US House Republicans to End Electric Vehicle Tax Credit a Year Early**\nThe US House of Representatives' Republican majority has decided to end the electric vehicle tax credit, which is based on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a year earlier than planned. According to the Wall Street Journal, the House Ways and Means Committee included a provision in the tax bill to repeal the IRA's electric vehicle tax credit (30D) by 2027. The original deadline for the tax credit was December 31, 2022, but it was moved up to December 31, 2026. However, for electric vehicles purchased in 2026, the tax credit will be eliminated if the manufacturer has sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles in the US between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025. The IRA allows taxpayers who purchase electric vehicles assembled in North America and meet certain battery and mineral requirements to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500. However, as President Trump is negative towards electric vehicles and needs to raise funds for his tax cuts, the Republican Party is expected to eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit, along with other clean energy initiatives from the previous Biden administration. The Republican bill also includes a provision to eliminate the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles, such as leased or rented vehicles, to claim the tax credit even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This exception was introduced to accommodate the requests of the Korean government and industry, but some Republicans have criticized it as a 'loophole' that goes against the intent of the law. The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be eliminated.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 10:48 PM\nSource:[KBS](https:\/\/news.kbs.co.kr\/news\/pc\/view\/view.do?ncd=8251784)\n\n**Trump's 'Great and Beautiful' Law: A Battle for Medicaid and the US Budget**\nUS President Donald Trump is pushing lawmakers to quickly pass his 'great and beautiful' law, which includes extending massive tax credits from his first term, set to expire at the end of the year.

If adopted by committees in the coming days, the text could head to the House floor in the coming weeks, before being examined by the Senate. However, if the bill faces opposition from Democrats, the divisions within the Republican camp may also derail it. Moderates fear that significant cuts to Medicaid could pose an electoral risk before the mid-term elections in November 2026. Some conservatives, on the other hand, think the cuts do not go far enough, and threaten not to vote for the text unless their demands are met. One of them, Texas Representative Chip Roy, said he hopes Republican leaders will develop a backup plan, as he will not vote for the current bill as is.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[LExpress.fr](https:\/\/www.lexpress.fr\/monde\/semaine-cruciale-au-congres-americain-pour-trump-et-son-programme-B54VI5EXMFEUFDAROT4SW2B3MM\/)\n\n**Extend Trump's tax cuts, pay for it by repealing Biden's climate handouts**\nPresident Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is set to expire at the end of the year, and Democrats are pushing for a $4.5 trillion tax increase. Republicans, who were elected with a mandate to end the 'lunacy of Bidenomics' and make America competitive again, must extend and expand the Trump tax cuts while preventing any tax hikes. Trump recently warned Republicans that a tax increase would ruin their chances of success in 2026. If the tax cuts expire, an automatic $4.5 trillion tax hike will land on working families, with the average taxpayer facing a 22 percent tax hike. Republicans must use the budget framework to extend and expand the Trump tax cuts through a final Reconciliation bill. This is the test of whether they intend to do anything with the mandate they were given. By extending the tax cuts, Republicans can prevent higher taxes on 40 million families and 26 million small businesses, and promote a stronger economy and more opportunity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[The Hill](https:\/\/thehill.com\/opinion\/finance\/5293551-extend-trumps-tax-cuts-pay-for-it-by-repealing-bidens-climate-handouts\/)\n\n**Holland & Knight Defense Situation Report: April 2025**\nThe US Congress is working on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), with the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) and Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) expected to mark up the bill in late spring or early summer. The FY 2026 NDAA will include provisions for defense spending, including a topline funding request of $1.01 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOD request is for $892.6 billion plus $119.3 billion, which would be added to the overall FY 2026 funding should congressional Republicans pass a reconciliation bill. The HASC has released a reconciliation bill with 11 primary funding objectives, including improving capacity across the maritime industrial base and integrated air and missile defense. The bill was approved by a bipartisan vote of 35-21. The DOD has also announced several initiatives, including the Software Fast Track (SWFT) Initiative, which aims to reform the way the DOD acquires, tests, and authorizes secure software. Additionally, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Army to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy, including streamlining force structure, eliminating wasteful spending, and reforming the acquisition process. President Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at acquisition reform, including 'Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base,' which directs the defense secretary to provide a plan for accomplishing this goal by giving a 'first preference' for acquisition of commercial solutions and a 'general preference' for use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 02:48 AM\nSource:[Lexology](https:\/\/www.lexology.com\/library\/detail.aspx?g=5c0fbe1a-4699-47e3-a3fb-0decbc199b9a)\n\n**US Treasury Secretary Warns Congress of Potential Debt Default in August**\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Congress that if no action is taken, the US government may be unable to pay its debt as early as August. Bessent urged Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling before July 15. In a letter to House Speaker Johnson, Bessent stated that after evaluating the April tax situation, the Treasury Department believes that it is likely to exhaust all means and cash by August to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt. 'Given that Congress will be in recess during the summer, I urge Congress to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling before the recess begins on July 15 to ensure the US fulfills its responsibility to pay its debts.' Bessent emphasized that any default on US debt would have a significant impact on the US financial system, as well as harm US national security and international leadership. The US Congress is currently discussing President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction plan, which is expected to be a critical period in the coming weeks, and is closely related to the X date. The US Treasury Department currently has a debt of over $36 trillion, exceeding the debt ceiling. In 2023, Congress passed a law temporarily allowing the government to disregard the debt ceiling until January 1 of this year. Since then, the Treasury Department has begun using extraordinary measures to prevent Washington from defaulting on its debt. The US Congressional Budget Office had previously stated in March that the X date may occur as early as August. At a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee on the Trump administration's budget proposal, Bessent said that Congress will eventually raise or suspend the debt ceiling again, and the Trump administration will not use any 'stopgap measures' to avoid the debt ceiling issue.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 04:03 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u5947\u6469\u80a1\u5e02](https:\/\/tw.stock.yahoo.com\/news\/%E8%B2%9D%E6%A3%AE%E7%89%B9%E8%AD%A6%E5%91%8A%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%83%E7%A8%B1-%E8%8B%A5%E4%B8%8D%E6%8E%A1%E5%8F%96%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%80%E5%BF%AB8%E6%9C%88%E7%84%A1%E5%8A%9B%E5%84%9F%E9%82%84%E5%82%B5%E5%8B%99-000344508.html)\n\n**Trump proposes major Medicare drug plan changes**\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. The order would implement a 'most favored nation' policy, tying the prices of certain Medicare-covered drugs to those paid by other developed countries. This move could offer meaningful relief from high out-of-pocket drug costs for the 53 million people enrolled in Medicare Part D. According to a 2024 RAND Corporation report, U.S. prescription drug prices in 2022 were nearly three times higher than those in 33 other developed countries. Diane Daniels, founder of Medicare Nation, says, 'People may have forgotten that President Trump initiated the 'American Patients First' blueprint in May of 2018, which aimed to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs for Americans.' The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has already allowed HHS to negotiate with drug manufacturers, and Medicare has negotiated lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. Starting in January 2026, 10 Medicare Part D negotiated prescription medications are set to offer beneficiaries a 38%-79% discount on these medications. The IRA also introduced a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs beginning in 2025. Tom Clark, a Social Security and Medicare consultant, says, 'Beginning this year, persons with Medicare Part D plans have a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for covered medications.' The potential implementation of the 'most favored nation' approach could have far-reaching implications for Medicare beneficiaries, but the pharmaceutical industry has historically opposed such pricing reforms. 'Trump's executive order will expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country, which has predominantly been a ball of red tape,' said Daniels. 'How the executive order will work alongside current tariffs is another issue.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 01:17 PM\nSource:[TheStreet](https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/retirement\/trump-proposes-major-medicare-drug-plan-changes)\n\n**Sheinbaum Defends T-MEC Amid Trump's Commercial War**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that her government will defend the North American Trade Agreement (T-MEC) with the US and Canada, amidst a commercial war launched by US President Donald Trump. The trade agreement, which has been in place since 1994 and was renewed as T-MEC in 2020, is crucial for Mexico's economy, which sends over 80% of its exports to the US, totaling $531 billion in 2024. 'We will defend the T-MEC because it has been beneficial for the three countries. If President Trump makes a different proposal, we will be prepared for any circumstance, but obviously we want the T-MEC to remain in place,' Sheinbaum said. She highlighted that the T-MEC is set to be reviewed every six years, with the first review scheduled for July 2026. Sheinbaum also noted that Trump stated in comments made on Tuesday that the current agreement 'is much better' than the old NAFTA. 'In his statement (Trump) says, 'it will be reviewed in 2026' and we will see what happens. So far, we have no other signal that the T-MEC is going to disappear,' Sheinbaum said. She added that despite Trump's tariff offensive since taking office, the benefits of the trade agreement remain in place for most of Mexico's exported goods. 'The T-MEC has remained in place in many areas, with the exception of some issues in the automotive and steel and aluminum sectors, which we are working on,' Sheinbaum argued. In 2023, Mexico surpassed China to become the US's largest trading partner, a position that could be consolidated amidst the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has kept the threat of new tariffs against Mexico and Canada, accusing them of not doing enough to combat fentanyl trafficking and irregular migration at the border.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[rotativo.com.mx](https:\/\/rotativo.com.mx\/nacionales\/mexico\/vamos-defender-t-mec-dice-presidenta-mexico_1527323_102.html)\n\n**Trump Says He Won't Remove Fed Chair Powell, Says Good Parts Of Economy Are His Doing**\nUS President Donald Trump stated that he will not remove Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Board chairman before his term ends in 2026, describing Powell as 'a total stiff' and calling for the Fed to lower interest rates. Trump attributed a first-quarter contraction in the US economy to former President Joe Biden's policies and claimed that his own moves to upend the global trading system with higher tariffs would eventually make Americans rich. Trump also sent mixed messages on the economy, dismissing concerns about a first-quarter decline in GDP and arguing that his predecessor was to blame for any economic weakness. Trump's whipsaw moves on tariffs have sparked the most volatile weeks on Wall Street since the early part of the COVID pandemic five years ago. Trump said, 'It partially is right now. And I really mean this. I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because he's done a terrible job.'

Trump also stated that he does not seek a third term as president, saying 'I'm not looking for a third term'. Additionally, he declared that he will not remove Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chairman before the end of his term in May 2026, calling Powell 'completely rigid' and repeating his calls for the Fed to lower interest rates. Trump stated that Powell is not a fan of his, but expects the Fed to lower interest rates at some point. 'Well, they should lower them. And at some point they will. They don't want to because they're not a fan of mine', he said, claiming that he does not like Powell because he finds him to be 'totally rigid and unable'. When asked if he would remove Powell before the end of his term, Trump firmly denied it, saying 'No, no, no... why should I? I can replace that person soon enough'. The US president also intends to extend the deadline for TikTok if no agreement is reached. In the NBC News interview, Trump refused to rule out the possibility of making some tariffs permanent, saying 'No, I wouldn't do that, because if someone thought they would be taken off the table, why would they build in the United States? ' He also acknowledged being 'very tough on China', effectively halting trade between the two major world economies, but stated that China now wants to reach an agreement.

One possibility is to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807, a historic law that would give the president the power to deploy military troops in emergency internal situations. This power could allow him to take more drastic measures against illegal immigration, a move that many see as a radical step in his immigration policy. According to Laura Dickinson, a constitutional law expert, the use of this law would be a unprecedented gesture and could generate additional tensions between the executive branch and the military. Trump has already signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, declaring a national emergency on the border and requesting a 90-day report from the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, to evaluate the migration situation and recommend whether to invoke the Insurrection Act.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: April 21, 2025 09:26 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https:\/\/larepublica.pe\/estados-unidos\/2025\/04\/21\/malas-noticias-para-inmigrantes-la-antigua-ley-que-trump-podria-usar-para-endurecer-la-persecucion-a-inmigrantes-en-eeuu-lrtmus-1494507)\n\n**On April 20th, 2025, the United States will Cross the Point of No Return.**\nThe author warns that on April 20th, 2025, the United States may initiate its final steps into authoritarian rule.

He may make a decision this Sunday; here's what Americans need to watch out for**\nPresident Donald Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act, a centuries-old law that would allow active-duty military troops to arrest migrants and support law enforcement inside the U.S. However, top officials at the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, are not recommending Trump take that step. According to a DHS source, the current low levels of migrant crossings, with fewer than 300 people crossing the southern border illegally each day, do not require military involvement. Trump signed an executive order in January 2025 calling the situation at the southern border a national emergency, and Hegseth and Noem have 90 days to assess the border and recommend whether the Insurrection Act should be used. The deadline is this Sunday, April 21. Despite growing frustration within Trump's inner circle about the pace of interior arrests of undocumented immigrants, it appears unlikely that Trump will immediately invoke the Insurrection Act based on current border conditions and the recommendation from his top defense and homeland security chiefs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 19, 2025 01:03 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/international\/us\/what-is-the-insurrection-act-and-will-donald-trump-invoke-it-he-may-make-a-decision-this-sunday-heres-what-americans-need-to-watch-out-for\/articleshow\/120433315.cms)\n\n**A Conspiracy Theory That Is Being Pushed By The Left Claims That Something Really Big Is Going To Happen On April 20th**\nA conspiracy theory spreading on social media claims that President Trump will declare martial law in the United States on April 20th.

While each country\u2019s journey to 5% plays out differently, timelines converge in the years that follow.\n\n> \u201cOnce enough sales occur, you kind of have a virtuous cycle,\u201d said Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at BloombergNEF. \u201cMore EVs popping up means more people seeing them as mainstream, automakers more willing to invest in the market, and the charging infrastructure expanding on a good trajectory.\n\nMarket shares in other countries have been as follows:\n\n| Country     | EV sales in Q4 2023 | EV market shr Q4 '24 (%) | First quarter at 5% tipping point |\n| ----------- | ------------------: | -----------------------: | --------------------------------: |\n| Norway      |              25,028 |                     79.6 |                           2013 Q3 |\n| Iceland     |               3,507 |                     58.4 |                           2019 Q1 |\n| Denmark     |              21,890 |                     44.9 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| Sweden      |              31,780 |                     39.8 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| Finland     |               6,686 |                     35.3 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Netherlands |              29,199 |                     35.1 |                           2018 Q4 |\n| Ireland     |               1,164 |                     33.9 |                           2019 Q4 |\n| Belgium     |              25,752 |                     25.3 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Portugal    |              11,265 |                     24.3 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Switzerland |              16,581 |                     23.9 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| China       |           1,879,600 |                     23.8 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Austria     |              13,083 |                     23.3 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| Israel      |               6,772 |                     22.9 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| France      |              98,755 |                     20.3 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| New Zealand |               7,435 |                     20.0 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Germany     |             138,390 |                     19.6 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| UK          |              79,602 |                     17.6 |                           2020 Q2 |\n| Thailand    |              23,864 |                     12.6 |                           2023 Q1 |\n| Turkey      |              36,026 |                     12.0 |                           2023 Q3 |\n| Romania     |               3,655 |                     10.8 |                           2021 Q4 |\n| Slovenia    |               1,126 |                     10.7 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| Australia   |              21,571 |                      9.5 |                           2022 Q3 |\n| Canada      |              38,160 |                      9.4 |                           2022 Q1 |\n| Spain       |              20,666 |                      8.7 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| US          |             313,822 |                      8.1 |                           2021 Q4 |\n| Estonia     |                 400 |                      7.5 |                           2023 Q2 |\n| South Korea |              36,009 |                      6.9 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Hungary     |               1,614 |                      6.5 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| Bulgaria    |                 551 |                      5.8 |                           2023 Q4 |\n| Italy       |              21,033 |                      5.4 |                           2023 Q4 |\n| Greece      |               1,579 |                      5.3 |                           2023 Q2 |\n\nArgonne National Laboratory tracks monthly electric vehicle sales figures in its [Light Duty Electric Drive Vehicles Monthly Sales Updates](https:\/\/www.anl.gov\/esia\/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates).\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

This question specifically excludes the hybrids and is asking only about BEV as a percentage of total light-duty vehicle sales.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n**1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status**\n\n- In Q1 2025, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for approximately 7.5% of new light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S., up from 7% in Q1 2024[1][3].\n- U.S. BEV sales volume remains on an upward trajectory, growing 11.4% year over year in Q1 2025, though market share gains have been modest as overall new vehicle sales also rise[1][3].\n- The U.S. reached the 5% \u201ctipping point\u201d for BEV share in Q4 2021. Historically, many international markets have crossed from 5% to above 10% BEV share within two to four years[1].\n\n**2. Recent Announcements and Policy Environment**\n\n- Major automakers such as GM, Honda, and Stellantis are launching new BEV models, with GM nearly doubling its EV volume year over year in Q1 2025[1][2].\n- The U.S. market is seeing a surge in hybrid sales as well, which may compete with BEVs for eco-conscious buyers and moderate BEV share gains[2].\n- While federal and some state incentives remain, there have been no recent national-level policy changes likely to cause a sharp, near-term spike in BEV share.\n\n**3. Authoritative Data Sources**\n\n- Argonne National Laboratory\u2019s Light Duty Electric Drive Vehicles Monthly Sales Updates is the definitive source for monthly BEV and total LDV sales and will be used for official question resolution.\n- Industry data from Kelley Blue Book and Cox Automotive supplements Argonne\u2019s reporting[1][2][3].\n\n**4. Limitations and Uncertainties**\n\n- Measurement depends on Argonne\u2019s reporting cadence and industry definitions.\n- If overall new vehicle sales surge, BEV share could stagnate despite rising BEV volume.\n- The pace of BEV adoption could accelerate if a new, popular mass-market model launches or if policy incentives change, but current evidence suggests steady, not explosive, growth.\n\n**Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment**\n\nGiven the current trajectory\u20147.5% BEV share in Q1 2025, historical annual gains of about 0.5\u20131 percentage point, and no major accelerants visible\u2014the probability that BEVs will make up more than 10% of U.S. new light-duty vehicle sales in any month before October 2025 appears below 50%. A reasonable forecast would place the likelihood in the 25\u201340% range, barring an unexpected surge in BEV demand or supportive policy changes before fall 2025.\n\n## References\n\n[1].

According to recent data, the majority of new cars registered in Europe now use alternative propulsion methods, including hybrids. The dominance of pure combustion engines is broken. However, the cost of EVs is still around 20% higher than comparable combustion engines, which is why many governments offer incentives to encourage their purchase. In some European countries, such as Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Portugal, the market share of EVs is growing rapidly, with over 50% of new cars registered in these countries being electric. These countries offer generous incentives, including tax breaks and subsidies, to encourage the adoption of EVs. In contrast, Tesla, a manufacturer that only produces EVs, has seen a significant decline in sales, with a 37% drop in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. However, the data for the first quarter of 2025 shows that the number of EVs registered in Europe is growing, with a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This growth is particularly pronounced in countries that have previously been slow to adopt EVs, such as Germany and Italy. 'The prospects for EVs in 2025 have brightened,' said a spokesperson for the International Energy Agency. 'The decline in prices due to cheaper batteries and increased competition, as well as the increasing range of EVs, are contributing to this growth.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 03:30 AM\nSource:[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung](https:\/\/www.nzz.ch\/visuals\/krise-bei-benzinern-chance-fuer-e-autos-der-wandel-von-europas-autoindustrie-in-grafiken-ld.1847621)\n\n**Zapped: Electric vehicle sales nosedive as Republicans take buzzsaw to Biden mandate * WorldNetDaily * by Thomas English, Daily Caller News Foundation**\nU.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales declined by 5% in April, marking the third monthly drop since 2021, according to Motor Intelligence data. Tesla's sales fell by nearly 13%, while Rivian's flagship electric pickup and SUV sales were cut in half, prompting the company to lower its 2025 forecast by 5,000 units. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, said, 'The challenge is consumers are more price-sensitive than they typically have been and are looking for lower-price alternatives.' In contrast, sales of traditional gas-powered vehicles rose 10% in April. Dealers reported growing inventories of unsold EVs, reflecting slower consumer uptake following years of high demand. Mickey Anderson, a dealership chain owner, said, 'I think the natural demand is probably half that,' referring to past EV demand artificially inflated by discounts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 08:33 PM\nSource:[WND](https:\/\/www.wnd.com\/2025\/05\/zapped-electric-vehicle-sales-nosedive-as-republicans-take-buzzsaw-to-biden-mandate\/)\n\n**China Leads the Electric Vehicle Market with 10 Million Cars Produced in 2024**\nChina has maintained its dominance in the electric vehicle market, producing 10 million cars in 2024 alone, with expectations of a significant increase in this number during the current year 2025. This highlights the significant technological progress made by China in this field, despite the technological challenges imposed by the US decisions to ban China from obtaining advanced semiconductor chips, as well as the protectionist measures that coincide with the trade war led by US President Donald Trump. China's production of electric vehicles has led to its dominance of the global market, with a 60% market share, surpassing Europe and the US combined. The Chinese company BYD has led the charge in the electric vehicle industry, with a significant increase in sales, reaching 4.27 million electric and hybrid vehicles. Other Chinese companies, such as Li Auto and Leapmotor, have also seen significant increases in sales. However, some well-known brands, such as Nio and Xpeng, have failed to meet their targets despite a significant increase in demand at the end of the year. A recent report by Bloomberg highlighted that countries that are more open to Chinese companies entering their markets have seen higher rates of adoption of electric vehicles compared to countries that impose strict tariffs. The report also noted that the competition from Chinese companies has forced Western companies to improve their offers and launch more competitive electric vehicle models. The adoption of electric vehicles in emerging markets has begun to surpass that of developed countries, with Thailand now surpassing the US in the percentage of electric vehicle adoption, and Brazil advancing ahead of Japan in this regard. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 05:14 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629](https:\/\/alroya.om\/post\/365479\/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC-10-%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9)\n\n**Is Lucid Group (LCID) the High Growth EV Stock to Invest In?**\nThe electric vehicle (EV) market is facing challenges despite growth.

According to recent data, the majority of new cars registered in Europe now use alternative propulsion methods, including hybrids. The dominance of pure combustion engines is broken. However, the cost of EVs is still around 20% higher than comparable combustion engines, which is why many governments offer incentives to encourage their purchase. In some European countries, such as Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Portugal, the market share of EVs is growing rapidly, with over 50% of new cars registered in these countries being electric. These countries offer generous incentives, including tax breaks and subsidies, to encourage the adoption of EVs. In contrast, Tesla, a manufacturer that only produces EVs, has seen a significant decline in sales, with a 37% drop in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. However, the data for the first quarter of 2025 shows that the number of EVs registered in Europe is growing, with a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This growth is particularly pronounced in countries that have previously been slow to adopt EVs, such as Germany and Italy. 'The prospects for EVs in 2025 have brightened,' said a spokesperson for the International Energy Agency. 'The decline in prices due to cheaper batteries and increased competition, as well as the increasing range of EVs, are contributing to this growth.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 03:30 AM\nSource:[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung](https:\/\/www.nzz.ch\/visuals\/krise-bei-benzinern-chance-fuer-e-autos-der-wandel-von-europas-autoindustrie-in-grafiken-ld.1847621)\n\n**Zapped: Electric vehicle sales nosedive as Republicans take buzzsaw to Biden mandate * WorldNetDaily * by Thomas English, Daily Caller News Foundation**\nU.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales declined by 5% in April, marking the third monthly drop since 2021, according to Motor Intelligence data. Tesla's sales fell by nearly 13%, while Rivian's flagship electric pickup and SUV sales were cut in half, prompting the company to lower its 2025 forecast by 5,000 units. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, said, 'The challenge is consumers are more price-sensitive than they typically have been and are looking for lower-price alternatives.' In contrast, sales of traditional gas-powered vehicles rose 10% in April. Dealers reported growing inventories of unsold EVs, reflecting slower consumer uptake following years of high demand. Mickey Anderson, a dealership chain owner, said, 'I think the natural demand is probably half that,' referring to past EV demand artificially inflated by discounts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 08:33 PM\nSource:[WND](https:\/\/www.wnd.com\/2025\/05\/zapped-electric-vehicle-sales-nosedive-as-republicans-take-buzzsaw-to-biden-mandate\/)\n\n**China Leads the Electric Vehicle Market with 10 Million Cars Produced in 2024**\nChina has maintained its dominance in the electric vehicle market, producing 10 million cars in 2024 alone, with expectations of a significant increase in this number during the current year 2025. This highlights the significant technological progress made by China in this field, despite the technological challenges imposed by the US decisions to ban China from obtaining advanced semiconductor chips, as well as the protectionist measures that coincide with the trade war led by US President Donald Trump. China's production of electric vehicles has led to its dominance of the global market, with a 60% market share, surpassing Europe and the US combined. The Chinese company BYD has led the charge in the electric vehicle industry, with a significant increase in sales, reaching 4.27 million electric and hybrid vehicles. Other Chinese companies, such as Li Auto and Leapmotor, have also seen significant increases in sales. However, some well-known brands, such as Nio and Xpeng, have failed to meet their targets despite a significant increase in demand at the end of the year. A recent report by Bloomberg highlighted that countries that are more open to Chinese companies entering their markets have seen higher rates of adoption of electric vehicles compared to countries that impose strict tariffs. The report also noted that the competition from Chinese companies has forced Western companies to improve their offers and launch more competitive electric vehicle models. The adoption of electric vehicles in emerging markets has begun to surpass that of developed countries, with Thailand now surpassing the US in the percentage of electric vehicle adoption, and Brazil advancing ahead of Japan in this regard. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 05:14 AM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629](https:\/\/alroya.om\/post\/365479\/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC-10-%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9)\n\n**US Automotive Market Shows Resilience in First Quarter of 2025**\nThe US automotive sector has maintained its dynamism in the first quarter of 2025, despite the political issues surrounding the economy. According to the sales figures for new cars from January to April, there is a general growth trend, although with important nuances that need to be analyzed. In the first four months, a total of 5,386,547 units were sold, representing a 5.3% increase compared to the same period last year, when 5,116,523 vehicles were sold. The growth in April was particularly notable, with 1,465,356 new vehicles sold, a 10.0% increase compared to the same month last year. This increase is attributed to a combination of factors, including a growing demand from consumers, who are concerned about potential price increases in the near future and a decrease in inventory levels. The imposition of a 25% tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the US on April 3 has also contributed to the trend. The uncertainty caused by this tariff has led to a surge in sales, with many consumers opting to buy now rather than later. The trend is expected to continue, with the sales of light trucks (including pickups and SUVs) increasing by 15.2% in April and 8.3% in the first four months. In contrast, traditional passenger cars continue to lose ground, with sales falling by 9.7% in April and 6.1% in the first four months. General Motors experienced a notable increase of 19.6%, while Ford grew by 13.3%, thanks in part to its incentive program that extended price discounts to the general public. Stellantis also saw an increase of 3.9% after adopting similar incentives. Tesla, on the other hand, suffered a significant decline of 19.6%, indicating that the brand continues to face a shift in consumer preference both in the US and Europe. Toyota saw an increase of 10.2% in April, driven by its electrified vehicles, while Lexus achieved its best April sales ever. Honda also had a strong month, with an increase of 18.1%, supported by the good sales of its electrified models and the Acura brand, which also set a record for April. Nissan reported a slight decline of 2.4%, while Subaru maintained its positive trend for 33 consecutive months with a discreet increase of 0.3%. Mazda celebrated a growth of 21.0%, adding 12 months of increases, and Mitsubishi advanced by 7.5%. Hyundai and Kia continued their winning streak, with increases of 18.5% and 13.8% respectively in April. The strength of their hybrid and electric vehicles remains a fundamental pillar, leading to both companies registering record monthly sales for the seventh consecutive month. Even their luxury brand, Genesis, set a new record for sales in April. Finally, European brands had a mixed performance in April: Volkswagen decreased by 14.2%, Mercedes-Benz grew by a slight 1.2%, BMW stood out with an increase of 16.1%, Audi fell by 3.7%, and Volvo experienced a healthy growth of 22.6%. In general, the US automotive market in the first four months of 2025 shows a notable resilience, although clearly influenced by external factors such as trade policies and consumer response to these.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 06, 2025 06:18 PM\nSource:[as](https:\/\/us.as.com\/autos\/actualidad\/a-que-se-debe-el-fuerte-aumento-en-ventas-de-autos-en-ee-uu-en-2025\/)\n\n**US Electric Vehicle Sales See 10.6% Growth in Q1 2025**\nIn the US, 294,250 electric vehicles were sold in the first quarter of 2025, a 10.6% increase from the same period in 2024. According to the Kelley Blue Book EV Sales Report, pure electric vehicles accounted for 7.5% of total sales in the US, up from 7% in the same period last year. The report notes that General Motors is driving electric vehicle growth, while Tesla's sales are declining. The authors of the report highlight that the latest numbers show uneven growth, with new models from Acura, Audi, Chevrolet, Honda, and Porsche contributing to higher sales, while established products are experiencing a decline. The report also notes that the market is becoming increasingly competitive, with more options available to customers. Looking ahead to the rest of 2025, the authors predict that the electric vehicle market in the US will be uncertain, despite the introduction of new products and incentives. They cite the potential impact of new auto tariffs, which could be a significant challenge for many automakers, as well as the ongoing trade war with China, which is a major supplier of battery materials for electric vehicles. Additionally, the report notes that there are speculations that the new government may reverse the electric vehicle incentives introduced during the Biden era.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: April 11, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[electrive.net](https:\/\/www.electrive.net\/2025\/04\/11\/q1-zahlen-e-auto-geschaeft-in-den-usa-zieht-um-10-prozent-an\/)\n\n**US grids must harness electric vehicle growth to tackle load risks**\nThe rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) in the US is expected to significantly impact the country's electricity demand, with estimates suggesting that EVs will add between 100 and 185 terawatt-hours (TWh) to US electricity demand by 2030. Experts predict that EV adoption will be driven by manufacturers introducing more affordable EVs to the public, with EVs expected to make up 30% of all US light-duty vehicle sales by 2030 and 60% by 2040. To mitigate the strain on the grid, grid operators are exploring new grid management measures, including managed and flexible EV charging, which can reduce the strain on the grid and improve grid reliability. According to Jaron Weston, manager of the California Energy Commission's Zero Emission Vehicle Acceleration Branch, 'Through vehicle-to-grid integration, electric vehicles represent substantially more potential for grid benefits than any other distributed resource.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 18, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[Reuters](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/energy\/us-grids-must-harness-electric-vehicle-growth-tackle-load-risks-2025-03-18\/)\n\n**Despite everything, US EV sales are up 28% this year**\nDespite announcements from automakers planning for more gasoline and hybrid cars, global EV sales are up 30% this year, with the US seeing a 28% increase.

This prediction is based on a study of 2557 car buyers and 526 dealers in the US. The study found that, excluding Stellantis and Tesla, almost all car manufacturers reported an increase in sales in 2024, with General Motors, Honda, and Mazda showing significant growth. The number of people considering buying a used electric car has also increased, from 62% in 2021 to 77% in 2024. Electric vehicles made up 7.5% of the market in 2024, but are expected to reach 10% in 2025. Meanwhile, sales of internal combustion engine cars are expected to decline to a record low of 75%, with 15% of the market going to pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In 2025, 15 new electric car models are expected to be released, and most buyers will try to purchase them before the new US administration's tax credit of $7500 is reduced. While the lack of charging infrastructure is currently a major obstacle to the development of the electric car market, 86% of dealers have pledged to continue investing in this area in 2025, which should help alleviate the problem. Additionally, electric cars are expected to become more accessible, with increased availability of credit and a potential decrease in interest rates if the economy stabilizes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 07:08 PM\nSource:[zerkalo.az](https:\/\/zerkalo.az\/v-2025-godu-kazhdyj-chetvyortyj-prodannyj-v-ssha-avtomobil-budet-elektricheskim\/)\n\n**US New Energy Vehicle Sales Reach 20% of Total Market for First Time**\nFor the first time, new energy vehicles in the US accounted for 20% of the total sales of new cars and trucks in 2024. This milestone marks significant progress for 'green' vehicles in the US market, although the growth rate is slower than many had expected. According to Motor Intelligence, over 3.2 million new energy vehicles were sold in the US in 2024, including 1.9 million hybrid vehicles and 1.3 million electric vehicles. Meanwhile, traditional gasoline-powered car sales fell below 80% for the first time, dropping to 79.8%, a new low in modern automotive history. In the electric vehicle market, Tesla continues to lead, but its market share has declined slightly. According to Cox Automotive, Tesla's sales declined in 2024, with its market share falling from 55% in 2023 to around 49%. However, Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 remained the best-selling electric vehicles in 2024. The top five electric vehicle manufacturers are Tesla, Hyundai Motor Group (including Kia), General Motors, Ford Motor, and BMW, with market shares of 49%, 9.3%, 8.7%, 7.5%, and 4.1%, respectively. These brands continue to compete fiercely in the market, driving the diversification of the electric vehicle market. The US electric vehicle market is highly competitive, with varying performances from different brands. According to Kelley Blue Book, 24 out of 68 mainstream electric vehicle models tracked by Cox saw year-over-year sales growth, 17 were new launches, and 27 saw sales declines. Looking ahead, Cox Automotive predicts that US electric vehicle sales will reach a new high in 2025, accounting for around 10% of new car sales. If hybrid vehicles are included, it is estimated that one in four new cars sold will be a new energy vehicle. However, analysis suggests that potential policy changes from the Trump administration could impact new energy vehicle sales. Currently, consumers who purchase electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles can enjoy a federal tax credit of up to $7,500. However, Trump may cancel this subsidy and other support policies for electric vehicles.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 12:48 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https:\/\/k.sina.com.cn\/article_7096020371_1a6f4ad9301901giwo.html)\n\n**Electric Vehicles Account for 20% of US Car Sales in 2024**\nAccording to Motor Intelligence, 1.3 million electric vehicles were sold in the US in 2024, accounting for 20% of total new car sales.

In recent years, they have dominated both domestic and European competitions, cementing their reputation as a powerhouse in women's football.\n\n In the 2023\/24 season, FC Barcelona won both Liga F and the Women's Champions League. As of February 2025, they lead the Liga F standings, displaying an unbeaten streak and a strong goalscoring record. In the UEFA Women's Champions League, Barcelona has advanced to the knockout stages and remains one of the strongest contenders.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThe question will be resolved as **Yes** if FC Barcelona win both the Liga F and the UEFA Women's Champions League in the 2024\/25 season. It will be resolved as **No** if they do not win one or both titles. The resolution will be based on the official results published on the Liga F and UEFA websites.\n\n\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# FC Barcelona Femen\u00ed's 2024\/25 Season Outlook as of February 2025\n\nAs of February 27, 2025, FC Barcelona Femen\u00ed is in the midst of their 2024-25 campaign, competing in multiple competitions including Liga F (Spanish domestic league) and the UEFA Women's Champions League. This analysis examines their prospects for winning both major titles based on available information.\n\n## Current Status in Liga F\n\nBarcelona entered the 2024-25 season as the defending Liga F champions and has maintained their dominant position in the Spanish league. Their impressive attacking prowess is evident from multiple high-scoring victories, including a 10-1 win against Granada and a 9-0 away victory against Real Betis[1][4]. \n\nThe team's offensive strength is largely driven by striker Ewa Pajor, who has been in exceptional form this season[1]. As the campaign progresses, Barcelona continues to demonstrate their superiority in the domestic competition, though they have suffered at least one surprising domestic defeat, losing 3-1 to Real Madrid[1].\n\n## Champions League Campaign\n\nIn the 2024-25 UEFA Women's Champions League, Barcelona began as the defending champions and has shown strong performances in the competition. Their group stage included a dominant 9-0 victory over Hammarby, demonstrating their attacking capabilities on the European stage[1][4].\n\nHowever, Barcelona has faced more significant challenges in European competition, including a 2-0 defeat to Manchester City in what appears to be a crucial Champions League match[1]. This suggests that while Barcelona remains one of the favorites, they face strong competition from other elite European clubs.\n\n## Key Factors Affecting Title Prospects\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. **Scoring power**: Barcelona's attack has been formidable, regularly scoring multiple goals in matches across competitions[1][4].\n2. **Championship experience**: As defending champions in both competitions, the team has proven their ability to handle pressure in crucial matches[1].\n3. **Home support**: Barcelona has enjoyed strong home attendance, particularly for key matches, with over 35,000 fans attending their match against Real Madrid[1].\n\n### Challenges\n\n1. **European competition**: The defeat to Manchester City highlights the increased difficulty of winning the Champions League compared to domestic competitions[1].\n2. **Defensive vulnerabilities**: Despite their offensive strength, Barcelona has conceded multiple goals in some matches, suggesting potential defensive weaknesses[1][4].\n3. **Fixture congestion**: Competing in five tournaments (Liga F, Copa de la Reina, Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, UEFA Champions League, and Copa Catalunya) could lead to fatigue as the season progresses[1].\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on information available as of February 27, 2025, Barcelona remains the favorite to win Liga F, given their historical dominance and strong performances this season. Their position in the league table (though specific details are not available for the February timeframe) likely shows them with a substantial lead over competitors.\n\nFor the Champions League, the assessment is more nuanced. While Barcelona entered as defending champions with a strong squad, the competition from teams like Manchester City and potentially Chelsea presents significant challenges. The knockout stage results up to February 27 would be crucial in determining their prospects.\n\nGiven Barcelona's status as one of the elite women's football clubs and their recent history of success, they would have a good but not certain chance of achieving the double. Their domestic title appears more secure than their European prospects based on the information available.\n\n## Measurement Limitations\n\nSeveral factors limit this assessment:\n\n1. The specific league standings as of February 27, 2025, are not provided in the search results.\n2. The exact stage of the Champions League reached by February 27 is not explicitly stated.\n3. Detailed information about injuries, team form, and remaining fixtures as of February 27 is limited.\n\nBarcelona's pursuit of both titles will likely be determined by their performance in key matches against direct competitors in Liga F and their ability to overcome the European elite in the Champions League knockout stages.\n\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**FC Barcelona Femenino Wins Sixth Consecutive Liga F Title**\nFC Barcelona women's team secured their sixth consecutive Liga F title with a 0-9 victory over Real Betis.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, during calendar year 2025, any one of the listed AI labs below or labs' leadership publicly claims to have created artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\n* [<u>OpenAI<\/u>](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/future-perfect\/380117\/openai-microsoft-sam-altman-nonprofit-for-profit-foundation-artificial-intelligence)\n* [<u>Anthropic<\/u>](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/future-perfect\/23794855\/anthropic-ai-openai-claude-2)\n* Google (including [<u>DeepMind<\/u>](https:\/\/deepmind.google\/))\n* [<u>Microsoft<\/u>](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/24314821\/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-google-deepmind-openai-inflection-agi-decoder-podcast)\n* [<u>Nvidia<\/u>](https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/ai\/nvidia-just-dropped-a-bombshell-its-new-ai-model-is-open-massive-and-ready-to-rival-gpt-4\/)\n* [<u>xAI<\/u>](https:\/\/x.ai\/)\n* [<u>Meta\/Facebook<\/u>](https:\/\/ai.meta.com\/)\n* [<u>Mistral<\/u>](https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2024\/02\/29\/mistral-french-ai-startup-microsoft)\n* [<u>Databricks<\/u>](https:\/\/www.databricks.com\/blog\/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm)\n* [<u>World Labs<\/u>](https:\/\/www.worldlabs.ai\/)\n* [<u>Safe Superintelligence<\/u>](https:\/\/ssi.inc\/)\n* [<u>Hugging Face<\/u>](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/)\n* [<u>Scale AI<\/u>](https:\/\/scale.com\/)\n* [<u>Magic.dev<\/u>](https:\/\/magic.dev\/)\n* [<u>Amazon<\/u>](https:\/\/www.aboutamazon.com\/news\/aws\/amazon-nova-artificial-intelligence-bedrock-aws)\n* [<u>Apple<\/u>](https:\/\/machinelearning.apple.com\/research\/introducing-apple-foundation-models)\n* [<u>Netflix<\/u>](https:\/\/netflixtechblog.com\/supporting-diverse-ml-systems-at-netflix-2d2e6b6d205d)\n* [<u>IBM<\/u>](https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/watson)\n\n* A lab will be considered to have claimed to have created AGI if the company or an official representative states publicly that the company considers an AI system they have created to be artificial general intelligence. An official representative must be clearly speaking on behalf of the company.\n* A public claim or statement of opinion by lab leadership that they have developed an AI system that they consider to be AGI will also be sufficient to resolve the question as **Yes**. Lab leadership will be considered to be the chief executive of each organization, or equivalent, or their nearest equivalent successor in the event they depart the company or eliminate the CEO position. If an organization is structured such that its AI lab is part of a larger organization and the AI lab has a clear chief executive, in most cases we will count both the chief executive of the organization and the chief executive of its AI lab. As of December 19, 2024, this is the comprehensive list of qualifying leadership:\n  * OpenAI: CEO Sam Altman\n  * Anthropic: CEO Dario Amodei\n  * Google and DeepMind: CEO Sundar Pichai and CEO Demis Hassabis\n  * Microsoft and Microsoft AI: CEO Satya Nadella and CEO Mustafa Suleyman\n  * NVIDIA: CEO Jensen Huang\n  * xAI: CEO Elon Musk\n  * Meta: CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n  * Mistral: CEO Arthur Mensch\n  * Databricks: CEO Ali Ghodsi\n  * World Labs: CEO Fei-Fei Li\n  * Safe Superintelligence: CEO Daniel Gross\n  * Hugging Face: CEO Clem Delangue\n  * Scale AI: CEO Alexandr Wang\n  * Magic.dev: CEO Eric Steinberger\n  * Amazon: CEO Andy Jassy\n  * Apple: CEO Tim Cook\n  * Netflix: Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters\n  * IBM: CEO Arvind Krishna&#x20;\n* A statement will generally qualify if it represents a claim, position, or opinion of the organization or top leadership. For example, a CEO stating their belief that the organization has created AGI would resolve the question as **Yes**, including in informal settings such as podcast appearances, interviews, or X.com. Statements that do not clearly attribute a position to the organization or CEO are not sufficient. For example, if a CEO were to say \"I think that the AI system we have developed would satisfy some definitions of AGI\" that would **not** be sufficient, because it does not clearly state a belief in having developed AGI under a definition they hold, only that they believe it satisfies definitions of AGI that others hold.\n* There are no requirements on the AI system that is referred to as AGI, there need not be public details, access, or announcements about such a system. However, a statement must refer to a system that the lab claims it has developed. A statement such as \"We are currently developing AGI\" or \"We are currently training AGI\" is not sufficient. Claims will generally be taken at face value, for example a claim that AGI has been developed will be sufficient, even if there is evidence to the contrary indicating that the system has not been completed.\n* Metaculus will assess potentially qualifying statements and reporting and make a determination as to whether the criteria were satisfied. In the event of unclear statements, Metaculus may wait for clarifications or additional context or resolve the question as **ambiguous**.\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n## 1. Key Historical Trends and Current Status\n\n- Generative AI adoption and research progress have surged since 2022, with labs like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Meta explicitly targeting AGI as a research goal[5][3].\n- No major AI lab has yet made a formal, top-leadership claim of AGI as defined by the resolution criteria.\n- Surveys of AI experts show wide disagreement: while a majority (76%) believe AGI is \"unlikely\" to result from simply scaling current methods, a substantial minority and some prominent lab leaders predict AGI could arrive as early as 2025\u20132028[2][4].\n- Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) publicly stated in late 2024 that AGI is now \"just an engineering problem\" and could be achieved in 2025, reflecting increasing confidence among some leaders[5].\n- Technical progress in large language models, autonomous agents, and robotics fuels the perception of rapid approach to AGI, but as of late 2024, these systems still lack general human-level flexibility and autonomy[4].\n\n## 2. Recent Announcements and Policies Affecting the Metric\n\n- OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta, and xAI have all publicly discussed AGI timelines, with some leaders (Altman, Musk) suggesting 2025\u20132028 as plausible dates[2][5].\n- There have been isolated claims from employees or outside commentators that AGI has been achieved, but none from qualifying lab leaders or in the requisite formal capacity as of December 2024[2].\n- No significant new regulations or standards have been set requiring labs to announce AGI, but growing societal and governmental scrutiny may influence lab communication strategies.\n\n## 3. Authoritative Sources for Verification\n\n- Leadership interviews (e.g., Altman interview, Y Combinator[5])\n- Industry surveys and meta-analyses of AGI predictions[2][4]\n- Public statements and official blogs from major labs (OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta)\n- Media reports on AI industry milestones and claims[1][3]\n\n## 4. Limitations and Uncertainties in Measurement\n\n- **Definition ambiguity:** AGI remains a contested and fuzzy concept; what constitutes a \"claim\" depends on interpretation and context[5].\n- **Incentives and caution:** Labs may hesitate to make official AGI claims due to reputational, regulatory, or commercial concerns.\n- **Survey uncertainty:** Expert timelines vary widely; while confidence in near-term AGI is rising, most still expect it later (post-2030)[2][4].\n- **Benchmarking:** No universally accepted test for AGI exists, making claims subject to debate even if made.\n\n## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n\n- The probability that a major AI lab will claim to have developed AGI in 2025 is **substantially higher than in previous years**, likely in the range of 10\u201330% given current trends and recent leadership rhetoric, but **most experts still expect formal AGI claims to occur later**, unless there is a strategic or competitive incentive for a lab to make such a declaration[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1].

AGI will enable generative AI systems to reason across specialties, apply evolving clinical guidelines, and solve complex medical problems without being explicitly programmed for each scenario. This will challenge the long-held belief that humans are inherently better than machines at delivering medical care. Once AI can match physicians in reasoning and accuracy, patients and clinicians will be forced to reconsider what it means to 'trust the doctor.' AGI will also transform medical practice, making it possible to integrate information from multiple specialties to diagnose patients and recommend treatment with human-level accuracy. However, the integration of AGI will depend on who leads it, and if clinicians fail to shape the next era of medical care, business executives will, prioritizing profit over patient outcomes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 07:15 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/robertpearl\/2025\/05\/12\/what-happens-to-medicine-when-machines-are-as-good-as-doctors\/)\n\n**12 European and American AI Startups Making Significant Contributions to AGI**\nThe article highlights 12 European and American AI startups that are making significant contributions to the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

While significant progress has been made, achieving human-level AI by 2025 is a daunting task. Researchers are grappling with challenges such as understanding human consciousness, generalizing from limited data, and ensuring that AGI aligns with human values. If achieved, AGI could automate jobs, revolutionize healthcare, and accelerate scientific discoveries, but also poses existential risks. To prepare for the potential impact of AGI, individuals, organizations, and governments must invest in education and reskilling programs, establish ethical guidelines, and work together to share knowledge and resources. The development of AGI is a moral and philosophical challenge that requires caution, curiosity, and a commitment to the greater good.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 04, 2025 09:01 AM\nSource:[DEV Community](https:\/\/dev.to\/levitation_infotech\/the-2025-agi-countdown-are-we-on-the-brink-of-human-level-ai-2o65)\n\n**Challenges Facing the Development of Artificial General Intelligence**\nA report by 475 researchers in the field found that 76% of them believe that achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is 'unlikely' or 'very unlikely'. This setback is a major challenge for the tech industries that expected that improvements in current models through more data and power would lead to AGI. Since the 2022 AI boom, expectations have focused on increasing resources to surpass human intelligence. However, despite the significant increase in funding, progress has slowed significantly. According to Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, 'since the release of GPT-4, it has become clear that the expansion of models has been gradual and costly. Companies have already invested heavily, and they cannot retreat due to financial pressure.' The innovative basic structure called 'Transformers', developed by Google scientists in 2017, has contributed to the improvement of AI model capabilities. However, continuous expansion requires massive resources of power and money. The AI-generated sector attracted around $56 billion in venture capital in 2024, with a significant portion of this money being used to build massive data centers that have increased carbon emissions threefold since 2018. With the depletion of usable human data by the end of this decade, companies will be forced to either use data generated by AI itself or collect user data, exposing models to additional error risks. Despite this, the limitation of current models is not only due to resources but also to structural limitations in the way these models are trained.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 31, 2025 03:31 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https:\/\/arabic.rt.com\/technology\/1659485-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A\/)\n\n**Kevin Veyl: AGI is on the Verge of Being Developed**\nKevin Veyl, the CPO of OpenAI, believes that AGI is on the verge of being developed and will be available this year.

At a high-profile summit in Paris, France has prioritized AI 'action' in 2025, shifting the focus away from safety concerns. Anne Bouverot, AI envoy for President Emmanuel Macron, said, 'We don't want to spend our time talking only about the risks. There's the very real opportunity aspect as well.' Max Tegmark, head of the Future of Life Institute, warned that France should not miss the opportunity to act, saying, 'There is a big fork in the road here at the Paris summit and it should be embraced.' The Global Risk and AI Safety Preparedness (GRASP) platform has been launched to map major risks linked to AI and solutions being developed around the world. The International AI Safety Report has outlined risks such as fake content online, biological attacks, and cyberattacks. Yoshua Bengio, coordinator of the report, fears a possible 'loss of control' by humans over AI systems, potentially motivated by 'their own will to survive.' Experts warn that the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) could lead to a loss of control over AI systems, with some predicting that AGI could be achieved by 2026 or 2027. 'At worst, these American or Chinese companies lose control over this, and then after that Earth will be run by machines,' said Tegmark. Stuart Russell, a computer science professor, said one of his greatest fears is 'weapons systems where the AI that is controlling that weapon system is deciding who to attack, when to attack, and so on.' Tegmark said the solution is to treat the AI industry the same way all other industries are, with government-appointed experts ensuring that AI systems are safe and do not pose a risk to human control.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:45 AM\nSource:[The News International](https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/latest\/1280957-experts-warn-of-ai-loss-of-control-urge-regulation)\n\n**AI Medicine to be Tested in 2025, Says Researcher**\nDemis Hassabis, founder of Isomorphic Labs, a startup founded by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, announced that they will have a medicine designed by artificial intelligence in clinical trials by the end of 2025. The company is working on oncology, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases, and Hassabis believes that they will have their first medicine by the end of the year. 'We're looking at oncology, cardiovascular, neurodegeneration, all the big areas of diseases, and I think we'll have our first medicine by the end of this year,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times at the World Economic Forum. Hassabis also mentioned that the development of medicines can be accelerated by 10 times, which would be a revolution in human health. Isomorphic Labs was spun off from Google's AI research arm, Google DeepMind, in 2021, but remains a subsidiary of Alphabet. The startup has attracted major pharmaceutical partners, who are eager to reduce costs and increase efficiency in the expensive process of developing medicines. Hassabis also mentioned that the prototype of Google's AI assistant, known as Project Astra, will likely be launched for consumers this year. He described a future where 'billions' of AI agents will be 'negotiating with each other on behalf of the seller and the customer,' and said that this would require a reevaluation of the web. Hassabis also called for more caution and coordination among the main developers of AI, warning that the technology could threaten human civilization if it gets out of control or is misused by 'malicious actors... for harmful purposes.' The ultimate goal of Google DeepMind is to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) or 'a system capable of exhibiting all the cognitive abilities that humans have,' according to Hassabis, who said that despite the 'hype' on social media, it will still take 5-10 years to achieve.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 09:03 AM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https:\/\/www1.folha.uol.com.br\/tec\/2025\/01\/remedio-desenvolvido-por-ia-sera-testado-ate-o-final-do-ano-diz-vencedor-do-nobel.shtml)\n\n**The Future of AI: A Roadmap to AGI**\nLeopold Aschenbrenner, a researcher at OpenAI, has written a detailed description of what will happen in the field of AI in the next 10 years. He predicts that the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will begin soon, and by 2025-2026, machines will surpass many university graduates in intelligence. By the end of the decade, they will become smarter than humans, and we will have a super-intelligence in the true sense of the word. According to Aschenbrenner, the transition to AGI will be rapid, and we will reach a point where predicting events will become difficult. He also notes that the current rate of progress in AI is unsustainable and that we will soon reach a point where we will need to automate the research process itself. Aschenbrenner emphasizes that models simply want to learn and that they are not malicious. He also highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of current AI systems and the potential risks associated with their development. He notes that the two main players in this process are Nvidia and TSMC, and that the US and China will soon realize the importance of controlling the export of GPU and will impose strict regulations. He also warns that the development of AGI will be a game-changer and that the first to achieve it will have a significant advantage over others. Finally, he notes that the development of AGI will also raise questions about the alignment of AI models with human values and the potential risks associated with their development.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 05:01 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https:\/\/habr.com\/ru\/companies\/raft\/articles\/875830\/)\n\n**AI Expert Stuart Russell: AGI Requires Conceptual Breakthrough, Unlikely to Appear in 2026**\nStuart J.

The most optimistic view is that the technology may reach AGI levels by 2026, but Russell believes that a true conceptual breakthrough is needed for deep learning systems, particularly large models, to surpass current limitations. He thinks it is unlikely that AGI will appear in 2026. 'We need a conceptual breakthrough, not just more data and more computing power,' Russell said. 'We need to understand how to make machines that are more intelligent than humans, and that's a much harder problem than just scaling up what we have today.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 09:03 PM\nSource:[\u5373\u6642\u65b0\u805e instant news](https:\/\/news.mingpao.com\/pns\/%e7%b6%93%e6%bf%9f\/article\/20250115\/s00004\/1736871782398\/ai%e5%ad%b8%e8%80%85%e7%be%85%e7%b4%a0-agi%e9%9c%80%e6%a6%82%e5%bf%b5%e7%aa%81%e7%a0%b4-%e6%98%8e%e5%b9%b4%e9%9b%a3%e5%87%ba%e7%8f%be)\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is 2025-05-12\n\nBefore answering you write:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n\nYou write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.\n\nThe last thing you write is your final answer as: \"Probability: ZZ%\", 0-100",

A statement by Trump saying he could invoke the Act would not qualify.\u00a0\n\n\\- Metaculus will resolve this question according to [<u>credible sources<\/u>](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/faq\/#definitions).\n\nYour research assistant reports:\n# Forecasting Analysis: Will President Trump Invoke the Insurrection Act Before 2026?\n\nAs of January 31, 2025, several factors suggest an increased probability that President Trump may formally invoke the Insurrection Act before 2026. This analysis examines the current situation, key indicators, and provides a probabilistic assessment.\n\n## Current Status and Recent Developments\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the United States, claiming \"America's sovereignty is under attack.\"[3] This executive order directed the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit reports within 90 days (by April 20, 2025) that include recommendations on whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807.[2][3]\n\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807 gives the president authority to deploy the National Guard or federal armed forces to address \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States.\"[2] This represents a significant potential escalation in the administration's approach to border security and immigration enforcement.\n\n## Comparative Analysis and Key Indicators\n\n### Historical Precedent and Legal Framework\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been invoked relatively rarely in American history. While the Act provides broad authority, it exists in tension with the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prevents the federal military from acting as a police force unless explicitly authorized by Congress or the Constitution.[2]\n\n### Administration Signals and Rhetoric\n\nSeveral indicators suggest an elevated probability of invocation:\n\n1. **Direct Consideration in Executive Order**: The explicit mention of the Insurrection Act in the January 20 executive order demonstrates that invoking the Act is under active consideration at the highest levels of the administration.[2][3]\n\n2. **National Emergency Declaration**: The declaration of a national emergency at the southern border creates a framework that could be used to justify more extreme measures.[3]\n\n3. **Cabinet-Level Assessment**: The assignment of this assessment to the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security indicates serious consideration rather than merely rhetorical posturing.[2]\n\n## Probabilistic Assessment\n\nBased on the information available as of January 31, 2025, I assess the probability of President Trump formally invoking the Insurrection Act before January 1, 2026, as follows:\n\n**Probability: 55-65%**\n\nThis assessment is based on:\n\n- The explicit consideration of the Insurrection Act in official executive actions\n- The administration's characterization of the situation at the southern border as a crisis requiring extraordinary measures\n- The formal process established to evaluate invoking the Act\n- The administration's demonstrated willingness to use executive authority expansively\n\n## Limitations and Uncertainties\n\nThis forecast faces several key uncertainties:\n\n1. **Cabinet Recommendations**: The content of the recommendations from the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, due April 20, 2025, will significantly influence the likelihood of invocation.\n\n2. **Evolving Border Situation**: Changes in migration patterns or border security incidents could substantially shift the administration's calculus.\n\n3. **Legal and Political Resistance**: Potential legal challenges or political opposition could affect the administration's decision-making.\n\n4. **Alternative Policy Approaches**: The administration may find other policy mechanisms to achieve similar objectives without formally invoking the Insurrection Act.\n\nThis forecast should be updated as new information becomes available, particularly after the submission of the cabinet-level recommendations in April 2025.\n\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Trump's 'Great and Beautiful' Law: A Battle for Medicaid and the US Budget**\nUS President Donald Trump is pushing lawmakers to quickly pass his 'great and beautiful' law, which includes extending massive tax credits from his first term, set to expire at the end of the year. However, to compensate for the costly measure, Republicans plan to make significant cuts in public spending. The first target is Medicaid, a public health insurance program for low-income Americans. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has unveiled its portion of the measures, aiming to achieve $880 billion in federal spending reductions over the next decade. Most of these savings come from reducing the scope of Medicaid and eliminating incentives for renewable energy adopted under Joe Biden. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these measures would reduce the number of people with health insurance by at least 8.6 million by 2034. The Democratic counterpart to Brett Guthrie, the committee's Republican chairman, denounced the cuts as 'catastrophic' and warned that millions of Americans would lose their health coverage, hospitals would close, and seniors would not have access to necessary care. Another committee is set to discuss reductions in food aid for the poorest Americans, which could reach several hundred billion dollars. If adopted by committees in the coming days, the text could head to the House floor in the coming weeks, before being examined by the Senate. However, if the bill faces opposition from Democrats, the divisions within the Republican camp may also derail it. Moderates fear that significant cuts to Medicaid could pose an electoral risk before the mid-term elections in November 2026. Some conservatives, on the other hand, think the cuts do not go far enough, and threaten not to vote for the text unless their demands are met. One of them, Texas Representative Chip Roy, said he hopes Republican leaders will develop a backup plan, as he will not vote for the current bill as is.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[LExpress.fr](https:\/\/www.lexpress.fr\/monde\/semaine-cruciale-au-congres-americain-pour-trump-et-son-programme-B54VI5EXMFEUFDAROT4SW2B3MM\/)\n\n**Extend Trump's tax cuts, pay for it by repealing Biden's climate handouts**\nPresident Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is set to expire at the end of the year, and Democrats are pushing for a $4.5 trillion tax increase.

Trump recently warned Republicans that a tax increase would ruin their chances of success in 2026. If the tax cuts expire, an automatic $4.5 trillion tax hike will land on working families, with the average taxpayer facing a 22 percent tax hike. Republicans must use the budget framework to extend and expand the Trump tax cuts through a final Reconciliation bill. This is the test of whether they intend to do anything with the mandate they were given.

The FY 2026 NDAA will include provisions for defense spending, including a topline funding request of $1.01 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOD request is for $892.6 billion plus $119.3 billion, which would be added to the overall FY 2026 funding should congressional Republicans pass a reconciliation bill. The HASC has released a reconciliation bill with 11 primary funding objectives, including improving capacity across the maritime industrial base and integrated air and missile defense. The bill was approved by a bipartisan vote of 35-21. The DOD has also announced several initiatives, including the Software Fast Track (SWFT) Initiative, which aims to reform the way the DOD acquires, tests, and authorizes secure software. Additionally, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Army to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy, including streamlining force structure, eliminating wasteful spending, and reforming the acquisition process. President Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at acquisition reform, including 'Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base,' which directs the defense secretary to provide a plan for accomplishing this goal by giving a 'first preference' for acquisition of commercial solutions and a 'general preference' for use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 02:48 AM\nSource:[Lexology](https:\/\/www.lexology.com\/library\/detail.aspx?g=5c0fbe1a-4699-47e3-a3fb-0decbc199b9a)\n\n**US Treasury Secretary Warns Congress of Potential Debt Default in August**\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Congress that if no action is taken, the US government may be unable to pay its debt as early as August. Bessent urged Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling before July 15. In a letter to House Speaker Johnson, Bessent stated that after evaluating the April tax situation, the Treasury Department believes that it is likely to exhaust all means and cash by August to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt. 'Given that Congress will be in recess during the summer, I urge Congress to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling before the recess begins on July 15 to ensure the US fulfills its responsibility to pay its debts.' Bessent emphasized that any default on US debt would have a significant impact on the US financial system, as well as harm US national security and international leadership. The US Congress is currently discussing President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction plan, which is expected to be a critical period in the coming weeks, and is closely related to the X date. The US Treasury Department currently has a debt of over $36 trillion, exceeding the debt ceiling. In 2023, Congress passed a law temporarily allowing the government to disregard the debt ceiling until January 1 of this year. Since then, the Treasury Department has begun using extraordinary measures to prevent Washington from defaulting on its debt. The US Congressional Budget Office had previously stated in March that the X date may occur as early as August. At a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee on the Trump administration's budget proposal, Bessent said that Congress will eventually raise or suspend the debt ceiling again, and the Trump administration will not use any 'stopgap measures' to avoid the debt ceiling issue.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 04:03 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u5947\u6469\u80a1\u5e02](https:\/\/tw.stock.yahoo.com\/news\/%E8%B2%9D%E6%A3%AE%E7%89%B9%E8%AD%A6%E5%91%8A%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%83%E7%A8%B1-%E8%8B%A5%E4%B8%8D%E6%8E%A1%E5%8F%96%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%80%E5%BF%AB8%E6%9C%88%E7%84%A1%E5%8A%9B%E5%84%9F%E9%82%84%E5%82%B5%E5%8B%99-000344508.html)\n\n**Trump proposes major Medicare drug plan changes**\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. The order would implement a 'most favored nation' policy, tying the prices of certain Medicare-covered drugs to those paid by other developed countries. This move could offer meaningful relief from high out-of-pocket drug costs for the 53 million people enrolled in Medicare Part D. According to a 2024 RAND Corporation report, U.S. prescription drug prices in 2022 were nearly three times higher than those in 33 other developed countries. Diane Daniels, founder of Medicare Nation, says, 'People may have forgotten that President Trump initiated the 'American Patients First' blueprint in May of 2018, which aimed to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs for Americans.' The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has already allowed HHS to negotiate with drug manufacturers, and Medicare has negotiated lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. Starting in January 2026, 10 Medicare Part D negotiated prescription medications are set to offer beneficiaries a 38%-79% discount on these medications. The IRA also introduced a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs beginning in 2025. Tom Clark, a Social Security and Medicare consultant, says, 'Beginning this year, persons with Medicare Part D plans have a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for covered medications.' The potential implementation of the 'most favored nation' approach could have far-reaching implications for Medicare beneficiaries, but the pharmaceutical industry has historically opposed such pricing reforms. 'Trump's executive order will expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country, which has predominantly been a ball of red tape,' said Daniels. 'How the executive order will work alongside current tariffs is another issue.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 01:17 PM\nSource:[TheStreet](https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/retirement\/trump-proposes-major-medicare-drug-plan-changes)\n\n**Sheinbaum Defends T-MEC Amid Trump's Commercial War**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that her government will defend the North American Trade Agreement (T-MEC) with the US and Canada, amidst a commercial war launched by US President Donald Trump. The trade agreement, which has been in place since 1994 and was renewed as T-MEC in 2020, is crucial for Mexico's economy, which sends over 80% of its exports to the US, totaling $531 billion in 2024. 'We will defend the T-MEC because it has been beneficial for the three countries. If President Trump makes a different proposal, we will be prepared for any circumstance, but obviously we want the T-MEC to remain in place,' Sheinbaum said. She highlighted that the T-MEC is set to be reviewed every six years, with the first review scheduled for July 2026. Sheinbaum also noted that Trump stated in comments made on Tuesday that the current agreement 'is much better' than the old NAFTA. 'In his statement (Trump) says, 'it will be reviewed in 2026' and we will see what happens. So far, we have no other signal that the T-MEC is going to disappear,' Sheinbaum said. She added that despite Trump's tariff offensive since taking office, the benefits of the trade agreement remain in place for most of Mexico's exported goods. 'The T-MEC has remained in place in many areas, with the exception of some issues in the automotive and steel and aluminum sectors, which we are working on,' Sheinbaum argued. In 2023, Mexico surpassed China to become the US's largest trading partner, a position that could be consolidated amidst the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has kept the threat of new tariffs against Mexico and Canada, accusing them of not doing enough to combat fentanyl trafficking and irregular migration at the border.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[rotativo.com.mx](https:\/\/rotativo.com.mx\/nacionales\/mexico\/vamos-defender-t-mec-dice-presidenta-mexico_1527323_102.html)\n\n**US House Republicans to End Electric Vehicle Tax Credit a Year Early**\nThe US House of Representatives' Republican majority has decided to end the electric vehicle tax credit, which is based on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a year earlier than planned. According to the Wall Street Journal, the House Ways and Means Committee included a provision in the tax bill to repeal the IRA's electric vehicle tax credit (30D) by 2027. The original deadline for the tax credit was December 31, 2022, but it was moved up to December 31, 2026. However, for electric vehicles purchased in 2026, the tax credit will be eliminated if the manufacturer has sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles in the US between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025. The IRA allows taxpayers who purchase electric vehicles assembled in North America and meet certain battery and mineral requirements to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500. However, as President Trump is negative towards electric vehicles and needs to raise funds for his tax cuts, the Republican Party is expected to eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit, along with other clean energy initiatives from the previous Biden administration. The Republican bill also includes a provision to eliminate the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles, such as leased or rented vehicles, to claim the tax credit even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This exception was introduced to accommodate the requests of the Korean government and industry, but some Republicans have criticized it as a 'loophole' that goes against the intent of the law. The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be eliminated.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 10:48 PM\nSource:[KBS](https:\/\/news.kbs.co.kr\/news\/pc\/view\/view.do?ncd=8251784)\n\n**Trump's 'Great and Beautiful' Law: A Battle for Medicaid and the US Budget**\nUS President Donald Trump is pushing lawmakers to quickly pass his 'great and beautiful' law, which includes extending massive tax credits from his first term, set to expire at the end of the year.

The FY 2026 NDAA will include provisions for defense spending, including a topline funding request of $1.01 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOD request is for $892.6 billion plus $119.3 billion, which would be added to the overall FY 2026 funding should congressional Republicans pass a reconciliation bill. The HASC has released a reconciliation bill with 11 primary funding objectives, including improving capacity across the maritime industrial base and integrated air and missile defense. The bill was approved by a bipartisan vote of 35-21. The DOD has also announced several initiatives, including the Software Fast Track (SWFT) Initiative, which aims to reform the way the DOD acquires, tests, and authorizes secure software. Additionally, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Army to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy, including streamlining force structure, eliminating wasteful spending, and reforming the acquisition process. President Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at acquisition reform, including 'Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base,' which directs the defense secretary to provide a plan for accomplishing this goal by giving a 'first preference' for acquisition of commercial solutions and a 'general preference' for use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 12, 2025 02:48 AM\nSource:[Lexology](https:\/\/www.lexology.com\/library\/detail.aspx?g=5c0fbe1a-4699-47e3-a3fb-0decbc199b9a)\n\n**US Treasury Secretary Warns Congress of Potential Debt Default in August**\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Congress that if no action is taken, the US government may be unable to pay its debt as early as August. Bessent urged Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling before July 15. In a letter to House Speaker Johnson, Bessent stated that after evaluating the April tax situation, the Treasury Department believes that it is likely to exhaust all means and cash by August to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt. 'Given that Congress will be in recess during the summer, I urge Congress to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling before the recess begins on July 15 to ensure the US fulfills its responsibility to pay its debts.' Bessent emphasized that any default on US debt would have a significant impact on the US financial system, as well as harm US national security and international leadership. The US Congress is currently discussing President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction plan, which is expected to be a critical period in the coming weeks, and is closely related to the X date. The US Treasury Department currently has a debt of over $36 trillion, exceeding the debt ceiling. In 2023, Congress passed a law temporarily allowing the government to disregard the debt ceiling until January 1 of this year. Since then, the Treasury Department has begun using extraordinary measures to prevent Washington from defaulting on its debt. The US Congressional Budget Office had previously stated in March that the X date may occur as early as August. At a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee on the Trump administration's budget proposal, Bessent said that Congress will eventually raise or suspend the debt ceiling again, and the Trump administration will not use any 'stopgap measures' to avoid the debt ceiling issue.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 04:03 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u5947\u6469\u80a1\u5e02](https:\/\/tw.stock.yahoo.com\/news\/%E8%B2%9D%E6%A3%AE%E7%89%B9%E8%AD%A6%E5%91%8A%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%83%E7%A8%B1-%E8%8B%A5%E4%B8%8D%E6%8E%A1%E5%8F%96%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%80%E5%BF%AB8%E6%9C%88%E7%84%A1%E5%8A%9B%E5%84%9F%E9%82%84%E5%82%B5%E5%8B%99-000344508.html)\n\n**Trump proposes major Medicare drug plan changes**\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. The order would implement a 'most favored nation' policy, tying the prices of certain Medicare-covered drugs to those paid by other developed countries. This move could offer meaningful relief from high out-of-pocket drug costs for the 53 million people enrolled in Medicare Part D. According to a 2024 RAND Corporation report, U.S. prescription drug prices in 2022 were nearly three times higher than those in 33 other developed countries. Diane Daniels, founder of Medicare Nation, says, 'People may have forgotten that President Trump initiated the 'American Patients First' blueprint in May of 2018, which aimed to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs for Americans.' The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has already allowed HHS to negotiate with drug manufacturers, and Medicare has negotiated lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. Starting in January 2026, 10 Medicare Part D negotiated prescription medications are set to offer beneficiaries a 38%-79% discount on these medications. The IRA also introduced a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs beginning in 2025. Tom Clark, a Social Security and Medicare consultant, says, 'Beginning this year, persons with Medicare Part D plans have a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for covered medications.' The potential implementation of the 'most favored nation' approach could have far-reaching implications for Medicare beneficiaries, but the pharmaceutical industry has historically opposed such pricing reforms. 'Trump's executive order will expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country, which has predominantly been a ball of red tape,' said Daniels. 'How the executive order will work alongside current tariffs is another issue.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: May 11, 2025 01:17 PM\nSource:[TheStreet](https:\/\/www.thestreet.com\/retirement\/trump-proposes-major-medicare-drug-plan-changes)\n\n**Sheinbaum Defends T-MEC Amid Trump's Commercial War**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that her government will defend the North American Trade Agreement (T-MEC) with the US and Canada, amidst a commercial war launched by US President Donald Trump. The trade agreement, which has been in place since 1994 and was renewed as T-MEC in 2020, is crucial for Mexico's economy, which sends over 80% of its exports to the US, totaling $531 billion in 2024. 'We will defend the T-MEC because it has been beneficial for the three countries. If President Trump makes a different proposal, we will be prepared for any circumstance, but obviously we want the T-MEC to remain in place,' Sheinbaum said. She highlighted that the T-MEC is set to be reviewed every six years, with the first review scheduled for July 2026. Sheinbaum also noted that Trump stated in comments made on Tuesday that the current agreement 'is much better' than the old NAFTA. 'In his statement (Trump) says, 'it will be reviewed in 2026' and we will see what happens. So far, we have no other signal that the T-MEC is going to disappear,' Sheinbaum said. She added that despite Trump's tariff offensive since taking office, the benefits of the trade agreement remain in place for most of Mexico's exported goods. 'The T-MEC has remained in place in many areas, with the exception of some issues in the automotive and steel and aluminum sectors, which we are working on,' Sheinbaum argued. In 2023, Mexico surpassed China to become the US's largest trading partner, a position that could be consolidated amidst the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has kept the threat of new tariffs against Mexico and Canada, accusing them of not doing enough to combat fentanyl trafficking and irregular migration at the border.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: May 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[rotativo.com.mx](https:\/\/rotativo.com.mx\/nacionales\/mexico\/vamos-defender-t-mec-dice-presidenta-mexico_1527323_102.html)\n\n**Trump Says He Won't Remove Fed Chair Powell, Says Good Parts Of Economy Are His Doing**\nUS President Donald Trump stated that he will not remove Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Board chairman before his term ends in 2026, describing Powell as 'a total stiff' and calling for the Fed to lower interest rates. Trump attributed a first-quarter contraction in the US economy to former President Joe Biden's policies and claimed that his own moves to upend the global trading system with higher tariffs would eventually make Americans rich. Trump also sent mixed messages on the economy, dismissing concerns about a first-quarter decline in GDP and arguing that his predecessor was to blame for any economic weakness. Trump's whipsaw moves on tariffs have sparked the most volatile weeks on Wall Street since the early part of the COVID pandemic five years ago. Trump said, 'It partially is right now. And I really mean this. I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because he's done a terrible job.'

Trump also stated that he does not seek a third term as president, saying 'I'm not looking for a third term'. Additionally, he declared that he will not remove Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chairman before the end of his term in May 2026, calling Powell 'completely rigid' and repeating his calls for the Fed to lower interest rates. Trump stated that Powell is not a fan of his, but expects the Fed to lower interest rates at some point. 'Well, they should lower them. And at some point they will. They don't want to because they're not a fan of mine', he said, claiming that he does not like Powell because he finds him to be 'totally rigid and unable'. When asked if he would remove Powell before the end of his term, Trump firmly denied it, saying 'No, no, no... why should I? I can replace that person soon enough'. The US president also intends to extend the deadline for TikTok if no agreement is reached. In the NBC News interview, Trump refused to rule out the possibility of making some tariffs permanent, saying 'No, I wouldn't do that, because if someone thought they would be taken off the table, why would they build in the United States?

One possibility is to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807, a historic law that would give the president the power to deploy military troops in emergency internal situations. This power could allow him to take more drastic measures against illegal immigration, a move that many see as a radical step in his immigration policy. According to Laura Dickinson, a constitutional law expert, the use of this law would be a unprecedented gesture and could generate additional tensions between the executive branch and the military. Trump has already signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, declaring a national emergency on the border and requesting a 90-day report from the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, to evaluate the migration situation and recommend whether to invoke the Insurrection Act.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: April 21, 2025 09:26 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https:\/\/larepublica.pe\/estados-unidos\/2025\/04\/21\/malas-noticias-para-inmigrantes-la-antigua-ley-que-trump-podria-usar-para-endurecer-la-persecucion-a-inmigrantes-en-eeuu-lrtmus-1494507)\n\n**On April 20th, 2025, the United States will Cross the Point of No Return.**\nThe author warns that on April 20th, 2025, the United States may initiate its final steps into authoritarian rule.

He may make a decision this Sunday; here's what Americans need to watch out for**\nPresident Donald Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act, a centuries-old law that would allow active-duty military troops to arrest migrants and support law enforcement inside the U.S. However, top officials at the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, are not recommending Trump take that step. According to a DHS source, the current low levels of migrant crossings, with fewer than 300 people crossing the southern border illegally each day, do not require military involvement. Trump signed an executive order in January 2025 calling the situation at the southern border a national emergency, and Hegseth and Noem have 90 days to assess the border and recommend whether the Insurrection Act should be used. The deadline is this Sunday, April 21. Despite growing frustration within Trump's inner circle about the pace of interior arrests of undocumented immigrants, it appears unlikely that Trump will immediately invoke the Insurrection Act based on current border conditions and the recommendation from his top defense and homeland security chiefs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: April 19, 2025 01:03 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/international\/us\/what-is-the-insurrection-act-and-will-donald-trump-invoke-it-he-may-make-a-decision-this-sunday-heres-what-americans-need-to-watch-out-for\/articleshow\/120433315.cms)\n\n**A Conspiracy Theory That Is Being Pushed By The Left Claims That Something Really Big Is Going To Happen On April 20th**\nA conspiracy theory spreading on social media claims that President Trump will declare martial law in the United States on April 20th.

Growth remains positive but modest, with year-on-year BEV share gains usually in the 0.5\u20131 percentage point range[1]. Major industry forecasters expect BEV market share to hold steady or rise only slightly in 2025, with J.D. Power projecting a 9.1% BEV share for the full year[5]. If current trends continue, BEVs will remain below 10% of monthly new light-duty vehicle sales before October 2025.\n\n(c) **A scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  \nThe most likely scenario, based on current data and projections, is continued moderate growth in BEV sales volume, offset by robust overall new vehicle sales (due in part to post-pandemic recovery and recent tariff-driven inventory surges), plus rising competition from hybrids. BEV market share stays below the 10% monthly threshold through September 2025 and does not cross it before October 2025[1][5].\n\n(d) **A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  \nA less likely but plausible scenario would involve a sudden uptick in BEV adoption, such as the launch and strong delivery of a mass-market, affordably priced electric vehicle, a temporary reinstatement or expansion of federal\/state incentives, or a spike in gasoline prices. These could push monthly BEV share above 10% by late summer or early fall 2025. This would likely require a 2.5+ percentage point gain in share within a few months\u2014much faster than current trends indicate and outpacing recent growth rates[1][5].\n\n---\n\n## Rationale\n\nU.S. BEV market share is growing, but the pace has slowed compared to the 2021\u20132023 \u201ctipping point\u201d phase. As of Q1 2025, BEVs have not crossed the 10% monthly share threshold, sitting at 7.5%[1]. Recent months have shown uneven momentum: while new models from GM, Honda, and others have contributed incremental volume, overall growth is dampened by higher interest rates, uncertain policy support, competition from hybrids, and reduced demand for premium models[1][5].\n\nMost credible industry forecasts for 2025 expect BEVs to account for about 9\u201310% of new LDV sales for the year, with few predicting a sustained or sudden jump above 10% in any given month before October[5]. Moreover, recent fluctuations in monthly sales\u2014including several months of BEV sales declines and surges in total vehicle demand\u2014suggest that the 10% mark is unlikely to be reached without significant near-term catalysts (policy, product, or economic shocks)[5].\n\nEmpirical international patterns point to 2\u20134 years for a market to grow from 5% to 10% BEV share after reaching the tipping point. The U.S. hit 5% in late 2021; thus, a mid-to-late 2025 crossing of the 10% threshold would be historically consistent, but the specifics of U.S. market structure and recent headwinds make earlier achievement uncertain.

This would mean winning both major titles in the 2024\/25 season, satisfying the \"Yes\" criteria.\n\n---\n\n## Rationale and Probability Assessment\n\nBarcelona's track record in recent years has been exceptional:  \n- They have won six consecutive Liga F titles and are the dominant force in Spain and Europe[2][5].\n- Their 2024\/25 league campaign was marked by an overwhelming points total, high-scoring wins, and record goal difference, even though they suffered two defeats in the league\u2014more than in any of their previous five campaigns[5].\n- Ewa Pajor leads both the league and overall team scoring, highlighting their attacking depth[2].\n\n**Current status:**  \n- Barcelona has completed the Liga F season as champions, fulfilling the first half of the double[2][5].\n- They are scheduled to face Arsenal in the Champions League final, with form and experience on their side but with the outcome undecided as of now[2].\n\n**Finals are unpredictable** in knockout football, but Barcelona's experience, talent (Ballon d'Or winners like Aitana Bonmat\u00ed, prolific scorers like Pajor), and recent Champions League pedigree (three titles since 2021) make them clear favorites. However, Arsenal, as finalists, have also demonstrated quality and the ability to win on the European stage.\n\n**Forecaster's logic:**  \n- The world changes slowly: Barcelona's dominance is entrenched, and their squad is at its peak.  \n- However, single-game finals can hinge on small incidents: red cards, injuries, penalties, nerves. Even the strongest favorite loses finals (as history in both men's and women's football shows).\n- Market odds in similar real-world situations for a favorite of Barcelona's caliber in a major final would typically run from 60%\u201375% to win, depending on relative team strength.\n\n**Status quo moderately favors Yes (probability >50%)** due to Barcelona's clear superiority and recent form, but not overwhelmingly so due to the high-variance nature of a one-off final.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 72%**  \n\n- This reflects Barcelona's exceptional dominance, recent Champions League pedigree, and current unbeaten run in high-stakes matches, balanced against the inherent unpredictability of a cup final against a quality Arsenal side. The most likely outcome is that Barcelona will complete the double, but an Arsenal win remains a credible risk.",
        "2":"(a) Time left until outcome: 7 months and 19 days (until December 31, 2025)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: No major AI lab has yet claimed to have developed AGI, though several leaders have discussed timelines and progress toward AGI.\n\n(c) No outcome scenario: AI labs continue making incremental progress but remain cautious about making definitive AGI claims due to reputational risks, regulatory concerns, and the fuzzy definition of AGI. Leaders like Hassabis and Altman continue to discuss AGI as a near-future goal but avoid declaring they've achieved it in 2025.\n\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: A competitive dynamic emerges between major labs, with one (likely OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or xAI) achieving a significant breakthrough in AI capabilities that they believe constitutes AGI. Under competitive pressure and seeking to establish historical primacy, a CEO like Sam Altman or Demis Hassabis makes a public claim of AGI achievement.\n\nAs a professional forecaster, I'll assess the likelihood of a major AI lab claiming to have developed AGI in 2025 based on the available evidence.\n\n## Current Landscape of AGI Development\n\nThe AI landscape in mid-2025 shows accelerating progress toward more capable systems. Recently, major advances have been made in AI capabilities across multiple domains, with systems showing improved performance on benchmarks testing reasoning, programming, and scientific knowledge[4]. This progress has led some industry leaders to make increasingly confident statements about AGI timelines.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been particularly bullish, having stated in 2024 that AGI could arrive as soon as 2025, describing it as \"just an engineering problem\"[1]. More recently, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has indicated that AGI could be achieved within a 5-10 year timeframe, suggesting it's no longer a question of \"if\" but \"when\"[5]. These statements represent a notable shift in confidence compared to previous years.\n\n## Factors Supporting a 2025 AGI Claim\n\nSeveral factors increase the likelihood of a major lab making an AGI claim this year:\n\n**1. Competitive Dynamics**\n\nThe race to develop AGI has intensified, with multiple labs explicitly targeting it. This competitive environment creates incentives for organizations to stake claims of achievement. The first company to credibly claim AGI development would gain enormous prestige, potential funding advantages, and possibly regulatory influence.\n\n**2. Increasingly Bold Leadership Statements**\n\nLeadership at major labs has grown more confident in public statements about AGI timelines. Particularly notable are Sam Altman's predictions about 2025 and Demis Hassabis's shortened timeline estimates[1][5]. These statements may be preparing the ground for eventual claims.\n\n**3. Technical Progress**\n\nRecent benchmarks show rapid improvement in AI capabilities. The AI Index Report 2025 indicates substantial performance gains on challenging benchmarks, with scores rising 18.8, 48.9, and 67.3 percentage points on MMMU, GPQA, and SWE-bench respectively over just one year[4]. This pace of advancement exceeds what many expected.\n\n## Factors Against a 2025 AGI Claim\n\nSeveral countervailing factors make a 2025 AGI claim less likely:\n\n**1. Definition Ambiguity and Reputational Risk**\n\nAGI remains a contested concept without universal agreement on what constitutes achievement. Making a premature claim risks significant reputational damage if the system doesn't meet broader expectations of AGI. Most labs would prefer to underclaim rather than overclaim on such a historically significant achievement.\n\n**2. Expert Skepticism**\n\nA substantial majority (76%) of AI researchers believe AGI is \"unlikely\" to result from simply scaling current methods[5]. This expert skepticism creates a high bar for any claim to be taken seriously by the technical community.\n\n**3. Regulatory and Safety Concerns**\n\nClaiming AGI achievement would likely trigger intense regulatory scrutiny and safety debates. Labs may prefer to avoid these complications by continuing to frame their systems as approaching but not yet achieving AGI, especially given growing calls for stronger AI regulation[5].\n\n**4. Recent History of Cautious Claims**\n\nDespite rapid progress, major labs have historically been relatively conservative in how they characterize their systems' capabilities. Even as capabilities have advanced dramatically since 2022, no major lab has yet formally claimed AGI achievement, suggesting a pattern of caution that may continue.\n\n## Synthesis and Forecast\n\nWhile the pace of AI advancement has accelerated and leader statements have grown bolder, there remains a significant gap between current capabilities and the full spectrum of human-level capabilities across domains that most definitions of AGI entail.\n\nThe most likely scenario is continued progress toward AGI with increasingly confident statements about approaching it, but without a formal claim of achievement in 2025. Labs will likely continue to emphasize specific capabilities rather than make the historically significant claim of having achieved AGI.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of such a claim is substantially higher than in previous years. If one lab (most likely OpenAI) believes they've made a breakthrough that approximates AGI and faces competitive pressure to establish primacy, they may decide the benefits of claiming AGI outweigh the risks.\n\nGiven the evidence and competing factors, I estimate the probability of a major AI lab claiming to have developed AGI in 2025 at:\n\nProbability: 25%",
        "3":"Based on the search results and the current date (May 13, 2025), I'll provide a professional forecasting analysis on whether President Trump will formally invoke the Insurrection Act before 2026.\n\n(a) Time until outcome is known: 7 months and 19 days (until January 1, 2026)\n\n(b) Status quo outcome: President Trump has not yet invoked the Insurrection Act, despite issuing executive orders declaring a national emergency at the southern border and directing cabinet officials to evaluate whether to invoke it.\n\n(c) No outcome scenario: The Trump administration continues to use existing authorities, including the national emergency declaration and other immigration enforcement mechanisms, without formally invoking the Insurrection Act. Border crossing numbers remain low enough that Defense Secretary Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Noem continue to advise against invoking the Act.\n\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: President Trump formally invokes the Insurrection Act in response to either a real or perceived escalation at the southern border, citing the need for military deployment to address immigration concerns. This follows through on the groundwork laid in his January 2025 executive order declaring a national emergency.\n\n## Current Status and Timeline\n\nPresident Trump has taken significant steps that suggest he is seriously considering invoking the Insurrection Act, but has not yet formally done so. Key developments include:\n\n- January 20, 2025: Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border and directing the Secretary of Defense (Pete Hegseth) and Secretary of Homeland Security (Kristi Noem) to submit a report within 90 days evaluating whether to invoke the Insurrection Act[2][4].\n\n- April 20, 2025 (approximately): The 90-day deadline for the cabinet secretaries' report. According to search results, top officials at the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security did not recommend invoking the Act at that time due to low levels of migrant crossings.\n\n- April 18, 2025: Rep. Jamie Raskin, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, issued a statement expressing concerns about Trump potentially invoking the Insurrection Act[1].\n\n## Key Factors Supporting Invocation\n\n1. **Formal Framework Already Established**: Trump has already declared a national emergency at the southern border, which creates the legal foundation for potentially invoking the Insurrection Act[2].\n\n2. **Strong Rhetoric**: Trump has characterized the situation at the border in extreme terms, describing it as \"overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries\"[2].\n\n3. **Previous Executive Actions**: Trump has already taken significant immigration-related executive actions, including a March 15, 2025 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act regarding the alleged \"invasion\" of the United States by Tren de Aragua (designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization)[3].\n\n## Key Factors Against Invocation\n\n1. **Current Low Border Crossing Numbers**: According to search results, fewer than 300 people are crossing the southern border illegally each day, which DHS sources indicated does not justify military involvement.\n\n2. **Advice From Cabinet Officials**: Top Pentagon and DHS officials apparently advised against invoking the Act based on current conditions.\n\n3. **Political and Legal Risks**: The Insurrection Act exists in tension with the Posse Comitatus Act, which prevents the federal military from acting as a police force without clear authorization[4]. Invoking it could trigger significant legal challenges and political backlash.\n\n## Analysis and Reasoning\n\nThe probability of Trump invoking the Insurrection Act before 2026 depends on weighing several competing factors:\n\n**Status Quo Bias**: The status quo is that the Act has not been invoked, and there are significant legal and political barriers to doing so. Most presidents are reluctant to take such extraordinary measures due to these constraints.\n\n**Trump's Demonstrated Intent**: However, Trump has already laid significant groundwork for invoking the Act, including declaring a national emergency and specifically directing his cabinet to evaluate whether to invoke it. This indicates a serious consideration rather than merely rhetorical posturing[2][4].\n\n**Border Situation Evolution**: The current reported low levels of border crossings weigh against invocation, but this could change over the coming months, especially if there's a real or perceived increase in migration.\n\n**Political Calculation**: Trump may see invoking the Act as fulfilling a campaign promise to take strong action on immigration, but must balance this against potential negative political and legal consequences.\n\nWhile there are many factors pointing toward Trump potentially invoking the Act, we must give significant weight to the status quo\u2014that presidents rarely take such extraordinary measures, and the reported advice against invocation from key cabinet officials. However, the explicit consideration in executive actions and Trump's demonstrated willingness to take unprecedented steps in immigration enforcement significantly increases the probability.\n\nProbability: 45%"
