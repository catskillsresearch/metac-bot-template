**US-Iran Nuclear Talks End Without Agreement**
The fifth round of US-Iran nuclear talks ended without an agreement, according to the Wall Street Journal. Despite this, the parties have agreed to continue discussions. As previously stated by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arakchi, Iran and the US have achieved a better understanding of each other's positions following the talks in Rome. 'The fifth round of US-Iran talks in Rome ended without an agreement, but the parties agreed to continue discussions,' the Wall Street Journal reports. The US and Iran are reportedly trying to establish parameters for a new deal on Iran's nuclear program, with 'key details' to be discussed later. The fifth round of talks took place against the backdrop of growing disagreements between the US and Iran over a possible agreement on Iran's nuclear program. The tensions escalated after US Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff stated that the US administration is seeking a complete halt to Iran's uranium enrichment. Before the fifth round, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei expressed doubts about the possibility of reaching an agreement, saying that the US demand for Iran to abandon uranium enrichment is an error. The Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that the parties will not reach an agreement if the US continues to insist on Iran's abandonment of enrichment technology. Iran had previously considered reducing the level of uranium enrichment and allowing for greater international control over its nuclear activities to demonstrate the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. In 2015, the UK, Germany, China, Russia, the US, France, and Iran signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which included the lifting of sanctions in exchange for Iran's nuclear program restrictions. The US withdrew from the JCPOA in May 2018 under the previous administration of Donald Trump and reinstated sanctions against Iran. In response, Iran announced a phased reduction of its obligations under the agreement, including restrictions on nuclear research and uranium enrichment levels.

**US and Iran Negotiate Framework Agreement for Nuclear Program**
The United States and Iran are trying to agree on a framework agreement that would be an intermediate step towards a nuclear deal. According to The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, the framework agreement would be a 'step towards a new deal' for Iran, which would include confirmation of its right to a civilian nuclear program and a commitment not to pursue nuclear weapons. The agreement may also include a requirement for strict inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities. The US, on the other hand, wants to include specific goals in the framework agreement that technical groups would work towards in the future. The US also hopes that the framework agreement would be 'more prescriptive in nature.' The main point of contention in the framework agreement is Iran's right to enrich uranium, notes the publication. The US demands that Iran completely abandon this activity, but Iranian authorities reject this demand, stating that their country's nuclear program is purely peaceful.

**Iran-US Nuclear Talks: A Critical Point**
Iran and the United States are engaged in nuclear talks, with the fifth round of negotiations set to take place in Rome today. The main point of contention is Iran's uranium enrichment activity. Iran is willing to limit its nuclear program to prevent the production of atomic bombs, but it wants to maintain its right to enrich uranium for civilian nuclear energy purposes. Iran's other concern is that the US will not fulfill its obligations in any future agreement, as it did in 2018 when it withdrew from the nuclear deal. The US, on the other hand, wants Iran to completely eliminate its nuclear enrichment capacity. The two sides' 'red lines' are clashing, making it difficult to reach an agreement. If no agreement is reached, the US may not be able to withdraw from the nuclear deal, but European countries like the UK, Germany, and France may impose UN sanctions on Iran. This could lead to Iran's isolation and economic hardship. Iran may even consider withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and producing nuclear weapons. Israel, which is also concerned about Iran's nuclear program, wants Iran to completely eliminate its nuclear capabilities and face harsh sanctions. However, Iran is unlikely to accept this, as it sees its nuclear program as a symbol of its independence. A possible agreement between Iran and the US could be a compromise, where Iran agrees to limit its uranium enrichment to low levels, but maintains its right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes. This would satisfy Israel's security concerns, but would also allow Iran to maintain its nuclear capabilities. The outcome of the negotiations is uncertain, but the consequences of failure could be severe.

**US and Iran Meet for Fifth Time to Discuss Nuclear Program**
The United States and Iran are set to meet for the fifth time since April to discuss the contentious issue of Iran's nuclear program. Tehran has warned that if Washington wants to ban Iran from enriching uranium, 'there will be no agreement'. The two countries are meeting in Rome on May 23 under Omani mediation, as negotiations seem to be stalled over the issue of uranium enrichment. Iran and the US have been discussing the nuclear program since April 12, representing the highest level of engagement between the two countries since the US withdrew from the 2015 international nuclear agreement in 2018. The US is seeking to negotiate a new deal with Tehran, which hopes to lift sanctions that are crippling its economy. The two countries are publicly at odds over the sensitive issue of uranium enrichment, with the US saying it cannot allow Iran to have even a 1% enrichment capacity. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has warned that if the US prevents Iran from enriching uranium, 'there will be no agreement'. Iran defends its right to nuclear civil power and considers the US demand as contrary to the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which Iran is a signatory. 'Iran's sovereignty is a red line and Iran will not give up its right to enrich uranium,' said Iranian politician Mohammad Marandi. The US and its Western allies, as well as Israel, suspect Iran of wanting to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies. The nuclear industry employs over 17,000 people in Iran, including in the energy and medical sectors, according to the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization. 'The Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea, Brazil, and Japan enrich uranium without having nuclear weapons,' said the organization's spokesman, Behrouz Kamalvandi. US President Donald Trump has spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the Iran issue, according to the White House. Trump believes that the negotiations with Tehran 'are going in the right direction', the White House said. Israel is seen as the only nuclear power in the Middle East and is considered an enemy of the Iranian regime. The Iranian foreign minister has warned that Iran will hold the US responsible for any Israeli attack on its nuclear installations.

**Iran-US Nuclear Agreement on Brink of Collapse**
The nuclear agreement between Iran and the US is on the brink of collapse due to disagreements over uranium enrichment. The US demands that Iran stop enriching uranium to any level, while Iran insists on its right to enrich uranium as a sovereign nation. The issue of uranium enrichment is a major obstacle to a new agreement, with the US and Iran holding different views on the matter. The US sees the issue as a matter of strategic trust, while Iran views it as a matter of national sovereignty and ideological resistance. The US has imposed economic sanctions on Iran, which has led to a decline in the country's economy. Iran has responded by strengthening its relations with Russia and China, and has signed long-term economic and military cooperation agreements with them. The US has offered to lift sanctions in exchange for Iran's agreement to limit its uranium enrichment program, but Iran has refused, insisting on its right to enrich uranium. The situation is complicated by the fact that the US and Iran have different views on the issue of inspections, with the US demanding strict inspections and Iran offering to allow limited inspections. The situation is also complicated by the fact that the US has imposed economic sanctions on Iran, which has led to a decline in the country's economy. The article concludes that the situation is precarious and that a new agreement is unlikely to be reached soon.

**Iran-US Nuclear Talks End with Some Progress, But Outstanding Issues Remain**
The fifth round of nuclear talks between Iran and the US has ended in Rome, with some progress made, according to Oman's Foreign Minister, Bader Al-Busaidi. Al-Busaidi said, 'Today, in Rome, the fifth round of talks between Iran and the US ended with some progress, but it was not decisive.' He expressed hope that the outstanding issues would be clarified in the coming days. The talks began on April 12 between Iran and the US regarding Iran's nuclear program. This is the highest level of communication between the two countries since the international agreement was signed with Iran in 2015, which the US withdrew from in 2018. Following the withdrawal, US President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran as part of a 'maximum pressure' policy, and is seeking to negotiate a new agreement with Iran, which hopes to have sanctions lifted that are crippling its economy. However, the issue of uranium enrichment will be the main point of contention in the talks. While US Special Envoy to the Middle East, Stephen Biegun, who represents the US in the talks, said that the US 'cannot allow even one percent of enrichment capacity,' Iran rejects this condition, saying it violates the international agreement, and insists on its right to a nuclear program for civilian purposes. Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, emphasized that Iran does not need permission from 'anyone' to enrich uranium, expressing skepticism that the talks with the US will lead to any outcome. Ahead of the talks, Iran announced that it is open to 'more inspections' of its nuclear facilities. Iranian Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, said on state television, 'We are confident in the peaceful nature of our nuclear program, and therefore, we have no problem in principle with more inspections and transparency.' He added that 'fundamental differences' remain with the US, warning that if the US wants to prevent Iran from enriching uranium, 'there will be no agreement.'

**European Countries Insist on Ensuring Security Interests in Any Deal with Iran**
European countries, including Germany, Britain, and France, have informed the United States that any agreement with Iran must ensure their security interests. A diplomatic source told 'Al Arabiya/Al Hadath' that the European countries have been in contact with the US to determine whether they will hold their own round of talks with Iran. Iran has been in talks with Britain, France, and Germany in Turkey, following a hint by US President Donald Trump that an agreement with Tehran is near. The talks included the political directors of the foreign ministries of Iran and the three European countries. 'Continuation of consultations' was the main topic of the meeting, according to Iranian media, which included discussing the continuation of indirect talks between Iran and the US. The meeting in Istanbul came after a warning by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of 'no return' if European powers move to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran. Britain, France, and Germany, along with China, Russia, the US, and other major powers, were signatories to the 2015 agreement, known as the 'Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.' The agreement allowed for the limitation of Iran's nuclear activities and ensured the peaceful nature of its program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. In 2018, Trump withdrew the US from the agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran, including secondary measures targeting countries that buy Iranian oil, as part of a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Tehran. Iran has remained committed to all the terms of the agreement for a year after the US withdrawal, before gradually backing away from its core commitments. The European powers are considering whether to activate the 'snapback' mechanism, also known as 'the trigger,' which is part of the 2015 agreement and allows for the re-imposition of UN sanctions on Iran in case of a breach of the nuclear agreement. The deadline for activating this mechanism is October 2025.

**Iran and US Resume Nuclear Talks in Rome Amid Disagreements**
Iran and the United States are set to resume talks in Rome on Friday over Iran's nuclear program, after a public disagreement over Tehran's uranium enrichment. The talks, which began in April, are the highest-level contact between the two countries since the US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal during Donald Trump's first term. Trump has since returned to a 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran, while warning of military action if diplomacy fails. Iran is seeking a new agreement that would ease the sanctions that have severely impacted its economy. The latest round of talks in Muscat, Oman, ended with a public disagreement over uranium enrichment, with the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, saying that Washington 'could not authorize even one percent of enrichment capacity', while Iran considers that stance 'non-negotiable' as it is an activity consistent with a civilian nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Minister Abás Araqchi said before the talks that 'there are still fundamental disagreements' with the US, and warned that if Washington wants to prevent Iran from enriching uranium 'there will be no agreement'. The talks come ahead of a June meeting of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and before the 2015 agreement expires in October. According to the Iranian official news agency, IRNA, the meeting in Rome will start at 13:00 (11:00 GMT). 'We still have fundamental disagreements with the US,' Araqchi said, 'and if Washington wants to prevent Iran from enriching uranium, there will be no agreement,' he added. Iran currently enriches uranium to 60%, far above the 3.67% limit set by the agreement, but below the 90% needed to develop nuclear weapons.

**Iran-US Nuclear Talks at a Standstill**
New negotiations between the United States and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program are taking place in Rome, but the talks seem to be at a standstill due to the vastly different positions of Washington and Tehran. The two countries have been discussing a new agreement to regulate Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that are crippling its economy. However, the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has expressed skepticism about the outcome of the talks, saying 'We don't think these talks will lead to any result.' The Iranian Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, has also stated that Iran will continue to enrich uranium 'with or without an agreement' with the US. The US has demanded that Iran not be allowed to enrich uranium at all, which is a major point of contention between the two countries. 'We cannot authorize even one percent of enrichment capacity' to Iran, said US envoy Steve Witkoff. The talks are focused on the enrichment of uranium, which is a key issue in the negotiations. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60%, far beyond the 3.67% limit set by the 2015 nuclear agreement, while a 90% enrichment rate is necessary for military use.

**Iran Ready to Sign Nuclear Deal with US in Exchange for Sanctions Relief**
Iran is willing to sign a nuclear agreement with the US in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, according to Ali Shamkhani, the chief advisor to Iran's supreme leader. Shamkhani stated that under the proposed agreement, Iran would commit to never producing nuclear weapons, dispose of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and only enrich uranium to levels necessary for civilian use. He added that international inspectors would be allowed to monitor this process. Shamkhani emphasized that these steps could be taken in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions. When asked if Iran would sign the agreement today if these conditions were met, Shamkhani replied, 'Yes.' Iran has also proposed the idea of creating an international nuclear consortium involving Arab countries in the region and US investments as an alternative to the US demand to completely dismantle Iran's nuclear program.

**Iran's Nuclear Program: A Possible Agreement with the US**
According to Reuters sources, the expected nuclear agreement between Iran and the United States may not differ much from the 2015 agreement. The sources pointed out that the expected US agreement with Iran will be similar to the one that President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018. Trump is expected to sign a 25-year agreement, which will strengthen inspection procedures without dismantling the nuclear program. Under the conditions being discussed, Iran will reduce its enriched uranium stockpile by 60% and limit the size of its stockpile, as well as certain types of centrifuges. Iran is also discussing reducing its nuclear stockpile under unprecedented monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency, in exchange for significant easing of sanctions. The expected agreement will strengthen inspection procedures, while expanding the provisions that temporarily freeze aspects of Iran's nuclear program without dismantling them all. Iran has offered, according to Reuters, not to manufacture missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads as a gesture of goodwill. Reuters reported that what is being discussed is sending a part of Iran's enriched uranium to the outside, possibly to Russia, and even selling it to the United States. The agency quoted a former Iranian official as saying that Iran has offered not to manufacture missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads as a 'goodwill gesture.' However, the official revealed that the Iranian leadership feels deep concern about the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran, whether an agreement is reached with Washington or not. According to the agency, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was surprised by Trump's decision last month to start immediate talks with Iran. The sources indicated that Netanyahu went to Washington to get Trump's support for military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, explaining that the Israeli prime minister knew about the talks with Iran less than 24 hours before a press conference with Trump that the talks would start within days.

**US Expects New Talks with Iran on Nuclear Program Despite Trump's Pressure**
The United States expects to hold new discussions with Iran 'in the near future' about its nuclear program, despite the postponement of talks scheduled for Saturday in Rome and despite Donald Trump's increased pressure, with the reinstatement of sanctions on Iranian oil this Thursday. Iran confirmed the postponement of the fourth meeting with American representatives, which was scheduled for Friday in Rome, after the mediator country, Oman, invoked 'logistical reasons'. Recently, Donald Trump initiated new talks with Iranian authorities to draft a new agreement on the Iranian nuclear program, after he himself made the 2015 agreement obsolete when he withdrew from it in 2018 during his first term. The 2015 agreement, signed by Iran, the United States, its Western partners, as well as Russia and China, provided for the lifting of economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran's commitment not to enrich uranium to quantities sufficient to acquire a nuclear weapon. Contrary to the efforts made in recent weeks, Donald Trump relaunched his policy of 'maximum pressure' on Iran, saying on his social network that 'all Iranian oil or petrochemical purchases must stop NOW,' and announcing that 'any country or person who buys any amount of Iranian oil or petrochemical products will be immediately subject to indirect sanctions.' These new pressures come at a time when Washington has just announced new sanctions against seven companies accused of being involved in the sale of Iranian oil. Reacting to these decisions, Tehran accused the United States of 'economic terrorism' and lamented a 'contradictory approach by US decision-makers and their lack of good faith and seriousness in advancing through the path of diplomacy.' In addition to the talks scheduled with the United States, the meeting with some of the signatories to the nuclear agreement, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, which was scheduled for Friday, was also canceled. It is worth noting that the agreement with Iran expires in October 2025, and from that date, sanctions can be reinstated against that country if it does not respect its commitments. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran is currently enriching uranium at a high level (60%), below the 90% needed to manufacture a nuclear bomb, but far beyond the 3.67% limit established by the nuclear agreement.

**US and Iran to Hold Direct Talks on Nuclear Program**
The United States and Iran will hold direct talks on Saturday, April 12, to discuss Iran's nuclear program. This will be the first formal nuclear talks between the two countries since September 2022. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the talks will be direct. Leavitt emphasized that President Trump's ultimate goal is to ensure that Iran never acquires nuclear weapons, and he believes that this can be achieved through diplomatic means, but he has also made it clear that all options are on the table, and Tehran must make a choice: agree to the president's demands or face severe consequences. Iran's Foreign Ministry stated that the high-level nuclear talks on Saturday will be 'a real opportunity' for the US. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated, 'We will carefully evaluate the intentions and determination of the other side on Saturday, and give diplomacy a sincere and honest chance.' Previously, US President Trump has repeatedly warned that if the talks fail, he will bomb Iran. In 2018, Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the nuclear agreement signed by Obama's administration in 2015. After Trump returned to the White House in January, he took a tougher stance on Iran. Israel views Iran's nuclear program as a threat to Israel's existence. In October 2023, the Palestinian militant group Hamas, backed by Iran, launched a surprise attack on Israel, prompting Israel to launch a military operation, including airstrikes on Iran, which significantly weakened Iran and its ally Hamas. Israel has since resumed military action against Hamas, which has received support from Iran. Additionally, the Houthi organization in Yemen, allied with Iran, has attacked the Red Sea international shipping lane to support Hamas, prompting the US to launch airstrikes against the Houthi forces, sparking speculation about a possible US attack on Iran. Before Trump's statement on March 30 that 'if they don't reach an agreement, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing they have never seen before,' Iran had refused to negotiate directly with Washington. The talks on Saturday will be between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi serving as a mediator.

**Iran Nuclear Program: Military Confrontation 'Almost Inevitable' Without New Agreement**
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot warned that a military confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program is 'almost inevitable' if a new agreement cannot be reached quickly. European countries are trying to create a diplomatic path to limit Iran's uranium enrichment activities by summer and October 2025. 'The window of opportunity is narrow. We have only a few months left before the expiration of this agreement (2015 -- ed.). In case of failure, military confrontation will be almost inevitable,' he said. Diplomatic sources reported that French, British, and German ministers, who are parties to the 2015 agreement, hope to discuss this issue with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Sources close to the US administration of President Donald Trump stated that Iran may 'disappear by September' if it refuses to abandon the nuclear deal and does not shut down its nuclear program.

**US Plans to Complete Military Operations in Iran by Fall, if Deal is Not Reached**
The US administration is reportedly planning to complete military operations in Iran by fall, if the Iranian government does not agree to a deal and start dismantling its nuclear program, according to sources in the US administration, as cited by the Daily Express. This comes after US President Donald Trump threatened 'unprecedented bombings' if the US and Iran do not reach an agreement. 'Iran will disappear by September,' said a source to the publication. Trump had previously stated in February that he was willing to sign a deal with Iran instead of conducting military operations against it. He expressed a desire to sign a 'verified' nuclear peace agreement with Iran, which would allow Tehran to develop and prosper peacefully. Trump also sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in early March, stating that he preferred to sign a deal with Tehran on the issue of Iran's nuclear program. Trump noted that the US is considering two possible paths to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue - military or diplomatic, emphasizing that he prefers negotiations. Axios reported on March 19 that Trump set a two-month deadline for a new nuclear deal in his letter to Khamenei. On March 27, Iran's Foreign Minister announced that Tehran had sent a response to Trump's letter through Oman. According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Iran refused direct negotiations with the US on the nuclear program in its response, but left the door open for negotiations with the mediation of third countries. In 2015, the UK, Germany, China, Russia, the US, France, and Iran signed a nuclear deal that included the lifting of sanctions in exchange for Iran's limitation of its nuclear program. The US withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018 and reinstated sanctions against Iran under Trump's presidency. In response, Iran announced a phased reduction of its commitments under the agreement, including restrictions on nuclear research and uranium enrichment levels.

**European Diplomat: US to Negotiate Directly with Iran, Agreement Possible Before October 2025**
A European diplomat has expressed his belief that the US administration under President Donald Trump is seeking to negotiate directly and secretly with Iran over its nuclear program, with a likely agreement to be reached before October 2025. The diplomat, who has extensive knowledge of previous nuclear negotiations with Iran, stated that the coming months will be crucial in reaching a new agreement with Tehran to replace the current agreement, which expired in October 2025. The diplomat believes that Washington will conduct secret negotiations with Tehran 'in a place other than the usual locations that hosted similar talks.' The US and Iran had previously conducted direct negotiations before the 2005 nuclear agreement in Muscat, Oman, and later in Doha. The Biden administration had resumed nuclear negotiations with Iran as part of the five-plus-one group in an attempt to return to the full implementation of the agreement. In the summer of 2023, European negotiators presented a draft agreement to the Iranians after more than 7 rounds of indirect negotiations between Iran and the US in Vienna, which also involved the three European countries (France, Britain, and Germany), Russia, and China. However, Iran withdrew from signing the agreement at the last minute, requesting additional concessions from the Biden administration, which it refused. Iran 'is weaker than before.' The European diplomat, who spoke to Al-Monitor on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, believes that any agreement that may be reached now between Washington and Tehran 'will not be better than the agreement that was presented to Iran two years ago and rejected.' However, he expressed optimism about the possibility of reaching an agreement before October, citing that 'Iran is currently in a weaker position than before,' after its allies in the region have been weakened unprecedentedly. The diplomat noted that this means that any new nuclear agreement will be broader, including Iran's activities in the region, which 'was not possible to consider previously.' Regional countries have long called for a broader agreement with Iran that includes curbing its interference in the region, which Tehran has consistently rejected. Trump had signed a presidential decree to tighten sanctions on Iran, but also announced that his administration is seeking to negotiate with it and reach a new agreement. The European diplomat noted that Trump's efforts in this regard are 'serious' because he wants to be remembered in history as a maker of agreements, and mentioned a major obstacle that still exists, which is the absence of a US negotiator, as the new US administration has not yet appointed a negotiator to replace Robert Malley, whose work was suspended and his security clearances revoked due to his passing of classified information to the Iranian side during indirect negotiations in Vienna. Iran is 'desperate' to negotiate with the US, and will accept any agreement to lift sanctions. The diplomat noted that this time, the incentives and guarantees will not come from the Europeans, who 'no longer have the trust of Iran' after the US withdrawal from the agreement, and the reduction of European trade with Tehran due to fear of US sanctions. Risks of no agreement. Despite the diplomat not ruling out the possibility of reaching an agreement before October 2025, he said: 'If there is a US administration capable of reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran, it is necessarily the Trump administration,' because the Iranian side will be confident that no new US administration will come and cancel the agreement, as Trump did with the agreement reached by the Obama administration. The diplomat believes that reaching an agreement before that date will spare Iran the reactivation of the 'snapback' mechanism by the Europeans, which would reapply all international sanctions on it. The three European countries had warned of this after the last meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the report by its director Rafael Grossi, which mentioned that 'Iran's cooperation is at its lowest, and its nuclear activities are increasing continuously, and it is no longer possible to trust that it is still peaceful.' The diplomat warned that if an agreement is not reached with Iran before October, 'the Middle East will head towards a real crisis,' and that it will push Israel 'to launch a military strike against Iran.'

**Trump wants to negotiate 'immediately' a new nuclear agreement with Iran**
US President Donald Trump stated on Wednesday (5) that he would like to reach a new 'verified' nuclear agreement with Iran and requested that work begin 'immediately' in this direction, while also considering 'exaggerated' the information that he wants to destroy the Persian nation. 'I want Iran to be a great and successful country, but without nuclear weapons,' Trump said on his Truth Social account, after stating that the information about the US working with Israel to 'blow up Iran in pieces' is 'exaggerated.' 'I would much prefer a verified nuclear peace agreement that would allow Iran to grow and prosper in peace. We should start working immediately,' he said, adding that once the agreement is signed and concluded, it will be 'a big party in the Middle East.' Trump's message comes after he said on Tuesday that he gave 'instructions' that if Iran kills him, the country will be 'annihilated.' He also signed a memorandum to restore the maximum pressure policy on the ayatollah regime. Trump had previously used the expression 'blow up' Iran in September last year, suggesting that the country was behind two attempts to assassinate him. The US Department of Justice announced in November that it had foiled an Iranian conspiracy to assassinate Trump before the presidential election. Iran responded on the same day that if the main issue for the US is that the country does not obtain nuclear weapons, their differences can be resolved and that 'there is no problem.' Trump had previously imposed a 'maximum pressure' policy on Tehran during his first term (2017-2020) and abandoned the 2015 nuclear pact that limited Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, which sank the Iranian economy. After the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement, Iran enriched uranium far beyond the allowed level and now has 182.3 kilograms enriched with 60% purity, close to the military use of 90%, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
