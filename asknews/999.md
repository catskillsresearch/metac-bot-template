**The Richest Individuals in the World: What They Do and How They Made Their Fortunes**
Forbes has released its list of the world's richest individuals, and we take a look at what they do for a living. With figures that are hard to comprehend, these individuals are heirs, entrepreneurs in sectors such as technology, cosmetics, and logistics, as well as business leaders from various nationalities. The majority of these entrepreneurs hold active roles such as creatives, CEOs, or shareholders, building empires valued in millions and making strategic decisions for each sector. Elon Musk remains the world's richest man after adding $46 billion to his fortune in April. His companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI, have contributed to his growth. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, comes in second with a fortune of $201.6 billion, despite a 4% drop in Amazon's stock price in April. Mark Zuckerberg, despite a $9.3 billion loss in April, remains a key figure in the digital world. Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, increased his fortune by $1.9 billion in April, thanks to the rise in Oracle's stock price and his involvement in the Proyecto Stargate, a key alliance for the development of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US. Warren Buffett, the architect of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s growth, will retire at the end of 2025, ending a six-decade tenure and leaving a lasting impact on global investment.

**Elon Musk's Fortune Grows to $386.5 Billion, Leading the List of the 10 Richest Men in the World**
Elon Musk's fortune increased by $46 billion in April 2025, making him the leader of the list of the 10 richest men in the world, according to Forbes. The 'volatility of April' affected the ranking of the richest people in the world, with Musk's fortune increasing due to a 7% rise in Tesla's stock price. However, Tesla's sales fell by 13% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Musk plans to dedicate more time to Tesla starting from May. The global ranking of fortunes shows that Musk leads with an estimated $386.5 billion, followed by Jeff Bezos with $201.6 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg with $192.3 billion. Amancio Ortega, the founder of Inditex, saw his fortune increase by $8.9 billion in April, reaching a total of $114.4 billion. 'The combination of a 2% increase in Inditex's stock price and the appreciation of the euro against the dollar (+5%) contributed to his fortune,' according to Forbes, citing Infobae.

**Elon Musk finally meets the press and compares himself to Buddha**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man and top Trump adviser, met with mainstream news reporters in the West Wing's Roosevelt Room for the first time since joining the Trump administration. Musk, along with three top Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team members, discussed his time in the administration and compared himself to Buddha, saying 'Is Buddha needed for Buddhism?' when asked about who will lead DOGE in his absence. Musk admitted that DOGE has not yet met the $1 trillion in cuts he initially proposed, and that it will be 'really difficult' to reach his goal without more support in Washington. He also acknowledged that some vital employees were 'accidentally let go' during the process of culling the federal workforce. Musk stated that he will reduce his time spent in Washington, but will keep his office on the White House grounds, boasting that it has a window but all you see is the HVAC unit, which he finds 'fine.' He also said that DOGE is a way of life. 'DOGE is a way of life,' he said.

**Elon Musk Remains World's Richest Person in 2025**
As of the end of April 2025, Elon Musk remains the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $335 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This is significantly higher than the net worth of other billionaires, such as Jeff Bezos ($209 billion) and Mark Zuckerberg ($195 billion). Forbes also estimates Musk's net worth to be $342 billion, keeping him at the top of the list of the world's richest people. Musk's wealth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. Although Tesla's stock has declined by 37% since the beginning of the year, the growth in value of SpaceX and other assets has helped to offset these losses. Musk has also announced plans to focus on leading Tesla, reducing his involvement in public affairs, which may positively impact investor confidence and further growth of his companies. In December 2024, Musk's net worth reached a record $500 billion, but it later decreased due to the decline in Tesla's stock. Since the beginning of 2025, Musk has lost approximately $134.7 billion. However, thanks to the growth in value of SpaceX and other assets, his net worth has again exceeded $300 billion. As a result, Musk continues to hold the position of the world's richest person, despite market fluctuations and political challenges.

**Trump chief of staff gives huge update on Elon Musk at the White House**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man, is stepping back from his role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a cost-slashing task force installed by President Trump. Musk, who was appointed as an unpaid special government employee and unofficial 'Efficiency Czar,' had been working closely with Trump to dismantle what they called the 'Deep State of Waste.' However, his 130-day mandate as a special government employee was set to expire at the end of May, and he has now confirmed that he will be allocating more time to Tesla. Musk said, 'Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,' but added that he would still be interested in continuing to spend a day or two a week on government matters, as long as it is useful. The DOGE initiative has been contentious, with critics accusing Musk of launching a Silicon Valley coup on American democracy, while Republicans have hailed him as the one man willing to treat the federal bureaucracy like a malfunctioning machine needing a complete rewiring.

**Who are the 10 richest people in the world in March 2025**
Elon Musk, owner of companies like Tesla and Space X, was the biggest loser in the group, despite still maintaining his position as the richest person on the planet in March. The reason was the decline in Tesla's stock, which reduced his fortune by $62 billion (R$ 366 billion). In December, Musk, who also serves as the leader of the Doge (Department of Government Efficiency) of Donald Trump's government, had become the first billionaire to surpass $400 billion, driven by the growth of Tesla and the valuation of his artificial intelligence company xAI. Now, with the decline in Tesla's stock, his fortune is estimated to be around $360 billion (R$ 2.1 trillion), according to Forbes.
