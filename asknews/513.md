**EUA to Develop 'Artificial Sun' with Big Tech Support**
Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a startup from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has raised over $1 billion (R$ 5.7 billion) to build the world's first commercial-scale fusion power plant in the United States. The investment was led by an unnamed hyperscale developer, according to Axios Pro. Google and Microsoft, among other big tech companies, have already invested in the project. Microsoft is also the cloud services provider for CFS. The ARC plant, which aims to start operations in the early 2030s, will generate 400 megawatts of clean and carbon-free electricity, enough to power large industrial facilities or around 150,000 homes. The plant will be built in collaboration with Dominion Energy Virginia, which will provide development and technical expertise, as well as land rights. CFS will finance, build, own, and operate the plant independently. The project is seen as a cleaner alternative to nuclear fission, using less resources and generating no long-lasting radioactive waste. However, harnessing fusion energy has proven to be challenging, requiring high temperatures to create and maintain the fusion reaction. CFS is currently developing its SPARC machine, which is expected to produce its first plasma in 2026 and demonstrate a commercially relevant project that produces more energy than it consumes.

**White House to Nominate New NASA Administrator, Citing Trump's 'America First' Agenda**
The White House announced on Saturday that it will nominate a new candidate for NASA administrator, just days before the current nominee, billionaire Jared Isaacman, faces a Senate confirmation vote. According to White House spokesperson Liz Huston, 'It is essential that the next leader of NASA is completely aligned with President Trump's 'America First' agenda, and President Trump will announce a replacement directly soon.' Isaacman, a former Democratic donor, had found support in the space industry and Congress, but some lawmakers expressed concerns about his close ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX. Isaacman has spent an undisclosed amount of his own money on two SpaceX missions, while Shift4 Payments has provided SpaceX with $27.5 million in funding. Starlink, SpaceX's satellite internet unit, is also a client. The White House's change of heart, reported earlier by Semafor, comes a day after Trump published a detailed budget plan that calls for a 25% cut in NASA's budget compared to the previous year, with significant reductions in its scientific portfolio; cuts that Isaacman has said would not be 'an optimal outcome.' Isaacman's representatives declined to comment, and Isaacman did not respond to our request for comment. Isaacman is the CEO of Shift4 Payments, which processes payments for restaurants, tourist complexes, hotels, casinos, and stadiums. During his confirmation hearing, Isaacman argued that NASA can conduct missions to the Moon and Mars 'in parallel,' walking a tightrope between the desires of Congress and the administration. 'The NASA administrator will help guide humanity to space and execute the bold mission of President Trump to plant the American flag on Mars,' said Huston. The Trump budget request described significant changes to NASA's Artemis program to return Americans to the Moon, including the gradual retirement of the Boeing Co.-built Space Launch System and its replacement with a more economical and commercially used system. Isaacman had previously criticized the SLS for being too expensive and delayed. However, when a senator asked if he would make changes to the Artemis program, Isaacman said that the SLS is the best and fastest way to get to the Moon, but doubted its long-term viability for frequent trips to the Moon and Mars. Isaacman also stated that he wanted to see NASA 'launch more telescopes, more probes, (and) more explorers,' which appears to contradict the recent budget request from Trump, which proposes canceling scientific missions and pushes for a more privately-led era of US space exploration.

**Guest column: Budget cuts to NASA could hit the Gulf Coast hard. Here's why it matters.**
NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion crew-carrying spacecraft, built in Louisiana and Mississippi, are crucial for the US to remain at the forefront of space exploration. However, the administration's recent budget proposal threatens to terminate the SLS program after just three flights, which could have far-reaching consequences for the local economy and the nation's strategic and technological future. The cancellation of the SLS and Orion programs will bring economic benefits to a halt, including thousands of high-quality jobs and support for local businesses. From a broader perspective, SLS and Orion are essential for maintaining US leadership in space, as China plans to dominate in space with regular crewed moon missions by 2030. It would be a grave mistake to phase out the SLS and Orion well before a replacement system is ready, allowing rival nations to take the lead. The author urges members of Congress to continue to robustly fund the NASA budget and keep SLS and Orion powering America's future in space.

**India Takes a Giant Leap Towards the Future with the Hyperloop**
India is taking a significant step towards the future of transportation with the completion of the longest Hyperloop test tube in Asia, measuring 410 meters, by a team of researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai (IIT Madras). This achievement not only marks a major success for Indian research but also brings India closer to a goal that seemed like science fiction just a few years ago. The Hyperloop is a high-speed transportation system that uses a vacuum tube to reduce friction, allowing speeds of over 1,000 km/h and significantly reducing travel times. The idea of creating such a system was first proposed by Elon Musk in 2013, and since then, it has become a global challenge for scientists and engineers. The IIT Madras has worked with experts from TuTr Hyperloop, Technical University of Munich, and Neoways Technologies to bring this project to life. The Indian Minister of Railways, Ashwini Vaishnaw, has even visited the facility and witnessed the live demonstration, indicating that India is accelerating the development of the Hyperloop and may be one of the first countries to launch this technology. While there is still much work to be done, including optimizing propulsion, magnetic levitation, and infrastructure, if everything goes according to plan, a commercial project could become a reality soon. If the Hyperloop becomes a concrete mode of transportation, it could mark the beginning of a new era in global transportation, and who knows, maybe one day it will be a convenient alternative to trains, cars, and planes.
