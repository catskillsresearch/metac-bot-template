**Irteya Presents New Telecommunications Equipment at CIPR-2025**
Irteya presented new telecommunications equipment at the CIPR-2025 exhibition, including a base station and a working demonstration network of the fifth generation (5G) on the Single RAN architecture, said Irteya's general director, Dmitry Laktionov. 'The new frequency band 2100 MHz (Band 1) is available for ordering for the first time as part of Irteya's base station line. On the stand, a working configuration of the site is shown with support for aggregation of two frequency bands: 2100 MHz (Band 1) and 800 MHz (Band 20)', - Laktionov explained. According to him, such a configuration allows significantly increasing the network's throughput and achieving an average data transfer speed of over 100 megabits per second, depending on the radio conditions and available frequency resources. 'The test zone of communication, deployed on the stand, serves modern smartphones without the need to install additional client modifications', - he clarified. He added that the company's equipment has also been confirmed to be backward compatible with outdated devices: for the first time, official support for the GSM standard has been demonstrated, using the cult phone Nokia 3310, which does not support LTE. During CIPR-2025, a pilot 5G zone is also demonstrated, deployed on Irteya's equipment. On the connected smartphone, a data transfer speed exceeding 1 gigabit per second was recorded. 'This confirms that domestic base stations are ready to deploy fifth-generation networks to solve the tasks of digital transformation of the economy and state organizations. At the same time, Irteya's equipment is initially built using the OpenRAN architecture and supports the Single RAN technology, which allows simultaneously serving 2G, 4G, and 5G standards - without the need to replace the hardware platform', - Laktionov said. 'For operators, this means reducing total costs of ownership due to software flexibility, backward compatibility, and a single hardware platform. Using domestic software, localized support, and ruble-based calculations reduces currency and logistics risks, increasing cost predictability and operational resilience', - concluded the company's head.

**Warp Drive Propulsion: From Alcubierre's Theoretical Framework to Advanced Extraterrestrial and...**
The warp drive, first proposed by Miguel Alcubierre in 1994, is an operational reality within secret military space programs, as confirmed by the 1969 US Air Force manual, Ben Rich's 1993/1994 statements, and evidence of Special Access Programs. While civilian scientists work to overcome theoretical challenges, the military employs warp-driven spacecraft, likely derived from extraterrestrial technologies, for interstellar travel. The 'force fields' described in the manual and the technologies developed by Skunk Works demonstrate that advanced civilizations have influenced human development, with civilian NASA serving as a cover for the military's advanced operations.

**Warp Drive: A Concept Still Distant from Reality**
Thirty years after being proven, the concept of a warp drive remains distant from reality. Physicist Miguel Alcubierre first used mathematics to test the possibility of a warp drive, a concept inspired by science fiction, in 1994. However, despite his initial success, doubts remain in the scientific community about how it would actually work. Alcubierre's idea involves creating a warp bubble around a spacecraft, allowing it to move faster than the speed of light without violating the laws of physics. However, this would require negative mass, which does not exist in the universe and would violate current physical knowledge. There is hope, however, as negative energy has been discovered, which could potentially be used to create a warp drive. However, the use of this exotic material is still debated, and questions about quantum gravity remain unanswered. A later model by physicist Chris Broeck improved upon Alcubierre's work, but it still faces significant challenges, including the risk of quantum failures and the need for a negative energy source. Despite these challenges, physicists continue to explore the mathematics of warp drives, driven by the allure of science fiction.

**Warp Drive: A Theoretical Possibility for Faster-Than-Light Travel?**
Physicist Miguel Alcubierre proposed an idea in 1994 to create a 'warp bubble' around a spacecraft, which would contract space-time in front of the ship and expand it behind, allowing the ship to move at superluminal speeds without violating the fundamental principle of relativity. This concept, known as the Alcubierre warp drive, would not violate the speed limit imposed by special relativity, but rather 'deceive' the universe by warping space-time in such a way that the spacecraft could reach distant stars faster than possible with normal movement. The idea is based on the fact that the expansion of the universe already demonstrates this effect, where distant galaxies move away from us at speeds greater than the speed of light. However, the practical implementation of the warp drive faces significant challenges, including the need for exotic matter with negative energy, which has not been confirmed to exist. Despite these challenges, the idea of the warp drive remains a powerful stimulus for scientific research, forcing us to re-examine our understanding of space-time, gravity, and the possibility of interstellar travel.

**Warp Drive Spaziale: 30 Years After Alcubierre's Theory, the Mathematics Remains Unsolved**
Thirty years after physicist Miguel Alcubierre's theory, the mathematics behind a warp drive remains unsolved. In 1994, Alcubierre, inspired by his favorite science fiction series, studied the possibility of creating a 'warp drive', a propulsion system that would allow faster-than-light travel. He surprisingly found a theoretical solution, but after three decades of research, scientists still cannot reconcile the necessary mathematical calculations to make it a reality. Alcubierre's solution to the general relativity equations predicts a flat region of space with a compressed zone in front of it and an expanded zone behind it. This configuration would allow the 'bubble' and its contents to move at any speed, even faster than light. However, the main problem lies in the practical realization: to create such a space-time geometry, negative mass would be needed, which does not seem to exist in the universe and would violate everything we know about motion, momentum, and energy. Although we do not know negative mass, we do know negative energy. The Casimir effect, which occurs when two metal plates are placed very close together, creates a region of negative energy due to the restriction of quantum fields. However, the tiny amount of negative energy generated by the Casimir effect is not even remotely sufficient to power a warp drive.

**30 years after warp drives were proposed, we still can't make the math work**
In 1994, Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre proposed a 'warp drive' that could manipulate space-time to achieve superluminal motion. His idea involves creating a region of compressed space in front of a bubble and expanded space behind it, allowing the bubble to move at any speed, including faster than light. However, this requires negative mass, which doesn't exist in the universe and would violate our understanding of motion and energy. Alcubierre's solution employs negative energy, which has been observed in the Casimir effect, but a minuscule amount is not enough to power a warp drive. The feasibility of warp drives is still uncertain and depends on the development of quantum gravity. Various calculations have led to conflicting insights, including the possibility of infinite quantum fields and the need for immense amounts of negative energy. However, some calculations suggest that a reshaped warp bubble could minimize quantum weirdness and require only a star's worth of negative energy. Ultimately, the verdict on warp drives is uncertain, but it remains a fun thought experiment that explores connections between general relativity and quantum mechanics.
