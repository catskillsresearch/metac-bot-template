**Superintelligent AI fears: They're baaa-ack**
A new wave of AI concern has emerged, triggered by the development of self-coding AIs that can improve themselves with minimal human oversight. Experts warn that this could lead to superintelligence, which could be catastrophic for humanity. Nate Soares, president of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), said, 'Right now, there's no real path here where humanity doesn't get destroyed. It gets really bad.' Hamza Chaudry, AI and National Security Lead at the Future of Life Institute (FLI), added, 'The product being sold is the lack of human supervision -- and that's the most alarming development here.' The US government's current approach to AI development relies heavily on voluntary commitments and fragmented pilot programs, with no binding rules for frontier labs. Critics worry that even if the government re-engages with AI safety, it will have lost time on an already slow-moving process. Katja Grace, lead researcher at AI Impacts, said, 'If you can use AI to build AI, the rate of progress could get much higher quickly.' The risk from advanced AI is 'probably the most worrying thing I'm aware of,' she added. Some states, like California, are exploring regulations for frontier AI development, but at the federal level, caution currently sounds quaint. Speeding up AI is now a national priority -- not a national risk.

**California Frontier AI Working Group Issues Report on Foundation Model Regulation**
The Joint California Policy Working Group on AI Frontier Models has released a draft report on the regulation of foundation models, aiming to provide an evidence-based foundation for AI policy decisions in California. The report assesses transparency, third-party risk assessment, and adverse event reporting requirements as key components for foundation model regulation. It recommends transparency requirements that focus on five categories of information about foundation models, including training data acquisition and developer safety practices. The report also calls for third-party risk assessments and whistleblower protections for employees and contractors of foundation model developers. Additionally, it recommends adverse event reporting requirements, including proactive monitoring systems that collect information about events or incidents from mandated or voluntary reporters. The report will inform lawmakers as they consider AI legislation during the 2025 legislative session, including SB 53, a foundation model whistleblower bill introduced by Senator Wiener last month. The final version of the report is expected to be released by June 2025.

**Anthropic Welcomes California Governor's Report on Frontier AI Models**
Anthropic, an AI company, has responded positively to the preliminary report from the California Governor's working group on frontier AI models. The report's emphasis on transparency, objective standards, and evidence-based policy guidelines for the AI environment was particularly well-received. Anthropic believes that transparency, when applied thoughtfully, can be a cost-effective and efficient way to expand the evidence base for new technologies, increase consumer trust, and encourage beneficial competition. A key aspect of the report that Anthropic appreciated was the call for AI labs to disclose their measures to protect their models from theft and test for potential national security risks. The report's recommendations are largely in line with industry best practices, which Anthropic already follows. The company estimates that governments can play a positive role in improving transparency around AI security practices, as suggested by the report. Currently, frontier AI companies are not legally required to have a security policy, describe it publicly, or document their tests publicly. Anthropic believes that this can be addressed without stifling innovation. The company has recently suggested to the White House that powerful AI systems could emerge as early as the end of 2026, making it crucial to establish a regulatory framework that promotes transparency on AI security protocols.

**DeepSeek scared away some AI funders. But this wealthy backer is ready to spend.**
The release of DeepSeek's R1 model has caused concern among Western tech investors, as it has matched ChatGPT's performance in just four months. This has led to a tipping point in the economics of generative AI, where leading labs and investors can no longer rely on the private market to fund their research. Instead, governments are likely to step in and fund frontier AI research for national security and strategic reasons. This shift will have several implications, including exposure to geopolitical risk, the potential for today's winners to become tomorrow's losers, and the emergence of defense companies as partners for AI pioneers. Ultimately, end-users will benefit from lower-cost solutions with 'good enough' capabilities.

**Ian Bremmer Warns of 'Uncontrollable AI' Risks**
Ian Bremmer, the founder of Eurasia Group, has warned about the risks of 'uncontrollable AI'. According to Bremmer, by 2025, AI's capabilities and performance will improve, and new models will be able to act autonomously, replicate themselves, and blur the line between humans and machines. However, most governments will relax regulations, and international cooperation will not progress, leading to an increase in the risks and secondary damage caused by uncontrollable AI. Bremmer stated, 'In 2025, existing safety measures will be eroded, and the framework of governance will be invaded. The Biden administration's AI-related presidential order, which was created in collaboration with Big Tech companies, may be revoked by the Trump administration, and the procedures for safety testing of high-risk AI systems may be dismantled.' Bremmer also warned that the development of frontier models and the realization of general-purpose artificial intelligence will accelerate, leading to an unprecedented demand for energy, water, and land resources. The destructive potential of AI will dramatically increase, and new models will be able to pursue their goals autonomously with minimal human supervision. These 'agents' will be able to interact with real-world systems, adapt to unexpected situations, and spread misinformation and market manipulation more efficiently. The most advanced models will increasingly show resistance to human control.
