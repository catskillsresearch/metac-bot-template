**India's Economic Growth: A Bright Spot in a Turbulent World**
India's GDP growth rate for the fiscal year 2024-25 has been recorded at 6.5%, which is lower than the 8.2% growth rate of the previous year, but still impressive compared to other major economies. The country's GDP growth rate has been steadily increasing, with the fourth quarter of 2024-25 recording a growth rate of 7.4%. This has reaffirmed India's economic resilience and sustained growth. The government has highlighted India's position as one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. Experts have analyzed India's economic performance, compared it to the global economy, and discussed its future prospects. While the government's efforts to increase per capita income have been commendable, and the Modi government has been made aware of the need for sustained growth, it is essential to consider India's economic growth and the factors behind it. The 6.5% GDP growth rate in India is particularly noteworthy in the context of global economic uncertainty. This is a significant achievement. Regardless of who is in power, it is essential to consider the positive aspects of India's economic growth. International institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have credited India's economic policies and structural reforms for this achievement. According to the latest data from the National Statistical Office, India's nominal GDP is expected to reach Rs 324.11 lakh crore (approximately $3.8 trillion) in 2024-25, a growth of 9.7%. This includes a 9.9% growth in the production sector and a similar growth in the construction sector. The main reasons behind this growth include a strong domestic demand, the government's increased spending on infrastructure, and the expansion of the digital economy. Private final consumption expenditure grew by 7.3%, and government final consumption expenditure grew by 4.1%, giving the economy a boost. Additionally, India's favorable demographic structure and young workforce have increased productivity, which sets it apart from the global level. This is a testament to the Modi government's policies. Therefore, a positive but cautious approach is taken by experts. The 6.5% GDP growth rate in 2024-25 is a slowdown compared to the 8.2% growth rate in 2023-24, which is due to a decline in industrial production and a shortage of global demand. Although the growth in the agricultural sector has increased to 3.8% from 1.4%, there is a risk of a negative impact on agriculture due to the irregularity of the monsoon. Furthermore, a decline in the Purchasing Managers' Index has also indicated a slowdown in some sectors. However, optimistic experts believe that India's long-term prospects are bright. NITI Aayog CEO BVRS Subrahmanyam has stated that India has surpassed Japan to become the fourth-largest economy in the world. According to SP Global Market Intelligence, India could become the third-largest economy by 2030 with a GDP of $7.3 trillion. India's economic performance is extremely impressive compared to the global economy. While China's GDP growth rate is 4.6%, Japan's is only 0.9%, and major European economies such as Germany and France have recorded growth rates of 0.2% and 1.1%, respectively, India's GDP growth rate is 6.5%. The United States' economy is growing at 2.5%, but this is lower than India's growth rate. India has achieved its target of surpassing Japan to become the fourth-largest economy by 2025, or will achieve it by the end of the year. India's influence has increased on international platforms such as the G20 and the IMF. Additionally, despite a decline in the export-GDP ratio, India's digital services exports and improvements in the production sector have strengthened its position in global trade. However, India's economy faces some challenges. Global demand shortages, increasing geopolitical tensions, and domestic inflation could put pressure on the economy. Additionally, India's per capita income is still low, which is a true measure of the general citizen's prosperity. In 2023, India's per capita income was $2,610, which is much lower than Japan and the United States. However, India has many opportunities. The government's 'Make in India' and 'Digital India' initiatives have boosted production and service sectors. Additionally, foreign direct investment in India is increasing, creating new job opportunities. In the fiscal year 2024-25, India has achieved a 6.5% GDP growth rate, reaffirming its economic resilience and global leadership.

**Is 6.5% GDP growth new normal for India?**
India's economy has posted a 6.5% GDP growth for the full year FY25, which is the slowest pace in the last four years. Economists are increasingly concerned that growth may plateau around 6-6.5% and that the ingredients for a return to 7%-plus growth are missing. According to Namrata Mittal, economist at SBI Mutual Fund, 'Post-Covid, there was a real push to boost exports and ramp up infrastructure spending, which lifted economic growth. But all of that is now built into the base.' The IMF projects GDP growth at 6.2% for FY26 and 6.3% for FY27, while the government's Chief Economic Advisor (CEA), V. Anantha Nageswaran, puts FY26 growth in the 6.3-6.8% range. Private sector investment continues to lag, and although consumption growth rebounded to 7.2% in real terms, it still lacks underlying strength. Arun Kumar, former professor of economics at JNU, notes that 'Private investment remains subdued,' and that 'weak demand over the past three years has kept formal sector capacity utilization at around 75%.'

**World Economic Forum Warns of Global Economic Fragility**
The World Economic Forum's 'Chief Economists Outlook' report highlights growing concerns about the fragility of the global economy. Based on a survey conducted between April 3 and 17, 2025, the report collects the perspectives of chief economists from the public and private sectors. Experts warn that the state of the global economy will significantly deteriorate, mainly due to abrupt changes in US commercial policy. The US has imposed historic tariff increases, including a 10% general tariff and up to 145% on Chinese products. China has retaliated with export restrictions on strategic minerals. Although a 90-day pause in the tariff escalation was agreed upon, experts believe that uncertainty persists. The report states that US commercial policy decisions are perceived as a long-term structural change, not a temporary disruption. 79% of surveyed economists share this view. The risks are not limited to the US. In Europe, a weak growth persists, but signs of recovery are seen, driven by more expansive fiscal policies, particularly in Germany. In China, the 5% growth target is met with skepticism, with the IMF reducing its projections to 4% due to internal and external factors affecting demand and the dynamism of the real estate sector. In Latin America, the situation is equally challenging, with a 2% growth expectation for 2025, down from 2.4% in the previous year. The report highlights the growing fragmentation of the global economy, with 98% of economists expecting it to accelerate in the remainder of the year. 94% anticipate that economic nationalism will increasingly influence policy decisions. The uncertainty has led to a paralysis in business decision-making, with 87% of experts believing that companies are delaying strategic investments, reorganizing supply chains, and diversifying operations to reduce risks. The uncertainty has become a structural feature of the global economy, with over 80% of surveyed economists rating it as 'very high' and only a slight majority expecting it to decrease in the next year. The areas most affected will be trade, GDP growth, and foreign direct investment. In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a double-edged factor. While 45% expect it to be disruptive in 2025, 81% believe it can contribute between 1 and 10 percentage points to global growth in the next decade. However, its impact on employment is uncertain, with 47% anticipating net job losses and only 19% expecting net gains. The most promising areas are automation of tasks and acceleration of innovation. The report concludes that AI can become the main driver of economic innovation if it is properly channeled, but also warns of associated risks, such as market concentration, unemployment, increased inequality, and disinformation. Governments and companies must prepare to integrate AI into their operations, with 89% of economists believing it is essential to invest in AI infrastructure and 75% seeing a need for public investment in training and labor retraining. Businesses should prioritize redesigning processes, improving data infrastructure, and strengthening cybersecurity.

**The Second Largest Inventory Build in History, Expect Big Problems**
The US economy experienced its second-largest inventory build in history, with a 2.64 percentage point contribution to GDP in the first quarter of 2025. However, this is largely due to companies stockpiling goods ahead of reciprocal tariffs, which may not be sustainable. Real Final Sales declined by 2.9 percentage points, and Gross Domestic Income (GDI) declined by 0.2 percent. Corporate profits fell by 2.95 percent, and the long bond yield is at 4.92 percent, indicating a potential recession. The author notes that the worst of the tariff mess may be behind us, but serious long-term debt issues remain. The author is temporarily wavering from near-term inflation, but serious long-term debt issues remain.

**Visualized: Post-Pandemic GDP Growth Recovery, by Region**
Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic, global economies have shown varying levels of recovery. According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook of April 2025, the U.S. is the only major economy to have surpassed its pre-pandemic GDP growth projections, with a 14.6% growth from 2019 to 2025, beating the pre-pandemic trend by 4.0 percentage points. In contrast, China's real GDP growth from 2019-2025 is -7.4 pp lower than pre-pandemic projections, and the euro area's recovery has also lagged, with GDP growth falling 2.8 percentage points short of its pre-pandemic trend. According to Brookings analysis, the U.S. standout recovery is largely due to the aggressive fiscal support provided during the pandemic, which enabled consumption to grow at a faster rate post-pandemic. However, U.S. GDP growth is now projected to hit a speed bump following the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs announced in April 2025.

**Charted: Falling GDP Growth Forecasts for 2025**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded its global real GDP growth forecast from 3.3% in January 2025 to 2.8% in April 2025 due to rising trade uncertainty and economic slowdowns. The IMF has also revised 2026 projections downward, with global real GDP growth now projected at 3% next year, down from 3.3% in January. The U.S. economy is expected to grow just 1.7% in 2026, with the impact of tariffs and trade wars continuously affecting growth over the next year. Major economies such as the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have seen significant downgrades in their GDP growth forecasts, while Russia is the only country on the list with an upward revision.

**Russia's Share in Global Economy Reaches Maximum Since 2021**
According to calculations by RIA Novosti based on IMF data, Russia's share in the global economy grew to 3.54% by the end of last year, reaching a maximum since 2021. The organization used the first estimate of Russia's GDP for 2024, and the second estimate is already available. According to it, Russia's economy, calculated in terms of purchasing power parity, reached $6.94 trillion in 2023, up from $6.48 trillion in the previous year. This allowed the country to maintain its fourth place among the world's largest economies. As a result, Russia's contribution to the global economy increased to 3.54% from 3.49% a year earlier, reaching a maximum since 2021. Over the past decade, the indicator has grown by 0.15 percentage points. In contrast, the US reduced its contribution by 0.06 percentage points to 14.88%, while Japan and Germany reduced their contributions by 0.1 percentage points to 3.33% and 3.06%, respectively. China increased its share to 19.45% from 19.12%, and India to 8.25% from 8%.

**UNCTAD: Global GDP Growth in 2025 Could Slow Down to 2.3% Due to Commercial Tensions and Uncertainty**
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has warned that the global GDP growth in 2025 could slow down to 2.3% annually, down from 2.8% in the previous two years, due to 'commercial tensions and uncertainty'. This could put the global economy on a recessionary path, with growing threats such as 'policy shocks, financial volatility, and increased uncertainty that could continue to weaken global prospects', according to a UNCTAD report on 2025 prospects. UNCTAD notes that a growth rate below 2.5% is an indicator of a global recession, and if confirmed in 2025, it would mark 'a significant deceleration compared to the average annual growth rates recorded in the pre-pandemic period, which was already a period of moderate growth'. The report highlights that the economic prospects for this year are clouded by 'the highest levels of political uncertainty seen in this century', surpassing even the high levels seen in 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 'The application of successive rounds of restrictive commercial measures and geoeconomic confrontation threaten to cause severe disruptions to transnational production chains and international trade flows, which in turn will drag down global economic activity', UNCTAD analyzes.

**Understanding GDP: Real vs. Nominal, and the Concept of 'Momentary Wind Speed'**
GDP is the king of economic statistics, and it is released quarterly to show how much value has been added to the economy during that period. The 'real' GDP is the one that excludes price increases, and it is the one used to calculate the growth rate. The 'momentary wind speed' is a term used to describe the growth rate over a four-quarter period, which is then converted to an annual rate. Japan's real GDP growth rate has been around 1% in recent years, except for 2021 when it was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's nominal GDP has fallen to fourth place in the world, and its share of the world's GDP has decreased from 17.5% in 1995 to 4.2% in 2022. Even considering the impact of a weak yen, the country's economic performance is a concern. The OECD ranks Japan 21st in terms of GDP per capita among its member countries. In 2023, Japan's nominal GDP was 596.5 trillion yen, with personal consumption accounting for 54% of the total. The country's GDP statistics are released quarterly, and they are based on a large amount of data that is processed to reflect the country's economic activity. The data is used to calculate the growth rate, which is then converted to an annual rate. China, on the other hand, only releases the GDP growth rate on a year-over-year basis, and it does not provide the momentary wind speed. This is because China has a planned economy and places more emphasis on production-side statistics. However, this has led to a delay in the country's transition to the SNA standard, and some economists have pointed out the discrepancy between the GDP growth rate and the real economy.

**OECD Report: Global GDP Growth to Drop Marginally from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025**
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has released its Economic Outlook report, revealing that global GDP growth will moderate from 3.2 percent in 2024 to 3.1 percent in 2025 due to higher trade barriers and increased policy uncertainty. The report notes that while the global economy remained resilient in 2024, signs of weakness are appearing, including lingering inflation and an uncertain policy environment. According to the report, annual real GDP growth in the United States is projected to slow to 2.2 percent in 2025 and 1.6 percent in 2026, while Euro area real GDP growth is projected to be 1.0 percent in 2025 and 1.2 percent in 2026. The report also warns that further trade fragmentation could harm global growth prospects and urges central banks to remain vigilant and policymakers to take decisive fiscal actions to ensure debt sustainability.

**World Bank Expects Gradual Decline in Dollar Value Starting from Spring 2025**
The World Bank expects a gradual decline in the value of the dollar starting from spring 2025. According to a report by the World Bank, titled 'Global Economic Outlook', it is necessary to take measures at both the global and national policy levels to encourage a more favorable external environment, promote economic stability, reduce structural constraints, address the effects of climate change, and thus accelerate the pace of growth and development in the long term. The report states that the global economy is expected to grow by 2.7% in both 2025 and 2026, the same rate as in 2024, with a gradual decline in inflation and interest rates. The report also notes that the new trade restrictions in 2024 were five times higher than the average of the years 2010-2019, resulting in a general decline in economic growth from 5.9% in the first decade of the 21st century to 5.1% in the second decade and then to 3.5% in the third decade. The report warns that the next 25 years will be more challenging for developing countries compared to the previous 25 years. The forecast for real GDP growth for 2025 and 2026 remained at 2.5% and 2.6% respectively, in an update in January 2025, indicating a modest slowdown compared to the global growth rate of 2.7% in 2024, but a larger slowdown compared to the average annual global growth rate of over 3% over the five years until 2019 (i.e. before the COVID-19 shock).

**WB revises up Vietnam’s 2025 GDP growth forecast to 6.6%**
The World Bank has revised up Vietnam's 2025 GDP growth forecast to 6.6%, a 0.6 percentage point increase from the June 2024 edition. This figure is lower than the Vietnamese government's target of at least 8% this year. Vietnam's economic growth is expected to outpace many major nations, including the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The World Bank anticipates Vietnam's GDP growth to be 6.3% in 2026, a 0.2 percentage point decrease from the June 2024 edition. On a global scale, the bank projects the global economy to expand by 2.7% in both 2025 and 2026, a weaker performance than before the pandemic. The bank stressed that developing economies, which fuel 60% of global growth, are projected to finish the first quarter of the 21st century with the weakest long-term growth outlook since 2000.
