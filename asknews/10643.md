**NATO Summit in The Hague: What to Expect**
The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, scheduled for June 24-25, 2025, is expected to be a significant event. The main goal of the summit is to strengthen unity among allies and define strategic directions for the next few years. Key topics will include further support for Ukraine, increased defense spending among allies, support for the defense industry, and cybersecurity. However, there are still many open questions, including who will attend the summit, whether Donald Trump will be present, and whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will receive an invitation. According to sources, the US does not want Zelensky to attend the summit, but the Dutch government has expressed its desire to invite him. The summit's communique is expected to be unusually short, with some sources suggesting it may contain only three paragraphs. The Dutch government has taken measures to ensure the summit's security, including deploying 27,000 police officers and 10,000 military personnel. The event will also be a test for the Netherlands' cybersecurity, with the country's military and government agencies being targeted by Russian hackers. The Dutch government has banned the use of drones around the conference center where the summit will take place, and has also restricted air traffic in the area. The summit is expected to cost over 183 million euros, nearly twice the initial estimate of 95 million euros.

**Germany and NATO Ready to Defend Against Russia, Says Generalmajor Henne**
Generalmajor Andreas Henne, commander of the new Home Defense Division, believes that the German military and NATO are quickly deployable in case of an emergency. 'My claim is 'fight tonight': We must and we will be deployable within a few hours,' Henne said to t-online. The German military is capable of defending Germany if it were attacked tomorrow. NATO is also ready: 'NATO is powerful enough to deter Russia and capable enough to defend against an attack. 400 million Europeans and 360 million Americans can defend against 160 million Russians. We must not be misled. We are more, we have more, and we are better.' Meanwhile, the US intelligence agency DIA has assessed that Putin's strategy in Ukraine is to exhaust the will of the Ukrainian people. 'Putin is likely committed to winning in Ukraine and his goals have remained largely unchanged since the start of the war: Ukraine's neutrality and further division of the Ukrainian state,' the report says. 'As long as there is no negotiation solution or massive Western aid, the prospects on the battlefield will likely continue to develop in favor of Russia until the end of 2025, even if Russian successes on the battlefield slow down and are still associated with high losses in personnel and equipment.' Additionally, the article reports on various other developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, including a prisoner exchange, a Russian attack on Kiew, and a statement by the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj.

**Germany Deploys First Permanent Brigade Outside of Country Since World War II**
Germany has deployed its first permanent brigade outside of the country since World War II, with 4,800 soldiers and 200 civilian staff in Lithuania. The move is part of NATO's efforts to strengthen its eastern flank in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said, 'Anybody who challenges NATO must know that we are prepared. Anybody who threatens an ally must know that the entire alliance will defend together every centimeter of NATO territory.' Merz also stated, 'Protecting Vilnius is protecting Berlin.' The brigade is part of a broader effort to increase military spending among NATO members, with a goal of 3.5% of GDP on defense and 1.5% on defense-related infrastructure. Germany's defense spending has increased from 1.19% of GDP in 2014 to 2.12% in 2024. The deployment is expected to be completed by 2027, with the goal of attracting more soldiers to the German military. The government has approved a law to make the military career more attractive, with benefits such as better pay and education opportunities.

**German Chancellor Warns of Russian Threat to European Security**
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that Russia poses a threat to the security of Europe as a whole, during a visit to Lithuania to celebrate the establishment of the first permanent German military unit outside of Germany since World War II. Merz said, 'There is a threat to us all from Russia, we will defend ourselves against this threat, that's why we are here today.' He added, 'We are determined together with our partners to defend the territories of the alliance against any aggression, the security of our allies in the Baltic region is also our security.' Merz emphasized that 'anyone who challenges NATO must know that we are ready, and anyone who threatens any ally must know that the entire alliance will defend every inch of NATO territory together.' Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda praised the alliance with Germany, describing it as 'an unbeatable force', and said, 'Together we will ensure that the people of Lithuania and Germany will not face the toughest test: war.' The German military unit in Lithuania aims to strengthen NATO's eastern flank against Russia. The decision to establish the first armored battalion, which will consist of 5,000 personnel over the next few years, was a response to Russia's comprehensive invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The battalion, which will include around 4,800 soldiers and 200 civilian employees in the German armed forces, will be deployed gradually over the next few years, and is expected to reach its full operational capacity by 2027. Currently, there is a group of around 400 personnel from the German armed forces in the country, according to the Ministry of Defense.

**Germany set to defend NATO neighbours with new brigade in Lithuania**
Germany is establishing a new 45 Armoured Brigade in Lithuania as part of NATO's efforts to strengthen its eastern flank in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. According to Chancellor Friedrich Merz, 'Anyone who challenges NATO must know that we are prepared. Anyone who threatens an ally must know that the entire alliance will jointly defend every inch of NATO territory.' The brigade will comprise 4,800 troops and 2,000 vehicles, including dozens of tanks, and will be fully operational by the end of 2027. Germany is also modernising its armed forces, with a goal to become Europe's strongest conventional army, and has loosened its constitutional debt brake to fund a surge in defence spending. NATO estimates indicate that Germany's defence spending was 2.12% of GDP last year, up from 1.19% in 2014, and is expected to increase further.

**NATO Exercises Begin in Finland, Raising Concerns from Russia**
The Karelian Sword 25 exercises, led by the Karelian Brigade, began in Kuhmo, Finland on May 23 and will run until June 1. The exercises involve around 700 units of equipment, including a British Army helicopter unit. This is the second major exercise in the region this month, following the Lively Sabre 25 exercises, which started earlier this week and involve 3,500 troops. Russia has expressed concern over NATO's buildup in Europe, stating that it will not ignore actions that pose a threat to its interests. As Finland has increased its military exercises since joining NATO in April 2023, Russian Ambassador to Finland Pavel Kuznetsov noted that the country's territory was used in a major NATO exercise for the first time last year. 'Finland has increased the number of military exercises since joining NATO,' Kuznetsov said. 'We will not leave without attention actions that pose a threat to our interests.'

Trump has warned that countries not meeting the spending target may not receive US protection. Several countries, including Spain, have pledged to increase their spending to meet the target. The US remains the largest military spender in NATO, accounting for 64% of all defense expenditure in 2024.

The winner of last year's Peace Prize was the Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo, which was awarded for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear arms and to demonstrate through witness testimony that nuclear arms should never be used again. The Peace Prize will be awarded on October 10 and will be presented on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, in a double ceremony in Oslo and Stockholm.

**NATO's 'Steadfast Defender 2025' Exercises Test Alliance's Eastern Front Capabilities**
The 'Steadfast Defender 2025' maneuvers are currently taking place, involving around 10,000 soldiers from nine countries, as part of the new Allied Response Force under NATO. The exercises are being held in Romania, which shares a border with Ukraine, amidst growing concerns about the US's priority, the strongest member of the alliance, according to European network 'Yuronyuz'. The maneuvers will last for six weeks in Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece, and in the context of these exercises, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called on allies to significantly increase military spending, citing that US security priorities have shifted to other regions, sparking doubts about the continuation of US security guarantees for Europe. Despite the Trump administration not announcing plans to withdraw US troops from the region, Austin's comments that 'European allies must take the lead' have made NATO countries think about the possibility of a reality shift where the US role as a nuclear security guarantor in the continent may decline. A NATO military official said, 'These exercises represent the pinnacle of our efforts and the beginning of forming our new force that will defend every inch of alliance territory.' Meanwhile, European allies expressed concern about being marginalized in talks between US and Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, which aimed to find ways to end the war in Ukraine, prompting French President Emmanuel Macron to call for an emergency meeting this week with some European countries and the UK in Paris. The NATO exercises in Romania included live-fire and trench warfare drills, while Greek and Spanish marines led exercises in Greece last week, including a simulated amphibious assault.

**A worried NATO holds large-scale combat drills as the U.S. shifts...**
NATO members are conducting their largest combat exercises of 2025, known as Steadfast Dart 2025, in Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece. The drills involve around 10,000 military personnel from nine nations and are part of NATO's new Allied Reaction Force. The exercises come as a response to growing concerns over the United States' commitment to European security under President Donald Trump's administration. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has called for European allies to 'lead from the front,' leaving NATO partners wondering if the US will continue to be a powerful backstop for the continent's security. Radu Tudor, a defense analyst, said a US rollback of its military presence in Romania would be 'a gift' to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The drills include live-fire training and trench warfare exercises, and are designed to test NATO's ability to rapidly deploy large-scale forces on the alliance's eastern border.

**Zelensky Warns of Russian Attack on NATO Countries in 2025**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on February 14 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for an attack on NATO countries in 2025. According to Zelensky, Russia will prepare 15 divisions for the Belarusian direction this year, consisting of 100-150 thousand people. They can be deployed to Ukraine, Poland, or the Baltic states, as was the case in 2022. Zelensky believes that Putin is planning a war with NATO countries. 'I think that's his idea. Based on the intelligence I receive, I believe he is preparing for war with NATO countries next year,' he said. This comes after a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) on December 6 stated that Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signed a new security agreement, effectively attempting to annex Belarus. A document leaked in 2023 revealed Russia's plan to 'absorb' Belarus by 2030, including a unified currency and tax system, and the subordination of the Belarusian army to Russian laws.

**NATO tests new deployment model without US ahead of Ukraine war anniversary**
NATO is conducting the Steadfast Dart 2025 exercises, a six-week operation involving 10,000 troops from nine nations, to test its ability to rapidly deploy across eastern Europe without direct U.S. assistance. The exercises, taking place in Bulgaria, Romania, and Greece, represent the largest NATO operation planned this year. The U.S. absence comes as European nations seek to build greater military self-sufficiency due to concerns about the Trump administration's commitment to common defense and demands for increased European military spending. The exercises demonstrate NATO's new Allied Reaction Force, established last July, which combines conventional forces with cyber and space-based technologies to deploy at scale within 10 days. According to Italian Lt. Gen. Lorenzo D'Addario, the ARF's commander, 'This is what we've been training for.' The exercise involves forces from nine NATO members, including regional rivals Greece and Turkey, and focuses on rapid deployment scenarios and multi-domain operations. British forces lead the operation with 2,600 military personnel and 730 vehicles, assuming command of all land forces during the drills. The drills, which end on February 26, underscore NATO's shifting military posture along its eastern boundaries.

**NATO Conducts Steadfast Dart 2025 Exercises Amid Russian Invasion of Ukraine**
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is conducting the Steadfast Dart 2025 exercises, a six-week operation involving around 10,000 soldiers from nine countries in Bulgaria, Romania, and Greece. The exercises come as the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches its third anniversary. The absence of the United States in the exercises is notable, as European nations are seeking to increase their military autonomy in light of concerns over the US government's commitment to collective defense and calls for increased military spending in Europe. NATO Secretary-General Pete Hegseth said that Europe must 'dramatically' increase its defense spending and take on the 'overwhelming' burden of financing Ukraine. The exercises will test the new NATO Rapid Response Force, which was created last July and is designed to deploy at large scale in just 10 days, combining conventional forces with cyber and space-based technology. 'Now we realize that the world we thought existed has almost disappeared completely,' said Greek Defense Minister Nikos Dendias. 'These challenges cannot be addressed by individual nations, not even by a powerful nation like the United States.' The exercises involve forces from nine NATO members, including regional rivals Greece and Turkey, and will feature 17 ships, over 20 aircraft, and over 1,500 military vehicles. The UK is leading the operation with 2,600 troops and 730 vehicles, taking command of all ground forces during the exercises.
