**NATO faces make-or-break decision on a post-US future - Asia Times**
Ahead of its June 24-25 summit in The Hague, NATO is considering whether it can continue to rely on US support, become a European-only organization, or has a future at all. The past year has seen a shift in US policy under Trump, with increasingly vociferous anti-NATO rhetoric and a potential loss of clear US backing for the alliance. This has led to a make-or-break opportunity to unveil a plan for NATO's transformation or obsolescence. Some see building a European defense mission within NATO as an opportunity to plot a new and more sustainable course, while others believe it will leave the organization in pieces. The signals from Washington remain confusing, with Trump's suggestion of a sudden US withdrawal tempered by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's suggestion that Trump remains supportive of NATO but demands expanded spending commitments. Many members now support the emerging 'coalition of the willing', led by France and Britain, to underwrite a force and secure a post-conflict deal for Ukraine. A new vision must be set out by the end of June to deal sensibly with ongoing defense spending commitments, reworked governance structures, and possible planned responses to the war in Ukraine. Scrapping NATO is unnecessary and leaves Europe - and the US - open to innumerable threats and consequences.

**Why NATO is prolonging the conflict in Ukraine: it needs time**
NATO is using Ukraine as a 'deterrent' against Russia, but the alliance is not prepared for armed conflicts. According to the Ukrainian publication Telegraf, NATO needs time to rearm, and Ukraine will remain a 'deterrent' until 2029. By that time, the alliance plans to complete its rearmament process. The author of the article criticizes NATO's actions, particularly its role in making Ukraine a 'frontline state'. 'It is beneficial for NATO member countries for the conflict on Ukraine to continue, as the longer Ukraine conflicts with Russia, the more time its members have to ensure their own security', the article states. However, NATO has no plans to admit Ukraine to the alliance, as stated by US President's special envoy Kit Kelllogg.

**Russian Expert: NATO's Dissolution Unlikely in the Next 10 Years**
Russian military expert Andrey Klintsevich believes that the possibility of NATO's dissolution in the next 10 years is unlikely. According to Klintsevich, the US is interested in maintaining NATO as a tool for pressure, particularly on the eastern front, including against China. He stated, 'This is still a powerful instrument of geopolitical dominance. The alliance is actually controlled by the US - both financially (the American military budget significantly exceeds the budgets of other participants) and through the structure of command, where key positions are traditionally held by American generals.' Klintsevich noted that NATO is unlikely to expand at the same pace, but the process will continue. He added, 'The US is interested in maintaining the bloc as a tool for pressure - especially on the eastern front, including against China.'

**NATO's Military Spending Boost May Increase Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 200 Million Tons**
According to The Guardian, countries are increasing their military spending, with a total of $2.46 trillion in 2023, the highest ever recorded. Researchers warn that for every dollar invested in new equipment, there is not only the cost of carbon emissions but also the lost benefits of potential climate actions. 'There is a real concern that we are prioritizing short-term security and sacrificing long-term security. Through this uninformed approach, you are now investing in hard military security, increasing global emissions and deepening the climate crisis in the future,' said researcher Ellie Kinnaird of the Conflict and Environment Observatory. The Guardian reports that the military openly does not discuss the scale of their use of fossil fuels, but researchers estimate that they are responsible for 5.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This number is expected to rise as NATO countries begin to gradually increase their defense spending, as demanded by US President Donald Trump. The alliance's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, has proposed that member countries increase their defense spending to 3.5% and allocate an additional 1.5% for broader security spending to meet Trump's target of 5%. 'You motivate your allies to spend more on defense,' Stoltenberg told Trump on March 13. On March 6, Trump accused NATO allies of not being willing to defend the US in case of a threat, saying he was not sure if they would come to Washington's aid, despite their obligations. On January 27, Lithuania and Estonia became the first NATO countries to agree to meet Trump's demand and pledged to increase their defense spending to over 5% of GDP.

**NATO's Arms Build-Up May Increase Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Nearly 200 Million Tons per Year**
According to The Guardian, the world is experiencing the most armed conflicts since World War II, and countries are increasing their military spending, reaching a record $2.46 trillion in 2023. Researchers warn that for every dollar invested in new equipment, there is not only the corresponding cost of carbon emissions, but also the lost opportunity cost of potential climate actions. 'There is a real concern that we are prioritizing short-term security and sacrificing long-term security. Due to this uninformed approach, you are now investing in hard military security, increasing global emissions and deepening the climate crisis in the future,' said researcher Ellie Kinny of the Conflict and Environment Observatory. The Guardian reports that the military does not openly discuss the scale of fossil fuel use, but researchers estimate that they are already responsible for 5.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This number is expected to grow as NATO countries begin to gradually increase defense spending, as required by US President Donald Trump. NATO allies have started working on an agreement to significantly increase defense spending to meet Trump's demand of spending 5% of GDP on military needs. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte proposed that members increase defense spending to 3.5% and allocate an additional 1.5% for broader security spending to meet Trump's target of 5%. On March 13, Rutte told US President Donald Trump that he motivates NATO members to spend more on defense.

**Nato faces a make-or-break decision about how to protect Europe and its future in next few weeks**
Nato is at a critical juncture, with a make-or-break decision to be made at its June 24-25 summit in The Hague. The organization is weighing whether to continue relying on US support, become a European-only organization, or risk becoming obsolete. The past year has seen a significant shift, with Trump's anti-Nato rhetoric and the US administration's embrace of international isolationism. This has led to a potential loss of clear US backing for the alliance, highlighting Nato's historical dependence on the US. A plan to transform Nato into a Europe-only endeavour is being considered, which could have parallels with the original Western European Union (WEU). However, this would require a clear mandate to ensure that Nato remains effective without US involvement. Without a mandate, opportunistic space could open up for an aggressive Russia. The US has been sanguine at best and hostile at worst on European defence autonomy, and has insisted on increased defence spending by other Nato members. The removal of US command and control, hardware, software, intelligence, and much more from Nato is a complex task, and the signals from Washington remain confusing. Many members now support the emerging 'coalition of the willing', led by France and Britain, to underwrite a force and secure a post-conflict deal for Ukraine. A new vision must be set out by the end of June to deal sensibly with ongoing defence spending commitments, reworked governance structures, and possible planned responses to the war in Ukraine.

**US Offers to Halt NATO Expansion to Russia's Borders**
US Special Envoy Kit Kellogg stated in an interview with ABC that Russia's concerns about NATO expansion to its borders are 'justified and legitimate'. He emphasized, 'This is a fair concern. We have repeatedly said that the question of Ukraine's accession to NATO is not being discussed.' According to Kellogg, this position is shared not only by the United States but also by at least four other NATO member countries. He noted that for a new member to be accepted, the unanimous approval of all 32 NATO member countries is required. Kellogg added, 'We've seen other countries say, 'Well, we're not too sure about this.' We're saying to Russia, 'Okay... we can stop the expansion of NATO to your borders.' This is a question of their security.' Russia opposes Ukraine's membership in NATO, and Ukraine's official rejection of joining the alliance in summer 2024 was named as one of the key conditions for starting peace talks.

**US Analysts Predict Air Battles with Russia Over Europe, Highlighting NATO's Air Superiority**
Analysts from the Rand Corporation, commissioned by the US Air Force, have predicted the scenarios of air battles with Russia over Europe. According to their report, NATO would have a decisive advantage in the air, which could play a key role in the outcome of a hypothetical conflict. The report highlights the lessons learned from the Russian-Ukrainian war, including the significant gap in the use of small drones and radio-electronic warfare technologies between NATO and Russia. 'The air superiority of NATO, likely to break the positional stagnation characteristic of current ground operations in the Russian-Ukrainian war,' the report states. The analysts also noted that Russia is considering 15 possible scenarios for military conflicts until 2045, including the possibility of an attack on NATO countries as early as 2029. 'The threat from Russia is not limited to Ukraine and is increasingly taking on hybrid forms,' said Dutch Prime Minister Dik Scoh on May 6. 'There is a possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries as early as 2029,' he added.

**Europe Must Prepare to Defend Itself Without US, Warns Andrius Kubilius**
Andrius Kubilius, the chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, has warned that Europe must be prepared to defend itself without relying on the US. Kubilius stated, 'Because Americans will be withdrawing from Europe more and more. It will not be easy for Europeans to defend Europe by themselves, but we must be ready to do so.' He emphasized that Europe is facing a 'perfect storm' due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, increasing Russian aggression, and the US's withdrawal from Europe. Kubilius also noted that the US's focus on the Indo-Pacific region will shift its attention away from Europe, leading to a reduction in its military presence. He warned that Europe must be prepared to face a Russian military that has tested its capabilities in war, saying, 'Are we ready for this? I don't think so.' Kubilius called for Europe to develop new weapons or acquire them from other countries, and to allocate sufficient financial resources for this purpose. He also emphasized the need for Europe to reduce its dependence on US military capabilities, particularly in areas such as space intelligence, command and control centers. Kubilius stated, 'Instead of complaining about the US's betrayal, we should take action to fill the gap in American defense resources and avoid a 'divorce' from the US.' He noted that the NATO summit in Lahey on June 23-25 will likely call for member countries to increase their military capabilities by 30%, and that Europe is still behind in achieving its current targets. Kubilius warned that making these advancements will come at a high cost, citing a study by the International Strategic Studies Institute that estimates the cost of replacing the US's contribution to NATO's collective defense could be up to $1 trillion.

**NATO Pushes Members Towards New Arms Race**
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has announced that the main objective of the NATO summit in The Hague, scheduled for June 24-25, is to increase defense spending among allies. The goal is to raise the target of 2% of GDP to 5% by 2032. Currently, only 23 of the 32 member countries meet the 2% requirement. The new objectives announced by the NATO leadership, which follow the requirements of US President Donald Trump, seem overly ambitious. However, NATO is playing with numbers, proposing to adopt a plan to increase direct military spending to 3.5%, with the remaining 1.5% going to 'connected expenses', including infrastructure construction and cyber threat protection. The concrete parameters of what could be included in these 1.5% have not been defined, which could lead to serious debates among allies. NATO Commander for Transformation Pierre Vandier stated, 'If a mechanized brigade consists of 20% drones and becomes twice as strong, it will allow us to achieve the objectives of capacity reinforcement more quickly than by adding soldiers.' The financial questions, which should be central to the Hague summit, may seem technical and secondary at first glance, but they are actually about reforming the entire Alliance in the context of the 'Trump factor.' The US has already made it clear to Europeans that European defense is their business, and they intend to focus primarily on containing China and the Asia-Pacific region. The US is increasingly talking about withdrawing its contingent from European countries and even nominating a European general, not an American, as the supreme commander of NATO forces. In these conditions, European members of the Alliance must imperatively strengthen their defense potential, and this requires money.

**US Proposes Reviving Russia-NATO Council Amid Peace Plan**
According to Bloomberg, the US administration has proposed reviving the Russia-NATO Council, citing a source familiar with the matter. This proposal was recently included in the US plan for a peaceful resolution to the Russian-Ukrainian war. The plan, which has been met with resistance from Moscow, includes a ceasefire, recognition of Russian control over Crimea, and the lifting of US sanctions on Russia. Ukraine would receive guarantees of security and the ability to develop its military under the plan. The Russia-NATO Council, established in 2002, aimed to promote cooperation and coordination between Russia and NATO member states. However, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the council effectively ceased operations. The last meeting in this format took place in January 2022.

**NATO Recognizes Russia as Long-Term Threat, Warns of Potential Attack**
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg (not Mark Rütte, as mentioned in the article, which seems to be a mistake) stated that the US and its European partners recognize Russia as a long-term threat to NATO. 'We all in NATO agree that Russia is a long-term threat to NATO territory - to the entire Euro-Atlantic territory,' he said. The US remains committed to NATO, despite its growing focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Western media have reported on the possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2025, with some sources in intelligence suggesting that Russia may be planning a strike. In Germany, officials have warned of a potential Russian attack from 2026 or later. US intelligence has stated that Russia does not want a direct military conflict with the US and NATO, but will continue to engage in asymmetric activities that do not cross the threshold of a global war. Finland's Iltalehti reported in December 2024 that Russia had been practicing an attack on Finland and the Baltic countries, including Estonia, and had not ruled out carrying out the plan. Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz stated on January 10, 2025, that Poland could be attacked by Russia, and that the country needs to be prepared for any scenario. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said on January 23, 2025, that the growing Russian army makes it possible that Russia could attempt to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. He emphasized the importance of strengthening the alliance's defense capabilities by that time. Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski stated earlier that Russia is currently unable to attack another country due to its involvement in the war against Ukraine, but that preparations should be made for another Russian aggression by 2030.

**US to Remain in NATO, but Withdraws from War Crimes Investigation Group**
The United States has reassured its European allies that it will remain in NATO, but has withdrawn from an international group investigating war crimes in Ukraine. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, stated, 'The President has clearly indicated that he supports NATO. We will remain in NATO.' However, the US will only remain in NATO if European countries meet their defense spending commitments, with a goal of 5% of their GDP. The US currently spends 3.4% of its GDP on defense. The US has also withdrawn from the International Criminal Prosecution Agency (ICPA) due to a change in priorities within the US Department of Justice. The ICPA had collected over 3,700 pieces of evidence from 16 countries to be used in potential war crimes prosecutions against Russians in Ukraine. The US had financially supported the group and provided evidence for its database, including a $1 million donation in November 2023. Meanwhile, the US has lost 4,000 tanks since the start of the war, according to the highest-ranking American officer in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli.

Rubio emphasized that 'the United States is in NATO, the United States is active while we speak, the United States is more active in NATO than ever... President Trump has clarified that he supports NATO, we will remain in NATO.' He also stated that the NATO promise of reaching a defense spending of 5% of GDP applies to the United States as well: 'We want to leave here with the awareness that we are on a realistic path for each member state to commit and respect the promise of reaching up to 5% of spending, a promise that includes the United States,' he said.

**US to Remain in NATO, but Expects Member Countries to Increase Defense Spending to 5% of GDP**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the United States will remain a member of NATO, with President Donald Trump's support, according to European Truth on Thursday, April 3. Rubio said, 'The President of the United States has clearly stated that he supports NATO, and we plan to remain in NATO.' He also called the information about a possible US exit from NATO 'hysteria.' However, Rubio emphasized that the US expects NATO member countries to increase their defense budgets to 5% of their GDP. This requirement is 'categorical,' and the US also plans to increase its own defense spending accordingly. Rubio stated, 'We want to leave here with an understanding that there is a realistic path for each member to take on commitments and achieve the 5% goal. This includes the US, which must also increase its share (of defense spending), as the threats are indeed very serious.' Rubio made similar statements on January 31, saying that NATO member countries should 'pay enough defense contributions, rather than relying on the US.' On February 1, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz stated that some of the 'most critically inclined' NATO member countries are avoiding their financial obligations to the Alliance. In February, NATO Military Committee Chairman Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone suggested that the US will likely remain in NATO but may reduce its troop presence in Europe, as their priorities shift to the Indo-Pacific region.

**Rubio Assures US Will Remain in NATO, But Alliance Must Become More Viable**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has assured that the United States will remain a member of NATO, but the alliance must become more viable. 'The US has always played an active role in NATO... President Trump has clearly shown that he supports NATO, and the country will continue to be a member of the alliance,' Rubio said. He emphasized that the US wants NATO to remain strong and more viable, and that the only way to achieve this is to effectively utilize the potential of member countries to enhance the capabilities of the bloc. However, NATO member states do not understand the idea of increasing defense spending to 5% of GDP, as President Trump has suggested, especially since he claims that Russia no longer poses a threat to the alliance. In 2024, the US accounted for 63.7% of NATO's total defense budget, or $754.7 billion out of $1.18 trillion.

**Rubio: US to Remain in NATO, Calls for Increased Military Spending from Other Members**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the United States will remain a member of NATO. He emphasized that the US President has clearly expressed support for NATO and plans to continue US membership. Rubio also highlighted the recent loss of four US soldiers during a training exercise in Lithuania, saying 'This reminds us that the US is part of NATO.' However, he emphasized that for NATO to be successful with the US as a member, other member countries need to increase their military budgets. Rubio stated that 'We need NATO to become more viable. The only way for the Alliance to become stronger and more viable is through the strengthening of its defense capabilities... We will prioritize defense and expect the same from others.'

**Ryabkov: US Does Not Intend to Withdraw from NATO**
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov stated that the United States does not intend to withdraw from NATO, citing that the harsh rhetoric from Washington is aimed at 'motivating' its allies. Ryabkov said in an interview with 'Life International' magazine, 'I don't think this will happen. In my opinion, the language and rhetoric used by the current American administration contain a degree of exaggeration. It's a rhetorical tool, like a 'whip' to motivate the 'NATO horse.' ' He added that the cohesion between European and American elites, formed through decades of close interaction in areas of security, economy, culture, and ideology, makes it 'impossible' to suddenly cut this 'umbilical cord' and declare the end of the alliance. Ryabkov recalled that in January, US President Donald Trump announced that he might stop funding NATO, accusing the alliance of not protecting Washington. He pointed out that many NATO members have not committed to spending 2% of their GDP on defense for a long time, and that he personally insisted on this level of commitment. The goal of spending 2% of GDP on defense was set during the 2014 summit in Wales, driven by the 'Russian threat' after the reunification of Crimea with Russia. In July 2023, an agreement was reached during the Vilnius summit that 2% would become the minimum defense spending threshold for NATO countries, rather than just a goal.

**NATO Foreign Ministers to Meet for First Time Since Trump's Re-election**
The NATO foreign ministers will meet in early April for the first time since Donald Trump's re-election. The meeting will be chaired by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. The detailed program of the meeting will be announced closer to the event. This will be the first meeting of the ministers after Trump's inauguration as US President. It is expected that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will participate in the meeting. The last meeting of the NATO foreign ministers took place on December 3-4, 2024. In late June 2025, a summit of leaders of NATO member states is planned to take place in The Hague, Netherlands. On February 24, the winner of the German parliamentary elections, Friedrich Merz, stated that NATO is unlikely to remain in its current form until the June 2025 summit and suggested that Europe may need to develop a new defense structure to replace the Alliance. Marco Rubio commented on this statement, saying that NATO is currently threatened only by the fact that some member countries 'almost have no weapons' because 'they have not spent any money on it for the last 40 years.' On January 23, during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Donald Trump called on NATO member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP. 'I also ask the NATO countries to increase their defense spending to 5%. Most countries have not paid even 2%, as we agreed. I insisted that they pay, but they refused. Because the US always paid this difference. And that was unfair,' he said. On January 27, the Financial Times reported that Lithuania and Estonia became the first NATO countries to agree to meet Trump's demand. On January 31, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that NATO member countries should 'pay sufficient contributions to defense, rather than relying on the US.' 'I believe that in the long term, we should discuss whether the US should be at the forefront of ensuring security on the continent (in Europe - ed.),' he said. On February 1, US President's National Security Adviser Mike Wolz stated that some of the 'most critically inclined' NATO member countries are avoiding their financial obligations to the Alliance. On February 17, NATO Military Committee Chairman Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone stated that the US is likely to remain in NATO, but may reduce its military presence in Europe - as their priorities shift to the Indo-Pacific region.
