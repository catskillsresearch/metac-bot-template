According to the regional Rospotrebnadzor, nine residents of Krasnoyarsk, including five adults and four children, have been attacked by urban rats in the first quarter of 2025. The rodents most often bit the tips of people's fingers. Experts remind that rats are carriers of several infectious diseases.

Manhattan borough president candidate Brad Hoylman-Sigal is tied to a Maryland housing complex, Windsor Court and Tower Apartments, that has racked up 1,600 violations for rodent infestations, mold, and other issues. Hoylman-Sigal's husband, David Sigal, has a 2.5% ownership interest in the complex, according to the candidate's financial disclosures. Tenants have complained about conditions, including rodent infestations and mold, and have filed 'failure to pay' eviction notices against them. Hoylman-Sigal's campaign spokesperson insisted that he is not a 'slumlord' and that his husband has no involvement or control over the complex. However, a tenant leader criticized Hoylman-Sigal, saying that 'anyone who's profiting from being a slumlord should be able to run for office where housing is the top issue facing middle and low-income residents.'

**US Government Reports 757 UFO Sightings, Raises Concerns of Cartel-Operated Drones**
In 2023, a unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported to have collided with a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft. According to The New York Post, these unidentified objects have been seen in groups of up to eight and have been classified as drones on occasion. 'Pentagon and Federal Aviation Administration investigators have confirmed that these sightings have been documented every time a pilot has reported them to the corresponding air traffic control facility', The New York Post states. Additionally, a UFO that collided with a US combat aircraft 'is just one of a cloud of mysterious objects that are flying over the Air Force's training fields in Arizona', according to multiple reports revealed by The New York Post. Three more encounters with these objects were detected the following day, reports said. 'What I can tell you is that there has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly at the border' with Mexico, said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to that medium. The US government presented 757 reports of this type between May 2023 and June 2024, of which 708 occurred in the air, and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report issued by the Office of Anomaly Resolution. In context: US government dismisses, for now, security threat after sightings of drones in several states The drones and other flying objects, such as the Chinese spy balloon of 2023, are 'clearly passing through multiple US military information channels', added the medium. Some US officials, including Ron Vitiello, chief advisor to the US Customs and Border Protection Office, suggest that the mysterious flying objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. Vitiello told NewsNation Prime earlier this month that the 'unlimited funding' of the cartels could explain the impressive cutting-edge technology never seen before. 'Perhaps they have technology that we are not used to seeing in the drone sector', Vitiello said. 'That's part of their business model: to be able to iterate and innovate constantly in order to continue selling their poison to the United States', concludes the medium.

**Lawmakers to advocates: 'Be vocal' in final weeks of session**
New York lawmakers are facing pressure to pass hundreds of bills in the final weeks of the legislative session, which is expected to end on June 12. The Assembly has added three days to its schedule, but the Senate does not plan to extend its calendar. Lawmakers typically pass between 600 and 800 bills during the six-month session, but so far, only 153 bills have been adopted. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said, 'We will be fine, we will get everything done that we can get done.' Assemblywoman Deborah Glick urged advocates to be 'visible and vocal' in the final weeks of session, while Assemblywoman Karines Reyes said, 'There is a new pressure because of what the federal government has been doing.' The New York For All Act and the Dignity Not Detention Act are among the bills that advocates are pushing for, which aim to strengthen protections for immigrants and prohibit state police from working with ICE. 'You don't stand with us, we don't forget, our children don't forget, our tías don't forget,' Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz said, emphasizing the importance of remembering who in government stood with or against the people.

Manhattan borough president candidate Brad Hoylman-Sigal's husband, David Sigal, has an ownership stake in three apartment complexes in Maryland and Virginia, including the troubled Windsor Court, which has over 1,600 violations, including 246 in 2022. The complex has been infested with rodents, bedbugs, and mold, with tenants complaining about the conditions. Hoylman-Sigal reported income between $30,000 and $110,000 from the properties in 2023. A tenant leader, Alicia Barksdale, criticized Hoylman-Sigal, saying that someone who profits from being a slumlord should not run for office. A campaign spokesperson defended Hoylman-Sigal, stating that his husband has a passive 2.5% ownership interest in the complex and that Hoylman-Sigal has championed tenant protection and affordable housing in the Senate.

**Making of chariots progressing well for next month''s Rath Yatra: Puri Jagannath temple admin**
The Puri Jagannath temple administration has reported that the making of chariots for next month's Rath Yatra is progressing well. According to sources, around 200 people, including 78 'Maharana Sevak' (carpenter servitors), have been engaged in the chariot-making process this year. SJTA chief administrative officer Arabinda Padheee stated, 'One can see how the chariots are being made organically by many servitors and other stakeholders. This is literally the quintessential essence of the intangible heritage of the Jagannath culture.' The 26 wheels of the three chariots are fitted with the wooden axle after a special 'puja' during the 'Bhaunri' festival. The annual Rath Yatra is scheduled to be held on June 27 this year. 'Three chariots- Nandighosh of Lord Jagannath, Taladwaja of Lord Balabhadra and Darpa Dalan of Devi Subhadra stand separately on the Rath Khala,' said Bijay Mohapatra, the chief carpenter of Lord Jagannath's Nandighosh chariot. The 'Bhaunri' festival also marks the end of the 'chandan' yatra of the Lord Jagannath. This is a major festival in Puri for which the police have made adequate security arrangements, a senior SJTA officer said.

**New York City Faces Growing Rat Infestation Crisis**
A new report from the New York City Department of Health reveals a growing rat infestation crisis in the city. The areas of Grand Concourse in the Bronx, as well as Bushwick, Bedford Stuyvesant, and Prospect Heights in Brooklyn, are experiencing a significant increase in infestations, according to the latest semi-annual report from the Department of Health. The report, covering the period from January to June 2024, shows a 24% increase in failed rodent control orders compared to the previous period, with 9,993 failed inspections. The Bronx is the most affected district, with failed inspections rising from 21% to 27%. Manhattan shows a mixed situation, with Harlem seeing a decrease in failed inspections, from 77% to 66%, while the East Village/Chinatown area is experiencing an increase in infestations. The Department of Health has intensified its efforts to control the rat population through integrated pest management strategies, including increased inspections and public outreach. The report highlights the need for cooperation between government agencies, building owners, and residents to effectively control the rat infestation. 'It is crucial that we work together to address this issue,' said a spokesperson for the Department of Health. 'We are committed to providing the necessary resources and support to help residents and building owners take control of the rat problem.'

The city has installed 'Empire Bins', a new type of trash bin that resembles a spaceship, in upper Manhattan schools to combat rat infestation. However, locals are not pleased with the futuristic-looking bins, calling them 'hideous' and 'out of place'. The bins are part of a pilot program that will be rolled out in Harlem's Community District 9, with all residential buildings required to use them by June 1, 2025. According to the Department of Sanitation, the bins have been shown to be effective in reducing rat sightings, with a 60% decrease in the pilot zone. However, some residents are concerned about the aesthetic impact and the fact that the bins take up parking spaces. As one resident said, 'If this is the best they can do to solve the rat problem, then we will see.'

**NYC rolling out rat birth control this month. What to know about the city's new strategy for reducing rodents**
New York City is launching a pilot program to reduce its rodent population using rat birth control. The program, which begins on April 26, will distribute pellets to select rat mitigation zones in Harlem. According to New York City Councilmember Shaun Abreu, two rats can produce 15,000 descendants in a year, making birth control a key strategy in tackling the rodent problem. Abreu estimates that zones could see a difference in as little as six months. The pellets are sweet and contain a compound called triptolide that targets ovarian function in female rats and sperm production in male rats. Animal welfare organizations, including PETA, have expressed support for the program, which aims to keep poison out of the mouths of pets and wildlife.

While rat sightings are trending down citywide, some neighborhoods in NYC are experiencing massive spikes, with one area in Queens seeing a 119% increase in 311 complaints about rats last year. Residents in Jamaica Hills, Queens, are frustrated with the lack of action from the city to address the issue, with one resident saying, 'Every house has rats and nobody is doing anything about it.' The city's new waste containerization rule, which requires sealed containers for trash, may not yet be effective, as 2024 data shows a 1% decrease in citywide 311 complaints for rat sightings. However, some residents have reported a decrease in rat sightings since the implementation of the new rule, with one resident saying, 'The city gave us garbage cans and that helped a lot.'

**Exclusive | Rat sightings up by 119% in this NYC nabe – as vermin-hating locals claim ‘every house has rats’**
Rat sightings have increased by 119% in Jamaica Hills, Queens, with residents claiming 'every house has rats' and calling for action from the city. Shuvro Md, a 39-year-old marketing consultant, said, 'Every house has rats and nobody is doing anything about it.' The city's sanitation department attributes the increase to a lack of sealed trash containers, but is working to implement a new waste containerization rule that requires all buildings with one to nine residential units to use sealed containers. Meanwhile, citywide rat sightings have decreased by only 1% year-over-year, with some neighborhoods seeing significant improvements. However, rats remain a problem in many areas, with residents citing construction, excess garbage, and other factors as contributing to the issue.

**Is New York Winning the Fight Against Rats?**
New York City is taking steps to reduce its rat population and improve waste management. The city has implemented a containerization policy, requiring businesses and residents to use trash cans instead of leaving bags on the sidewalk. The policy has led to a 23% decline in rat sightings in low-density residential areas. However, the New York Post reported that rats have been able to chew through the city's 'rat-proof' trash bins. The city is also exploring other options, including composting and using technology to reduce waste. A mandatory compost policy began in October 2024 and will result in fines for non-compliance. Additionally, the city is considering using drones to enforce its trash agenda and prevent illegal dumping. 'As a result of these measures, rat sightings continue to decline,' said Vincent Gragnani, NYC Department of Sanitation Press Secretary. 'One year later, we saw year-over-year declines in rat sightings.'

**What S.F. can learn from New York about getting our rat infestation under control**
San Francisco's rat infestation is a persistent problem, with a recent study suggesting that the city has the second-largest increase of rats in the nation. However, the city's efforts to control the population are ongoing, with the San Francisco Department of Public Health, Recreation and Park Department, and Public Works all working together to eradicate rats and secure food waste. New York City, which has a notoriously robust rat population, offers a good lesson in how to mitigate the problem. In 2023, New York appointed a 'rat czar' to address the issue, and a trash can pilot program in West Harlem resulted in a 60% drop in reported rat sightings. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is facing a budget deficit and hiring freeze, making it difficult to imagine finding funds for a rat czar, but Supervisor Danny Sauter has pledged to make cleaner streets a priority, promising to add 1,500 new trash cans citywide. Sauter has called for a hearing to better understand the city's decision-making process around trash can placement and how often they're emptied.

**Rat birth control and 'Rat Walks' among new initiatives to curb NYC’s rat population**
New York City is home to 3 million rats, making it the third rattiest city in the country. To combat this issue, the city has implemented various initiatives, including 'Rat Walks' and rat contraceptives. Director of Rodent Mitigation Kathleen Corradi, also known as the Rat Czar, is leading the effort to educate New Yorkers on rat behavior and encourage them to change their waste management habits. City Council Member Shaun Abreu has introduced Bill 736, which will implement rat contraceptives in areas where trash is containerized. Abreu believes that rat birth control can help curb rat populations, but only if trash is fully contained. The city has seen a 14% decrease in rat sightings in rat mitigation zones, and a 55% decrease in Harlem after implementing a residential pilot program to containerize trash. Rat contraceptives are expected to be rolled out on New York City streets by April 26, 2025, in partnership with the company WISDOM Good Works. PETA supports the initiative, citing the humane benefits of preventing rat poison and promoting prevention over extermination.

Rodents have apparently gnawed through the dense plastic of the Big Apple's 'rat-proof' new trash bins, but the city claims the containers are still effective in keeping pests away. The bins, dubbed the NYC Bin, were mandated for buildings with nine or fewer units starting in November. Despite the city's claims, experts say the bins are 'basically rendered useless' and that the city should not give them credit for the decrease in rat sightings in Williamsburg. The city's Deputy Commissioner of Public Affairs and Customer Experience, Joshua Goodman, said that rat sightings citywide fell 23% in December and are down another 25% so far this month. However, a representative from City Hall confirmed that they were investigating the gobbled trash bin in Williamsburg. Shannon Phipps, the founder of the Berry Street Alliance, said, 'It's confirming the concern that this is not going to prevent rats from being a problem.' Michael H. Parsons, a senior investigator for the Centre for Urban Ecological Solutions, said, 'Yes, this does look like rodent-gnawing,' and that the war against rats is not entirely over yet.
