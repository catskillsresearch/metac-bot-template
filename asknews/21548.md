**NATO Must Be Prepared for Battle with Russia 'Tonight' - German General**
German General Carsten Breuer, inspector of the German military, stated that NATO must be prepared for a battle with Russia 'already tonight'. In an interview with the BBC, Breuer said, 'According to analysts' estimates, a direct military conflict between NATO countries and Russia will occur in 2029. However, when asked if there are any guarantees that the conflict will not happen before 2029, Breuer replied, 'No, so we must be ready for it tonight.' Breuer also suggested that Russia may target the Suwalki Corridor, which borders Lithuania, Poland, and Belarus simultaneously.

**UK Shifts to 'War Readiness' Mode Amid Plans to Increase Military Spending**
The UK is shifting to a 'war readiness' mode as part of its new defense strategy, said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. 'We are moving to a state of war readiness, which will be the main goal of our armed forces. When directly threatened by states with advanced military capabilities, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready and show that we are prepared to maintain peace through force,' Sunak said during a press conference in Glasgow, dedicated to the new strategic defense review of the government. The UK government will publish a strategic defense review on Monday, amid plans to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. The document will include recommendations on defense policy. The previous review was published in 2021 and was revised after the start of the Ukrainian conflict. Recommendations will cover both external and internal security, the UK's policy on the Ukrainian conflict, military modernization, and nuclear doctrine. The new strategy will solidify Sunak's plan to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. The government will also aim to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP, but has not yet made specific promises. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously explained in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson that Moscow has no intention of attacking NATO countries, as it would make no sense. Putin noted that Western politicians regularly scare their citizens with a fictional Russian threat to distract from internal problems, but 'smart people understand that it's a fake.' Russia has been claiming an unprecedented level of NATO activity near its western borders in recent years. NATO has expanded its initiatives and calls it 'deterrence of Russian aggression.' Moscow has repeatedly expressed concern about the alliance's growing military presence in Europe. The Kremlin has stated that Russia poses no threat to anyone, but will not ignore actions that could be potentially hazardous to its interests.

**Germany's Top General Warns of Potential Russian Attack on NATO by 2029**
German Chief of Staff, General Carsten Breuer, believes that Russia may attack NATO within the next four years. He stated in an interview with the BBC, published on June 1, that NATO members must prepare for a possible Russian attack by 2029 or even earlier. According to Breuer, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never encountered in his 40-year career. He noted that Russia is rapidly increasing its military capabilities, producing around 1,500 main battle tanks per year and 4 million 152mm shells in 2024, not all of which were sent to Ukraine. Some of the military equipment is being stored in warehouses, awaiting a potential attack on the West. 'There is an intention and a buildup of reserves' for a possible future attack on Baltic states, he said. 'We must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it won't happen before 2029, I would say no, it's not. So we must be able to fight tonight,' Breuer said. He highlighted the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable areas. General Breuer asserts that NATO members must again increase their military forces. He added that it will take years for the European military-industrial base to ramp up to match the scale of Russia's military production.

**Russia May Attack NATO Countries in the Future, Warns German Defence Chief**
Germany's Chief of the Defence Staff, Eberhard von Brauchitsch, has warned that Russia may attack NATO countries in the future. According to Brauchitsch, Russia produces over 1,500 tanks per year, and some of these may be stored for future use. He also stated that Russia has manufactured 4 million 152mm artillery shells in 2024, not all of which are intended for use in the Ukraine conflict. Brauchitsch believes that NATO member states in the Baltic region, particularly Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, may be attacked by Russia as early as 2029. He also noted that NATO countries remain united in their support for Ukraine, despite Hungary and Slovakia's reluctance to provide military aid. Brauchitsch warned that if Russia were to attack NATO countries, it would trigger the collective defense mechanism, leading to an escalation of the conflict. He also highlighted the vulnerability of the region, citing recent incidents such as the cutting of Baltic Sea cables, cyber attacks on European transportation, and drone attacks on German power plants as potential indicators of Russia's testing of European defenses.

**Germany's General Staff Chief Warns of Potential Russian Attack in 2029**
German General Staff Chief, General Carsten Breuer, has stated that Russia is likely to attack in four years. According to him, Russia produces around 1,500 main battle tanks annually and significantly increases its military forces. 'Not all tanks are sent to war in Ukraine, but they also go to reserves and new military structures that are always directed against the West,' he said. Breuer also mentioned that in 2024, Russia produced 4 million 152mm artillery shells, not all of which are intended for the front in Ukraine. 'There is an intention and accumulation of reserves' for a possible future attack on Baltic states, he added. 'This is what analysts estimate - in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029? I would say no, it's not. Therefore, we must be ready for battle already today,' he emphasized. Breuer named the Suwałki Gap - a section on the border of Poland, Lithuania, Russia, and Belarus - as one of the most vulnerable zones in case of aggression. 'Baltic states are indeed vulnerable to the Russians, aren't they? And when you're there, you really feel it... during the negotiations we conduct there,' he said. According to him, Estonians compare their situation to feeling heat, seeing flames, and smelling smoke, while in Germany 'you probably see only a little smoke on the horizon.' The general also noted that Russia perceives the war in Ukraine as 'a continuation' of a broader conflict with NATO and 'tries to find ways to penetrate our defensive lines and test them.' As examples of such actions, he cited attacks on underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, cyberattacks on public transportation, and the appearance of drones over critical infrastructure in Germany. Breuer called on NATO allies to urgently increase their defense capabilities. 'What we need to do now is really take action and say to everyone: 'Hey, increase... invest more in this, because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves, and therefore, to increase the deterrent potential,' he said.

**Germany warns of Russian military build-up and risk of NATO clash as early as 2029 - Daily Star**
Germany's top military official, General Carsten Breuer, has warned NATO allies of a potential showdown with Russia in the 'next four years.' Breuer stated that Russia is producing hundreds of tanks annually, many of which could be deployed for an assault on NATO Baltic state members by 2029, or possibly even sooner. He emphasized that NATO stands united over the conflict in Ukraine, despite recent divergent views. Breuer expressed that Russia is amassing its forces to an 'enormous extent,' manufacturing roughly 1,500 main battle tanks each year. He warned that there's an intent and a build-up of stocks for a possible future attack on NATO's Baltic state members, and that NATO must be ready by 2029. 'This is what the analysts are assessing - in 2029. So we have to be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that's not earlier than 2029? I would say no, it's not. So we must be able to fight tonight,' Breuer said. The most susceptible spot is the so-called Suwalki Gap, nestled at the crossroads of Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus.

**NATO Warned of Possible Russian Attack Within 4 Years**
General Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the Inspector General of the German Armed Forces, has warned that NATO member states should prepare for a possible Russian attack, which could happen within the next 4 years. According to him, Russia is increasing its military forces in 'enormous scales', producing approximately 1,500 main battle tanks per year. Not all tanks are sent to the front for the war in Ukraine, but rather remain in storage and in new military structures, always focused on the West. 'This is an assessment of analysts - (the attack can happen in 2029 - 24 Channel) in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, whether this is a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029, I would say no, it is not. Therefore, we must be able to fight today,' he said. The Minister also mentioned the Suwałki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable points for an attack by an aggressor country. 'The Baltic countries are indeed very vulnerable to the Russians, aren't they? And as soon as you're there, you really feel it... in the negotiations we conduct there,' he said. General zu Guttenberg compared the possible war to being near a forest fire, where one 'feels the heat, sees the flames, and smells the smoke', while in Germany 'one probably only sees a bit of smoke on the horizon, and no more.' He emphasized that this demonstrates different views among European countries on the threat of a possible Russian attack. According to him, Russia's view of the war in Ukraine differs from that of the West, where Moscow sees the war as 'a continuum' in a larger conflict with NATO, and therefore 'tries to find ways to our defense lines and test them.' Therefore, zu Guttenberg believes that NATO members should again increase their military forces. Responding to a question about the unity of NATO, given the closer relations between Hungary and Slovakia with Moscow, the German general insisted that the Alliance is still united. 'I have never seen such unity as now among countries and military leaders. All of them understand the threat that is approaching NATO, all understand that we must develop in the direction of deterrence, in the direction of collective defense. This is clear to all. All see the urgency,' he said.

**Germany's Military Chief Warns of Potential Russian Attack on NATO**
The head of the German military, General Carsten Pröller, has warned that NATO may face a military attack from Russia within the next four years, urging increased defensive preparations before 2029 or even earlier. In an interview with the BBC, Pröller stated that Russia is currently producing around 1,500 main battle tanks annually, in addition to four million artillery shells of 152mm caliber in 2024, noting that part of these capabilities are not used in the Ukrainian war, but are stored to face a potential confrontation with NATO, especially in the Baltic region. Pröller described the Russian threat as 'unprecedented' during his four-decade military career, stating that Russia is building new military structures and strategic stockpiles aimed at the West. He said, 'We must be prepared to fight from tonight, because we cannot guarantee that the attack will occur in 2029 and not before.' Pröller highlighted the 'Suwalki Gap' - a narrow strip between Poland and Lithuania that separates the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad from Belarus - as a critical weak point on the eastern front of NATO. He added that the Baltic states feel a looming threat, explaining that 'the Estonians have compared the situation to standing near a forest fire, watching the flames and smelling the smoke, while in Germany we can hardly see any smoke on the horizon.' The general emphasized that Russia does not consider the war in Ukraine as an isolated conflict, but rather as part of a broader conflict with NATO, seeking to test the Western defense system through cyber attacks and infrastructure sabotage, such as Baltic Sea cables and unidentified drones over German energy facilities. Pröller stressed the need to rebuild European armies and increase their readiness, stating that 'we all need to engage... because we need it for a real deterrent and actual defense capability.' Despite recent political differences between Hungary and Slovakia regarding the war in Ukraine, Pröller emphasized that NATO's unity remains strong. He cited the accession of Finland and Sweden to the alliance after the war began, considering it a collective recognition 'of the need for collective deterrence and defense.'

**US Special Representative Says Putin is 'Right' About Proxy War Between Russia and NATO**
US Special Representative for Ukraine, Kurt Campbell, stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin is 'right' in saying that a 'proxy war' is being waged between Russia and NATO. Campbell made this statement during an interview with Fox News, where he discussed US-Russia negotiations on the Ukrainian conflict. Campbell also praised President Donald Trump's progress in resolving the conflict. Campbell said, 'Putin said, 'If you continue to supply them (Kyiv - ed.) with arms, we will continue to consider you aggressors'... And now he (Putin - ed.) considers it a proxy war with NATO. And honestly, in some sense, it is. Look at what the Europeans have done in terms of assistance. Putin sees this clearly,' - Campbell stated during the Fox News interview. When asked if the Ukrainian conflict will end in peace, Campbell replied positively, saying, 'Yes, I believe so... if anyone can make it happen, it's Trump,' - Campbell noted, emphasizing that 'everyone is working hard' to resolve the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously proposed direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions in Istanbul on May 15. The goal of the proposed talks is to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and protect Russian interests. However, the Russian delegation arrived in Istanbul on May 15, but no contact was made between the two sides. A meeting took place the next day and lasted almost two hours. Russian Presidential Assistant Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation, stated that Moscow and Kyiv agreed to present their vision of a possible future ceasefire. Medinsky also stated that Russia is willing to continue negotiations with Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated on Wednesday that the Russian delegation is ready to present a memorandum on the settlement to the Ukrainian side during the second round of talks in Istanbul on June 2. Russia believes that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder conflict resolution and directly involve NATO countries. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that any cargo containing arms for Ukraine would become a legitimate target for Russia. The Kremlin stated that pumping Ukraine with arms from the West does not contribute to negotiations and will have a negative effect.

**Could the Finland-Russia border be the next conflict zone after the Ukraine war?**
Recent satellite images show that Russia has reinforced its military presence along the border with Finland, which joined NATO in 2023. Over 130 military tents have been set up at Kamenka, 60 km from the border, capable of housing up to 2,000 soldiers. Three large warehouses have been built at Petrozavodsk, each storing 50-odd armoured vehicles. The Kremlin plans to establish a new army headquarters to oversee tens of thousands of troops. Finnish military historian Emil Kastehelmi said, 'We are seeing military activity, and we are seeing the Russians developing their military infrastructure and most likely training new soldiers.' Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, added, 'The long term is just that Russia needs to take defence on the border with Finland more seriously now that Finland is a NATO member.' The Finnish border brings Russia into direct contact with a NATO member across over 1,000 km, making it crucial for the defence of St Petersburg and the surrounding region. Finland could play a key role in any future conflict between Russia and NATO.

**Russia 'could attack a NATO state by 2027 if a ceasefire is agreed in Ukraine this year' as experts warn Europe 'cannot assume that they have years to prepare' for another war | Daily Mail Online**
A security think tank has warned that Russia could be ready to launch fresh attacks on NATO's eastern flank as early as 2027 if a ceasefire in Ukraine is agreed this year. The RAND report found that Russia 'could be in a position to pose a significant military challenge to NATO allies, particularly the Baltic states, as early as 2027'. Ed Arnold, a Senior Research Fellow for European Security at the Royal United Services Institute, said that policymakers in the West cannot afford to assume that they have years to prepare for a conflict with Russia. He warned that Russia's economy is on a war footing and will be able to effect a speedy military reconstitution after a ceasefire in Ukraine is agreed. The report also highlighted that Russia's military mobilisation is not affected by elections or public dissent, and that the war in Ukraine has become a central theme in Russian society, economy and politics. The authors of the RAND paper concluded that Russia's economy and industrial base has pivoted to ensure its armed forces can sustain a large conflict indefinitely. Even after the Ukraine war is halted, Moscow's efforts to reconstitute and reinforce its military will likely continue apace. 'The need to scale up defence production as a result of the war in Ukraine may actually lead to a more productive and more skilled defence industrial base,' the report stated. 'Russia's reconstitution process should not be viewed as having a well-defined starting point and distinct end date. 'In all likelihood, Russia's reconstitution efforts will be a continuous process over the next decade, perhaps longer… Even if Russia falls short of its stated reconstitution objectives in the post–Ukraine war period, it may still decide to initiate another conflict. 'This means that the United States and NATO should anticipate the necessity of planning to counter a partially reconstituted Russian military.'

**Russia 'could attack a NATO state by 2027'**
A security think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), has warned that Russia could be ready to launch fresh attacks on NATO's eastern flank as early as 2027 if a ceasefire in Ukraine is agreed this year. The report assumes that a ceasefire would be agreed in Ukraine later this year and that the US under Donald Trump could withdraw from NATO, or reduce American military presence on the continent to refocus on the perceived threat from China. The IISS report echoed concerns raised in a recent paper by the RAND think tank, which pointed out that the Kremlin is likely to maintain a wartime economy and ability to ramp up military reconstitution efforts even after a ceasefire in Ukraine is agreed. Ed Arnold, a Senior Research Fellow for European Security at the Royal United Services Institute, said that policymakers in the West cannot afford to assume that they have years to prepare for a conflict with Russia. 'NATO's a defensive alliance and it isn't going to mount any offensives in Russia, so any conflict would take place based on Russian terms,' Arnold said. 'What Moscow would try to do is launch a small-scale operation to take a part of a NATO territory and hold it. That would put NATO in a difficult position as to how to respond, whether this would meet the conditions for Article 5.' Ian Bond, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform, told the BBC that even if a full ceasefire is agreed in Ukraine, it is unlikely Putin's aggression would be abated. 'Nobody in their right mind wants to think that a European war is around the corner again. But the reality is an increasing number of European intelligence officials have been telling us that,' he said. 'Whether this is coming in three years or five years or ten years, what they are saying is the idea that peace in Europe is going to last forever is now a thing of the past.'

**NATO Countries Could Be Involved in Military Conflict with Russia as Early as 2027, Warns British Expert**
According to Ed Arnold, a British military expert from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), NATO countries could be involved in a military conflict with Russia as early as 2027. Arnold warns that Germany should not spread its planned massive investments in the defense sector over a period of ten years, but rather focus on rapidly increasing the stockpiles of proven weapon systems and ammunition, particularly artillery ammunition. The Bundeswehr should be equipped with heavy equipment, such as the Taurus missile, the Leopard 2 A8 tank, and the Boxer armored transport vehicle, which are also used by other European nations. These systems should be produced 'on a massive scale' and used to equip German units and supply allies, Arnold recommends. German air defense systems like IRIS-T and the retired Flakpanzer Gepard have proven to be 'remarkably effective' in the war in Ukraine, according to the expert, and should be produced in large quantities and exported to allies. Arnold also advises that Europe should abandon the idea of always seeking the most technologically advanced weapons, saying 'what the Ukraine shows is that you don't always need the best. You just need to be a little better than the enemy.' Additionally, it would be unwise to spend too much money on equipment that might be lost in large numbers in a real emergency. When it comes to drones, it's not just about acquiring your own stockpiles, but also about building production capacity to keep up with the rapid development cycles. 'The change in warfare means that drones are used at the lowest level,' Arnold said. 'They are omnipresent on the battlefield.' The expert also warns that Germany should consider whether it should continue to invest in US systems, such as the F-35 stealth fighter and the Patriot air defense system, given the changing political alignment of Washington. If Russia were to intentionally seek conflict, it would most likely start in the Baltic region, possibly at the Suwalki Gap, the only land bridge between NATO countries in Central Europe and the Baltic allies. Arnold also warns that NATO countries and Russia could unintentionally slide into a conflict at another location due to the many military activities in Europe.

**Russian Analyst Predicts NATO Attack Before 2027**
Russian analyst Anatoly Nesmiyan (also known as El Muryd) believes that Russia will attempt to start a war against NATO sooner than 2027. According to Nesmiyan, 'The Kremlin cannot afford to wait so long, especially in a situation where its opponent is intensively preparing for a conflict. In such a situation, one's own preparedness plays a smaller role than the opponent's preparedness.' He thinks that the goal of the war will be a country in the Baltic region, and that Russia will try to break through to its Kaliningrad exclave through the Suwalki Corridor. Nesmiyan also believes that US President Donald Trump will benefit from a Russian attack on NATO, as it will allow him to claim rights to Greenland. 'Therefore, the timelines are shifting. Not only the Kremlin, but also Trump cannot wait so long. Even 2027 is too long, it's unacceptable,' Nesmiyan said.

**NATO-Russia Conflict in 2027? Expert Warns**
A British military expert, Ed Arnold from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), warns that NATO countries could be involved in a military conflict with Russia as early as 2027. Arnold emphasizes that the German government should prioritize increasing the stockpiles of proven weapon systems and ammunition, particularly artillery ammunition, rather than spreading investments over a period of ten years. He recommends mass-producing air defense systems such as the Taurus missile, Leopard 2 A8 tank, and Boxer armored transport vehicle, which are also used by other European nations. German air defense systems like IRIS-T and the retired Flakpanzer Gepard have proven to be 'remarkably effective' in the war in Ukraine, according to Arnold, and should be mass-produced and exported to allies. Arnold also warns that Europe should abandon the idea of always seeking the most technologically advanced weapons, saying 'you don't always need the best, you just need to be a little better than the enemy.' He also emphasizes the importance of adapting to the rapid development of drone technology, saying 'drones are omnipresent on the battlefield.' Additionally, Arnold suggests that Germany should consider whether it should continue investing in US-made systems like the F-35 and Patriot, and whether these could be replaced by European alternatives in the medium term. He also warns that a conflict with Russia could start in the Baltic region, particularly at the Suwalki Gap, and that NATO countries and Russia could unintentionally slide into a conflict elsewhere in Europe due to the high level of military activity.

**Russia Threatens Poland and Baltic States in Event of War with NATO**
Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR, has threatened Poland and the Baltic states in the event of a war between Russia and NATO. He stated that Poland and the Baltic states are 'especially aggressive, especially in their words, and they brandish their weapons.' Naryshkin added that Poland plans to deploy around 2 million anti-tank mines along its borders with Belarus and the Kaliningrad region. He warned that in the event of aggression from NATO against the Union State, the damage would be inflicted on the entire NATO bloc, but the first to suffer would be the carriers of such ideas, particularly in the political circles of Poland and the Baltic states. Naryshkin's comments come as Western media have reported on the possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2025, with Germany warning of a possible attack in 2026 or later. The US intelligence community has stated that Russia does not want a direct military conflict with the US and NATO, but will continue to engage in asymmetric activities that do not cross the threshold of a global military conflict.

**Ulyanov: Direct Conflict Between NATO and Russia Unlikely**
Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, believes that a direct conflict between NATO countries and Russia is unlikely. 'It's not in the EU's interest to engage in a conflict with us, they don't have the necessary capabilities, and most importantly, they lack the political will,' Ulyanov told Russia-24. He also stated that he considers it low probability for European countries to transition to 'tactical actions'. This comes after French newspaper Le Figaro reported that France has been mapping the territory bordering Ukraine, Romania, and Moldova in preparation for a potential conflict between NATO and Russia. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also reiterated that EU countries are trying to prolong the Ukrainian conflict, causing economic damage to European countries.

Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, stated in an interview with Russia-24 that a direct military conflict between Russia and the EU and NATO is unlikely. According to Ulyanov, 'it's clearly not in the West's interests' to engage in a direct confrontation with Russia, given its current capabilities. He emphasized that it's still just speculation, and that it's not worth discussing a potential conflict with the EU, especially considering that the US is not planning to engage in a military confrontation. Ulyanov also noted that the EU does not have the necessary capabilities or political will to engage in a conflict with Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry previously stated that NATO continues to push for the militarization of the EU, and that the alliance is developing a confrontational plan against Russia.

**Russia Predicts 15 Possible Military Conflict Scenarios by 2045, Direct Threat to Poland**
Russia has predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045, with six of them affecting Northern Europe. According to General-Major Vadim Skibitsky, deputy head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, countries in Northern Europe, particularly the Baltic states and Poland, are aware of the potential threat. Skibitsky stated that Poland is directly threatened by four possible military conflict scenarios. 'For Poland, there are only four scenarios of a possible military conflict. Poland now understands that this is a direct threat,' he said. Russia has previously prepared a forecast of events from 2026 to 2035 with a perspective to 2045, identifying four possible scenarios of the world order. The first scenario involves the absolute dominance of the US, the second the strengthening of China's role, the third a multipolar world where Russia aims to become one of the key players, and the fourth regionalization, or the division of influence into separate regions. Skibitsky noted that Russia's strategic documents clearly state the intention to complete the 'Ukrainian question' by 2026. He believes this is because a prolonged war for 5-10 years would prevent Russia from reaching the level of the US and China, leaving it a regional player in Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius previously stated that, considering the growth of the Russian army, there is a possibility of Russia attempting to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. In response, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the Alliance's defense capabilities before then.
