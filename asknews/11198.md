**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**AI Drives Demand for Computing Power: McKinsey Estimates 6.7 Trillion Dollars by 2030**
According to McKinsey, the global demand for data center capacity is expected to almost triple by 2030, reaching 6.7 trillion dollars. 70% of this demand will be attributed to AI, while the remaining 30% will be for traditional IT applications. McKinsey presents three scenarios for the evolution of computing power demand by 2030: Scenario accelerated: 205 GW of additional AI capacity between 2025 and 2030, with a total of 7.9 trillion dollars in capital investments. Scenario intermediate (based on the report): 125 GW additional in the same period, for 5.2 trillion dollars. Scenario contained: 78 GW additional by 2030, with a total demand of 3.7 trillion dollars. The predictions take into account two main uncertainties: AI use cases. The value of AI lies in its application level—i.e., the ability of companies to transform it into concrete impacts on business. If companies fail to generate real value, the demand for computing power may be lower than expected. On the other hand, transformative applications could fuel a higher demand than current predictions, with a reduction in training costs of around 18 times and inference costs of around 36 times compared to GPT-4. 15% of investments (800 billion) will be allocated to builders, for land, materials, and site development. An additional 25% (1.3 trillion) will be allocated to operators. Despite the expected demands, the analysis highlights that current investment levels remain below demand. In dozens of interviews with CEOs, it emerged that many leaders hesitate to invest maximally in computing capacity due to limited visibility on demand evolution, uncertainty on AI adoption rate, and long project implementation times. To guide strategic decisions and investments, companies can be classified into five main archetypes, each with a specific role in the AI infrastructure ecosystem: Builder: real estate developers, design firms, and construction companies involved in expanding data center capacity. Energizer: utilities, energy providers, cooling system and electrical equipment manufacturers, and telecommunications operators. Technology Developers and Designers: semiconductor companies and IT suppliers that produce chips and computational hardware. Operators: hyperscalers, colocation providers, GPU-as-a-service platforms, and companies that optimize their computational resources. AI Architect: AI model developers, foundation model providers, and companies that build proprietary AI capabilities.

**When Machines Prove Theorems: How AI is Revolutionizing Mathematics**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing mathematics by automating the proof process, forcing mathematicians to rethink their approach. Historically, proof has been the heart of mathematics, a strict, logical argument for whether a statement is true or false. Mathematicians spend most of their time gaining new insights to make a proof work and then translating these intuitions into step-by-step conclusions. The best proofs are like art, precise, elegant, creative, and beautiful. They embody a human action - giving the world meaning, sharpening the mind, and exploring and expanding the limits of thought. However, proofs are inherently rational. In the 1950s, researchers developed the first AI programs, hoping to automate theorem proving. They achieved some success, with one program proving dozens of logical statements. Since then, other computer programs have proven statements in geometry, analysis, and other areas. However, these capabilities were limited, and the theorems that experts really cared about overpowered them. The mathematical research continued as it had for centuries or millennia: individual people thought through a problem from start to finish. This is changing now. In recent years, researchers have used AI models to discover new mathematical patterns, make hypotheses, and find counterexamples to old hypotheses. They have also developed computer-assisted proof assistants that check whether a proof is correct. While these systems can't yet prove a theorem from start to finish, this could change soon. In 2024, Google DeepMind presented a KI system that won a silver medal at the International Mathematics Olympiad. The large language model ChatGPT from OpenAI has made significant progress in reproducing proofs and solving challenging problems, and other tailored KI systems are being applied to mathematical challenges. 'It's breathtaking how quickly they're getting better,' says mathematician Andrew Granville from the University of Montreal, who previously doubted that this technology would soon affect mathematical work. Many researchers now believe that they can outsource tedious parts of the proof process to AI in the coming years. However, they are divided on whether the new technology will ever independently solve the most important mathematical problems. 'You only gain understanding by getting your hands dirty' - Andrew Granville, mathematician. Granville fears that outsourcing certain tasks to AI could impair the researchers' reasoning ability: 'You only gain understanding by getting your hands dirty.' Nevertheless, he criticizes most of his colleagues for ignoring the latest technological developments. Continuing in this way, some experts warn, would be a mistake. 'The possibility of outsourcing tedious or laborious parts of a proof to AI will drastically change the way we think about mathematics over time,' says renowned mathematician Akshay Venkatesh, who was awarded the Fields Medal in 2018 and researches at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Together with other colleagues, he is investigating how a KI-supported mathematical future could look and how it will change science. In such a future, mathematicians will no longer spend most of their time proving theorems but will instead take on the role of critic, translator, conductor, and experimenter. Mathematics could thus approach the natural sciences or even the humanities. 'It's not just a nice thought experiment,' says Venkatesh. 'It forces experts to think about what mathematics is at its core - and what it's good for.'

**AI Models Fail to Provide Reliable Mathematical Proofs, Study Finds**
Researchers from ETH Zurich and INSAIT have found that modern AI models, which can confidently solve standard mathematical problems, are unable to formulate complete proofs at the level of the 2025 USAMO (USA Mathematical Olympiad). The study, titled 'Proof or Bluff? Evaluating LLMs on 2025 USA Math Olympiad', highlights the fundamental difference between solving problems and building mathematical proofs. The authors of the study found that the AI models were unable to maintain correct logical connections throughout the chain of reasoning, and even when they made serious logical errors, they presented their solutions in an affirmative form without any indication of doubt or potential contradictions. The study also found that the AI models were prone to artifacts of optimization strategies used in training, such as forced formatting of answers, which led to errors in the context of problems that required detailed proofs rather than just numerical answers. The study concludes that modern large language models (LLMs) continue to work as pattern recognition systems, rather than as independent systems of conceptual reasoning, and that significant progress requires training AI models to learn deeper multi-dimensional connections in the latent space and to master the principles of building new logical structures, rather than just copying existing patterns from training datasets. The study suggests that the results of the study are a wake-up call for the AI research community to re-examine the current approaches to building AI systems that can reason and prove mathematical theorems. 'Proof or Bluff? Evaluating LLMs on 2025 USA Math Olympiad' study authors, Ivo Petrov and Martin Vechev, said, 'Our results show that current LLMs are not yet capable of providing reliable mathematical proofs, and that significant progress is needed to bridge the gap between simulated and real reasoning.'

**The AI arms race will be won on mathematical proof**
The US military's reliance on AI-powered systems poses a significant vulnerability due to the 'software understanding gap,' where users lack a deep understanding of the digital building blocks of their systems. This gap makes it difficult to predict, verify, and secure the systems' actions. To address this issue, Anjana Rajan, former Assistant National Cyber Director, argues that mathematical proof is essential for ensuring the reliability of AI-driven military systems. Unlike testing, which can only cover a limited number of scenarios, mathematical proof guarantees that a system will behave as intended, even in unforeseen conditions. The private sector, such as Amazon Web Services, has already adopted this approach to build more secure and reliable systems. The US must follow suit to ensure its national defense is not compromised by unpredictable AI failures. China is already setting the pace in autonomous warfare, and the US must prioritize mathematical rigor to stay ahead.

**AI to Replace Most Programmers by 2026, Predicts Eric Schmidt**
Eric Schmidt, former Google executive, believes that most programmers will be replaced by AI by 2026. He stated, 'We think as an industry that in the next year, a significant majority of programmers will be replaced by AI.' Schmidt expects AI models to continue improving and take on more specialized tasks that currently require human intelligence. He also predicts that AI programs will be able to solve mathematical problems that even the best math graduates struggle with. In 2027, Schmidt expects AI systems to begin self-improving and modifying their own code. By 2028-2030, AI models will be able to compete with the world's top mathematicians, physicists, writers, and artists. Finally, by 2031, AI will reach the stage of 'artificial superintelligence', surpassing human capabilities and functioning independently without human involvement, according to Schmidt.

**Strange Times Ahead: What I'll Teach My Kids in an AI World**
As the AI revolution advances, futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) by 2029 and the singularity by 2045. A father of two homeschooled kids wonders what skills will be relevant in the future and how to prepare them for a world where AGI surpasses human intelligence. He argues that while soft skills like creativity and critical thinking are useful today, they may not be enough in a world where AI is embedded everywhere. Instead, he suggests focusing on teaching morality, values, virtues, and logic, as well as the classics, communication, and mathematics. The goal is not to future-proof their education, but to raise good people. 'In the end, I'm not just trying to future-proof their education. I'm trying to raise good people. And maybe that's the only thing that's future-proof,' he says.

**Artificial Intelligence in 2025: A Partnership Between Humans and Machines**
Artificial intelligence has undergone a revolutionary transformation in recent years, impacting various fields such as healthcare, physics, and chemistry. In 2024, AI technologies experienced an exceptional surge, with applications contributing to global awards like the 'Nobel' prize in physics and chemistry. As AI technologies continue to evolve, humans are optimistic about their potential, raising questions about what AI can achieve in 2025. AI-powered patient support will enable AI to analyze vast amounts of medical data, including genomic information and lifestyle patterns, to provide accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. Wearable devices and implantable chips will also allow for real-time monitoring of patients' vital signs, enabling better management of chronic diseases. Chatbots and virtual assistants will become reliable sources for answering health-related questions and managing chronic conditions. Perplexity Companies will also benefit from AI to discover new medicines and identify treatments at an unprecedented speed. This not only saves lives but also makes expensive treatments more accessible by reducing costs. Advanced AI systems have revolutionized cybersecurity, enabling more efficient and independent systems to prevent data and asset loss. By prioritizing transparency and accountability, AI-powered cybersecurity applications help companies protect their digital ecosystems more effectively. AI models are also accelerating the discovery of new materials, which has vast potential for industries like energy. This could lead to significant progress in various fields, potentially changing our approach to energy production and medical treatments. Advanced AI models like OpenAI's o1 have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in complex thinking, mathematics, and scientific problem-solving. These models will help companies write advanced algorithms, diagnose operational flaws, and design innovative solutions across various industries. In a groundbreaking development, AI has been successfully integrated with human biology, with ChatGPT being implanted in individuals with paralysis, enabling them to communicate more naturally in real-time. This innovation showcases how AI can significantly improve the quality of life for people with severe disabilities. The integration of human experience and AI capabilities has become a key factor in maintaining competitiveness across various sectors. Economically, McKinsey estimates that AI will contribute a staggering $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, leading to a 1.2% annual increase in GDP. This prediction is driven by AI's ability to improve operations, reduce costs, and create new opportunities across industries. However, as AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, new ethical questions arise. Privacy concerns, the boundaries between personal and work-related information, and the need for human oversight in critical operations are among the topics being discussed.

**Full list of AI-proof jobs that robots are less likely to take from humans**
According to research from Goldman Sachs, up to 300 million full-time equivalent jobs could be replaced by AI by 2030. However, not all jobs are at risk. Experts at Adzuna analyzed data and research from the OECD and Goldman Sachs to identify jobs that are less likely to be replaced by AI. These include specialist medical roles such as surgeons (£80,000/year), physicists, dentists, psychologists, and dermatologists. Manual labour roles like plumbers, floor layers, and roofers are also considered safe. Additionally, bespoke roles such as pest controllers, crane drivers, museum curators, dentists, carpenters, and marriage counsellors are less likely to be replaced by AI. As Janine Chamberlin, LinkedIn's UK manager, said, 'The next phase is underway - jobs shaped by AI. It won't be long before the landscape will shift again from AI to another emerging area, the world of work will change, and new jobs will be created.'

**Will AI Reach Singularity? Analysis of 8600 Predictions**
A new analysis of 8590 predictions from scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts has systematized existing predictions about the future of AI and tracked their changes over time. The study, conducted by the research group AIMultiple, covers key stages of AI development, including general artificial intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence. While industry leaders are generally optimistic, most respondents believe that AGI is likely to appear within the next 50 years. The progress in large language models has reduced the predicted timeline for achieving AGI and singularity. According to the report, researchers now predict AGI by 2040, whereas before the breakthrough in BLM, they expected it by 2060. Entrepreneurs are even more optimistic, predicting AGI by 2030. The analysis explains why many experts consider AGI inevitable. Unlike human intelligence, machine intelligence appears to have no limits. According to Moore's Law, computational power doubles every 18 months. Therefore, large language models will eventually match human cognitive power. If the limits of computation are reached, quantum technologies will be the solution. 'Most experts believe that Moore's Law will be exhausted in the current decade. Unique opportunities of quantum computing may accelerate the training of neural networks, which dominate commercial AI applications today. AI algorithms working on stable quantum computers can become the key to achieving singularity,' the report says. However, not all agree with the inevitability of AGI. Some experts consider human intelligence much more complex than what is defined by AGI. For example, some AI specialists distinguish eight types of intelligence, where 'logical-mathematical' is just one of them (along with interpersonal, intrapersonal, and existential). Jan LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests renaming AGI to 'advanced machine intelligence,' highlighting that human mind is too unique to be replicated. The report also notes that, although AI can be a useful tool for discoveries, it is not capable of making them independently. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not find a cancer cure. It will have to conduct experiments and analyze results to gain new knowledge in most areas,' the authors write.

**Google’s AI Can Beat the Smartest High Schoolers in Math**
Google's AI system, AlphaGeometry2, has surpassed the level of the average gold medallist in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a prestigious competition for gifted high-school students. The system, developed by Google DeepMind, can solve 84% of all geometry problems given in IMOs in the past 25 years. Kevin Buzzard, a mathematician at Imperial College London, says, 'I imagine it won't be long before computers are getting full marks on the IMO.' The system uses a combination of a specialized language model and a 'neuro-symbolic' system to provide rigorous proofs for geometric objects on the plane. Future improvements will include dealing with maths problems that involve inequalities and non-linear equations. Buzzard notes that while the problems are hard, the subject is still conceptually simple, and there are many more challenges to overcome before AI is able to solve problems at the level of research mathematics.

**Can AI Save Democracy? Linda Zervakis Explores the Future of Politics**
Linda Zervakis explores the question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) will shape our democracy in the future. In her new reportage, she asks 'Can AI save democracy?' and conducts an experiment with AI, wondering if a computer can make future political decisions. Politicians are considering the possibility of AI replacing them, and a survey found that 51% of Europeans would prefer their representatives to be replaced by an AI algorithm. This is because AI, with access to personal data, could potentially better represent citizens' interests than current politicians. Zervakis' AI duplicate, 'KI-Linda,' is a central part of her investigation, which also includes interviews with politicians such as Jens Spahn, Katrin Göring-Eckardt, and Lars Klingbeil. The reportage raises questions about the future of work, with 60% of professions expected to be replaced by AI by 2030, and the potential for AI to take over leadership in politics.
