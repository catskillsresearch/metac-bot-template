**EU Passes Resolution to Limit Chinese Companies' Entry into Medical Device Procurement Market**
The European Union (EU) has passed a resolution to limit the entry of Chinese companies into the EU's medical device procurement market in response to Beijing's discriminatory behavior against foreign manufacturers in public procurement. According to the Financial Times, the resolution, which was passed by EU member states, requires EU public institutions to exclude Chinese companies from participating in procurement tenders worth over €5 million within the EU for the next five years. This is the EU's first action under the International Procurement Instrument (IPI) to address Beijing's market discrimination in this field. The EU has pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party's policies force domestic hospitals to choose local suppliers. An investigation found that 87% of procurement cases involved 'direct or indirect discrimination', including banning imported medical devices from participating in tenders. The IPI was established in 2022 to promote a procurement environment consistent with the EU's market access principle, ensuring that foreign companies enjoy fair treatment in the EU public market. The EU launched an investigation into China's medical device procurement market in April last year and reported in January that Beijing's restrictions on European companies bidding for Chinese public procurement projects had increased in recent years. Despite multiple rounds of talks between the EU and Beijing, no solution was reached. According to Bloomberg, data shows that China's trade surplus in medical equipment has turned into a deficit in just one year. In 2019, China had a €1.3 billion deficit in this category, while in 2020, it turned into a €520 million surplus. The EU believes that this is not a natural competitive result, but rather a result of the Chinese Communist Party's 'Made in China 2025' policy, which requires Chinese companies to achieve a local market share of 85% in 'core medical device components' by 2025, 70% in high-end equipment by 2025, and 95% in high-end equipment by 2030. The EU criticizes this practice as causing market distortion and harming European companies. The Chinese Communist Party acknowledges its policy bias towards domestic products, but claims it has not made any international commitments on public procurement. According to the IPI, the EU's executive committee can take measures against foreign companies, including reducing scores or banning them from participating in tenders. The EU has taken various legal tools in recent years to address unfair trade practices, such as the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, which restricts companies receiving foreign government subsidies from participating in EU public contracts or mergers and acquisitions. Although these measures do not specifically target Beijing, they are mainly used to address issues related to Chinese companies.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**EU set to curb China's access to medical device market as trade tensions simmer**
The European Union is set to limit China's access to the EU medical device market due to trade tensions. According to a European Commission investigation, China has been unfairly restricting EU medical device producers from accessing government contracts. In contrast, Chinese medical device manufacturers have largely free access to public procurement tenders in the EU market. The EU probe highlighted Beijing's 'Buy China' policies, which favour domestic medical devices over imported ones, particularly in the high-end segment of the medical device sector. These policies are part of the Made in China 2025 programme, which aims to have domestically produced products account for 90% of all devices used in county hospitals by 2030, as stated by the programme's targets. 'Influential' trade ministers are expected to attend a dinner gathering organised by World Trade Organization director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, but it is unclear if they will discuss this issue.

**US Ban on Engine Technology Exports to China's C919: A Long-Term Strategy or a Short-Term Move?**
The US has reportedly banned American companies from exporting engine technology to China's C919 commercial airliner. However, Hong Kong military analysts, Liang Guoliang and Song Zhongping, believe that China has already developed its own alternative engine, the CJ1000, which can be used for the C919 or future aircraft models. Liang Guoliang stated, 'China has been researching the CJ1000 for about 20 years, and has already developed an improved version, the CJ1000A. It is likely that they also have a more advanced version, the CJ1000B.' Song Zhongping also pointed out that the CJ1000 has been used in China's domestically developed Y-20 transport aircraft. He believes that the US ban on engine technology exports will not be able to 'strangle' China's commercial aircraft industry in the long run. However, in the short term, the ban will have an impact on China's ability to meet market demand, as the CJ1000 is still in production and cannot meet the current demand. He also noted that China will continue to import foreign products, even with its own alternative engine, as it is a matter of trust and convenience. Song Zhongping stated, 'The US ban is actually a trade war, a bargaining chip between the two countries.'

**China-US Chamber of Commerce Denies White House Claims, Says China Has Not Banned Rare Earth Exports**
Michael Hart, the chairman of the China-US Chamber of Commerce, stated that China has begun to relax its control on the export of rare earths over the past week, with some approvals already being processed, although the speed is slower than the industry had hoped. Hart attributed the delay to China's new export system, rather than a ban on exports. This contradicts the claims made by the White House, which accused China of violating the preliminary trade agreement between the two countries. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai also stated that China has failed to comply with certain provisions of the trade agreement reached in Geneva last month, and has continued to slow down and suppress the production of key minerals and rare earth magnets. However, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Commerce stated that China has cancelled or suspended relevant tariffs and non-tariff measures against the US in accordance with the joint statement issued by the two countries after the Geneva trade talks.

**Adriana Smith's Case Sparks Debate on Anti-Abortion Policies and Maternal Health in the US**
Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old pregnant woman, was declared brain dead after suffering a stroke, but her body was kept on life support to allow the fetus to develop. The case has sparked a debate about the ethics and legality of anti-abortion policies in the US, particularly in states with Republican governors. Smith's family, including her 5-year-old son, continues to visit her in the hospital, but they are not allowed to disconnect her life support machines because of a state law that prohibits abortion after the detection of fetal activity. The law was passed in 2019, but only took effect in 2022 after the Roe v. Wade case was overturned. Experts, including Kimberly Mutcherson, a reproductive rights specialist, have expressed concerns about the impact of such policies on women's health and the potential harm to the fetus. 'It's a kind of experiment: allowing a fetus to develop in a woman's body with brain death. Knowing the enormous effort a pregnant woman's body needs to sustain and nourish a pregnancy, it's impossible to know for sure the damage a fetus may suffer while remaining attached to a body without a functioning brain,' Mutcherson said. The case highlights the need for better healthcare and reproductive rights in the US, particularly for women from low-income backgrounds. According to the CDC, 80% of maternal deaths in the US are preventable. The country has one of the highest maternal mortality rates among developed countries, with 18.6 deaths per 100,000 births in 2023. The rate has decreased from 22.3 deaths per 100,000 births in 2022, but the number of deaths among black women has increased, reaching 50.3 per 100,000 births in 2023. 'In Tennessee, for example, we have one of the strictest abortion bans, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or young girls. It's also one of the states with the highest infant mortality rate (6.6 per 100,000) and maternal mortality rate (41.1, the highest in the country). At the same time, Republicans have complete control,' said Senator London Lamar. 'So, instead of fighting a lost battle, I changed my strategy to raise the banner of maternal health.'

**Chinese Tech Companies Find Ways to Overcome US Chip Export Ban**
Chinese technology companies are finding ways to overcome the US chip export ban, which has hindered their access to advanced chips. According to reports, Tencent, Baidu, and other tech companies have developed various solutions, including stockpiling large quantities of US-made chips before the ban, developing more efficient AI models, and using locally produced chips from domestic semiconductor companies. Tencent, the company behind WeChat, stated that they had a 'very strong chip stockpile' from previous purchases before the sanctions were imposed. China is also making significant strides in developing its own chip production, with Huawei leading the way in developing local AI chips. This could be a positive development for the world, as it may lead to Chinese GPUs that can compete with Nvidia and AMD in the future, freeing computer users and gamers from the tyranny of having to spend thousands of dollars on a single graphics card. However, there are also concerns that some Chinese companies may be purchasing used or refurbished Nvidia chips from third-party sellers, although this has not been proven. The US chip export ban to China began during the Trump administration (2016-2020), when Huawei was placed under sanctions due to its suspected ties with the Chinese government. Huawei executives were even arrested in Canada during a meeting and spent years in detention. The ban has continued under the Biden administration and has been tightened since Trump's return to the White House, with even lower-performance chips like Nvidia's H20 being banned for sale to Chinese customers.

**Scandal in China Raises Questions About Education and Healthcare Systems**
A scandal in China has raised questions about the country's education and healthcare systems. The case involves a doctor, Xiao Fei, who was accused of having an affair with a colleague, Dong Xiying, and leaving a patient unattended for 40 minutes. An investigation found that Xiao had indeed left the patient, and he was subsequently fired and expelled from the Communist Party. However, the focus of the scandal shifted to Dong Xiying, who was accused of using a special program to become a doctor in just four years, rather than the usual eight. The program, known as '4+4', is meant to produce 'interdisciplinary professionals', but in reality, it is often used by those with connections to get ahead. The Chinese government has since announced that Xiao and Dong will no longer be able to practice medicine. In the United States, a woman named Adriana Smith is being kept on life support against her family's wishes, as she is pregnant and the state of Georgia has laws that require women to carry their pregnancies to term. Smith's family wants to turn off the life support, but the state is preventing them from doing so. This is a result of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which has led to a wave of anti-abortion laws across the country. In Tanzania, the leader of the opposition, Tundu Lissu, is on trial for treason after calling for people to rebel and boycott the upcoming elections. The government has responded to international criticism by blocking social media and arresting human rights activists who tried to attend the trial.

**China's Rapid Technological Advancements: A Threat to US Supremacy**
The US is struggling to keep up with China's rapid technological advancements, particularly in AI, which may be the next area to be surpassed. This has sparked intense debate between the government and industry. The White House has largely supported banning the export of high-tech chips and components to prevent China's progress, but Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and others argue that such policies will only accelerate China's development of its own tech ecosystem. China's electric cars are priced lower and outperform many American-made models, with self-driving cars already appearing on the streets of Wuhan and Beijing. China dominates the global market in consumer drones, solar panels, and batteries. The US currently maintains a narrow lead in advanced chips and AI, but the gap is rapidly closing. China is shifting towards developing and manufacturing its own chips, including those from Huawei, Hwawei, Longxin Storage, and SMIC. Since the US banned ZTE and Huawei in 2018, China's tech companies and government have invested heavily, and the US has tried to slow China's progress by banning the export of chip-making equipment and materials. Patrick Moorhead, a semiconductor industry analyst who spent 11 years as a high-ranking executive at AMD, believes that China's lagging behind or being forever behind is a misconception. He says, 'I've been in the tech industry for 30 years, and I've heard people say China can't do this. Now I think the only question is how fast they can do it.' Experts point out that China's unique advantages, such as its well-trained workforce and massive domestic market, are unprecedented in US trade history. Huang has repeatedly stated that 'half of the world's AI engineers are in China.' China's domestic market allows companies to test and refine their products before going global. Huang has recently strongly criticized the US's current export control ban, saying that it will only strengthen China's competitiveness and weaken the US's position. He predicts that by 2026, China's spending on AI chips and servers will reach $50 billion, and the new AI chip export ban will cost Nvidia a significant market share.

**Connect to the Capitol: Abortion in SC, possible probe into firing squad execution**
The South Carolina Supreme Court has ruled that the state's abortion ban at six weeks of pregnancy can stand, despite Planned Parenthood's challenge. The court's decision was met with criticism from Planned Parenthood, which stated that 'justice did not prevail today, and the people of South Carolina are paying the price.' Governor Henry McMaster praised the decision, saying it was a 'clear and decisive victory' for the right to life. Meanwhile, a pair of state lawmakers have requested an independent investigation into the firing squad execution of convicted cop killer Mikal Mahdi, citing concerns about the 'integrity of South Carolina's justice system and public confidence in our state's administration of executions under the rule of law.' Solicitor David Pascoe, who prosecuted Mahdi, has defended the execution, saying that all three bullets struck Mahdi's heart. The controversy comes as the state prepares to execute Stephen Stanko, who is scheduled to die by firing squad, lethal injection, or electric chair on June 13. Additionally, South Carolina's Attorney General Alan Wilson has launched an effort with North Carolina's Attorney General Jeff Jackson to demand answers from Chinese messaging app 'We Chat' about its role in facilitating fentanyl trafficking and money laundering. Finally, a Democrat has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2026, challenging incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham.

**Trump admin pulls $300 million in funding for UN's population control program - LifeSite**
The Trump administration has fulfilled another campaign promise by defunding the UN's Population Fund (UNFPA), a move that will cut off $335 million in funding for abortion, sterilization, and contraception promoting projects. The decision was made after the UNFPA was found to be in violation of the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, which prohibits US funding for organizations that support coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The UNFPA has been involved in coercive population control programs around the world, including China's one-child policy. As stated by the author, 'This decision is based on unfounded claims about UNFPA's work in China that have long been disproved - including by the U.S. Government itself.' However, the author disputes this claim, stating that their research has consistently shown the UNFPA's involvement in coercive tactics. The UNFPA has responded with 'deep regret' to the decision, but the author argues that their claims are 'simply false'.

**China's 'No Child' Policy: A Horrific Event 30 Years Ago**
Dr. Cai Yi-chen revealed a horrific event in China 30 years ago, where the government implemented a 'no child' policy, resulting in the forced abortion of countless pregnant women and the deaths of many newborn babies. According to Dr. Cai, in 1991, the county party secretary, Zeng Zhaoqi, held a meeting and ordered that no children should be born between May 1st and August 10th. He explained that the county was at the bottom of the list for birth control, and he wanted to turn it around by the end of the year. Dr. Cai said that during this time, any pregnant woman, regardless of whether she was in the planned birth program or not, and regardless of how many months she was pregnant, would be caught and forced to have an abortion. He stated that many of these women were taken to hospitals, where they were forced to undergo the procedure, and that many of the newborn babies were killed after being born. Dr. Cai asked, 'How would you feel if you were ruled by a country like this?' He emphasized that people should not be afraid of the Chinese Communist Party's influence and should instead use their power to resist. He said, 'If you don't want the Chinese Communist Party to have power, use your pen to drive them out. Vote them out, and don't let them have a majority.'

**Beijing's Pro-Natalist Push Continues to Strengthen**
The Chinese government has continued to implement a pro-natalist strategy, as seen in the 2025 government work report, which instructs officials to formulate policies to promote childbirth and adopt financial incentives, such as 'baby bonuses'. This shift away from supporting individual choices to have children, towards state-mandated goals of raising the number of births, raises concerns about the implications for women's rights. Chen Songqi, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, proposed removing restrictions on the number of children couples may have and lowering the legal age of marriage to 18, citing the need to 'increase the population base for childbearing' and 'release untapped reproductive potential.' A report by Chinese rights activists details how local officials are pressuring women to have more children, restricting access to sterilization and abortion medication, and encouraging Communist Party members and government officials to lead by example.

**Does the US have abortion policies similar to Communist China?**
The United States has abortion laws similar to those of Communist China, where abortions are widely performed and can take place at any stage of pregnancy. China's one-child policy, now a three-child policy, has led to a predominantly gender-skewed and elderly population. The preference for boy children among Chinese couples is fueled by the country's historically patriarchal and increasingly militaristic culture. Similarly, in the US, sex-selective abortion is a phenomenon occurring in some parts of the nation, particularly in states like New York, where abortion is a constitutional right and no state law specifically bans sex-selective abortion. The author argues that the US is doing a great injustice to pre-born girls by refusing to ban sex-selective abortions, and that this action stands in opposition to the values America claims to hold dear - life, liberty, and equality. 'We are encouraging policies that are just as barbaric and misogynistic as those of the CCP,' the author writes. 'This must end.'

**A new era of struggle for women's rights and gender equality in America**
The 2024 US elections marked a turning point for women's rights and gender equality in America. Donald Trump's supporters emphasized the need to return to traditional social values to ensure economic growth and national security, which included a strong message on traditional gender roles. This approach was evident in attacks on abortion and birth control rights. The history of abortion rights in America has been fraught with contradictions, with Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022, leading to 19 states banning abortion entirely. Trump has stated that he will not implement a federal abortion ban, but the Republican Party's religious faction is attempting to revive a 1873 law that prohibits mailing abortion pills, aiming to severely restrict access nationwide. The exclusion of abortion from state-funded insurance policies is also being pursued. Despite over 60% of Americans supporting abortion rights, Trump is expected to impose restrictions that will severely curtail access. The abortion debate extends beyond religious concerns to the history of forced sterilization of Black women in the US, revealing how birth control policies have been intertwined with eugenics. Today's debates over abortion and contraception mirror those of past eras, particularly in how they intersect with demographic shifts and anxieties over traditional gender norms. Figures like Elon Musk argue that declining birth rates pose a greater threat than climate change, but demographic data indicate that global population growth is now concentrated in the Global South, particularly Africa, while many countries, including China and India, face population decline. The European and American populations are concerned that if this trend continues, they will face deeper social and economic problems and lose their global hegemony. Given the demographic concerns of the capitalist class, there is growing hostility toward LGBTQ+ rights and non-traditional family structures. However, scientific data contradicts these claims, and experts agree that the quickest solution to demographic decline is to encourage migration flows. In short, while the owners of capital and their political representatives continue to blame transgender individuals and women who refrain from having children due to social injustice, the real issue, the demand for social justice and pluralistic identity policies, is not only ignored, but also portrayed as a threat to the future of humanity. Unfortunately, American women and the LGBTQ+ community still lag behind their European counterparts in terms of gender equality, parental leave, and political representation. A second Trump presidency is likely to bring significant rollbacks in rights and heightened social conflict, but this crisis also presents an opportunity for a renewed wave of activism.

**China's One-Child Policy Leaves a Trail of Suffering**
Teng, a Chinese woman, was subjected to a forced abortion in 1997 and has since suffered from severe health complications, including incontinence. Despite her efforts to seek justice and compensation, she has been met with resistance from local authorities, who have allegedly blocked her claims and intimidated her and her family. Teng believes that the authorities want her to die rather than acknowledge their responsibility for her suffering. China's one-child policy has had devastating consequences, including a shrinking population and a demographic time bomb. The policy was abolished in 2021, but the birth rate remains low, and the country is struggling to cope with the consequences of decades of strict birth control measures. The Communist Party is now trying to encourage people to have children, but it is still finding ways to control women's reproductive choices.

**China's One-Child Policy: A Legacy of Pain and Suffering for Women**
In China, the one-child policy was in place from 1979 to 2015, affecting millions of women. Rebecca, a 90s-born woman, shares her mother's story of being forced to undergo sterilization and having multiple abortions due to the policy. Her mother, Y, was subjected to a metal IUD for over 20 years, causing her physical and emotional distress. Rebecca's family was forced to move to a different city to avoid being reported for having more than one child. She and her sisters were sent to live with different families, and Rebecca was only reunited with her parents once a year. Rebecca's mother, Y, eventually had a hysterectomy and had the IUD removed, but not before it caused her significant health problems. The policy has had a lasting impact on the lives of Chinese women, with many still struggling with the consequences today. Rebecca's mother, Y, now advocates for women's rights and reproductive freedom, saying 'I hope my daughter can have a better life and make her own choices.'

**China Considers Reducing Minimum Marriage Age and Eliminating Childbirth Restrictions**
China is considering reducing the minimum age for marriage and eliminating restrictions on the number of children, according to Chen Songxi, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The proposal aims to expand the fertile population base and explore China's reproductive potential, amid growing concerns about the country's aging population and low birth rate, as reported by the Global Times. Chen argued that the proposal is in line with international trends on minimum marriage age and does not aim to force young people to marry early, but rather to provide more options. The number of marriages in China has reached a record low of 6.1 million in 2024, the lowest since 1980. Chen also suggested a broader reform of the population and birth control legislation, including changing the name of the current 'Family Planning and Population Law' to 'Population and Birth Law', eliminating restrictions on the number of children, and promoting policies such as monthly subsidies and medical support for each child until a certain age. The window of opportunity for implementing these measures is between 2025 and 2035, a critical period when the number of women of childbearing age will stabilize between 290 million and 310 million, Chen said. During this time, authorities plan to conduct surveys on intentions to have children and adjust programs for different population groups. China's projected population aging is also alarming, with over 15% of the population aged 65 or older in 2024, and estimated to reach over 20% by 2031, and 29.5% by 2050, which will have a negative impact on the country's workforce and economy.
