**Report: DOGE Team Begins Reviewing NTSB**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has assigned a team to review the operations of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). This review comes as part of DOGE's efforts to evaluate finances at several federal agencies, a practice that began under President Donald Trump. According to an unnamed NTSB spokesperson, DOGE is currently evaluating the investigative agency. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy testified to the House Appropriations Committee that her agency would need between 485 and 500 workers to achieve full staffing, but had not yet seen any staffing changes following a previous review by DOGE.

**Trump's DOGE Assigns Review Team To Examine NTSB Amid Firings And Safety Oversight Concerns - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL)**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has assigned a review team to examine the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) amid concerns over safety oversight and recent firings. This follows DOGE's pattern of reviewing independent agencies, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission, where three Democratic commissioners were recently dismissed. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy had previously stated that the agency had avoided personnel losses and remained exempt from DOGE's buyout offers. However, the review comes as aviation safety incidents surge, including a recent mid-air collision that killed 67 people. The NTSB typically handles over 2,000 investigations annually, and any operational changes could impact the agency's ability to conduct thorough safety investigations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has raised concerns about DOGE's impact on Coast Guard operations, citing the removal of Admiral Linda Fagan as Commandant and hiring freezes affecting water traffic control staffing.

**SEC chair says DOGE found $90M in cost savings, but public receipts don't add up**
SEC Chairman Paul Atkins claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has found $90 million in cost savings at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but a review of publicly available data found the actual savings to be tens of millions of dollars less, at $18.9 million. Atkins stated that DOGE has 'already been inside' the agency, identifying overlapping contracts and inefficiencies, particularly in technology investments. However, the data on DOGE's website only lists contract cancellations and savings up to May 9, with the highest-value cancellation being a $4 million contract with KUSI Global. Atkins said that the SEC has 'rationalized' its contracting, but the discrepancy between his figure and the published data remains. DOGE has been criticized for its lack of transparency and is currently fighting a court ruling that would subject it to Freedom of Information Act requests.

**SEC chair says DOGE found $90M in cost savings, but public receipts don’t add up**
SEC Chairman Paul Atkins claims that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has found $90 million in cost savings since joining the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, a review of DOGE data by FedScoop found that the actual savings is tens of millions of dollars less than that estimate, with a discrepancy of over $71 million. Atkins stated, 'I think the savings is up to $90 million that they’ve identified,' but the SEC declined to comment further. Atkins also mentioned that the SEC has reduced its contractor count from 2,000 to 5,100, and has been able to rationalize some contracting to the tune of $90 million. He also discussed the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) and the need for IT improvements to better protect sensitive financial information.

**DOGE Exposes Government Credit Card Scandal**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has exposed a major credit card scandal by deactivating 146,000 government credit cards and slashing spending limits from $10,000 to $1 in some cases. DOGE's leader, Elon Musk, highlighted the scale of government credit card abuse, but critics warn of unintended disruptions to essential services. The Department of Defense reported 8,000+ suspicious transactions on government credit cards between 2020 and 2024, citing transactions at casinos, luxury retailers, and pyramid schemes as implausible for legitimate military purposes. Comer stated, 'This is not 'waste'—it's deliberate corruption,' in a letter to Comptroller Gene Dodaro. The report noted purchases at 'high-risk merchants' and urged prosecutors to indict offenders.

**Elon Musk Urges US Congress to Support DOGE's Cost-Cutting Plan**
Elon Musk has called on the US Congress to provide greater support for his ambitious plan to save millions of dollars through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which he advises. He warned that without legislative and executive backing, the plan will be incomplete. Musk emphasized that his team is not 'dictators of the government' but rather advisors, and that the progress made so far is 'incredible'. However, he acknowledged that the DOGE's goal of saving $2 trillion by July 4, 2026 may not be met without legislative support. Musk also defended the DOGE's achievements, saying that the team has done an 'incredible job', but that the magnitude of the savings depends on the support received from Congress and the executive branch. He reiterated that the DOGE has only consultative functions and cannot impose decisions on its own. Musk also addressed the legal obstacles facing the DOGE, including a Supreme Court case to access Social Security records, and warned of violent threats against Tesla and its users. He vowed to pursue those responsible and said that some of them 'will go to prison'.

**The Destructive Fall of International Cooperation**
The cancellation of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) by the US government has had a devastating effect on international cooperation. The USAID, established by Senator John F. Kennedy in the 1950s, was responsible for providing $40 billion annually to humanitarian assistance programs worldwide. However, under the leadership of Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has significantly reduced the agency's budget and numerous solidarity policies. This has led to a loss of funding for programs that mitigate poverty and hunger in developing countries. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 295.3 million people faced food insecurity in 2024. The EU has also been criticized for its proposed budget, which would tie aid to development to conditions such as controlling migration flows and accessing rare earth minerals. This would be a significant departure from the EU's current model of unconditional aid. NGOs have expressed concerns that this approach would undermine the quality of aid and prioritize the interests of EU member states over those of developing countries.

**Is DOGE Saving Taxpayers Money or Costing Them More?**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), launched by President Donald Trump and initially led by Elon Musk, aimed to save taxpayers $2 trillion. However, the estimated savings have been reduced to $150 billion, while reports suggest that DOGE's actions could cost taxpayers approximately $135 billion due to workforce layoffs, rehiring expenses, lost productivity, and paid leave. Additionally, defending lawsuits and lost tax revenue from IRS staff cuts may add to the costs. A survey found that 64% of respondents were concerned about the loss of experienced government personnel and 55% think the federal government is functioning worse now than a year ago. Furthermore, some DOGE staff members are being paid relatively high salaries, with Jeremy Lewin making $167,000, Kyle Schutt making $195,000, and Nate Cavanaugh making $120,500 per year, which is higher than the average GSA employee's salary of $128,565.

**DOGE Says It Has Saved over $1,000 Per Taxpayer**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have saved over $1,000 per taxpayer, with a total estimated savings of $165 billion. This is attributed to various cost-saving measures, including asset sales, contract cancellations, fraud deletion, grant cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions. The breakdown of savings per taxpayer is calculated at $1,024.84, based on approximately 161 million individual federal taxpayers in the U.S. DOGE's 'Wall of Receipts' lists 9,497 terminated contracts totaling $32 billion in savings, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leading the agency leaderboard in terms of generating savings. Despite being on the poorer side of the leaderboard, the Department of Transportation is still generating savings, with DOGE praising its leader, Secretary Sean Duffy, for cancelling seven 'wasteful grants' with a savings of $51M.

**Elon Musk's Ranking of US Government Agencies Based on Economic Savings Raises Concerns**
Billionaire Elon Musk has published a ranking of US government agencies based on their economic savings on the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) website. The ranking is a competition, with the Department of Education at the top and the Department of State at the bottom. However, experts have criticized the data for errors in calculation, including confusing millions and billions. According to CBS News, Doge misinterpreted the nature of several documents, leading to an overestimation of economic savings by $1.96 billion. Additionally, the budget cuts touted by Elon Musk have raised concerns among experts that they could compromise the US government's ability to manage potential future crises, such as a pandemic. The Doge has, for example, laid off 20 FDA employees, who are responsible for monitoring food and drugs in the US. The Doge website claims that the total estimated savings are $65 billion, which can be attributed to a combination of fraud detection, contract cancellations, renegotiations, asset sales, subsidy cancellations, staff reductions, program changes, and regulatory savings.
