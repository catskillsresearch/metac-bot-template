**Korea's birth crisis far from over**
South Korea's total fertility rate reached 0.82 in the first quarter of 2025, a 7.4% year-on-year increase, the highest since records began in 1981. Experts are cautiously optimistic, but warn that even if the government's target of a 1.0 fertility rate by 2030 is met, Korea would still be at the bottom globally in terms of fertility. The prolonged low birthrate has eroded the population of people capable of having children, and an increase in fertility rates may not translate into more births due to a smaller base population of parents. According to Statistics Korea, even under the agency's high-fertility projection scenario, the national population will fall to the 30-million range within 45 years. Complacency is not an option, and a fertility rate must rise to two or three children per woman to avoid a shrinking society. 'We must remember that we have merely bought a little more time to prepare for the demographic shock ahead,' said a warning from the article.

**South Korea's Aging Population: A Call for Action**
South Korea is expected to become the world's oldest country by 2045, with 37% of the population over 65. To address this issue, the government should consider increasing the retirement age to 70, allowing seniors to continue working and contributing to the economy. Additionally, the government should provide a 'choice of retirement extension' option for companies, similar to Japan's 'employment stabilization measure'. This would enable seniors to continue working beyond the current retirement age of 65. Furthermore, the government should transform community centers (known as 'gongdan' in Korean) into multi-generational spaces where seniors can socialize and engage in leisure activities. Finally, the government should invest in AgeTech, a technology-based care industry, to create a new growth engine for the economy. According to a survey, 78.1% of respondents agreed to increase the retirement age to 70, and 81.5% considered 70 to be the appropriate age for seniors. The government should also consider providing a 'choice of retirement extension' option for companies, similar to Japan's 'employment stabilization measure'. This would enable seniors to continue working beyond the current retirement age of 65. The government should also invest in AgeTech, a technology-based care industry, to create a new growth engine for the economy.

**South Korean presidential front-runner backs nuclear power - for now**
South Korea's presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being,' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables, like offshore wind, to supply industrial hubs, and calls for phasing out coal by 2040 and curbing natural gas consumption. Lee supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants, but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60 per cent of the mix. Analysts expect Lee to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30 per cent of the power mix by 2030, while Kim is likely to retain the current push for nuclear power.

**South Korea's Caregiver Shortage: A Looming Crisis**
South Korea is facing a severe shortage of caregivers, with the Korean government warning that the country will need at least 61 million more caregivers by 2042, or as many as 155 million. The number of people aged 75 and over is expected to surge from 4.3 million this year to 11.5 million by 2050. Despite this, the government is still in the process of discussing possible solutions. 'We need to actively train and recruit caregivers from within and outside the country to respond to the rapid changes in our population structure,' said Joo Hyung-hwan, a vice chairman of the Low Fertility and Aging Society Committee. 'We should consider importing more caregivers and utilizing age-tech to improve efficiency and productivity.' However, some critics argue that this is just a starting point for discussion and that the government's current pace of planning will not be enough to address the looming care gap in the 2030s. The committee also mentioned the need to review policies to protect the rights of children and caregivers, but this was seen as a declarative statement rather than a concrete plan.

**Turkey's Fertility Rate Decline: A Demographic Alarm**
Turkey is facing a critical issue that directly affects its future: the decline in fertility rate and the aging of the young population. This situation is closely related to the total population number and the age structure of the society. While some argue that the population is already too large and should decrease, the real threat lies in the increase in the population's average age. For example, in 2020, the median age in Turkey was 32.7 years, indicating that half of the population is over 32.7 years old. A similar situation is seen in South Korea, where the fertility rate is currently 0.78. Experts predict that South Korea will experience a significant demographic collapse between 2040-2050, with a ratio of 100 elderly individuals to every child by 2060, leading to a loss of workforce and social collapse. Turkey is also experiencing a similar trend. The fertility rate in Turkey decreased from 2.16 in 2007 to 1.48 in 2024, indicating that the population cannot reproduce itself. Experts say that a fertility rate of at least 2.10 is needed to maintain a stable population. Various factors are contributing to this decline in fertility, including increased urbanization and education, women's participation in the workforce, economic costs, and changes in lifestyle. The government is preparing to take various steps to reverse this alarming trend. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that the 2026-2035 period will be declared the 'Family 10 Years' period. As part of this, economic incentives will be provided to couples getting married, and measures will be taken to strengthen family structures. Experts emphasize that demographic balance can only be maintained through long-term social policies and sustainable solutions.

**South Korea is Over**
South Korea is facing a demographic collapse, with a fertility rate of 0.72 children per woman in 2023, the lowest ever recorded in history. By 2060, the population will have shrunk by 30%, with one in two South Koreans over the age of 65 and less than one in 10 under 25. The country's economy is projected to collapse, with a workforce shrinking to less than half and a GDP that could peak in the 2040s. The societal and cultural collapse will be even more severe, with a loneliness epidemic, a decline in cultural traditions, and a shrinking youth population. The author argues that there is no way back, but rapid and societal changes could make the population want to have kids again. In 2024, births rose for the first time in 9 years, but this is not enough to reverse the trend. The article concludes that demographic collapse is not an abstract thing in the future, but is happening right now, and that it is not just South Korea, but a global problem.

**BOK Governor Warns Korea's Growth Will Reverse from 2050 If Birth Rate Remains at 0.75**
Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong has warned that if South Korea's low birth rate continues, the country will face negative growth after 2050. He stated, 'If the current total fertility rate of 0.75 continues, the Korean population will plummet from the current 51 million to 30 million in 50 years.' Rhee projected that Korea's potential growth rate will fall from 2% to 0% in the late 2040s, and that a total fertility rate of 1.4 is needed to maintain positive growth in the 2050s. He also expressed concern that neglecting the low birth rate issue will worsen national finances, predicting that the national debt-to-GDP ratio will soar from 46.9% in 2023 to 182% in 50 years. Rhee proposed the introduction of a 'regional proportional selection system' to alleviate excessive concentration in the capital region and entrance exam competition, which he believes could boost marriage and birth rates.

**S. Korea may log negative growth from 2050 if low birth rate continues: BOK chief**
The Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong warned that South Korea's ultra-low birth rate will lead to negative economic growth after 2050, citing a recent study that showed the country's potential growth rate may approach near zero percent by the late 2040s. Rhee emphasized the need to address intense competition and burdens regarding employment, housing, and child care, saying 'The current fertility rate constitutes a national emergency.' He also called for measures to ease the demographic crisis, including fostering regional hub cities and implementing a regional proportional college admission system. Additionally, Rhee stressed the importance of addressing climate change, saying 'Severe localized climate damage could cause significant financial losses for households and businesses, destabilizing financial institutions and spreading shocks throughout the economy.'

**South Korea's baby bump**
South Korea's birthrate, the lowest in the world, has risen for the first time in nine years in 2024, with the total fertility rate increasing to 0.75 from a record low of 0.72 in 2023. Government incentives and corporate support for working parents have contributed to this change, with Nam Hyun-jin, a 35-year-old mother of two, noticing a societal shift in favor of childbirth. Workplace culture is also changing, with companies like Booyoung offering a 100-million-won childbirth bonus, and the government introducing policies such as 100% salary coverage for six months of parental leave. However, many younger South Koreans remain skeptical, citing the high cost and difficulty of getting married and raising a family in Korea. The country aims to raise its fertility rate to 1.0 by 2030, but faces challenges such as temporary employment and the need for companies to create family-friendly work environments.

**South Korea birth rate rises for first time in 9 years on marriage boom**
South Korea's birth rate has risen for the first time in nine years, with 238,300 babies born in 2024, a 3.6% increase from the previous year. The fertility rate also grew to 0.75, up from a record-low 0.72 in 2023. Officials attribute the rebound to government incentives, a boom in postponed marriages after the COVID-19 pandemic, and changing social attitudes. Park Hyun-jeong, an official from Statistics Korea, noted that the number of marriages has increased, with 222,422 couples married in 2024, the highest number since 1996. However, South Korea's birth rate remains the lowest in the world, and experts are unsure if the upward trend will continue. The government aims to increase the birth rate to 1.0 by 2030.

**Gov't forecasts total fertility rate will continue rising this year**
South Korea's birthrate has rebounded for the first time in nearly a decade, with 238,300 babies born in 2024, an increase of 8,300 from the previous year. The total fertility rate, the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, climbed to 0.75 from 0.72. Joo Hyung-hwan, vice chairman of the Presidential Committee on Ageing Society and Population Policy, forecasts that the upward trend will continue this year to reach 0.79. He attributes the rebound to government policies and a shift in public perception. Marriages also jumped 14.9 percent in 2024, the biggest spike since data collecting began in 1970. The government aims to raise the total fertility rate to 1 by 2030 and will continue to improve policies to support working parents and promote positive images of multi-child families.

**South Korea's policy push springs to life as world's lowest...**
South Korea's fertility rate has risen to 0.75 in 2024, the first increase in nine years, driven by more couples getting married and having second children. The government's policies to incentivize companies and Koreans to embrace parenthood are paying off, but experts say more work is needed. The demographic crisis is seen as the biggest economic risk to the country, with the population on track to halve by the end of the century. The government aims to raise the fertility rate to 1 by 2030, but experts say it will be a challenge to achieve this goal. Companies are being encouraged to provide more family-friendly policies, such as childcare bonuses and parental leave, to support the government's efforts. 'The society as a whole is encouraging childbirth more than five years ago,' said Nam Hyun-jin, a 35-year-old mother of two. 'It's the company culture of encouraging childbirth that is providing huge help,' she added. 'There is a high possibility of further rises (in fertility rate) in coming years, and we are right at the inflection point,' said You Hye-mi, presidential secretary for population policy. The government plans to spend 19.7 trillion won ($13.76 billion) in the three focus areas of work-family balance, childcare, and housing this year, up 22% from 2024.

**South Korea sees first rise in birth rate in nine years amid post-pandemic marriages**
South Korea has seen its first increase in birth rate in nine years, with 238,300 births recorded in 2024, a 3.6% increase from the historic low of 230,000 births in 2023. The total fertility rate (TFR) also rose from 0.72 in 2023 to 0.75 in 2024, surpassing the government's forecast of 0.74. Officials attribute the uptick in childbirths to an increase in marriages following the Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of marriages in 2024 being the highest recorded since 1996. According to Statistics Korea, birth rates per 1,000 women were recorded as 1,434 in 2024, up from 1,388 in 2023. The government has set a goal of raising the fertility rate to 1.0 by 2030, and has implemented various pro-natalist policies to address the low birth rate crisis. However, experts remain cautious about whether this rebound will be sustained in the coming years, as the number of women of childbearing age is projected to decline from 2027 onwards.
