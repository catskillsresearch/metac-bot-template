**Spanish Prime Minister Visits Valencia to Meet with Flood Victims**
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited Valencia on May 22, 2025, to meet with victims of the devastating floods that occurred on October 29, 2023, which left 228 people dead. Sánchez avoided visiting the 'zone cero' where the floods had the most impact, instead meeting with representatives of three associations of victims in a controlled environment. The associations, which represent 150 families of victims, had previously met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels. Sánchez announced that a state funeral will be held in Valencia on the first anniversary of the tragedy, and promised to visit the 'zone cero' again in the future. He also discussed plans to improve emergency protocols and provide more information to citizens in situations of risk. The associations criticized the lack of communication and coordination between the central government and the regional government, and expressed their desire to work together to address the needs of the victims. Sánchez also met with José Vicent, the owner of a bike shop destroyed by the floods, and gave him a Spanish cycling team jersey. The associations have not ruled out meeting with regional President Carlos Mazón, but have conditions for doing so, including participating in the investigation commission and being able to attend the Congress. Sánchez has promised to follow up on the commitments made during the meeting, including repairing the elevators in damaged homes and increasing resources to investigate the destruction of vehicles.

**PSOE and PP Advance, but Tired of Themselves: The Road to 2027**
The Spanish government, led by Pedro Sánchez, and the opposition party, PP, are both advancing, but tired of themselves. Sánchez is relying on the economy to withstand the wear and tear of ongoing judicial cases against him and his family members, while Feijóo is counting on his strategy of wear and tear, but Aznar warns that this will not be enough. According to Sánchez's entourage, some minor issues, such as the WhatsApp messages between Sánchez and his former minister, Ábalos, are actually contributing to cohesion among their voters, rather than causing them to desert. However, the president needs the economy and good governance to stay afloat. Sánchez is taking center stage in international politics, advocating for a European position against Netanyahu in Gaza, despite the inconsistencies in his discourse due to some Interior Ministry contracts with Israeli companies. The PP is struggling to articulate a compelling message, and both parties are showing signs of exhaustion, advancing tired of their own strategies, and waiting for a final sprint to the 2027 goal.

**Sánchez's Presidency: A President of Investiture, but Not of Government**
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will remain a president of investiture, but not of government, until he approves the general state budgets. He has only managed to pass a few laws in the current legislature and has had to approve all decisions on income and expenses, including rearmament, through backdoor measures. Sánchez's government coalition should understand that the country's budgets are not just a management tool, but the foundation of democracy, which determines the community's most pressing needs and decides where resources are obtained to address them. The opposition leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, has criticized Sánchez, saying, 'I will fulfill my budgetary obligations.' If Sánchez fails to do so, he will go down in history as a president who circumvented Parliament. Sánchez can still salvage his presidency by paying his coalition partners to approve the 2026 budgets. He plans to apply an amnesty to Carles Puigdemont, the leader of Junts, with the help of the Constitutional Court's president, Cándido Conde Pumpido, and the progressive block. He also wants to implement a new financing system for Catalonia and hold a popular consultation on the territory's self-determination. If he succeeds, he can present himself in the next elections as a president who has maintained the progressive coalition government 'to stop the far right' until 2031.

**Spanish PM Calls to End Social Media Anonymity, Force Digital ID: WEF**
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called for an end to anonymity on social media by forcing platforms to link user accounts with the European digital identity wallet. Sanchez believes that anonymity is 'paving the way for misinformation, hate speech, and cyber harassment' and is 'facilitating the use of bots' and 'allowing people to act without being held accountable for their actions.' He proposes that 'one social media user — one real ID' and that social media companies should 'open the black box on their algorithms' and be held accountable for non-compliance with laws and norms. Sanchez stated, 'Such an anomaly can't continue. In a democracy, citizens have the right to privacy — not to anonymity or impunity — because with those two social coexistence would be impossible.'

**Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez Sparks Controversy with Israel Comments**
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has sparked controversy with his comments on Israel's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2025. Sánchez called for Israel's expulsion from the contest, citing 'double standards' and comparing the situation to Russia's exclusion after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'No one raised an eyebrow when Russia was asked to leave international competitions like Eurovision,' Sánchez said. The German newspaper Bild has criticized Sánchez's comments, saying he is 'actively interfering' and 'asking for Israel to be excluded.' The article also mentions the potential fine for Spanish public broadcaster RTVE after a warning from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) over comments made about Israel during the second semifinal. Many politicians have expressed outrage over Israel's participation, with some calling for its expulsion and accusing the country of 'cultural manipulation.' Israeli Minister of Diaspora and Combatting Antisemitism Amichai Chikli responded to Sánchez's comments, saying 'Sánchez, it seems the Spanish people have spoken and we've taken the slap here in Jerusalem.'

**Feijóo Accuses Sánchez of Corruption, Sánchez Defends Himself**
Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the leader of the PP, has accused the Spanish government of 'generalized corruption' and asked Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez if he 'avals' the management of his secretary of Organization, Santos Cerdán. Sánchez defended the honesty of Cerdán and accused the PP of 'covering up corruption' of the president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Feijóo criticized the government for 'launching smokescreens' on various topics due to 'generalized corruption'. He warned that 'everything will be known' and that 'more examples will illustrate what is happening in Spain'. Sánchez replied that the world is mobilizing against the 'barbarity of Netanyahu in Gaza' and that Feijóo makes jokes about Franco, showing a 'lack of humanity'. Feijóo said that the only service that is punctual in Spain is the tax office, and that the government has increased taxes 97 times. He also stated that Spain is the country with the highest child poverty in the European Union. Sánchez replied that Spain suffers from many inequalities, such as accessibility to housing, and that the PP does not apply the housing law in many regions they govern. He also highlighted that the European Commission has increased the growth forecast for Spain to 2.6% in 2025 and 2% in 2026, and that the OECD has stated that Spanish families have the highest real income growth last year.

**Feijóo Accuses Government of 'Generalized Corruption', Sánchez Defends Cerdán's Honesty**
Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the leader of the PP, has accused the Spanish government of 'generalized corruption' and asked Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez if he 'avals' the management of his secretary of Organization, Santos Cerdán. Sánchez defended the honesty of his number three in the PSOE and accused the PP of 'covering up corruption' of the president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Sánchez said, 'For what we have left. You who did not come to insult and what you are dedicated to is to defame honest people.' Feijóo replied, 'Everything will be known.' Feijóo has also criticized the government for 'launching smoke screens' on different topics in front of 'generalized corruption.' He said, 'You have to transform the PIB into well-being, into personal income, into purchasing power, into a full fridge.' Sánchez replied that 'effectively' Spain 'suffers many inequalities, for example in accessibility to housing, but also in the cuts that were suffered during the financial crisis period', by 'the neoliberal response.' Sánchez also pointed out that many autonomous communities governed by the PP are not applying the housing law 'to resolve one of the main problems' that the country has. 'You invent a crisis every day, the same strategy for seven years, the same result. You in opposition, with the mess, and this government making progress in Spain,' Sánchez said to the PP bench. Sánchez also highlighted that this week the European Commission 'has raised the forecast of economic growth for Spain to 2.6% in 2025 and 2% in 2026', and that the OECD has said that the real income of Spanish families has increased the most during the past year.

**Spanish Government Faces Challenges in Passing General State Budgets**

The government has reiterated that it will try to approve the budgets, with Minister Ángel Víctor Torres stating that 'we are not giving up' on the goal. Sánchez has acknowledged that there is a difficulty in approving the budgets, but has expressed his commitment to 'sweating the shirt' and not giving up.

In contrast, Vox's Santiago Abascal will ask Sánchez how long he will continue to 'dynamite' Spain's relationships with international partners to support 'dictators or terrorists', referring to Nicolás Maduro and Hamas. Podemos' Ione Belarra will also ask about Trump's plans, targeting Vice President María Jesús Montero. The PP will focus on the investigations affecting the government and its environment, with questions for Justice Minister Félix Bolaños, including whether he believes in the principle of equality before the law. The session will also address the 'caso Koldo' scandal, with questions for Minister Angel Víctor Torres, who is accused of receiving money for favors. '¿Aún sigue usted siendo ministro?'

**Pedro Sánchez Met with Protests at Goya Awards 2025**
Pedro Sánchez, the President of the Government of Spain, was met with boos and chants of 'dimisión' (resignation) as he arrived at the Goya Awards 2025 in Granada. Protesters, who had gathered outside the Palacio de Congresos, shouted '¡Pedro, cobarde, España está que arde!' ('Pedro, coward, Spain is on fire!') and held up a caricatured head of Sánchez. Sánchez used his time on the red carpet to make a political statement, criticizing Isabel Díaz Ayuso and the Community of Madrid in his brief speech on TVE. When asked about the situation, Sánchez referred to the 'regresión de valores de diversidad, tolerancia y respeto' (regression of values of diversity, tolerance, and respect) and stated that the Government of Spain 'reivindica' (reclaims) these values. Despite the protests, Sánchez expressed his gratitude to the Academy and celebrated the decision to hold the event in Granada, saying 'Vengo todos los años' ('I come every year'). He also mentioned Madrid, saying that it did not host the event, and praised Granada as 'una de las joyas que tiene España' ('one of the jewels of Spain').

**Kevin Roberts: 'Spain and US will end badly due to Pedro Sánchez's policies'**
Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, believes that Spain and the US will end badly due to Pedro Sánchez's policies. Roberts has been a key advisor to Donald Trump and has written a 900-page document called Project 2025, which outlines a roadmap for the next US president. The document has been influential in shaping Trump's policies, with over two-thirds of his decisions in the past three weeks inspired by the project. Roberts is also a close friend of Santiago Abascal, the leader of Vox, and has been a vocal supporter of his party's policies. He believes that the EU has centralized power and has been unfair in its distribution of funds, and that it is a 'bad organization' in terms of defending 'stupid woke theories'. Roberts also believes that the US should prioritize its own interests and not be afraid to use tariffs to protect them. He is critical of the EU's plans to increase trade with China and believes that it would be 'sorprendentemente estúpido' for the EU to form an alliance with China instead of the US. Roberts also believes that the EU should prioritize its own defense and not rely on the US to provide for it.

**Sánchez Attacks the Opposition and Promises Progressive Policies**
Pedro Sánchez, the President of the Government of Spain, attended the XV Congreso regional of the PSOE-M, led by Óscar López. Sánchez praised López, saying 'I am an unconditional admirer of Óscar López' and highlighting his leadership, empathy, and ability to articulate large majorities. Sánchez also emphasized the importance of 'valentía' (courage) in politics, stating that 'for there to be social justice, there must be fiscal justice.' He criticized the opposition, calling them a 'multinacional ultraderechista' (ultra-right multinational) and accusing them of spreading 'bulos' (lies) in 'pseudomedios digitales' (fake digital media). Sánchez promised to defend the Welfare State and implement progressive policies, including reducing the working day, increasing the minimum wage, and filling the pension fund. He also attacked the President of the PP, Feijóo, saying that he has many reasons to demand Ayuso's resignation, but is afraid to do so because he doesn't want to end up like Pablo Casado. Sánchez concluded by saying that 'we will win in 2027 in the regional, municipal, and general elections. We will win in Madrid with a new, solvent, exemplary, and socialist president like Óscar López.'

**A Hypothetical Scenario: The Collapse of the Spanish Government by 2025**
According to a hypothetical scenario, by the end of 2025, the Spanish government, led by Pedro Sánchez, will be in a precarious situation due to the disintegration of its parliamentary support. The PSOE will be paralyzed by internal contradictions and the weight of the Ábalos case. In this context, the PP and Junts will block the increase in pensions, putting the government in a difficult position. The article suggests that the PP will continue to gain points in the polls, while Vox will be an uncomfortable partner for the PP. Meanwhile, Sánchez will struggle to maintain his alliances. The article also mentions the rise of a new extreme left-wing movement that uses Trump's strategy and is anti-immigration. The PSOE will be unable to negotiate and decide, and will become a ghost of its former self. The article also predicts a clash between Junts and ERC, with potential benefits for the Aliança Catalana de Ripoll and Salvador Illa. The PSOE will lose votes everywhere except in Catalonia, and Sánchez will likely not be the party's candidate in the next elections. The article also mentions the rise of the CDU in Germany and the possibility of presidential elections in France, as well as the continued influence of Trumpism and China's growing military presence.

**Spanish Government in Precarious Position After Parliamentary Defeat**
The Spanish government appears to be in disarray after its recent parliamentary defeat. Pedro Sánchez, the president, has been criticized for his lack of reaction to the defeat, saying 'now it's time for management, management, and management' and that he will visit affected areas 'later'. Sánchez has avoided visiting areas affected by the defeat, citing the need for 'management' instead. However, he has not committed to passing a decree to address the issue. The government's lack of reaction may be due to their desire to avoid making changes and instead try to pass another omnibus decree. Sánchez continues to claim that there is no alternative majority capable of passing a motion of censure, downplaying the government's recent setbacks. This includes the possibility of not being able to pass the 2025 Budget. The president is relying on the 'project of progress' to preserve his position against the rise of reactionary options. It is ironic that Sánchez, who celebrated his victory in the 2023 general elections, is now avoiding seeking the favor of the Congress or the citizens in the polls. Sánchez, who was absent from the parliamentary plenary session to attend the Davos Forum, avoided being the direct protagonist of the bad news. However, just as Alberto Núñez Feijóo and the PP leaders must face reality, Sánchez has the institutional responsibility to provide stability to the country without shying away from the truth.

**Spanish PM Calls to End Social Media Anonymity, Force Digital ID: WEF**
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called for an end to anonymity on social media by forcing platforms to link user accounts with the European digital identity wallet. Sanchez believes that anonymity is 'paving the way for misinformation, hate speech, and cyber harassment' and is 'facilitating the use of bots' and 'allowing people to act without being held accountable for their actions.' He proposes that 'one social media user — one real ID' and that social media companies should 'open the black box on their algorithms' and be held accountable for non-compliance with laws and norms. Sanchez stated, 'Such an anomaly can't continue. In a democracy, citizens have the right to privacy — not to anonymity or impunity — because with those two social coexistence would be impossible.'
