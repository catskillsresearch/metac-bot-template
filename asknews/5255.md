**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Taurus, June 2025: Your Monthly Horoscope**
For Taurus in June 2025, Pluto retrograde will cast a transformative shadow over the month, influencing subconscious aspects of life and potentially leading to intense and life-changing events. A conjunction of Chiron and Venus will bring emotional intensity and inner shifts related to romantic relationships, money, or self-esteem. However, a trine between Venus and the waxing crescent Moon suggests that Taurus is ready for big change. Other notable alignments include a favorable sextile between Venus and Jupiter, an opposition between Venus and the waxing gibbous Moon, and a square between Venus and Pluto retrograde, which may signal hesitation or difficulty in embracing new truths. The full Moon in Sagittarius will raise questions about life goals, purpose, and identity, while a harmonious trine with Mars will increase the temptation to dominate the current situation. The cosmos will present an opportunity to turn past hurt into power on June 18, and the summer solstice will promote introspection and self-reflection. The month will also emphasize the importance of creating and enforcing firm boundaries to protect emotional, mental, and financial well-being.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Venus: Active Tectonics and Oxygen Discovery Suggests Possibility of Life**
Scientists have discovered evidence of tectonic activity on Venus, suggesting that the planet may be more active than previously thought. According to Gaël Cassini, the lead author of the study from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, 'there are no folds on Earth today, but they may have existed when our planet was young and before the development of plate tectonics'. The radar gravity data confirms that 'the most exciting thing in our study is that we can now say that it is likely that there are different active processes that lead to the formation of these folds and that the same processes may have occurred early in the Earth's history'. To conduct further studies on these folds, scientists need more accurate data. NASA plans to send two spacecraft to Venus in the early 2030s. The discovery of oxygen on Venus has also sparked interest in the possibility of life on the planet. Researchers have found evidence of oxygen in the planet's atmosphere, both on the night side and on the day side. The study, published in the journal Nature, shows that there is a layer of atomic oxygen in the atmosphere. This discovery has significant implications for the search for life on Venus.

**Venus Discovery: Study Reveals Signs of Geological Life on its Surface**
A study published in the scientific journal Sciences Advances has revealed signs of geological life on the surface of Venus. The study analyzed the changes that have been occurring on the planet for over 30 years. The circular formations on Venus' surface, known as coronas, are believed to be in the process of formation and may be related to the planet's tectonic activity. According to the study, these coronas could be formed by activity on the surface or from the interior of the planet. The NASA's VERITAS mission, set to launch in 2031, will analyze the formation of these extensive coronas. While it is not possible to confirm life on Venus due to its dense atmosphere, the study suggests that the planet may have signs of life in its atmosphere, such as the presence of phosphine gas. As Dr. Natalia Villamil said, 'the discovery of life on Venus would be a groundbreaking finding that could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe.'

**Elon Musk's Plan B for Humanity: Colonizing Mars by 2031**
Elon Musk has reiterated his conviction that humanity's future must pass through Mars. In an interview on 'Jesse Watters Primetime' on Fox News, the SpaceX CEO defined the colonization of the red planet as a 'life insurance' for the human species. With the end of his experience in the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) group, Musk has shifted his attention to his most ambitious project: transforming Mars into a safe and self-sufficient refuge. According to Musk, Earth will not be habitable forever. The Sun, as explained by NASA scientists, has a life expectancy of around 5 billion years, but will eventually expand to become a red giant, likely engulfing Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth. 'The Sun is slowly expanding. Eventually, life on Earth will be wiped out,' Musk said. 'It's essential to become a multi-planetary civilization to ensure the continuity of life.' The project aims to build an autonomous city on Mars that can survive without supplies from Earth, as Musk stated, 'We need to become a multi-planetary species to ensure the survival of humanity.'

**Elon Musk Reveals the Terrifying Reason He's Willing to Do Anything to Sustain Life on Mars  --  Before It's Too Late**
Elon Musk has revealed the terrifying reason behind his push to colonize Mars: the sun's natural processes will eventually destroy life on Earth. According to Musk, the sun will engulf Mercury, Venus, and potentially Earth itself in five billion years, making Mars humanity's only chance for survival. Musk sees Mars as a 'life insurance' policy for the species and has dedicated resources to SpaceX's Mars missions to ensure the continuation of life. His ultimate goal is to create a self-sustaining city on Mars that can grow independently of Earth, with a timeline of sending the first crewed mission by 2029 or 2031. Musk believes that without this level of independence, Mars would not fulfill its role as a 'life insurance' policy for humanity.

**Mars as a Life Insurance for Humanity**
Elon Musk told Fox News that all life on Earth will eventually be lost when the sun expands and eventually destroys the planet. According to NASA, the sun will become a red giant and potentially engulf Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth in about five billion years. Musk emphasized the importance of becoming a multi-planetary civilization, stating, 'Therefore, we must become a multi-planetary civilization.' Musk's ambitions go beyond symbolic presence, he explained, 'The crucial thing is that a Martian settlement must be self-sustaining. If it is dependent on supplies from Earth to survive, we have not created a real life insurance.' Musk plans to send a spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026, with Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus on board. If everything goes according to plan, he believes humans can land on the planet as early as 2029, but 2031 is more realistic.

**These Prophecies Of Baba Vanga Came True In 2025. Here's What She Predicted**
Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian psychic known as the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans', has accurately predicted several devastating events, including recent earthquakes worldwide. Her 2025 predictions include 'shattering earthquakes', which have come true, and a war in Europe, a global economic disaster, and the downfall of humanity beginning in 2025. According to Baba Vanga, the timeline for humanity's collapse is as follows: 2025: A major conflict in Europe will severely impact the continent's population; 2028: Humans will begin to explore Venus as a potential energy resource; 2033: The melting of the polar ice caps will cause significant rises in global sea levels; 2076: Communism will spread across multiple nations worldwide; 2130: Humanity will establish contact with extraterrestrial life; 2170: A widespread drought will severely impact large parts of the planet; 3005: Earth will engage in a war with a Martian civilization; 3797: Humans will be forced to leave Earth as it becomes uninhabitable; and 5079: The world will come to an end. 'The New York Post' notes that while there's no official record to confirm her specific earthquake prediction for 2025, this event has revived discussion on her other forecasts for the year.

**Venus Life Finder Mission Aims to Search for Signs of Life in the Clouds of Venus**
The Venus Life Finder mission, led by Sara Seager and Janusz Petkowski, aims to search for signs of life in the clouds of Venus. The mission, supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rocket Lab USA Inc., will use a device called a nephelometer of autofluorescence (AFN) to search for organic material in the clouds and characterize particles. Although it won't confirm the existence of life, it could identify conditions that make it possible. The mission will focus on staying in the clouds, rather than simply passing through them and observing them. This is a new approach, as previous missions have focused on mapping the surface or measuring sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, which is an indicator of volcanic processes. The first mission will last for five minutes, and the second phase, starting in 2026, will explore the habitability of the clouds in more depth. The third and final phase, projected for 2041, will involve a mission to return samples from the clouds of Venus to Earth for analysis. According to Segura Peralta, these expeditions will provide new information about Venus, also known as the Morning Star, and will help humans better understand themselves and their position in the cosmos. The possibility of finding organic compounds in such an extreme environment as the clouds of Venus not only expands our understanding of the chemistry of life, but also raises new questions about our existence and place in the universe.

**Venus Life Finder Mission: A New Era in Exploring the Planet's Clouds**
In 2025, the Venus Life Finder mission, a program designed to search for signs of life in the clouds of Venus, is expected to begin. The mission is supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rocket Lab USA Inc. According to Antígona Segura Peralta, a researcher at the Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), this is the first phase of a series of expeditions focused on the astrobiology of Venus that will last until 2041. The exploration is planned for the first months of 2025 and will start with the launch of the Electron rocket from Rocket Lab, which will deploy the Photon spacecraft near the planet. The spacecraft will carry a small probe weighing around 20 kilograms that will drop just before entering the atmosphere. The probe will be equipped with a nefelómetro de autofluorescencia (AFN) instrument that will allow it to search for organic material in the clouds and characterize particles. Although it will not confirm the existence of life, it could identify conditions that make it possible. As Segura Peralta mentioned, before this mission, other missions have been developed where the ships have orbited around Venus to map its surface or measure the sulfur dioxide in its atmosphere, which is an indicator of volcanic processes.

**Venera-D Mission Delayed Until 2034-2035**
The Russian space mission 'Venera-D' is likely to be delayed until 2034-2035, according to the scientific director of the Institute of Cosmical Research, Lev Zeleny. The mission, originally scheduled for 2031, will be postponed to coincide with other missions to Venus launched by international colleagues. Lev Zeleny stated, 'We fear and do not want to rush the NPO Lavochkin, so the launch is likely to be delayed to 2034-2035.' The Venera-D project includes an orbital apparatus and a landing module to study the atmosphere and surface of Venus. The mission aims to deliver samples of the planet's atmosphere, which may hold signs of extraterrestrial life, and is expected to be the beginning of a series of missions. The launch is planned to be carried out using the Angara-A5 rocket.
