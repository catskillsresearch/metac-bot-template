**LA Angels On Pace to Post Historically Poor Offensive Numbers in 2025**
The Los Angeles Angels are on pace to post historically poor offensive numbers in 2025, with a current on-base percentage (OBP) of .282, ranking dead last in MLB. According to Underdog Fantasy's Justin Havens, this would be the third-lowest OBP in the expansion era, behind the 2022 Oakland Athletics (.281) and the 2024 Chicago White Sox (.278). The Angels' struggles are led by players such as Kevin Newman, Taylor Ward, and Tim Anderson, who all have OBPs below .250. In contrast, Nolan Schanuel, Yoán Moncada, and Zach Neto are leading the team with OBPs between .336 and .356, but still trail the Dodgers' leaders. The Angels are currently 20-25, but their expected win-loss record is 17-28, indicating that they are getting lucky despite their poor offense.

**Dodgers Manager Sends Warning to Rest of League**
The Los Angeles Dodgers, who won their eighth World Series title in franchise history, remain one of the top teams in MLB this season. Despite navigating the recovery processes of multiple injured pitchers, including Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell, the Dodgers have maintained a strong record, with a .667 winning percentage, second only to the New York Mets. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts believes that the team's ability to win games despite obstacles should intimidate other MLB teams. He said, 'All the stuff that we've gone through with having the inconsistencies with the offense, some hiccups sometimes with the defense, with the injuries, and still to be where we're at... So I think that that's a bad sign for the rest of the league.' The Dodgers aim to win another World Series title in the 2025 season, but will need a healthy pitching staff and consistent offense from all nine batters to achieve this goal.

**How Dodgers' hot start has affected World Series, win total odds**
The Los Angeles Dodgers have started the season 8-0, following Shohei Ohtani's walk-off home run in their 6-5 win over the Atlanta Braves. This is the first time a defending World Series champion has started the season with an 8-0 record. The Dodgers are now the team to beat in 2025, with odds of +230 to win the World Series and an updated win total of 108.5. According to BetMGM trading manager Halvor Egeland, 'I think everyone came into this season expecting the Dodgers to be the best team in baseball.' Egeland also noted that 'Just about every number we put up for the Dodgers gets bet over,' and that the team has received the highest percentage of bets (16.1%) and money (34.3%) in the World Series market. The Dodgers now have an implied probability of 30.3% to win the World Series, with a large gap between them and the next closest team in terms of talent.

**Dodgers projected for MLB-best 104 wins by Baseball Prospectus**
Baseball Prospectus has projected the Los Angeles Dodgers to win 104 games in the 2025 season, the most in Major League Baseball. The PECOTA projections, unveiled on Monday, also predict the Dodgers to lead the league in runs scored (834) and fewest runs allowed (625). The team's 97.7% chance to win the National League West division is the highest in baseball. While winning a division by 17 or more games does not guarantee success in the playoffs, the Dodgers have a history of setting high standards, having won 95 more games than the next-best team over the last 12 seasons. As Dodgers' fan and writer, 'So yeah, 104 wins sounds about right for this team. It might even be a conservative estimate after all.'
