**UN: The World Approaches a New Climate Threshold**
The United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a report warning of a high probability of the global average temperature exceeding the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2025 and 2029, with a 70% chance. This report highlights the world's approach to breaching the climate limit set by the Paris Agreement in 2015, which aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, with a goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. The report notes that the past two years have seen record-breaking temperatures, with 2023 and 2024 being among the hottest years on record. According to the latest data, the average temperature in 2024 exceeded pre-industrial levels by 1.45 degrees Celsius, with a 80% scientific probability that one of the next five years will be warmer than 2024. The report predicts that temperatures will rise between 1.2 and 1.9 degrees Celsius between 2025 and 2029 compared to the mid-19th century, with a 1% chance of exceeding a 2-degree Celsius threshold during the same period, a scenario that was considered unlikely a decade ago but is now a looming reality. These numbers are not just statistics, but reflect an escalating reality of climate change impacts, where temperatures have risen by 40 to 50 degrees Celsius in regions such as China and the UAE, while Pakistan has suffered from drought and strong winds, and Europe and Canada have experienced devastating floods and fires. Rising temperatures also contribute to the melting of permanent ice and the reduction of sea ice coverage, as well as exacerbating droughts and increasing the risk of heavy rainfall. Climate scientists warn that continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions make achieving the ambitious goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius less likely over time. According to the Copernicus program of the European Union, the current warming has reached 1.39 degrees Celsius, and it is likely to exceed the 1.5-degree threshold before the end of the 2020s. The Arctic remains the fastest-warming region compared to the rest of the world, with a clear reduction in sea ice coverage in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas. Studies predict an increase in rainfall rates in coastal areas, Alaska, Siberia, and northern Europe, while the Amazon basin is expected to experience drier conditions in the near future.

**Are We Still on Track with the Paris Agreement? A New Analysis Raises Concerns**
The world is getting closer to exceeding the +1.5°C global warming limit set by the Paris Agreement in 2015. According to a new analysis by the Wegener Center and Institute of Physics at the University of Graz, Austria, the global temperature could exceed this limit as early as 2028, with a margin of error of plus or minus two years. This is earlier than the predicted timeframe of 2030-2035 by the IPCC. As Dr. Wegener said, 'it's time to reassess our standards for evaluating our adherence to the Paris Agreement.'

**Global Efforts to Curb Rising Temperatures: A Warning from the World Meteorological Organization**
A new report from the World Meteorological Organization warns that the Earth is on track to surpass the 1.5°C threshold, a level of global warming that scientists have long been concerned about. According to the report, the Earth's temperature is rising at an alarming rate, and the 1.5°C threshold is now just two years away. The report highlights the increasing temperatures over the past few years, and notes that the rate of warming is accelerating due to the return of the El Niño phenomenon, increased pollution, and continued greenhouse gas emissions. The report emphasizes that renewable energy is still not enough to reverse the trend, and that the real danger lies in what comes after the 1.5°C threshold, including the melting of polar ice caps, the disappearance of coral reefs, and the increasing intensity of hurricanes and heatwaves. As one scientist noted, 'We are not counting on miracles, but on finding solutions that can mitigate the effects of climate change.' The report warns that 2027 may be just a number, but it is a final warning, and that we are approaching a point of no return.

**World Meteorological Organization Issues Urgent Climate Warning for Next Five Years**
The World Meteorological Organization (OMM) has released an urgent statement warning of the next five years' global climate projections. According to the report, the average annual global surface temperature is expected to be higher than the 1850-1900 average. The organization warns that for every additional fraction of a degree, 'more damaging heatwaves, extreme precipitation events, intense droughts, melting of ice caps, sea ice, and glaciers, warming of the oceans, and sea level rise' will occur. The OMM emphasizes that these consequences will be more severe with each additional degree of warming.

**WMO Warns of 70% Probability of Exceeding 1.5°C Global Temperature Increase by 2029**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned that there is a 70% probability that the average global temperature between 2025-2029 will exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The WMO's report states that high temperatures will increase climate risks and impacts on societies, economies, and sustainable development. The report predicts that the average annual global temperature near the surface for each year between 2025 and 2029 will be 'between 1.2°C and 1.9°C', surpassing the average temperature recorded between 1850 and 1900. The WMO also notes that there is an 80% chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be hotter than the current record holder, 2024. Additionally, there is an 86% probability that at least one year will be more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The WMO explains that each additional degree of warming leads to more severe heatwaves, extreme precipitation events, intense droughts, melting of glaciers, warming of oceans, and sea-level rise. The organization highlights that the warming of the Arctic in the next five years is expected to be more than three and a half times the global average, and that regions such as the Sahel, northern Europe, Alaska, and northern Siberia will be wetter, while the Amazon will be drier (from May to September 2025-2029). The scientific community has warned that a warming above 1.5°C could trigger more severe climate change impacts and extreme weather conditions, emphasizing that each fraction of a degree of warming is crucial. The COP30 conference in Brazil will analyze the updated national climate action plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are essential to achieving the Paris Agreement's goals.

**What will happen If Earth's temperature rises by just 2 degrees Celsius? These places will...**
A recent scientific study warns that if the global temperature rises by 2 degrees Celsius, the Hindu Kush Himalaya, a vital water source for nearly two billion people, could lose up to 75% of its glacier ice by the end of this century. The study, published in the scientific journal Science, states that limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels could preserve around 40-45% of the glacier ice in the Himalayas and the Caucasus Mountains. According to the study, if global temperatures rise by 2.7 degrees Celsius, only about one-quarter of the world's glacier ice will remain. The study emphasizes that keeping the global temperature increase within the 1.5°C limit set by the 2015 Paris Agreement could aid in retaining some glacier ice in all affected areas. Asian Development Bank Vice-President Yingming Yang said, 'Melting glaciers threaten lives on an unprecedented scale, including the livelihoods of more than 2 billion people in Asia. Switching to clean energy to cut the release of planet-warming emissions remains the most effective way of slowing glacial melt'.

**Arctic warming seen at three times global average in years ahead: UN agency - The Weather Network**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a report predicting that the world will experience more record temperatures over the next five years, with Arctic warming expected to be over three times the global average. There is an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years will see record heat, with a high likelihood that average warming will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. The WMO warns that this warming will fuel more extreme weather, including heatwaves, extreme rainfall events, and rising sea levels. According to the WMO, 'Every additional fraction of a degree of warming drives more harmful heatwaves, extreme rainfall events, intense droughts, melting of ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, heating of the ocean, and rising sea levels.'

**WMO Sounds Alarm: 1.5-Degree Celsius Target May Be Reached Sooner Than Thought**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has sounded the alarm, warning that the 1.5-degree Celsius target may be reached sooner than previously thought. The accelerated timeline is due to higher temperatures than expected in recent years, decreasing air pollution that cooled the Earth, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide despite the growth of renewable energy. This means that irreversible tipping points in the climate system, such as the melting of Arctic ice shelves or the widespread collapse of coral reefs, are closer than scientists previously thought. According to the new analysis, the next five years will likely average over 1.5 degrees Celsius. Combined with the recent hot years and expected rising temperatures after 2030, 2027 is likely to be the first year in which the long-term average temperature exceeds the limit, says Zeke Hausfather. The Paris Agreement aimed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but some scientists and experts privately feared that the more ambitious goal would be impossible due to the difficulty of transforming the energy system. Despite the growth of renewable energy, it still only makes up about a third of the global energy mix. Even if wind, solar, and batteries grow in the power grid, the world consumes more electricity than ever before. The failure of the climate goal puts politicians and negotiators who have tried to win support for reducing climate-damaging emissions in an uncomfortable position. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres claims that the 1.5-degree target is 'on life support' and 'will soon be dead.' Eventually, nations will recognize this failure and need to develop a new goal. 'You could imagine governments saying: 'Hey, 1.5 won't be achievable, but here's what we'll do, and here's where we'll strengthen our efforts,' says David Victor. 'That's an approach. Another approach would be to give up.' Zeke Hausfather, a climate researcher and head of climate research at Stripe, is critical of the climate protection alternative 'Overshoot.' 'I'm personally very skeptical about our willingness to spend billions of dollars on dealing with Overshoot,' he said. After another decade of inaction, we'll be talking about the 2-degree target the way we're talking about the 1.5-degree target now. The nations could focus their attention on the less ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, keeping temperatures below two degrees Celsius warming. This goal is more achievable, but currently still unlikely. The planet is currently on its way to about 2.5 degrees Celsius. 'The longer we wait, the harder it will be,' emphasizes Hausfather. 'After another decade of inaction, we'll be talking about the 2-degree target the way we're talking about the 1.5-degree target now.'

**UN Warns of Potential 1.5°C Temperature Threshold Exceedance by 2029**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has published a report warning that global temperatures are expected to continue reaching record levels over the next 5 years, possibly exceeding the 1.5°C limit of average temperature increase. According to the report, there is a 70% probability that the average global temperature will surpass the 1.5°C threshold between 2025 and 2029. This is a significant increase from previous reports, which estimated a 47% probability between 2024-2028 and a 32% probability between 2023-2027. Ko Barrett, Deputy Secretary-General of the UN agency, stated, 'The planet has experienced the 10 warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this report does not show any signs of relief, which implies a growing negative impact on our economies, daily lives, ecosystems, and planet.' The report also highlights the importance of continued climate monitoring and prediction to provide decision-makers with evidence-based scientific tools to adapt to this new reality. The scientific community has repeatedly emphasized that each fraction of a degree of global temperature increase can exacerbate extreme climate phenomena, such as heatwaves, intense rainfall, prolonged droughts, and glacier melting, which leads to sea level rise and ocean warming. The report notes that the 2024 was the first year to exceed the 1.5°C threshold compared to pre-industrial temperatures, and it is estimated that the average between 2015 and 2034 will be 1.44°C, close to the limit. The WMO also highlighted other concerning findings, including the rapid warming of the Arctic, which is expected to experience an increase of 2.4°C between November and March of the next five years, more than three and a half times the global average. Additionally, the report predicts a continuous reduction in sea ice in the Barents, Bering, and Ojotsk seas in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as a reduction in precipitation in the Amazon and more humid years in southern Asia between 2025-2029.

**Climate Predictions Show Temperatures Expected to Remain at or Near Record Levels in Coming 5 Years**
A recent report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicts that there is an 80% chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be warmer than the current warmest year on record (2024). Additionally, there is an 86% chance that at least one year will be more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level. The report also forecasts a 70% chance that the five-year average warming for 2025-2029 will be more than 1.5°C. WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett stated, 'Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet.' The report also warns that every additional fraction of a degree of warming drives more harmful heatwaves, extreme rainfall events, intense droughts, melting of ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, heating of the ocean, and rising sea levels.

**Next Five Years Will Be the Warmest on Record, Warns World Meteorological Organization**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a report predicting that the next five years will be the warmest on record. According to the report, the global average temperature will rise by 1.2-1.9°C above the pre-industrial level (1850-1900) between 2025 and 2029. This will increase climate-related risks for populations, industries, and agriculture worldwide. The WMO's Deputy Secretary-General, Ko Barrett, stated, 'We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, according to our report, there will be no respite in the coming years, and this will lead to a growing negative impact on our economy, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet.' The report also predicts that the probability of exceeding the critical 1.5°C threshold (set by the Paris Agreement) is 70%, up from 47% in the previous report. Experts warn that the temporary exceedance of established levels will become more frequent, eventually becoming permanent and stable. They predict that the 20-year period (2015-2034) will see a global temperature increase of 1.44°C on average. However, the planet often surprises humanity with unexpected events that significantly alter any predictions. The UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, will discuss updated national climate action plans to achieve the Paris Agreement's goals. Despite the obvious reasons for concern, many people believe that nothing serious is happening, especially when they look out the window and see a warm spring like the one in Belarus this year. However, it's essential to distinguish between weather and climate. Climate refers to long-term weather conditions in a region, while weather is the current atmospheric conditions in a specific location. The average global temperature has already exceeded the critical 2°C threshold, reaching 2.06°C in November 2023. While this is a temporary anomaly, it's a worrying sign that the planet is becoming warmer. Experts predict that the consequences of climate change will be severe, including the loss of 70-90% of coral reefs (the foundation of many ecosystems) at a 1.5°C increase, and 99% at a 2°C increase. This will have a devastating impact on marine life and the people who depend on it for food. Therefore, it's essential to prepare for the coming five years of heatwaves.

**Global Temperatures To Soar In Next 5 Years: Report**
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has released a report predicting that global temperatures will continue to rise over the next five years, with an 80% likelihood that at least one year will surpass the warmest year on record (currently 2024). The report forecasts that temperatures will be 1.2°C to 1.9°C higher than the pre-industrial average, with a 70% chance that the five-year average warming will exceed 1.5°C. According to the WMO, 'The World Meteorological Organization Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update (2025-2029) projects that global temperatures are expected to continue at or near record levels in the next five years, increasing climate risks and impacts on societies, economies and sustainable development.' The report also warns that every additional fraction of a degree of warming will drive more harmful heatwaves, extreme rainfall events, intense droughts, melting of ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, heating of the ocean, and rising sea levels.

**UN Warns of 70% Chance of Exceeding 1.5 Degrees of Global Warming by 2029**
The United Nations has warned that the likelihood of exceeding 1.5 degrees of global warming by 2029 is 70%. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the past two years, 2023 and 2024, have been the hottest on record. The organization's deputy general secretary, Kwo Barrett, said, 'We have just witnessed the most free years in the past decade. Unfortunately, the organization's report does not show any signs of a slowdown in the coming years. This means a negative impact on our economies, daily lives, and environmental systems and our planet.' The Paris Climate Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, with a target of 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. The organization's predictions for the next five years, based on data from several international centers, indicate that the global average temperature for each year from 2025 to 2029 will be between 1.2 and 1.9 degrees Celsius higher than the pre-industrial average. The likelihood of exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius in the period from 2025 to 2029 is 70%. Climate expert Peter Thorn from University of Maynooth in Ireland said, 'This is exactly what we expect as we approach the long-term threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the late 2020s or early 2030s.' He added, 'I expect the likelihood to rise to 100% within two to three years in the context of five-year predictions.' The organization predicts that the likelihood of at least one year between 2025 and 2029 being the hottest on record is 80%. Director of the Climate Services Branch at the World Meteorological Organization, Christopher Hewitt, said in a press conference that several methods are used to evaluate long-term warming. One approach combines data from the past decade with predictions for the next decade. Based on this, the predictions indicate that the 20-year average temperature from 2015 to 2034 will be 1.44 degrees Celsius. There is no agreement yet on the best way to evaluate long-term warming. The European Copernicus Observatory estimates that the current warming is 1.39 degrees and expects the world to reach 1.5 degrees by mid-2029 or earlier. The likelihood of reaching two degrees is still very low (1%), but the mere appearance of this likelihood in computer predictions for at least one year in the next five years means it should be taken seriously. Adam Scaife from the UK Met Office said, 'This is the first time we have seen this in our computer predictions.' He added that 'this is alarming' and 'we expect an increase in this likelihood.' He recalled that a decade ago, predictions initially showed a very low likelihood of any year exceeding the 1.5 degree threshold. However, this happened in 2024. Each additional degree of warming increases the severity of heatwaves, heavy rainfall, droughts, glacier melting, sea ice melting, and river ice melting. It does not appear that this year will see any improvement. Last week, China recorded temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in some areas, while the UAE recorded around 52 degrees Celsius, and a severe heatwave struck Pakistan, killing people. Climate expert Frederike Otto from Imperial College London said, 'We have indeed reached a critical level of warming with recent deadly floods in Australia, France, Algeria, India, China, Ghana, and Canada.' She added that 'relying on oil, gas, and coal in 2025 is absolute madness.' Other warnings are expected to continue. The World Meteorological Organization predicts that the Arctic region will continue to warm at a rate higher than the global average over the next five years. The predictions indicate that the Arctic sea ice will continue to decline from March 2025 to 2029 in the Barents Sea, the Bering Sea, and the Okhotsk Sea. The region of South Asia is expected to experience increased rainfall over the next five years. Patterns of rainfall indicate that the African coastal region, northern Europe, Alaska, and northern Siberia will all experience increased rainfall, while the Amazon region will experience drier conditions than the natural average.

**Global Average Temperature to Exceed 1.5°C with 70% Probability by 2029, Warns WMO**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has announced that the global average temperature is expected to exceed 1.5°C above the pre-industrial era with a probability of 70% between 2025 and 2029. This is a record-breaking level of global warming, following the hottest years on record in 2023 and 2024. 'We've just lived through the 10 hottest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report doesn't show any signs of change,' said WMO deputy secretary-general Ko Barrett. The 1.5°C threshold is calculated in comparison to the period of 1850-1900, before the large-scale burning of fossil fuels began. Climatologist Peter Thorne noted that this is the most optimistic target included in the Paris Agreement of 2015, but it is now considered unachievable by many experts. 'It's entirely consistent with the fact that we're likely to exceed 1.5°C in the long term by the end of the 2020s or the start of the 2030s,' he said. The WMO also predicts that the Arctic will continue to warm at a faster rate than the global average over the next five years, with a 1% chance that at least one of the next five years will exceed 2°C of warming. 'It's exceptionally unlikely, but not impossible,' said WMO climate services director Christopher Hewitt. 'We're seeing this for the first time in our predictions,' said Adam Scaife of the UK Met Office. 'It's a shock, despite thinking it would be plausible by now.' The expert noted that a decade ago, the first time the probability of exceeding 1.5°C was shown in predictions was in 2024. Each additional fraction of a degree of warming can intensify heatwaves, extreme storms, droughts, polar ice cap melting, sea ice melting, and glacier melting. 'We've already reached a perilous level of global warming, with recent fatal floods in Australia, France, Algeria, India, China, and Ghana, as well as forest fires in Canada,' said Friederike Otto of the Imperial College of London. 'Continuing to rely on oil, gas, and coal in 2025 is absolute madness,' she added.

**70% chance 2025–2029 warming will exceed 1.5°C: UN - SUCH TV**
The United Nations has warned that there is a 70% chance that the average global temperature from 2025 to 2029 will exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius international benchmark. The World Meteorological Organisation's deputy secretary-general, Ko Barrett, said, 'We have just experienced the 10 warmest years on record, and unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years.' The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. However, the more optimistic 1.5°C target is now considered impossible to achieve, as CO2 emissions continue to rise. The WMO's latest projections predict that the global mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2025 and 2029 will be between 1.2°C and 1.9°C above the pre-industrial average. Peter Thorne, director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units group, said, 'This is entirely consistent with our proximity to passing 1.5°C on a long-term basis in the late 2020s or early 2030s.' The WMO also warns that there is an 80% chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be warmer than the warmest year on record (2024). Additionally, there is now an above-zero chance of at least one year in the next five exceeding 2°C of warming, which is 'exceptionally unlikely' at 1%.

**WMO Warns of 70% Chance of Exceeding 1.5°C Global Warming by 2029**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned that the global average temperature is likely to exceed 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level by 70% between 2025 and 2029. According to the WMO's annual climate report, the Earth is expected to maintain its highest warming level after experiencing the hottest two years in 2023 and 2024. 'We have just experienced the warmest 10 years on record,' said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett. 'Unfortunately, this report does not show any signs of relief in the coming years, which means it will have increasingly negative impacts on our economy, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet.' The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and if possible, below 1.5°C. However, many climate scientists believe that the more optimistic 1.5°C target is unlikely to be achieved due to increasing CO2 emissions. The WMO's latest predictions, compiled from multiple global weather centers, show that the global average near-surface temperature is expected to be 1.2-1.9°C above the pre-industrial level between 2025 and 2029. The report states that the probability of exceeding 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level is 70% between 2025 and 2029. 'This is entirely consistent with our expectation that we will break the 1.5°C threshold by the end of the 2020s or early 2030s,' said Dr. Sören, Director of the ICARUS unit at Maynooth University. 'I expect this probability to reach 100% within 2-3 years.' The WMO also predicts that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be the hottest year on record, with a probability of 80%. 'We are seeing a number of ways to evaluate long-term warming,' said WMO Climate Services Director Huw C. Lee. 'One way is to combine past observations with future predictions. This predicts that the 20-year average warming between 2015 and 2034 will be 1.44°C.' However, there is currently no consensus on how best to evaluate long-term climate warming. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) estimates that the current global temperature increase is 1.39°C, and is expected to reach 1.5°C by 2029 or earlier. Although the probability of exceeding 2°C above the pre-industrial level is extremely low at 1%, it is still higher than zero. 'This is the first time we have seen this event in computer predictions,' said Dr. Skew, of the UK Met Office. 'It is shocking, and this probability will continue to rise.' He recalled that 10 years ago, predictions first showed a very low probability of exceeding 1.5°C, but this target was reached in 2024. 'We have already reached the dangerous warming level,' said Dr. Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. 'Recently, we have seen deadly floods in Australia, France, Algeria, India, China, and Ghana, and wildfires in Canada. It is completely crazy to rely on oil, gas, and coal in 2025.'

**WMO Warns of Catastrophic Effects of Global Warming in Next Five Years**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned that the next five years could see even more catastrophic effects of global warming. There is a 70% chance that the global average temperature will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the limit set by the Paris Agreement to avoid more catastrophic effects of climate change. The WMO also raises the possibility to 86% that this limit will be exceeded in at least one of the five years, after it was first exceeded in 2024 for the first time in 175 years of measurements. The report also predicts that there is an 80% chance that at least one of the years in the studied period will be the hottest ever recorded, a record currently held by 2024. The average global temperature in 2024 was 1.55 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average, making it the first complete year to exceed the risk threshold of 1.5 degrees. The report indicates that between 2025 and 2029, the average temperature increase will be between 1.2 and 1.9 degrees Celsius, with the latter figure approaching another risk limit of 2 degrees Celsius set by the Paris Agreement. The experts warn that the higher the global warming, the more frequent extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, heavy rainfall, and floods will occur, as well as the acceleration of polar ice and glacier melting. The report predicts that in the next five years, the temperature increase in the Arctic, one of the most affected regions by global warming, will be three and a half times higher than the global average, with an average temperature of 2.4 degrees Celsius above the last 30 years. 'There is no respite after experiencing the 10 consecutive years of the warmest on record,' warned the WMO's under-secretary general, Ko Barrett. At a longer term, the report predicts that the average temperature increase in the 20 years between 2015 and 2034 will be 1.44 degrees Celsius.

**WMO Predicts Significant Increase in Global Temperatures Over Next Five Years**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has predicted a significant increase in global temperatures over the next five years. According to the WMO, there is a 70% chance that the average global temperature will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels between 2025-2029. This would make the planet experience historic levels of warming, following the two hottest years on record (2023 and 2024). WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ku Barrett said, 'We've just seen the hottest ten years on record. The WMO report shows no sign of improvement, according to Radio France Internationale. 'The 1.5 degree Celsius threshold is the most optimistic target set by the world in the Paris Agreement of 2015, but it is now considered impossible to achieve by an increasing number of climate scientists, as global CO2 emissions have not begun to decrease; instead, they continue to rise. Peter Thorne, a climate scientist from Maynooth University in Ireland, said, 'This is entirely consistent with the fact that we are approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius on a long-term basis in the late 2020s or early 2030s.' Although 'it is extremely unlikely' according to the WMO, there is now a non-zero (1%) chance that the temperature rise will exceed two degrees Celsius in at least one of the next five years. Adam Scaife from the UK Met Office said, 'This is the first time we've seen this in our forecasts... It's a shock, even though we thought it was reasonable at this stage.' He noted that a decade ago, the forecasts first showed a low probability of exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius in one year, and this was the first time in 2024. Each additional degree of global warming can exacerbate heatwaves, heavy rainfall, droughts, glacier melting, sea ice melting, and river ice melting... Last week, China recorded temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius in some areas, while the UAE reached temperatures of nearly 52 degrees Celsius, and Pakistan was hit by strong winds following a severe heatwave. Climate scientist Frederike Otto from Imperial College London said, 'We have already reached a critical level of warming' with 'the recent deadly floods in Australia, France, Algeria, India, China, and Ghana' and 'forest fires in Canada.' She concluded, 'Continuing to rely on oil, gas, and coal in 2025 is absolute madness.'

**WMO Report Suggests Possibility of Exceeding 2-Degree Temperature Limit**
A recent report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) suggests that there is a 1% chance that at least one year between 2024 and 2029 will see a global temperature rise of over 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This is the first time such a possibility has been suggested. The report also states that there is an 86% chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will see a global temperature rise of over 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and an 80% chance that the record for the hottest year will be broken. The WMO's report is based on the integration of predictions from 14 different institutions, including the Korea Meteorological Administration, and uses an 'ensemble prediction' method to increase the reliability of the forecast. The report predicts that the global temperature will rise by 1.2-1.9 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in each year between 2025 and 2029. 'This is the first time we have suggested that there is a possibility of exceeding the 2-degree limit,' said a spokesperson for the Korea Meteorological Administration. 'The 2-degree limit is a 'red line' that we must not cross.' The WMO's report also states that the average global temperature between 2015 and 2034 is unlikely to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 'This is a warning sign that the trend of rising temperatures will continue,' said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. 'This has negative impacts on the planet, ecosystems, daily life, and the economy.'
