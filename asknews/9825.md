**Polish Couple Worried About Impact of New President on LGBTQ+ Rights**
Areta Szpura and her partner Agnieszka Rylska are a same-sex couple living in Warsaw, Poland. They are planning to have a child through a clinic in Berlin, but Areta is concerned about the legal implications in Poland. The couple is worried about the new president, Karol Nawrocki, who has been critical of LGBTQ+ rights. Nawrocki's party, PiS, has a history of promoting conservative values and has been criticized for its treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals. Areta and Agnieszka feel that they live in a 'bubble' in Warsaw, where they are accepted, but outside of this bubble, they face a reality where their love is seen as a threat. They are concerned about the impact of Nawrocki's presidency on their lives and the lives of other LGBTQ+ individuals in Poland.

**Polish Presidential Election: Karol Nawrocki Takes Lead in Early Projections**
According to the first projections of the 23rd, the sovranist candidate Karol Nawrocki is in the lead in the Polish presidential elections, winning 50.7% of the votes, while the pro-EU candidate Rafal Trzaskowski, mayor of Warsaw and ally of the centrist government, has obtained 49.3%. The projections reverse the result indicated by the exit polls, which had given a slight advantage to Trzaskowski. The vote will have significant implications for the country's role in Europe, abortion, and LGBTQ+ rights. Trzaskowski, 53, has been running against the 42-year-old historic nationalist Karol Nawrocki, supported by the party Diritto e Giustizia (PiS) of the conservative President Andrzej Duda. The polls had predicted a close race. Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has voted in the presidential elections in his country, wrote on X, 'Is there a queue at Sopot at this hour? There will be a good turnout!' while sharing a photo of himself smiling next to his wife in front of the ballot box in the coastal town between Danzig and Gdynia, where he spent most of his life. The runoff is crucial for the relations between Warsaw and Europe. The two opposing visions are at stake, and not just the leadership of the country - the President of the Republic, in addition to leading the armed forces, has the power of legislative veto - but also the orientation on sensitive issues such as women's rights, abortion, and LGBTQ+ policies. A Trzaskowski victory would give momentum to the progressive program of the executive led by Tusk, opening the possibility of recognizing same-sex civil unions and revising the rules on abortion. A Nawrocki win would instead mark a return to the hard line of the PiS, which was in government from 2015 to 2023, and could even trigger new parliamentary elections. His supporters push for a tightening of immigration rules and greater autonomy from Brussels.

**Polish Presidential Election: A Close Contest Between EU Supporter and Right-Wing Candidate**
In the upcoming presidential election in Poland, Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, the 52-year-old mayor of Warsaw, is running against Karol Nessler, a 42-year-old historian and a strong supporter of the European Union. According to the latest polls, the competition between the two is very close, and the outcome is difficult to predict. The election is being held in a country that is a member of the European Union and NATO, and is a close ally of Ukraine, which has been fighting against Russia. The election is expected to continue until 9 pm, and the results will be announced on Monday. If Trzaskowski wins, it would be a significant victory for the government led by Donald Tusk, the former President of the European Council. It would also mean that the country would take a step towards greater social change, such as the legalization of same-sex marriage and the recognition of same-sex relationships. Poland is a rapidly growing economy in the European Union, with a population of 37 million people. The President of Poland has the power to veto laws and has control over the country's military. A victory for Karol Nessler would mean that the position of the Law and Justice Party (PiS), which ruled Poland from 2015 to 2023, would be strengthened, and the possibility of early parliamentary elections would increase. Many of Nessler's supporters are advocates of stricter immigration policies and want to maintain Poland's independence from the European Union. In the midst of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the Polish election is taking on a significant role. Karol Nessler, who is a supporter of Donald Trump, is opposed to Ukraine's membership in NATO and has called for stricter controls on the number of Ukrainian refugees in Poland. He also spoke at a rally in the Warsaw Uprising Museum, where many Polish soldiers were killed during World War II, saying, 'This is a betrayal of the Polish people.' The outcome of the election will depend on whether Trzaskowski can win over the supporters of Nessler, who are mostly right-wing voters. In the first round of the election, Nessler received 30% of the vote, while Trzaskowski received 31%.

**Poland votes in tight presidential race between pro-EU and nationalist visions**
Poland is voting in a tight presidential election between Rafal Trzaskowski of the ruling centrists Civic Coalition (KO) and Karol Nawrocki, backed by nationalists Law and Justice (PiS). Trzaskowski has a narrow lead in opinion polls, but the difference is within the margin of error. Both candidates agree on the need to spend heavily on defence and to continue supporting Ukraine, but differ on NATO membership and relations with the US and EU. Analysts say the vote will be a test of support for Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition government. Trzaskowski is hoping for high turnout, particularly from younger, liberal, urban Poles, who were crucial in securing a majority for Tusk in 2023. Nawrocki, who draws inspiration from Trump, says the election could be decided by single votes. The two candidates also differ on social issues, with Trzaskowski favouring liberalisation of abortion laws and introduction of civil partnerships for LGBT couples.

**Poland's Presidential Election: A Closely Contested Vote**
The upcoming presidential election in Poland is expected to be closely contested between centrist Rafal Trzaskowski and nationalist Karol Nawrocki. Poland has been a strong ally of Ukraine, providing political, logistical, and military support. However, the country has also faced criticism for suspending asylum rights for migrants crossing the border from Belarus. Poland accuses Belarus and Russia of organizing a migrant influx as part of a hybrid attack to destabilize the region and the EU. The country has increased its defense spending, exceeding the NATO target of 2% of GDP, with 4.7% of GDP allocated to military expenses. Poland plans to increase this level to 5% of GDP next year, a goal also supported by US President Donald Trump. The country has modernized its army, signing contracts with the US and South Korea, and has also signed a new treaty with France for mutual assistance in case of aggression. A large-scale military training program has been announced to ensure that every adult in Poland can be mobilized in case of war. The program, which is also open to women, will be based on voluntary participation and aims to train 100,000 civilians per year from 2027. Poland remains a coal-dependent country, with 63% of its energy production relying on this fuel. The country has signed an agreement to build its first nuclear power plant, with the first reactor expected to enter service in 2033. The Poles are also less and less Catholic, with only 71.3% of the population identifying as Catholic in the 2021 census, compared to 87.6% a decade earlier. Abortion is almost completely banned in Poland, with women only allowed to have an abortion in hospital if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or if it poses a direct threat to the mother's life or health. Assistance with abortion is punishable by up to three years in prison. In 2024, only 896 abortions were performed in the country of 38 million people, but a network called 'Abortion without Borders' reported supporting 47,000 people in accessing abortion that same year.

**Poland Holds Second-Round Presidential Election Between Pro-European and Nationalist Candidates**
Poland is holding a second-round presidential election between a pro-European and a nationalist candidate. Rafal Trzaskowski, a 53-year-old pro-European and ally of the centrist government, is facing off against Karol Nawrocki, a 42-year-old nationalist historian. According to opinion polls, the result is too close to call, with Nawrocki leading by 0.2 percentage points. The outcome of the election could have significant consequences for Poland's role in the European Union and the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community. A victory for Trzaskowski would be a boost for the progressive agenda of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, potentially leading to changes such as the introduction of civil unions for same-sex couples and a relaxation of Poland's near-total ban on abortion. On the other hand, a win for Nawrocki would strengthen the populist Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, and could lead to new parliamentary elections. Many of Nawrocki's supporters want stricter migration controls and defend conservative values and greater sovereignty over the EU. 'We should not give in to European pressure,' said housewife Agnieszka Prokopiuk, 40, before voting. However, many of Trzaskowski's supporters advocate for greater European integration and faster social reforms. 'Unfortunately, Polish women do not have the same rights as our European friends,' said tourist guide Malgorzata Wojciechowska. 'I hope that Rafal Trzaskowski will revive the debate on abortion so that we can finally live in a free country where we can have our own opinion,' she added.

**Poland's Presidential Election Heads to Second Round**
The Polish presidential election is heading to a second round, with Rafal Trzaskowski, the pro-European mayor of Warsaw, and Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian and admirer of Donald Trump, as the top contenders. According to polls, the election is expected to be closely contested, with neither candidate receiving more than 50% of the vote in the first round on May 18. Trzaskowski's victory would be a significant boost for the liberal government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, which has differing views with conservative President Andrzej Duda. Trzaskowski supports measures such as same-sex marriage and the relaxation of Poland's near-total ban on abortion. On the other hand, Nawrocki's victory would weaken Poland's support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, as he opposes NATO membership and criticizes aid to Ukrainian refugees. In a recent speech, Trzaskowski called on his supporters to mobilize, saying, 'If the participation is as high as in 2023, or even higher, we will win this presidential election.' He also emphasized the importance of choosing a president who is willing to build and unite the community, rather than one who would bring conflict and chaos. Nawrocki, meanwhile, has paid tribute to the victims of the massacres of Poles by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II, a sensitive topic in relations between the two countries. 'It was a genocide against the Polish people. There is no doubt: it was a crime committed by Ukrainian nationalists,' he declared. Analysts predict that a Nawrocki victory could lead to new legislative elections. The final result will be known on Monday, June 3.

**Poland Bans Sale of E-Cigarettes to Minors, Citing EU's 2040 Tobacco-Free Goal**
The Polish parliament has approved a law banning the sale of all types of e-cigarettes to minors, including those without 'nicotine' and 'nicotine' pouches, according to Radio Poland. The law also prohibits the sale of these products remotely, including online, and imposes a comprehensive ban on advertising them. The bill was passed with a large majority, with 417 members of the parliament voting in favor, one member opposing it, and 10 members abstaining. The law will now be sent to the Senate for review. This law aims to fill the legal loopholes that allowed minors to access products without 'nicotine', which have become increasingly popular in Poland. In a similar move, Belgium has banned single-use e-cigarettes with various flavors, including mint, apple, pomegranate, and cola, starting from January 2025. This measure is part of a national plan to combat smoking and is in line with the European Union's goal of achieving a tobacco-free generation by 2040. Currently, less than 5% of the population smokes, and some countries aim to make this deadline sooner.

**Romania overtakes Poland as worst country in the EU for LGBTQ+ people**
Romania has overtaken Poland as the worst country in the EU for LGBTQ+ people, according to the ILGA-Europe 'Rainbow Map' ranking. Poland had held the top spot since 2019, but its ranking improved after the 2023 parliamentary elections, indicating better conditions for LGBTQ+ people. However, the new government has not introduced any new reforms to improve LGBTQ+ rights. ILGA-Europe reports that Poland has seen an improvement in the 'civil society space' category, with fewer obstacles to LGBTQ+ events such as pride marches. 'Last year, more than 35 marches were organised across Poland and almost all of them took place peacefully,' according to the ILGA-Europe report. 'However, the protection of these events is insufficient.' Poland recently abolished its last 'LGBT-free zone', which was an attempt to exclude the LGBTQ+ community from public life. According to an Ipsos+ poll, 67% of Poles support same-sex marriage or legal recognition of unions for LGBTQ+ couples, but the ruling coalition failed to introduce bills on civil partnerships into parliament due to a lack of support from conservative members.

**LGBT+ Rights in Poland: A Change is Taking Place in Society**
Bartosz Staszewski, a Polish activist for LGBT+ rights, believes that a change is taking place in Polish society. He has been fighting for LGBT+ rights for eight years under the previous government led by the Law and Justice party (PiS). Staszewski has received death threats and has been constantly battling for the cause. However, with the election of Donald Tusk's Civic Coalition in 2023, he sees a glimmer of hope. Although the election has not led to significant changes, Staszewski believes that there is a shift in mentality in Poland. He notes that in large cities, it is safer for same-sex couples to walk hand in hand, and he sees young people who are not afraid to express themselves. Staszewski attributes the progress to the work of activists and the normalization of LGBT+ existence through Pride marches. He believes that politicians are becoming more open to supporting the cause as they see the change taking place in society. However, he acknowledges that being gay in Poland is still difficult due to the lack of rights, including no civil union, no marriage equality, and no protection from hate speech. Despite this, Staszewski remains optimistic about the future, citing increasing tolerance in Polish society.

**Poland finally abolishes its last archaic 'anti-LGBT' zone**
Poland has finally abolished its last 'LGBT-free' zone after funding was withheld from areas with the discriminatory policy. The move comes after more than 100 municipalities, about a third of Poland, had been declared as 'LGBT-free zones' in 2020. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's (ILGA-Europe) Rainbow map, Poland was listed as the 42nd friendliest place for the LGBTQ+ community last year. Poland's president Andrzej Duda previously stated that 'LGBT are not people; they are an ideology,' but funding cuts from the European Commission seem to have spurred change. A survey in 2024 found that 67% of Polish respondents supported same-sex marriage, indicating growing levels of support in the country. The European Union's legal action against Hungary and Poland for anti-LGBTQ discrimination in 2021 may have contributed to this shift.

**TSUE: Poland Must Register Same-Sex Marriage**
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that Poland must register the marriage of two men, a Polish citizen and a German citizen, who got married in Berlin in 2018. According to the ECJ, Poland is obligated to recognize same-sex marriages and register them in the civil register, as required by EU law. The couple had previously been denied registration in Poland due to the country's laws not recognizing same-sex marriages. The ECJ's opinion states that if a country does not recognize same-sex marriages, it must still document them, as this is a fundamental right of the couple. In this case, the ECJ has ruled that the marriage must be registered in Poland, as the couple is living there and wants to be recognized as a married couple. The opinion is not yet a final ruling, but it is likely to influence the ECJ's decision. As stated by Richard de la Tour, the ECJ's advocate general, 'If a Member State does not provide for the possibility of contracting a same-sex marriage, it must, nonetheless, ensure that the marriage concluded in another Member State is registered in its civil register.'

**EU Advocate General: Member States Must Recognize Same-Sex Marriages**
According to the European Union's Advocate General, J. Richard de la Tour, EU member states must recognize same-sex marriages contracted in another EU member state, but not necessarily by transcribing the marriage act into the civil registry. However, if transcribing is the only way to recognize a same-sex marriage in a member state that does not allow it, then the state must make provisions for it. The Advocate General's opinion is that the lack of recognition of a same-sex marriage contracted in another EU member state constitutes a limitation on the freedom of movement and residence of EU citizens and can prejudice the respect of private and family life. Therefore, member states that do not allow same-sex marriage must introduce adequate procedures to ensure publicity for third parties of marriages contracted in another EU member state, and not leave same-sex couples in a legal vacuum. The Advocate General concludes that the obligation to transcribe the marriage act applies to Poland, where there are no alternative solutions to prove marital status.

**European Court of Justice: Poland Must Recognize Same-Sex Marriage**
The European Court of Justice has ruled that Poland must recognize a same-sex marriage between two men who got married in Germany, despite such marriages being impossible in Poland. The Advocate General argued that EU law obliges the recognition of same-sex marriages. The case involves a Polish citizen and a Polish-German citizen who got married in Berlin in 2018. After their request to transfer the marriage certificate was denied, the highest Polish administrative court asked the ECJ for an interpretation of EU law. The ECJ's decision is a significant step towards greater recognition of same-sex marriages across the EU.

**‚ÄúLGBT Free Zones‚Äù: First To Revoke - Bi Community News**
The Swietokrzyskie district in southern Poland has revoked its 'LGBT Free Zone' status after a vote in the local assembly. The move, supported by the central government, may free up EU funding for the area, which had been blocked due to breaches of human rights. A compromise motion passed, guaranteeing equality and fair treatment for all citizens, while also allowing parents to raise children according to their beliefs. Activists have been frustrated by the slow response of European institutions, but the resolutions passed have forced Poland's hand. This move may set a precedent for other countries, such as Hungary, to follow suit.
