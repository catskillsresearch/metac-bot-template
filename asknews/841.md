**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Metaverses to Form New Economic Model in Russia by 2026**
According to a study by the 'Skolkovo' laboratory, the Russian metaverse market is expected to grow at an average rate of 41.12% annually. By 2026, metaverses will form a new economic model in Russia, reducing business costs, and a quarter of the population will spend at least an hour a day in them. The study found that multiplayer online games, previously associated with metaverses, have evolved into platforms for other tasks. They have begun to change real-world sectors, including HR, retail, small and medium-sized businesses, show business, education, banking, aviation, science, and other areas of life. The authors of the study 'The Economy of Impressions in the Coordinates of Virtual Worlds' calculated that the Russian metaverse market will reach $7.86 billion by 2030. Researchers found that metaverses have become a working tool that expands the possibilities of Russian business, helps it reduce costs, and forms a competitive market. The Association of Metaverse Market Participants (ARMET) has appeared on the wave of significant revenue growth in Russia in 2024. Metaverses give small and medium-sized businesses the opportunity to scale - with their help, it is easier to enter the global market without large investments. In science, aviation, and space construction, metaverses are useful for conducting tests and safely modeling processes. In HR, virtual worlds simplify employee adaptation and training. For Russian stores, virtual content has become a new way to attract customers, increase loyalty, and promote products. Experts predict that the market of virtual spaces will grow from $46.1 billion in 2022 to $507.8 billion by 2030, with online commerce driving this growth. Companies that integrate into virtual worlds in a timely manner will receive real benefits on the market, experts from 'Skolkovo' believe. VR has already been used in medicine for a long time. Last year, British doctors used mixed reality glasses to perform a spinal operation. A nurse wore them to timely provide the surgeon with the necessary tools and monitor the actions of the doctors.

**The Quest for General Artificial Intelligence: A Double-Edged Sword**
According to a survey by the Future of Humanity Institute, the median estimate for when General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) will be achieved is around 2040, although opinions vary widely. A Metaculus survey of nearly 1,500 predictors expects it to be achieved by 2030. The pursuit of AGI has become the new space race of the 21st century, with companies, governments, and experts worldwide competing to develop an AI that can equal or surpass human capabilities. However, the question remains whether humanity is close to achieving this milestone and whether it is prepared for its potential consequences. Miguel López, director for the South of EMEA at Barracuda Networks, shares this view: 'Achieving General Artificial Intelligence is a complex and ambitious goal. While we will undoubtedly see significant progress, achieving a complete AGI in this decade could be overly optimistic.' The current state of AGI is that it is closer than ever, but still far away, with major tech companies investing heavily in its development. However, Europe seems to be lagging behind, with López stating: 'Currently, our role in this technology is basically that of a mere consumer.' The European Union's investment in AI research and development is estimated to be only 3,200 million euros, compared to the 20,000-30,000 million euros invested by the US and China. The article also highlights the need for global coordination to ensure the safe and beneficial development of AGI, as well as the potential risks and consequences of its creation.

**Mark Zuckerberg Predicts Smart Glasses Will Replace Smartphones by 2030**
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, predicts that by 2030, smart glasses will gradually replace smartphones as the primary technological platform. He compares this transition to the evolution of computers to mobile phones, suggesting that smart glasses will integrate more naturally into daily life, offering a more immersive and functional experience. Meta has advanced in this field with the development of the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which include a high-quality camera, microphones, and increased memory capacity, allowing functions such as taking photos, answering calls, and playing music without the need for a mobile phone. Zuckerberg notes that while smartphones will continue to exist, many users will opt for more advanced and comfortable devices, such as smart glasses, which will integrate multiple functions into a single device. He predicts that smart glasses will be the next major computing platform in the next decade, comparing this transition to the change between computers and mobile phones. 'I think it will be the next important computing platform, but each new platform doesn't tend to replace the previous one,' he said. 'What I think is going to happen with glasses is that we'll get to a point, probably by some time in 2030, where you'll have your phone with you, but it will stay in your pocket more often,' added the Meta CEO.
