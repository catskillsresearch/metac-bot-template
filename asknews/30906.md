**Kraken to allow trading of tokenized versions of Apple stocks - 9to5Mac**
Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is set to launch a new product called xStocks, which will allow users to trade tokenized versions of popular stocks like Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia. The xStocks tokens will be deployed on the Solana blockchain platform and will be backed by shares of the underlying security. According to Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi, 'There's a lot of friction' in international access to U.S. markets, and xStocks aim to fix this by offering instant settlement and around-the-clock global availability. Kraken is working with regulators in each region to avoid regulatory pressure, unlike Binance, which briefly offered tokenized stocks in 2021 but shut them down due to regulatory issues. The launch of xStocks marks a step towards putting U.S. stocks on the internet in a truly native way, making assets like Apple or Tesla tradable 24/7.

The move could support small-scale creator payouts on apps like Instagram. Executives say Meta is considering a multi-token strategy and is currently in 'learn mode.' This marks Meta's most significant crypto move since shelving its Diem project in 2022 amid regulatory pressure.

**Bitcoin just hit a new record after a long crypto slump**
Bitcoin has reached a new record high of $109,359.59, surpassing its previous high of January. The cryptocurrency has been steadily increasing in value since falling to $75,000 in March, and is up 16% in May. This rally comes as crypto becomes more accepted by U.S. regulatory bodies and the broader financial world. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon announced that its customers will soon be able to buy Bitcoin through the bank, while Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said the bank would issue its own stablecoin if a legal framework is established. Morgan Stanley has also begun allowing its financial advisors to pitch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds to certain clients. Coinbase has joined the S&P 500 stock index, and Tesla is a huge owner of Bitcoin, with an estimated $1.3 billion worth on its ledger.

**Bitcoin Surpasses Silver, Regains 7th Position as Most Valuable Asset**
Bitcoin has regained its position as the 7th most valuable asset in the world, according to CompaniesMarketCap data. The cryptocurrency has seen a significant increase in value over the past few hours, reaching as high as 5th place on the list. Despite some of the gains being reversed, the digital currency is still showing a notable recovery. The current market capitalization of the bitcoin is approximately $1.9 trillion, surpassing the value of silver. However, both assets are performing well, resulting in a swap of positions. The top 5 assets are currently led by gold with a market capitalization of $22 trillion, followed by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. The proximity of market capitalizations between Amazon, Google, silver, and bitcoin has led to constant changes in their rankings. The overall market is operating with increased optimism this week, benefiting these assets. The consolidation of bitcoin in this range also means that it has surpassed the market value of other giants, including Saudi Aramco and Meta. Additionally, the cryptocurrency has a higher market capitalization than several well-known companies, including Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, Tesla, and Walmart. Ethereum is the only other cryptocurrency in the top 100 most valuable assets, with a market capitalization of $216 billion and a ranking of 62.

**Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Resilient as Trump's 'Liberation Day' Unsettles Markets**
President Trump's 'Liberation Day' has arrived, with markets awaiting developments on U.S. tariffs. Despite a likely recession, as indicated by the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model projecting a -3.7% first-quarter contraction in U.S. real GDP, Bitcoin (BTC) remains resilient, trading little changed at above $85,000. This is in contrast to the 'Magnificent 7' tech stocks, which have fallen significantly from their all-time highs: Apple (17%), Microsoft (22%), Amazon (24%), Meta (25%), Google (26%), NVIDIA (32%), and Tesla (50%). Bitcoin's resilience is notable, particularly when compared to past cycles, where it fell 75% in 2022. This year, it has dropped 30%, a relative drawdown of 1.87 times compared to the Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ), which has fallen 16%. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik is reportedly in the crosshairs, with suggestions he may become the scapegoat for favoring overly aggressive tariffs. 'A lot hinges on the tariff announcement and how markets react,' according to the article.

**Trump's Crypto Surprise Move Brings Buyers Into Stock Market - Skeptics Abound - Anathema To Free Enterprise**
President Trump's surprise announcement of a strategic crypto reserve, including not only Bitcoin (BTC) but also Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), has sparked skepticism among investors. Many astute bitcoin bulls are concerned about the inclusion of smaller tokens due to volatility, liquidity, complexity, and higher risks. On the other hand, Trump supporters argue that including smaller tokens provides diversification and will help the U.S. gain technological leadership. The announcement has also raised concerns about the psychological impact on the dollar, as the U.S. owes a big part of its prosperity to the dollar being the world's reserve currency. The stock market has seen a boost in sentiment, with aggressive buying in speculative stocks, but The Arora Report analysis suggests that the probability of a correction in the stock market has increased after last week's events. Crypto-related stocks such as MicroStrategy Inc (MSTR), Coinbase Global Inc (COIN), and Robinhood Markets Inc (HOOD) are being aggressively bought, while money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (META), Microsoft Corp (MSFT), and Tesla Inc (TSLA). The Arora Report recommends considering a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges to protect oneself and participate in the upside at the same time.

**Bitcoin Supply Running Out, Analysts Predict Bullish Market**
Analysts in the crypto sector point out that the decrease in the supply of Bitcoin (BTC) on exchanges is a strong signal of accumulation for the long term and may fuel a bullish market. The supply of BTC is running out, with over 504 billion dollars in Bitcoin withdrawn from exchanges in the last five years. The interest of institutional investors in ETF Spot on $BTC is increasing, with a total net flow of 40 billion dollars. The reduction in supply could create sudden price movements upwards, with the potential to fuel a significant price increase. The context is further strengthened by the favorable policies towards cryptocurrencies adopted by President Donald Trump, who has declared the growth of the crypto ecosystem as a 'national priority', and the change of leadership in the American regulatory body, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The ETF Spot on Bitcoin have played a key role in the market dynamics, with giants like BlackRock managing 107 billion dollars in assets, setting a historic absolute record for the first year of launch. The financial instruments ETF and ETP have absorbed over 5% of the total supply of Bitcoin, accentuating the scarcity of the asset available. For 2025, an expansion of the ETF market is expected in other countries, especially in the Asian continent, with the launch of multi-asset funds that will offer exposure to a diversified basket of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Coalition Greenwich, part of S&P Global, has reported a strong interest from asset managers in these new instruments. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy, now Strategy₿, are also adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet as a strategic asset for value reserves. MicroStrategy is a leader in this field, with a current portfolio of 45.5 billion dollars in $BTC. Companies like GameStop, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are evaluating whether to integrate this strategy into their companies, marking a radical change in the interpretation of Bitcoin as an asset with intrinsic value. The combination of reduced supply and increasing demand may lead to a supply shock, with a consequent increase in prices. By December 2024, US ETFs on Bitcoin have bought almost three times the Bitcoin produced by miners in the same period, contributing to reaching a new high of 109,400 dollars on January 20, 2025. In general, analysts remain optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, with predictions of a bullish cycle that could push the price over 150,000 dollars by the end of 2025. This movement would be fueled by an increase in global monetary liquidity of 20 trillion dollars, of which 2 trillion dollars could be invested in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is emerging as one of the new generations of meme coins, distinguishing itself for its ability to combine the appeal of the sector with a concrete economic utility. Unlike the first meme coins, such as Dogecoin ($DOGE) or Shiba Inu ($SHIB), which based their success on community involvement and virality, $BTCBULL proposes a revolutionary concept, namely a direct link between Bitcoin rewards and the price movement of $BTC. The project is based on a system of pre-established price targets for $BTC, which reward $BTCBULL token holders every time they are reached, including airdrops and burning of the circulating supply. Burning of the supply: This process reduces the available supply of $BTCBULL, potentially creating a deflationary effect that could increase the value of the remaining tokens. $BTC airdrop as a reward: $BTCBULL holders receive free distributions of $BTC when key prices are reached, further incentivizing the maintenance of the token in the wallet. Currently, the pre-sale of the $BTCBULL token, accessible from the official website, has already reached 2.17 million dollars, with a cost of 0.00237 dollars, but only 48 hours remain before the next price increase in pre-sale.

**Cryptocurrencies Coming to X’s Payment Platform**
Elon Musk's plans for X's payment platform could shake up the stock market in 2025. Musk wants to integrate cryptocurrencies into X, which could increase their value. He has a history of influencing the crypto market, such as causing Dogecoin's price to rise after a single tweet. If payments on X become cheap and fast, it could affect rival companies like PayPal and Block. Additionally, Musk's plans for Tesla, such as promising autonomous robots as the company's main product, could also impact the stock market. Furthermore, Musk's role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could lead to federal budget cuts, affecting companies with government contracts. Investors should be aware of these potential market shifts and take a balanced approach to risk management.

**Elon Musk's X Money Gears Up for Crypto Adoption by Late 2025: Fireblocks Exec**
Payment giants are racing to adopt crypto strategies, with X Money likely to offer crypto payouts by the end of 2025, according to Fireblocks' Ran Goldi. The partnership between X Money and Visa has sparked speculation about the integration of cryptocurrency on the platform. Goldi stated, 'They fully expect that by the end of this year, X will probably have the ability to pay out in cryptocurrencies.' The growing demand for crypto payments in the gig economy and the potential for cross-border payments make X Money an attractive option for digital asset firms. However, regulatory questions arise, particularly with regards to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's oversight. Despite the uncertainty, industry insiders see the shift to crypto as inevitable.

**Nuvve to Accept Bitcoin as Payment and Create Reserve**
Nuvve, a US-based competitor of Tesla, announced that it will accept bitcoin as a form of payment and plans to create a reserve of the digital currency. The company, which focuses on electric vehicles, aims to modernize the grid and provide more efficient solutions for fleet management and energy storage. According to CEO Gregory Poilasne, 'The acceptance of BTC will promote more payment options for customers and suppliers with potentially less inherent transactional friction.' This move comes as the new Trump administration has shown favor towards the cryptocurrency market, and other government agencies, such as the SEC, have also expressed support. The news has sparked interest in whether Tesla will also resume accepting bitcoin as a form of payment, after previously announcing its intention to do so in 2021 but later suspending the move.
