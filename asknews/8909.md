**Target ALS Chooses PacBio HiFi Sequencing to Advance ALS Research with Largest Global Genomic Study to Date - Pacific Biosciences (NASDAQ:PACB)**
Target ALS has partnered with PacBio to launch the largest global whole genome sequencing initiative for ALS to date. The project aims to detect structural variants, repeat expansions, and other hard-to-detect genetic features that may underlie the disease. PacBio's HiFi sequencing will be used to sequence more than 6,000 genomes from people with ALS and healthy controls. The data will be openly shared via the Target ALS Data Engine, enabling researchers around the world to uncover disease mechanisms and explore new pathways to treatment. Dr. Amy Easton, Senior Director of Scientific Programs at Target ALS, said, '90% of ALS patients do not know the cause of their disease. We are combining two powerful approaches to discover new genetic causes of ALS - the first is to go out into communities to generate data from as many people with ALS as we can find, particularly those who would not be able to come into clinic to participate in research, and the second is to use a method of sequencing that allows us to'see' as much of the genome as is possible.' Dr. Manish Raisinghani, Chief Executive Officer at Target ALS, added, 'For most researchers, the expense of long-read sequencing is prohibitive and the ability to obtain human samples is limited. Target ALS sees it as our role to continue to lower the barriers and fill the gaps, enabling rapid discovery of new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.'
