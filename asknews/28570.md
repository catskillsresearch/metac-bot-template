**Gulf Countries to Maintain Low Inflation Rates, IMF Predicts**
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global inflation is expected to decline to 4.3% in 2025 and further to 3.6% by 2026, due to a slowdown in price pressures. The IMF predicts that advanced economies will see a return to target inflation rates, reaching 2.2% by 2026, while inflation in emerging markets and economies in transition is expected to decline to 4.6% during the same period. The high inflation expectations for 2025 are largely driven by the inflationary impact of the new tariff package, which has increased inflation forecasts for advanced economies by 40 basis points. In oil-exporting countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, inflation is expected to remain under control, below 2% in 2025 and 2026, with a projected annual growth rate of 1.9% in 2025 and 2026, a modest increase from the 1.6% recorded in 2024. In contrast, the Gulf region's oil-importing countries have seen a moderation in inflation rates due to a decline in food prices. However, some countries in the region continue to face ongoing inflationary pressures due to geopolitical tensions and a decline in local currency exchange rates, keeping inflation rates above historical averages. The IMF expects inflation in the Middle East and North Africa to decline from 14.6% in 2024 to 12.7% in 2025, before continuing to decline to 10.7% in 2026.

**Trump's strong economy defies gloomy Wall Street predictions of recession**
Despite predictions of a recession from economists and media pundits, the US economy continues to perform strongly. Analysts such as Peter Brezein and Mark Zandi predicted disaster, with a 75% and 40% chance of a recession respectively. However, the economy has defied these predictions, with egg prices decreasing by 53%, gas prices holding steady, and the number of jobs added in April exceeding expectations. James Mohs, an economics professor at the University of New Haven, said 'All these little metrics that we use to determine what a recession is - and there's a bunch of them -- are just not sitting there right now.' The Federal Reserve's GDPNow model predicts real gross domestic product growth of 2.3% in the second quarter of 2025, raising the possibility that a recession may not occur until early 2026. Other key indicators such as inflation and hiring remain strong, with the Consumer Price Index showing cooling prices and employers adding 177,000 jobs in April.

**Is a US recession imminent and what would be the impact on India? How should we manage a robust portfolio in this scenario?**
The US tariff policies have created economic uncertainty, potentially leading to a short-term recession due to delayed capital expenditure and cautious investment. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts reduced global growth, which could impact India's exports, manufacturing, and commodity prices. However, amidst this volatility, bonds have emerged as a promising asset class for investors seeking stable returns, allowing them to navigate the uncertain market landscape. As one might say, 'bonds offer a beacon of stability in turbulent times.'

**IMF Revises Global Growth Forecast Downward**
According to a report by 'Camco Invest', the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its growth forecast for the global economy, expecting a 2.8% growth rate in 2025 and 3% in 2026. The IMF has also revised its forecast for Kuwait's economy, expecting a 1.9% growth rate in 2024 and a 3.1% growth rate in 2025. The report attributes the revisions to the impact of recent trade policies, including the direct and indirect effects of these policies through trade links, as well as increased uncertainty and a decline in sentiment. The IMF has also revised its forecast for the Middle East and North Africa region, expecting a 2.6% growth rate in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026. The report notes that the revisions reflect a more gradual resumption of oil production, the continued indirect effects of conflicts, and slower-than-expected progress in structural reforms. According to data from the futures market, the average oil price is expected to be $66.94 per barrel in 2025 and $62.38 per barrel in 2026. The report also expects the advanced economies to experience a decline in growth, with revised forecasts of 1.4% and 1.5% for 2025 and 2026, respectively. The report notes that the revisions reflect significant downward revisions for Canada, Japan, the UK, and the US, while Spain has seen an upward revision.

**Analysis: Noise without direction in Washington with concern over tariff impact on the dollar**
The recent spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) in Washington was marked by confusion and uncertainty over economic policy and its impact. The main topic of discussion was the interference of US politics in the global economy. Economists found it difficult to separate the signal from the noise, but the exchange of ideas allowed for some conclusions to be drawn. The main concerns remain the impact of tariffs on the economy and financial assets, particularly the dollar. There is no certainty about the final levels of tariffs, the negotiation process, or what the US will demand from other countries to reduce them. Even the identity of the leaders of the negotiations is unclear. Jorge Sicilia, director of BBVA Research, stated, 'It is unlikely that agreements will be reached in three months. What is more likely is that we will see letters of intent, small concessions, and an extension of the deadline.' The meetings did serve to allow some delegations to set red lines, explain the impossibility of meeting some US demands, and for the private sector to express its concerns about investment and growth. Regarding the US economy, there are still doubts: recession, deceleration, and/or lower potential growth. The fiscal situation also raises concerns. As for the rest of the world, there are doubts about whether retaliation will occur, but above all, whether reforms will be made to sustain growth or reorient fiscal priorities. It is hoped that Europe will better exploit the single market, advance in the union of savings and investments, and increase its defense spending; although this is more of a hope than an expectation. China is perceived as being patient and wanting to project a position of strength. However, the presence of Chinese representatives was testimonial. Some common expectations include: the tariff shock will be inflationary in the US and deflationary in other countries; the US is seriously seeking to reindustrialize and will maintain tariffs, although lower than announced; the fight for rare materials and semiconductors will be intense; and there is no appetite in Congress for a fiscal correction this year. The focus on Europe was maximum: many think that this is a shock that forces them to react. Scott Bessent, Secretary of the Treasury, who now also co-leads commercial initiatives, has gained prominence and his messages about the future of the IMF and the WB have received much attention, as it was not impossible that the US would opt to abandon these institutions. The US is asking the IMF to return to its original mandate - cooperation, growth, avoiding exchange rate manipulation, and resolving balance of payments imbalances - and rejects that the Fund dedicate resources to parallel agendas such as climate change. The US also demands more rigor: it asks the Fund to denounce imbalances, even criticizing the US fiscal deficit (we will see if it receives the same sportsmanship for other criticisms of its policies) and to pressure countries with high external surpluses. This orientation of the IMF has been well received by many officials of the institution; pending details. The US is also asking the WB to prioritize energy, with a central role in reducing poverty and promoting development, and to support not only renewables but also nuclear and gas if they guarantee secure and affordable access. Additionally, it asks the WB to stop financing developed countries and to reform the bidding process, which it believes is dominated by distorted prices due to state subsidies. And it asks the WB to support the exclusion of companies from countries that have collaborated with Russia in the invasion of Ukraine from participating in its reconstruction. These demands show that there is a common denominator in the US: confronting China. This priority permeates trade, investment, control of international institutions, and energy policy. China and the rest of the world know this. This may reduce the noise, but not the concern. Changing such deep rules of the game requires a better strategy with more collaboration and much more time.

**The IMF’s Epitaph for the Descending Economic Uncertainty**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned of a volatile mix of rising tariffs, fractured alliances, and an unraveling consensus in the global economy. The IMF's World Economic Outlook has trimmed global growth to 2.8 percent for 2025 and 3 percent for 2026, citing the impact of new tariffs and their retaliatory counterparts. The IMF notes that the combined effect of these tariffs has already shaved nearly a full percentage point off global growth since January's estimates. The institution's cautious prose barely conceals the magnitude of concern, warning that sustained unpredictability in trade policy can undermine productivity, freeze investment, and stunt innovation. The IMF cuts its U.S. growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent, with tariffs alone accounting for 0.4 points of that downgrade. The IMF also notes a tightening of financial conditions, declining oil prices, and an investment pullback by firms bracing for further shocks. The IMF's prescription is a call for calm: restore trade stability, rekindle cooperation, and resist the allure of zero-sum logic. However, such appeals to multilateralism increasingly fall on deaf ears, and the global trading system now drifts rudderless as Washington turns inward and rivals scramble to adjust.

**Non-Investment Grade Debt Investment Value Emerges Amidst Market Uncertainty**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained its benchmark interest rate unchanged in its May FOMC meeting. Investment experts believe that Fed officials have acknowledged the increased risk of rising unemployment and inflation, limiting the Fed's ability to cut interest rates. Meanwhile, the US corporate default rate remains low, making high-yielding non-investment grade debt an attractive investment opportunity. According to the research team of the Kaye Chee US High Yield Non-Investment Grade Bond ETF (00945B), the market is in a state of high uncertainty, influenced by multiple factors, including the potential for a slowdown in short-term inflation, the upcoming July deadline for trade tariffs, and the 2026 US midterm elections. To mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and reduce the influence of trade policies on interest rate decisions, Kaye Chee Investment Trust recommends diversifying bond targets, shortening maturity periods, and increasing credit ratings. Given the low corporate default risk, investors can consider excluding CCC-rated non-investment grade debt and extending investment periods to better align with the goal of generating cash flow. Lee Zhongtai, manager of the Yee Chong US High Yield Non-Investment Grade Bond ETF, notes that the recent downward revisions to global economic growth forecasts by major investment banks and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have highlighted the challenges facing the economy, but the risk of recession remains controllable. He believes that the probability of low growth is high.

**US Economy on Brink of Recession: What Does it Mean for Costa Rica?**
The fear of a US recession has increased in recent weeks, with economists predicting a 60% chance of a recession this year. The US economy has been experiencing a contraction, with the first quarter of 2025 showing a decline. The war on tariffs initiated by President Donald Trump has injected uncertainty and distrust into the US economy and the global economy. According to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, the economy is 'on the brink of the precipice'. A survey of 167 economists from 50 countries found that 60% perceive a high or very high risk of a recession. However, some voices are more moderate, with Bank of America's CEO, Brian Moynihan, saying that a recession would be 'very mild'. Jerome Powell, head of the Federal Reserve, referred to the uncertainty surrounding the recession, saying 'we don't publish a forecast that evaluates how likely a recession is'. The IMF has reduced its growth forecast for the US from 2.7% to 1.8% and has also reduced its global growth forecast from 3.3% to 2.8%. Daniel Ortiz, director of Consejeros Económicos y Financieros, believes that a prolonged recession in the US is not the main scenario, but anticipates 'a year of slower growth, where inflation does not decrease as much as expected, and as a consequence, the world will grow more slowly'. This combination of factors would have 'direct and indirect impacts on the Costa Rican economy'. Costa Rica's economy is heavily dependent on the US, with 47% of its exports and 60% of its services exports going to the US. The country's tourism sector has also been affected, with a 7.3% decline in US tourists in February and a 0.9% decline in March. Ortiz said, 'everything indicates that 2025 will be a different year from what we saw in 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of GDP growth, exports, foreign direct investment, and some tourism'.

**IMF Warns of Global Recession: A Reconfiguration of the Global Economic Architecture is Needed**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released new projections for the global economy, showing a significant reduction in growth rates for 2025 and 2026 compared to previous projections. This reduction is particularly notable given the already modest growth rates in many economies, especially in advanced economies. The IMF notes that the growth rates in emerging economies, such as China and India, are also slowing down. The projections for 2025 show a substantial reduction in growth rates compared to 2024, which was not a notable year. The prospects for 2026 are more uncertain due to the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead. The situation in Europe is particularly dire, with a projected growth rate of 0.8% for the eurozone in 2024, compared to 1.8% for the US. Germany is projected to have a growth rate of 0% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, which could be considered a recession. France is also facing significant challenges, with a projected growth rate of 0.8% in 2025 and 1.0% in 2026. The IMF notes that the two economies are facing deep structural crises, reflecting their growing disconnection from the global economy. The latest data from the Bundesbank and the Bank of France confirm the bleak prospects for 2025, although there is some recovery expected in 2026. The Eurostat estimates for the eurozone and the EU are slightly more optimistic, but do not change the overall situation. The surprise comes from the US, where the latest data shows a contraction in economic activity of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, compared to a growth rate of 2.4% in the previous quarter. The contraction is attributed to an increase in imports and a reduction in government spending. However, there were increases in investment and exports that partially offset the declines in other components. The growth of non-resident investment, which increased by 9.8%, is particularly noteworthy. In conclusion, the IMF's projections suggest that the world is on the brink of a global recession, which could have devastating effects in the current context of widespread confrontation and collective irrationality. The IMF warns that the solution will require a reconfiguration of the global economic architecture.

**Infrastructure Development in Europe and US Has Stopped, Says Maxim Oreshkin**
According to Maxim Oreshkin, the deputy head of the Russian presidential administration, infrastructure development in Europe and the US has come to a halt, unlike the active projects in BRICS countries and the Global South. Oreshkin cited examples of large-scale initiatives, including the Northern Sea Route and China's 'One Belt, One Road' project. He emphasized that in Western countries, new projects are hardly being implemented, while BRICS and Global South countries are launching massive infrastructure programs. 'India needs to build 30 cities the size of Moscow to reach a medium level of urbanization. This is a colossal amount of investment,' Oreshkin noted. He added that the demographic potential of countries like Nigeria, Pakistan, and Ethiopia will drive global growth. China and Russia, although they will maintain their influence, will cede the dynamic to new leaders. This comes as Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, the world's largest investment company by assets, warned that the US economy has weakened so much that it may enter a recession. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) may also downgrade its forecast for global economic growth due to the trade tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

**Risk of Global Recession This Year is Very High, Say Economists**
Most economists from 50 countries in a Reuters survey believe that the risk of a global recession this year is very high. Just three months ago, the same group of respondents expected the global GDP to grow at high and sustainable rates. However, the trade policy of US President Donald Trump, who introduced tariffs on all imports to the US, has changed everything. Although Trump has suspended the highest tariffs for 90 days, the overall tariff remains at 10%, and a 145% tariff for China, the US's largest trading partner, remains in place. In the current state of extreme uncertainty, companies are finding it difficult to predict what will happen even in July, let alone plans for the year or five years, said James Rossiter, head of global macroeconomic strategy at TD Securities. Many have either withdrawn or reduced their income forecasts. In a rare display of unity, none of the over 300 respondents said that tariffs had a positive impact on business sentiment. Instead, 92% said it had a 'negative' effect, while only 8% (mainly from India and other developing countries) called it 'neutral'. Three-quarters of economists have lowered their forecast for global economic growth in 2025. The average figure has fallen to 2.7% from 3.0% in the January survey. For comparison, the current forecast of the International Monetary Fund is 2.8%. When asked about the risk of a global recession this year, 60% of respondents (101 out of 167) said it was high or very high. Sixty-six respondents considered it low, including four who said 'very low'. 'It's very difficult to look at economic growth with optimism in these conditions,' said Timothy Graf, head of macroeconomic strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa on Wall Street. Even if the tariffs are removed today, it would still cause significant damage, he added, as the reputation of the US as a reliable participant in bilateral and multilateral agreements, from trade to joint defense, has been undermined.

**World Economy Faces Uncertainty Due to Trade Tensions**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its growth projections for the world economy in 2025 and 2026 due to increased trade tensions, which are causing uncertainty and impacting consumption and investment decisions. The IMF now projects a growth rate of 2.8% in 2025, down from 3.3%, and 3% in 2026, down from 3.3%. This would be the slowest pace of activity since the COVID-19 pandemic. The main reason for the pessimism is the escalation of the trade war triggered by the United States under the administration of Donald Trump. The new import tariffs, especially against Chinese goods, have sparked retaliations, such as China's restrictions on the export of rare minerals. This dynamic threatens global supply chains, which are highly integrated. The IMF notes that the tariffs represent a negative shock to supply. In the current reality of integrated production, intermediate goods cross multiple borders before becoming final products. Sectoral disruptions can spread quickly, increasing costs for companies and consumers. Financial institutions are reevaluating credit offers, fearing exposure to an unstable environment. The IMF estimates that the risks of a global recession have risen from 17% to 30%, although it still dismisses a general contraction. In addition to the loss of production, costs will materialize in a slower decline in inflation, whose projection was raised to 4.3% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026, with notable increases in the US (to 3% this year, down from 2% previously forecast). However, there is some hope for accommodation through the negotiation of new trade agreements between Washington and other regions. The negotiations, according to the American delegation at the IMF meeting, are underway to reduce the country's $1 trillion annual trade deficit. For a sustainable solution, however, it will be necessary to act on other fronts and in a spirit of cooperation, a trait that is currently scarce. In the case of the US, reducing the fiscal deficit is urgent, but not yet visible. Similarly, there is skepticism about the stimuli adopted to expand internal demand in the regions that are currently trade surpluses, such as Germany and China. For Brazil, the IMF has revised its growth projections for the PIB from 2.2% to 2% in 2025 and 2026, in any case a deceleration compared to the pattern of the last years. Among the bottlenecks pointed out are persistent inflation, estimated at 5.3% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026, and the galloping increase in public debt. The moment requires caution, and the Lula da Silva government (PT) should act with this premise in mind. The insistence on expansionary spending measures will be an error that unfortunately the Planalto still minimizes.'

**Could Trump be leading the world into recession?**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sharply downgraded growth forecasts for the US and other advanced economies due to the uncertainty and turmoil in financial markets caused by US President Donald Trump's economic policy. The IMF predicts a sharp reduction in world economic growth in 2025 and 2026, but not a recession - for now. However, the chances of a global recession have risen sharply from 17% to 30%, and there is now a 40% chance of a recession in the US. The head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, has blamed the slowdown on the ongoing 'reboot of the global trading system' by the US, which is leading to downgrades in growth estimates and volatility in financial markets. The forecast underscores that the era of rapid globalisation is coming to an end, and the Trump administration's answer to this is massive tariff increases, which have several contradictory objectives, including raising money to pay for tax cuts and encouraging manufacturers to relocate to the US. Trump has swung between these objectives, and backed down when market reaction became too fierce, destabilising trade and investment, as well as business and consumer confidence. The IMF warns that the inflationary effect of tariffs could reverse the recent successes of central banks in taming inflation, and even force them to raise interest rates - something Trump is fiercely against.

**Tariffs to cause major shock but no recession, says IMF**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that trade tariffs will cause a significant shock to global growth, but not a recession. The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report predicts global growth to be lower than previously estimated, at 2.8 per cent in 2025 and 3 per cent in 2026. The report also notes that 'intensifying downside risks' and 'more elevated trade policy uncertainty' could further reduce near- and long-term growth outlook. The IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, stated, 'While many of the scheduled tariff increases are on hold for now, the combination of measures and countermeasures has hiked US and global tariff rates to centennial highs.' He added, 'For this reason, we expect that the sharp increase on April 2nd in both tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a significant slowdown in global growth in the near term.' The report also notes that the probability of a recession occurring in 2025 is 37 per cent.

**IMF Warns of Decreased Economic Expectations Due to Escalating Trade Tensions**
According to Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the escalation of trade tensions and the profound changes in the global trade system will lead to a decrease in economic expectations, but a global recession is unlikely. Georgieva stated, 'Economies are facing tough tests at a time when the global trade system is being reshaped by US tariffs and responses from China and the EU.' She added that this has led to 'unprecedented' uncertainty in trade policy and extreme volatility in financial markets. Georgieva noted that 'disturbances come with costs.' The IMF's new growth forecasts will include significant downward revisions, but not a recession. The forecasts will also include the possibility of higher inflation in some countries. Georgieva warned that the increased uncertainty has increased the risk of financial market pressures, saying, 'Everyone will suffer if the financial situation worsens.' The IMF previously forecasted a 3.3% global economic growth in 2025 and 2026.

**IMF: Tariffs will not spark global recession but will weaken economy**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that surging US tariffs will weaken the global economy and push up inflation this year, but not cause a worldwide recession. According to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, the import taxes will slow global growth, but the world economy's resilience is being tested by the 'reboot of the global trading system'. Georgieva echoed some Trump administration concerns, calling on countries to reduce their tariffs and lower other barriers to trade. She noted that tariffs cause uncertainty, which can be costly, and that increased trade barriers tend to immediately impact growth. The IMF forecast the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, but warned that the outlook is clouded by President Donald Trump's policies, including tax cuts and increased tariffs on foreign imports. Global inflation is forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026, but the IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that Trump's policies are likely to push inflation higher in the near term. The IMF will release the details of their global economic outlook on Tuesday.

**World economy should avoid recession: IMF - RTHK**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva stated that the global economy is likely to avoid a recession despite the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariff rollout. However, the IMF expects 'notable' markdowns to growth due to the trade disruptions. Georgieva emphasized that uncertainty is costly, rising trade barriers hit growth upfront, and protectionism erodes productivity over the long run. She called on countries to 'put their own houses in order' by adjusting fiscal policies and maintaining an 'agile and credible' monetary policy. According to prepared remarks, Georgieva said, 'This is a reminder that we live in a world of sudden and sweeping shifts,' and 'And it is a call to respond wisely.' The IMF will use its upcoming World Economic Report to pare back its previous forecast for global growth to hit 3.3 percent in 2025 and 2026.

**Is a recession looming?**
The global economy is facing a high risk of recession, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) revising its global growth forecasts downward to 3.1% for 2025 and 3.0% for 2026. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank also anticipate global growth to remain below the historical average, with the IMF projecting 3.3% and the World Bank foreseeing 2.7% growth over the same period. Escalating trade tensions, intensified by US tariff policies, are a major catalyst of this instability, eroding investment confidence and curbing household spending. The OECD warns that protectionist measures may usher in an era of prolonged stagnation and financial volatility, casting a long shadow over global prosperity. Pakistan's economy is particularly vulnerable to a global recession, with risks of eroding trade, dwindling remittances, and capital flight threatening to weaken the rupee, widen the deficit, and intensify inflation.
