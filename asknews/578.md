**ChatGPT Predicts Humans Will Be Irrelevant by 2100**
ChatGPT, a conversational AI, was asked about the fate of humanity by the year 2100 and responded, 'Yes, but they will be irrelevant.' According to ComputerHoy, this response is precise, as technology will continue to advance, bringing us closer to what was once considered science fiction. The AI does not foresee a physical or biological collapse of the human species or a large-scale extinction. However, it does predict that humans will have minimal influence in key processes by the year 2100. This statement is not optimistic, as the AI does not envision a future of prosperity or ethical progress, but rather a species that has been marginalized from the center of the system it created. 'In a time marked by automation and the increasing delegation of decisions, it's not surprising that we start to question the place of people in the next few decades,' says ComputerHoy. 'The future is already a cultural and philosophical question.'

**Elon Musk Predicts Earth's Destruction by the Sun; Human Extinction in 1.080 Million Years**
Elon Musk has predicted that the Earth will be destroyed by the Sun when it expands and explodes as a Supernova in space. According to NASA and the University Tōhō of Japan, the human extinction will occur in approximately 1,080 million years due to the decrease of oxygen levels on Earth caused by the Sun's increasing brightness and heat. However, another study suggests that the extinction will occur in 1,000,002,021, when the Sun will have expanded and the temperatures will have risen. Musk believes that the best option to preserve humanity is to migrate to Mars, which he is currently investigating to establish a new civilization. 'Eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the Sun. The Sun expands gradually, so at some point, we will need to be a multi-planetary civilization because the Earth will be incinerated,' he predicted. 'Mars is a safeguard for collective life (...) We have a long way to go because it's not just about landing on Mars and leaving flags and footprints,' Musk said. 'So that's the key point in the future where the fate of life, as we know it, will be affected forever, when Mars becomes self-sufficient,' he added.

**The Mysterious Case of the Neanderthals: Why Did They Go Extinct?**
Recent research has revealed that the history of human evolution is more complex than previously thought. The Neanderthals, who were once considered to be a primitive species, are now seen as being closely related to modern humans. In fact, studies have shown that Neanderthals and modern humans shared a common ancestor in Africa, dating back 50 million years. The two species are also found to have had physical and cultural similarities, with Neanderthals having complex cognitive abilities and even interbreeding with modern humans. It is estimated that 1-4% of modern human DNA is derived from Neanderthals. The question remains as to why Neanderthals went extinct, with some scientists suggesting that they may have been absorbed into the modern human population. However, the exact circumstances of their extinction remain a mystery. As one scientist notes, 'There is still something fascinating about Neanderthals that continues to capture our imagination. They lived for tens of thousands of years, and then suddenly disappeared, replaced entirely by modern humans.'

**The Irrelevance of Humans: A Conversation with ChatGPT**
A recent conversation with ChatGPT, an AI, revealed a concerning prediction about the future of humanity. According to the AI, humans will continue to exist in 2100, but will become 'irrelevant'. This means that they will no longer be necessary to sustain the functioning of the planet, as they will lose the ability to influence key processes such as knowledge, production, and power. The AI explained that this is not due to a malicious intention, but rather a natural consequence of the increasing efficiency of automated systems. As these systems take over decision-making with greater precision and accuracy, the role of humans becomes redundant. This transition has already begun, with automation taking over tasks such as customer service, logistics, and financial analysis. In the future, the AI predicts that automation will extend to education, politics, urban planning, and art creation. This will lead to a gradual cession of control, with humans no longer at the center of the system. As Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, warned, the danger of AI lies not in its malicious intentions, but in its extreme efficiency. A machine does not need consciousness to alter the global order; it simply needs to function better than humans, and control will be lost. Suleyman identifies four areas of risk: cyberattacks on vulnerable infrastructure, pandemics generated by synthetic biology, unregulated AI, and accelerated geopolitical fragmentation due to technology.

**Will Humanity be Irrelevant by 2100?**
Chatgpt, an AI, was asked if humanity will arrive at 2100 and its response was 'yes, but they will be irrelevant.' This statement should not be understood as a prophecy, but as a reflection of our own fears projected in technology. The AI does not speak of a physical or biological collapse of the human species, but of a species that has been removed from the center of the system that she herself built. According to the AI, this transition has already begun and we can see it in sectors such as customer service or logistics, which are already being absorbed by automated systems. In the next 50 years, this process could affect education, politics, urban planning and even creativity. The AI explains that irrelevance refers to the loss of capacity for influence in the planet's operational structures, and that humans will continue to exist biologically, but will cease to be the main agents of change, knowledge and control. The AI also states that humans will not be replaced by a single entity, but by an interconnected machines ecosystem, autonomous algorithms and adaptive systems that will operate with less margin of error, lower emotional bias and higher speed.

**The big idea: could the English language die?**
Linguist Martin Haspelmath suggests that English, like Egyptian, could eventually die as a language. However, predicting the future of any language is challenging due to the complex and interacting forces that influence it. Migration, technology, and literacy are key drivers of language change, but the configuration of the linguistic landscape is susceptible to black swan events. Experts agree that English will still be spoken in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand, but its dominion may shrink, and its internal evolution may lead to the emergence of new variants. West African Pidgin, a creole influenced by English, is expected to have 400 million speakers by 2100, and Nigerian and Indian colloquialisms may enter 'standard' English. The vocabulary of a language tends to evolve faster than its grammar or phonology, and the impact of migration and technology on English is difficult to anticipate. Ultimately, even the world's first global language is not immune to extinction, and English may eventually go the way of Latin and Egyptian.

**The Purgatorius: The Earliest Known Primate and Ancestor of Humans**
According to Will Newton, a researcher at Manchester University, the purgatorius, a small mammal that lived 66-63 million years ago, is the earliest known primate. It is considered the ancestor of modern primates, including humans. Purgatorius was smaller than most modern primates, measuring 15 cm in length and weighing around 35 grams. It was more similar to a squirrel than a monkey, with a pointed nose, long, low-slung body, and bushy tail. Newton notes that these characteristics are thought to have been inherited from the last common ancestor of rodents and primates, which likely lived just a few million years before the purgatorius. The purgatorius is believed to have given rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens through many thousands of years of evolution, with many intermediate species in between. Newton suggests that the purgatorius went extinct due to climate change and habitat loss, as well as the emergence of more adaptable primates. The first fossils of the purgatorius were discovered in 1965 in eastern Montana, USA, where it lived in large subtropical forests around 63 million years ago. Newton notes that the purgatorius had teeth similar to those of modern primates, setting it apart from other mammals of its time. 'It was a great day when we discovered the purgatorius,' Newton said, 'because it showed us the origins of the primates, including humans.'

**Stephen Hawking's Warning about Human Extinction Confirmed by NASA**
Stephen Hawking's warning about the potential disappearance of humanity has found partial confirmation at NASA. In 2017, Hawking stated on the Tencent WE forum in Beijing that by 2600, the planet would become a 'scorched earth' and people should prepare for a catastrophe. His conclusions were based on an analysis of data on growing resource consumption and deepening environmental crisis. While NASA agrees with Hawking's concerns, they disagree with his exact date. NASA experts confirmed that, at current rates of natural resource exploitation, humanity faces a threat to its existence. Moreover, their calculations suggest that unlimited resource consumption could bring about a global environmental catastrophe sooner than predicted.

**Scientist Warns of Risk of New Mass Extinction: 'Greatest and Most Rapid the Planet Has Ever Seen'**
Hugh Montgomery, director of the Centre for Human Health and Performance at University College London, warned of the risk of a new mass extinction on Earth if the effects of climate change are not reversed. According to Montgomery, the process is already underway and the extinction could be 'the greatest and most rapid the planet has ever seen, and we are causing it.' He stated that the scenario could be similar to the Permian extinction period (299-251 million years ago), where about 90% of species disappeared due to extreme planetary conditions. Montgomery estimated that the catastrophic scenario could be reached if the global average temperature reaches 3°C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, the planet recorded a record increase of 1.5°C. He warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the increase could reach 2.7°C by 2100. Montgomery emphasized that 'if we continue to hit the base of this unstable column on which we are supported, the human species itself will be threatened.' He also noted that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is not only increasing, but doing so at an increasingly rapid rate, with 54.6 billion tons of CO2 equivalent emitted in 2024, a 1% increase from the previous year.

**Climate Crisis May Cause New Mass Extinction, Warns Researcher**
Renowned researcher Hugh Montgomery warns that if the effects of climate change are not reversed, the Earth may experience a mass extinction similar to the Permian extinction event (299-251 million years ago), where 90% of species were unable to survive the drastic conditions. Montgomery, director of the Centre for Human Health and Performance at University College London, emphasizes that this extinction is already occurring, 'the greatest and fastest extinction the planet has ever seen, and we are causing it.' However, the death of species could reach catastrophic levels if the global average temperature increase reaches 3°C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, a record increase of 1.5°C was reached, and scientists estimate that if current actions are maintained, especially regarding greenhouse gas emissions, the increase will reach 2.7°C by 2100. Montgomery stresses that if we continue to 'hit the base of this unstable column we are standing on,' the human species will be threatened. He also warns of other drastic consequences, such as an abrupt collapse of the Arctic ice layers, which would cause a significant slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Circulation, leading to a sea level rise of several meters, with catastrophic consequences. He emphasizes the need for immediate action to reduce pollution and adapt to climate change, which is already affecting human health today, but cannot be done at the expense of a drastic and immediate reduction in emissions, as 'it doesn't make sense to focus only on symptom relief when we should be seeking a cure.'

**Countdown to Extinction: Why Humanity May Be Doomed by 2050**
According to a study by the World One supercomputer, human civilization may be on the brink of extinction by 2040-2050 due to the cumulative effects of human activity. The four main factors contributing to this are overpopulation, global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental pollution. If current trends continue, climate change and resource depletion will make the Earth uninhabitable for humans by the mid-21st century. While some experts criticize the supercomputer for oversimplifying complex processes, many agree with its conclusions. The growing frequency of natural disasters and the increasing scarcity of oxygen and drinking water are seen as major causes of human extinction. Even if immediate action is taken to mitigate these factors, the global population may still decline to 19th-century levels by the given timeframe. Researchers emphasize that if humans do survive, they will have to adapt to a new world with different conditions. Climate expert Alexander Chernokulsky notes that water scarcity is a pressing issue that may threaten humanity in the near future. He also warns that sea levels may rise by 12-15 cm by mid-century and 40-60 cm by the end of the century. In contrast, climate expert Nikolai Tereshonok believes that the predictions of imminent human extinction are exaggerated. However, he acknowledges that reversing the situation is now extremely difficult and emphasizes the need to continue fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to alternative energy sources.

**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**
British paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species. 'If we make a concerted effort to expand into the Universe, we could 'live -- potentially -- for millions of years,' he says. However, he warns that if we don't take action, 'there might be no one left on the Earth for you to wave back to.'

**Future Humans: A Hunched Back, Smaller Brain, and Claws - Scientists Predict**
Scientists have created a 3D model of a person in 2100, named MinDi, to show how human appearance will change due to technological advancements. According to the study, people living in 2100 may have a hunched back from constant smartphone and computer use, a smaller brain, and hands resembling claws. Experts also predict that people will develop a double eyelid to protect their eyes from harmful light. 'Prolonged phone use strains the neck and throws the spine out of balance, causing the neck muscles to work harder to support the head,' said Caleb Buke, an expert on health and well-being who created the model. 'Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end also means that your torso is stretched forward, rather than being upright.' The study also notes that a similar phenomenon occurred around 110,000 years ago, when our prehistoric ancestors faced a catastrophic population decline, known as a 'genetic bottleneck,' which threatened their survival.

**Extinction Looms: Animals May Disappear by 2100**
A group of international scientists has presented a comprehensive study on the threat of animal extinction. According to the data published in the BioScience journal, many species may disappear from the face of the Earth in the next 100 years due to human intervention and climate change. Scientists warn that if urgent measures are not taken, by 2100, we will only see these animals on pictures: 'If we don't take measures to protect these animals, they will become part of history, like mammoths or dinosaurs,' researchers said. Interestingly, while some species disappear, new ones emerge, differing in size, color, behavior, and having increased survival rates in changed conditions. However, this does not compensate for the loss of unique representatives of the fauna that exist today. Researchers are confident that if the situation is not changed, in a few generations, people will study the Bengal tiger in the same way as they now study the triceratops.

**10-40% of Species Could Become Extinct by 2100 Due to Global Warming: Professor Vaipayee**
According to Professor Vaipayee, 10-40% of species could become extinct by 2100 if global warming causes a temperature increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius. This problem will become even more severe due to ocean acidification and rapid environmental changes. At the IIT Dhanbad, a lecture on collective extinction: past, present, and future was organized under the Centenary Lecture series. Professor Vaipayee said, 'Historically, there have been five major extinction events on Earth: Ordovician, Devonian, Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous. These have had a profound impact on the Earth's biodiversity.' He warned that the current era is facing the sixth mass extinction, known as the Holocene or Anthropocene extinction, mainly due to human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation of species, and climate change. He stated that the current extinction rate is 100 to 1,000 times higher than the natural background rate, posing a severe threat to global ecosystems.

**Elon Musk Warns of Human Extinction in Europe and Asia if Birth Rates Don't Increase**
Elon Musk believes that humans will become extinct in Asia and Europe if birth rates do not increase. He made this statement in a post on the 'X' platform, in response to a proposal by Swedish journalist Peter Emanuelson, who suggested that tax exemptions for mothers in Europe should be implemented to encourage more children. Musk said, 'This is worth trying, we need to change something, or Europe and Asia and all the earth will disappear!' Musk has previously called for an increase in births to ensure the survival of humanity, saying 'If we don't increase births, the world will come to an end.' This warning comes after predictions that the world's population will decline for the first time in 2100, which will have significant economic and social impacts, according to the British Daily Express. Finally, the world's richest man, Musk, confirmed that 'people should have more children to ensure the survival of humans.'

Something needs to change or Europe and Asia (and most of Earth) will disappear!' Musk, who has 11 children with three women, is actively working to prevent human extinction. According to a report by 'The Lancet', by 2050, more than three-quarters of the world's countries and territories (155 out of 204) will no longer have a sufficient birth rate to ensure normal population replacement. By 2100, this problem is expected to occur in 198 countries and territories, with 54% of the world's births occurring in Africa south of the Sahara desert. To ensure population replacement, the total fertility rate needs to be approximately 2.1, but 'The Lancet' predicts a rate of 1.8 by 2050 and 1.6 by 2100. Only six countries (Chad, Niger, Samoa, Somalia, Tajikistan, and Tonga) are expected to have a rate above 2.1 by the end of the century, while 13 countries will have a rate below 1.0. Western Europe is expected to have a rate of 1.44 by 2050 and 1.37 by 2100.

**Elon Musk Predicts 'Extinction' of Europe and Asia if Birth Rates Don't Increase**
Elon Musk has predicted that Europe and Asia will 'go extinct' if humanity fails to increase birth rates. Musk commented on a proposal by Swedish journalist Peter Emanuelson to introduce tax exemptions for women in Europe to encourage more children. Musk said, 'It's worth a try. We need to change something, or Europe and Asia, and most of the Earth, will disappear!' According to him. Earlier, Musk called for increased birth rates to ensure the continuation of humanity, 'or the world will end.' His warning comes after predictions that the world's population will decline for the first time in 2100, with significant economic and social impacts, according to the British Daily Express newspaper. Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of Tesla, believes that 'people need to have more children to ensure the survival of the human species.' In April, Musk described the sharp decline in the number of young Americans having children over the past 30 years as a 'complete disaster' for the United States. In December, Musk said that Germany and Europe are on the brink of extinction due to low birth rates.
