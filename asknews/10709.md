**EU Countries Approve Plans for CO2 Border Taxes**
The 27 EU member states have agreed to the European Commission's plans to exempt most companies in Europe from the planned CO2 border taxes starting from 2026, according to the European Union's Council. The relevant ministers approved the proposed changes at a meeting in Brussels. The EU states still need to negotiate the final details with the European Parliament. The European Parliament had previously signaled its support for exempting more than 90% of companies from the taxes. The new EU system, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), will only cover companies that import more than 50 tons of goods per year. However, this would still account for 99% of the emissions generated by imported products, as previously stated in a draft. The CO2 border taxes aim to protect European companies from unfair competition from countries that do not charge climate protection fees. The EU requires companies in the EU to balance the CO2 emissions in imported goods through the tax. This should also prevent the relocation of production to non-European countries. The taxes will be paid through emissions certificates, which importers must purchase in Europe. It is expected that importers will demand price discounts from their suppliers in China, South America, or the US, or switch to European products, which are already burdened with the purchase of CO2 pollution rights. Initially, CO2-intensive goods such as cement or steel will be affected, but the scope is expected to be expanded to all industrial goods by 2030.

**Global Times: Why China, as a developing nation, still committed to carbon reductions?**
China remains committed to reducing carbon emissions, despite some developed countries abandoning their efforts. According to a reader on people.cn, 'Some media reports suggest that certain developed countries have already abandoned their carbon reduction efforts. As a developing country, why does China still remain committed to cutting carbon emissions?' China's commitment to carbon reduction is driven by its own desire to upgrade its economic development model, said Li Changan, a professor at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies at the University of International Business and Economics. 'The country is shifting away from a resource-intensive and extensive growth approach toward one that is innovation-driven and efficiency-oriented. This transformation naturally brings higher environmental standards, including stricter targets for emission reductions, making decarbonization a strategic necessity,' he said. China has made significant progress in optimizing its energy mix, with significant growth in hydropower, nuclear, wind, and solar power generation. The country has also built the world's largest and most complete new-energy industrial chain, and its exports of wind and solar products have helped other countries reduce carbon emissions by approximately 810 million tones in 2023. Carbon reduction is conducive to driving China's green and low-carbon transition and ensuring sustainable development, and is an inherent requirement for promoting high-quality development.

**Are Countries' New Climate Plans Ambitious Enough? What We Know So Far**
The World Resources Institute analyzed the initial submissions of countries' new climate commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), for 2025. The results show that while some countries, such as the U.S., U.K., and Brazil, have made ambitious commitments, many others, including major emitters like the EU and China, have yet to submit their NDCs. The analysis found that the new NDCs submitted so far have made a noticeable but modest dent in the 2035 'emissions gap', with a projected reduction of 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 compared to 2030. However, this is far from what's needed to keep global warming within safe limits, and many countries, including developed and wealthy economies, have not strengthened their 2030 targets. The analysis also found that some countries, such as the U.K. and Brazil, have set ambitious targets, while others, such as Canada, have made only marginal increases to their targets. The report concludes that much greater ambition and action are needed to narrow the emissions gap and keep global temperature goals within reach.

**Three Studies That Give Us Hope**
Three recent studies have provided positive news that can boost our morale. Firstly, a study of nearly nine million deaths in the US found that taxi and ambulance drivers have a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. The researchers believe that the constant changes in their environment may activate the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for spatial orientation and memory. Secondly, a team of scientists from the Austrian Academy of Sciences has successfully developed brain organoids without using animal testing, allowing them to study the development of the corpus callosum, a brain structure involved in information exchange between the two hemispheres. Finally, China has reported a decrease in CO2 emissions for the first time, thanks to the expansion of renewable energy sources. According to the climate research portal Carbon Brief, China's CO2 emissions decreased by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year, despite increasing electricity demand. 'This shows that climate protection is possible if the right political measures are taken,' said the researchers. 'It is a hopeful message for a better future.'

**China Unveils Climate Change Standard System, Japan Relaxes Offshore Wind Power Regulations**
China has released a plan to build a climate change standard system, which includes three aspects: basic capacity, reducing climate change, and adapting to climate change. The plan aims to promote the development of green energy and reduce carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the country has launched a fourth round of ecological environment protection inspections, focusing on five provinces and three state-owned enterprises. In other news, Japan plans to relax its regulations on offshore wind power development, allowing for longer project periods and clearer rules for non-Japanese ships. In a separate incident, a chemical plant in Shandong province exploded, killing five people and injuring six. The company's founder, Li Zhen Guo, has resigned as CEO and chairman, and will focus on research and development. China has also seen an increase in sandstorms, with 2060 days of sandstorms in the first four months of 2025, a 24% increase from the same period last year. The main reasons for the increase are drought, high temperatures, and strong winds.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**Spatiotemporal evolution of agricultural carbon emissions intensity in China and analysis of influencing factors - Scientific Reports**
This study analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of agricultural carbon emissions intensity in China from 2001 to 2022. The results showed a significant downward trend in agricultural carbon emissions intensity across all provinces, with a notable decrease in the northwestern and northeastern regions. The study also found that the western region exhibited a double-peak phenomenon in agricultural carbon emissions intensity, with some provinces experiencing extremely high emissions while others had notably low levels. The national kernel density curve showed a mild trailing phenomenon after 2019, attributed to the significant influence of the western region. The study employed the natural breakpoint classification method to categorize agricultural carbon emissions into low, medium, high, and very high levels, resulting in a spatial distribution map that showed a pattern of 'high in the west and low in the east, high in the north and low in the south'. The study also found that the eastern region took the lead in realizing the eco-friendly transformation of agricultural production mode, while the central and western regions gradually adjusted to the direction of diversified and efficient agricultural industrial structure. The study used the GTWR model to explore the influencing factors of agricultural carbon emission reduction in China and found that financial support, R&D intensity, degree of openness, level of human capital, level of urbanization, and level of technology market development were significant factors. The study also found that the average regression coefficient for financial support regarding agricultural carbon emissions intensity was 2.4809, indicating that financial support significantly promotes agricultural carbon emissions intensity, but its effectiveness in promoting emissions is weakening annually. The study plotted the spatial distribution of regression coefficients from the GTWR model and found that financial support had a negative impact on agricultural carbon emissions intensity only in Heilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, while all other regions exhibited positive coefficients.

**China's Emissions Peak: A New Era in the Fight Against Global Warming?**
China, the world's largest CO2 emitter, has seen a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Lauri Myllyvirta, a China analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), if current trends in renewable energy growth, electric vehicle sales, and energy demand continue, the conditions for a structural emissions peak are in place. This means that renewable energy will grow so strongly that it will meet the increasing demand for electricity and displace fossil fuels. In the first quarter of 2025, Chinese companies and consumers demanded 2.5% more electricity than in the previous year, but emissions from electricity generation decreased by 5.8% due to less coal and gas being burned. China has built wind and solar power plants with a capacity of 80 GW and 278 GW, respectively, in 2024, which is two-thirds of the world's installed capacity. The Chinese government's goal is to reach an emissions peak by 2030. However, the government's approach to achieving this goal is not through a high CO2 price, but through massive subsidies combined with a hard competition between domestic companies. Claudia Kemfert, an energy economist at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), says that the 'but China' argument is always wrong and that Chinese companies have been 'aggressively' pursuing green markets. She suggests that the argument should be changed to 'look at China' instead of 'but China'. The Chinese government seems to have a business model for a 'sustainable' CO2 reduction, says Wanyuan Song, a China expert at CarbonBrief. The central government in Beijing sets the plans, while the provincial and city governments are responsible for implementation, which can lead to data manipulation. Myllyvirta says that he has no trust in individual data sources and therefore uses data from multiple sources. Despite China's efforts to reduce emissions, the country will likely miss its goal of reducing CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by over 65% compared to 2005 by 2030. Kemfert says that China needs to stop building coal-fired power plants on a large scale to meet the Paris Agreement targets. The Chinese government must fill the gap left by the US withdrawal from the agreement.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**China's Carbon Emissions Decrease by 1.6% in Q1 2025**
According to a study, China's carbon emissions decreased by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025, reaching 150 billion tons of CO2 equivalent. This decline is attributed to the growth of clean energy production, despite a 2.5% increase in electricity demand. The study notes that 'clean energy production has grown faster than the average growth rate of current and long-term electricity demand, leading to a decrease in fossil fuel usage[...]If this trend continues, it will indicate that China's energy sector emissions will peak and decline.' The study also credits the Trump trade war for China's economic shift towards domestic consumption. China added 277 GW of solar power capacity, a new record high. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China is expected to account for nearly 60% of global renewable energy capacity expansion by 2030. However, the study warns that China's carbon emissions still have a significant impact, with a projected 120 billion tons of CO2 equivalent by 2023, surpassing the US (60 billion tons) and India (41 billion tons). The Energy and Climate Change Air Research Center notes that China can do better.

**China's CO2 emissions have started falling - is this finally the peak?**
China's carbon dioxide emissions have declined by 1% over the past 12 months, despite an increase in power demand, according to an analysis by Lauri Myllivirta at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. This is a significant sign that China's massive buildout of clean energy is displacing fossil fuels. However, emissions could still surge again due to factors such as hot summers, droughts, and the Trump administration's tariffs. To sustain the decline, China will need to build hundreds of gigawatts per year of new clean power generation, which will depend on the targets set in its next five-year plan and the pledges made under the Paris agreement. Myllivirta says, 'That, of course, means the current fall in emissions has a much better chance of being sustained.' He also notes that a sustained drop in emissions would indicate that China has passed peak emissions, several years ahead of its 2030 target.

**China Sees Decrease in CO2 Emissions in First Quarter of 2025**
China has seen a decrease in CO2 emissions in the first quarter of 2025, thanks to the growth of renewable energy, despite a significant increase in electricity demand. This is a notable step in its energy transition, according to a study published on Thursday. China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, aims to peak its emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The country has heavily invested in renewable energy, building nearly twice as much wind and solar capacity as the rest of the world combined, according to a study published last year. 'The growth of clean energy production now exceeds the average and long-term growth of electricity demand, reducing the use of fossil fuels,' said Lauri Myllyvirta, analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). 'This is the first time that such a decline is mainly due to the growth of clean energy production,' he added. The Chinese electricity sector generated 5.8% fewer emissions in the first quarter, allowing it to offset the increases in emissions related to coal use in metallurgy and chemistry. However, China remains 'very behind' on one of its key objectives for 2030, which is to reduce its carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per GDP) by 65% compared to its 2005 level.

**China at Risk of Climate Failure: Urgent Emissions Reductions Needed to Meet Paris Agreement**
Lauri Myllyvirta, Co-Founder of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, stated, 'China must now reduce absolute emissions from 2024 to 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement commitment, due to the rapid increase in emissions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, which has pushed the country away from achieving its goals.' China's current main commitment under the Paris Agreement is to reduce carbon dioxide emission intensity by over 65% from 2005 to 2030. However, this emission reduction goal is difficult to reconcile with the official plan to peak emissions 'before 2030', which implies more years of increases and does not leave enough time to bring emissions below 2024 levels by 2030. It is alarming that high-level political statements currently focus only on CO2 peak and carbon neutrality targets, while the intensity goal is not even mentioned.

**Beijing's plans to combat climate change**
China plans to develop major projects to combat climate change, aiming to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060. The country will develop new offshore wind farms, accelerate the construction of 'new energy bases' in desert areas, and build a direct power transmission route connecting Tibet with Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangdong. However, coal will remain a key fuel, with the country increasing coal production and supply this year. China has struggled to balance economic growth with environmental goals, and is unlikely to meet its targets to reduce carbon intensity and energy consumption per unit of growth. According to the National Development and Reform Commission, 'China will actively and prudently work towards peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality.'

**Peak emissions and carbon neutrality remain key targets**
China has reaffirmed its commitment to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, as outlined in the Government Work Report. The country will take concrete measures to promote these targets, including accelerating the establishment of a framework for controlling carbon emissions and expanding the national carbon trading market. China will also respond to green trade barriers by implementing regulations on imported products and developing systems for managing carbon emissions. The country will promote new energy development, including the construction of new energy bases in deserts and the integration of renewable energy into local grids. According to the report, 'We will develop major projects for climate change response and engage in and steer global environmental and climate governance.'

**China missed key climate target in 2024: Official data**
China has missed a key climate target in 2024, with carbon intensity falling 3.4% short of the official goal of 3.9%, according to official data. Analysts say this puts the country off-track on its commitment under the Paris climate agreement. Despite record renewable additions, coal remained dominant, and emissions rose slightly. Experts speculate that China may have reached peak emissions ahead of a 2030 target, but it will be 'extremely hard' to meet a pledge to reduce carbon intensity by 65% of 2005 levels by 2030, said Mr Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. 'Even with optimistic assumptions for 2025, carbon dioxide intensity must fall by 22% in (the period) 2026-2030 to meet China's key Paris target', he added. China plans to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2060, but growth in its carbon-hungry industrial sector is holding back progress towards its climate goals, said Mr Muyi Yang, senior energy analyst for Asia at think-tank Ember. 'Rapid industrial growth has driven energy demand to increase at a pace that outstrips the build-up of clean energy infrastructure,' he said. Reforms like increasing flexibility in the energy market and adding clean energy infrastructure are needed to ensure industrial output growth 'doesn't come at the expense of a sustainable energy future', he added. Total energy consumption was up 4.3% over that of 2023, the NBS report said.
