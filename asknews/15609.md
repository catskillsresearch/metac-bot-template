**Cuban Dictatorship's 66-Year-Long Attack on the US and the Americas**
The Cuban dictatorship has been attacking the US and the Americas for 66 years, using anti-imperialism as a narrative to justify its crimes. The regime has committed, promoted, and covered up numerous crimes against its own people, as well as against the people of the Americas and the US, including executions, persecutions, torture, imprisonment, invasions, creation of guerrillas and terrorist groups, and participation in armed conflicts. The regime has also proclaimed that narco-trafficking is an instrument of struggle against imperialism. One of the most notable events was the 'missile crisis' of October 1962, which led to the regime's permanence in Cuba. Since then, the Cuban regime has maintained and acted as part of the communist bloc during the Cold War and survived until the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The regime has also been involved in the Foro de Sao Paolo and later with Hugo Chávez. Since 1959, there has not been a single guerrilla, subversive group, terrorist organization, antidemocratic movement, or anti-imperialist operation that has not been created, controlled, advised, executed, or protected by the long arm of the Cuban dictatorship. The regime's criminal actions include its participation in the takeover of power through fact or manipulated electoral mechanisms to control countries and governments that have allowed the expansion of its dictatorship/narco-state model in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Bolivia, and with democratic governments subordinated or 'paradictatorial' in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Honduras. It is surprising the gravity, permanence, and persistence of the aggressions against all countries and peoples of the region, exposed and demonstrated by academics, journalists, activists, exiles, statesmen, politicians, and citizens. No country in the Americas has not been or is not a victim of the Cuban dictatorship. The problem is that after 66 years of constant perpetration of crimes by the Cuban dictatorship against human rights, crimes against humanity, crimes against the sovereignty of peoples, and the security of states, the situation worsens, because after subjecting the Cubans to an extreme situation of misery, dependence, and slavery, the regime is converting - or has already converted - the territory of Cuba into a base for the dictatorships of Iran, China, and Russia. The alliance between Cuba and Iran includes the penetration of Iran with the satellite dictatorships of Cuba in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Bolivia, which is widely known. The operation of Iran in the region has been public for almost two decades, with military agreements between Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Venezuela with Iran, under Cuban direction, which in January of this year celebrated the '19th Commission of Economic Cooperation between Cuba and Iran' with the visit of the Cuban dictator to the Iranian theocratic dictator in Tehran. With China, the anti-democratic and anti-US operation cannot be more evident if we only attend to 'the growing expansion of the espionage bases of the Chinese regime in Cuba' (Infobae July 2024), which 'after analyzing years of satellite images, discovered that Cuba has significantly improved and expanded its electronic espionage facilities in recent years and identified four sites: in Bejucal, El Salao, Wajay, and Calabazar'. In the invasion of Russia to Ukraine, the Cuban dictatorship participates with military personnel estimated to be over 20,000. On May 6, 2025, Ukraine published a list of Cubans serving in the Russian army, having 'verified 1,028 Cubans who signed contracts with Russia'. Swissinfo.ch on May 15, 2025, reported that 'up to 20,000 Cubans have been recruited by Russia, of which between 200 and 300 have died in the war against Ukraine, with the support of the Cuban government to Russia'.

**Garda Lake to Become a 'Desert' Due to Climate Change**
The Lago di Garda is expected to become a 'desert' due to the increasing trend of less rainfall and record-breaking heat. According to a study commissioned by the Comune di Desenzano, the 'Desenact' project, which projects the climate until 2100, shows that precipitation and drought will gradually disappear, and the days of frost will become a rare occurrence. In Trentino, the Mandrone glacier is expected to lose 95% of its ice by 2100. The study also highlights the growing concern among citizens about the increasing emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are causing frequent and intense rainfall events, such as the recent flood in Sirmione on May 12. As one might say, 'the bomb of water' is becoming a recurring phenomenon.

**Kim Moon-soo: 'Choosing Yoon Suk-yeol means only helping him, not me'**
Kim Moon-soo, the presidential candidate of the People Power Party, said on June 2 that if voters choose Yoon Suk-yeol, the presidential candidate of the Reforms and Openness Party, 'only Yoon Suk-yeol will be helped, and Kim Moon-soo will be left behind.' Kim said, 'Tomorrow is a day of truth, not dictatorship, but a day of free choice.' He emphasized, 'If you choose me, you will get me. I ask for your overwhelming support to open a hopeful era for the people.' Kim also criticized Yoon Suk-yeol, saying, 'Yoon Suk-yeol, who was in a situation where he could go to prison, has now become the one who controls all the power in South Korea and is trying to establish a Hitler-style dictatorship.' He added, 'He will operate a special investigation team to punish his opponents and suppress the opposition party in the National Assembly.' Kim also pointed out that Yoon Suk-yeol's family, including his wife and son, has been criticized for being a 'crime family' due to their involvement in scandals. He said, 'Yoon Suk-yeol's hypocrisy and the true nature of his actions will be exposed, and he will try to cover it up and show a regressive behavior.' Kim emphasized, 'Tomorrow's election is the only way to save South Korea from crisis, and I ask for your vote to prevent Yoon Suk-yeol's monster dictatorship.'

**Lee Jun-seok Criticizes Lee Jae-myung's Attempt to Abolish Law**
Lee Jun-seok, the presidential candidate of the Reform Shinbang Party, said, 'Lee Jae-myung is trying to become a king for the sake of BTS, not a president.' He criticized Lee Jae-myung for attempting to abolish the law itself, saying, 'This is not legislation, but the beginning of a dictatorship.' Lee Jun-seok stated, 'If this attempt is realized, there will be two laws in South Korea: one for the people and one for Lee Jae-myung.' He emphasized, 'This is not just bad legislation, but a coup that is unconstitutional and anti-legal. From the moment Lee Jae-myung becomes president, the judiciary will be paralyzed, and the Constitution will become a piece of paper.' Lee Jun-seok warned, 'If a law is created for the sake of Lee Jae-myung, we are no longer citizens, and the law will become a shield for criminals.' He concluded, 'If we entrust the country to someone who tries to put people above the law, the responsibility will fall entirely on us.'

**Cuba's 66-Year-Old Dictatorship: A Base for Iran, China, and Russia's Aggression**
The Cuban dictatorship has been attacking the United States and the Americas for 66 years, and today it is serving as a base for the expansion and aggression of the dictatorships of Iran, China, and Russia. The dictatorship has justified its crimes against its own people, the people of the Americas, and the United States using anti-imperialism as a narrative. It has committed, promoted, and covered up the most heinous crimes, including executions, persecutions, tortures, and encarcerations, as well as invasions, creation of guerrillas, terrorist groups, and armed participation. The Cuban dictatorship has also participated in the creation of narco-states and has institutionalized 'state terrorism as a means of holding power.' The situation has worsened because after 66 years of constant perpetration of crimes, the dictatorship is converting the territory of Cuba into a base for the dictatorships of Iran, China, and Russia. The alliance between Cuba and Iran includes the penetration of Iran with the satellite dictatorships of Cuba in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Bolivia. China's operation against democracy and the United States is evident in the 'creeping expansion of the Chinese regime's espionage bases in Cuba.' The Cuban dictatorship is also participating in the invasion of Russia in Ukraine with over 20,000 military personnel. '1,028 Cubans have been verified to have signed contracts with Russia,' and 'between 200 and 300 Cubans have died in the war against Ukraine, with the support of the Cuban government.'

**Is N.J. prepared for the next superstorm? Can't trust Trump. Ask Murphy | Opinion**
A recent pledge by Gov. Phil Murphy to enact regulations to protect New Jerseyans against climate change, known as NJPACT, is facing enormous pushback. The rules aim to address how we develop on our coast, considering an estimated five feet of sea level rise by 2100. Opponents claim it will destroy 'economic development' and 'affordable housing', but the author argues that these concerns are shortsighted and that the rules will save lives. The author urges Murphy and the state legislature to support the NJPACT rules, saying 'Don't do nothing. Do the right thing. Support the NJPACT rules. You'll be protecting New Jerseyans - today, tomorrow, and in 2100, when many of us are long gone.'

** 'Not a fact that it will happen this year': Kremlin doubts meeting with Trump in 2025**
Kremlin representatives have commented on the possible meeting between Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump. Now, in Moscow, they doubt that such a meeting will take place in 2025. According to Yuri Ushakov, Putin's assistant, the Kremlin needs results that can be discussed at the level of Trump and Putin. He stated that Trump's phone conversations with Putin have already yielded certain results. However, Ushakov expressed doubts that a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Trump will take place before the end of the current year. Ushakov emphasized that the meeting between Putin and Trump must be carefully prepared, as Moscow needs results that can be discussed at the highest level. 'It's not a fact that it will happen this year,' Ushakov said. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has noted that Russia has been sending 'signals' before the negotiations in Istanbul. Moscow continues to make ultimatums and operate with maximalist demands, while Russian officials signal an uncompromising position. This suggests that it is unlikely to expect results from the meeting in Istanbul.

**Nicaragua, a dictatorship without brakes**
The government of Nicaragua, led by dictator Daniel Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo, has announced its withdrawal from all activities related to the United Nations Human Rights Council. This decision comes after a report by the Human Rights Experts Group was released, urging the International Court of Justice to take Nicaragua to court for stripping its citizens of their nationality. According to the report, the Nicaraguan army actively participated in the repression of protests that broke out in April 2018. The official persecution of real or perceived opponents has become commonplace, with crimes, violations, and abuses committed not only to dismantle active opposition efforts but also to. The bicameral dictatorship has also created the Voluntary Police, a force of 30,000 civilians who, masked, have sworn allegiance to the presidential couple. This force is intended to support the National Police in maintaining order and security, although. The concentration of power in the presidential couple has been strengthened by the passage of a new electoral law that eliminates any semblance of independence and. With the modification of the composition of the National Assembly, the 'co-presidents' will automatically join the Parliament when they leave their positions, guaranteeing the permanence of Ortega and Murillo in positions of power. Nicaragua has become a country where citizens can only express themselves if they are loyal to the ruling dictatorship. The international community must take concrete and urgent measures - legal actions and specific sanctions - to force the government to account for its actions. Inaction will only strengthen the regime and prolong the suffering of the population.' said the report. 'La Nación' emphasizes that 'debe tomar medidas concretas y urgentes -acciones legales y sanciones específicas- para obligar al gobierno a rendir cuentas. La inacción solo fortalecerá al régimen y prolongará el sufrimiento de la población.'

**Isabel Allende Threatens to Leave the United States if Trump's Government Becomes 'Dictatorial'**
Chilean author Isabel Allende has stated that she will leave the United States if the situation with Donald Trump's government becomes 'as red as an ant', as she believes it will. She does not want to live in a dictatorship. 'While I can, I will live in the United States because that's where my son, daughter-in-law, dogs, and husband are. In that order. But if the situation becomes as red as an ant, as I think it will, I will have to leave. I don't want to live in a dictatorship. I don't want to live in an authoritarian government,' she said in an interview with the media to promote the simultaneous publication in Spanish of her new novel 'Mi nombre es Emilia del Valle' on May 20. Allende has criticized the 'nacionalismo cristiano blanco' defended by Trump, calling it 'very dangerous' and stating that diversity is where the 'wealth' of the United States is found. She has also mentioned that if she had to live in another place, it would be in the current south of Chile or in Spain. 'I don't want to live in a country where I have to live in fear, in silence, or hiding. That's when I will leave,' she added. Allende has also criticized the 'antimigrant' sentiment in 'all places', but especially in countries made by migrants, and has pointed out that millions of immigrants in the United States contribute with taxes, culture, and work, and that all services in the country are in the hands of migrants.

**The Science of Autocracy Suggests the U.S. Is Headed for Dictatorship**
Scholars warn that the U.S. is headed for a dictatorship, citing a quarter-century's collapse in Venezuela and the populist movement's erosion of democratic institutions. The country's relentless attacks on science, illegal firings of federal workers, and deportations to foreign prisons are all contributing factors. According to a May report, the U.S. is at the edge of the fourth step in the dismantling of checks and balances on executive power, which could lead to the suspension of habeas corpus and the Magna Carta. The article notes that the country's approval rating slides and that Big Tech and white nationalists are on opposite sides of the issue, but it is not inevitable that the U.S. will become a dictatorship. 'This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of [Scientific American].'

**Dictatorship in America is a possibility**
The author, Natalie Pappalardo, argues that the United States is at risk of becoming a dictatorship, citing the rise of authoritarian leaders and the exploitation of social unrest and minority groups. She points to the example of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, who used the parliamentary system to seize control and suppress civil liberties. Pappalardo also draws parallels between Hitler's tactics and those of Donald Trump, who has used economic hardship and scapegoating to gain support. She notes that Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan is a call to an illusive prior strength, and that his campaign has relied on propaganda and scapegoating to turn the masses against immigrants. The author warns that Trump's overreach of presidential power and exploitation of hate and fear are alarming signs of a potential dictatorship. She concludes that Americans must be vigilant and critical of their government to prevent this dark age from unfolding.

**Three Scenarios for the Future of the United States**
The future of the United States is uncertain, with three possible scenarios: the country becoming a dictatorship, a 'competitive authoritarian' regime, or maintaining its liberal democracy. Analysts and commentators have predicted that the US is at risk of becoming a dictatorship, with some even suggesting the possibility of a fascist regime. However, experts argue that this scenario is unlikely, given Donald Trump's capitalist and anti-state-providence views. The second scenario, a 'competitive authoritarian' regime, is also possible, with the administration using the judiciary and law enforcement to suppress opposition. However, this scenario is also unlikely, as the US has a strong tradition of democratic institutions. The third scenario, the maintenance of liberal democracy, is the most probable, with the Democrats potentially regaining control of Congress and the presidency in 2026 and 2028, respectively. This scenario is supported by the fact that the US has a strong tradition of democratic institutions and that Trump's policies have been met with resistance from various sectors of society.

**The United States is Becoming a Dictatorship**
The author argues that the United States is evolving rapidly towards a totalitarian regime. They point to Jeff Bezos' decision to only publish opinions that defend absolute economic freedom and total freedom of expression in the Washington Post, excluding voices that speak out against these freedoms. The author believes that this decision, combined with the actions of President Trump, who has said that 'since he wants to save America, nothing he does can be illegal', and the fact that he is now immune from prosecution, shows that the US is becoming a dictatorship. The author also argues that the US is encouraging extremes and destroying the credibility of science by allowing uncontrolled fake news, defamation, and lies. They warn that the US is one of the last great democracies to not have experienced a totalitarian episode, and that it is likely to happen soon. The author calls on Europeans to prepare for the possibility of an American totalitarian regime and to take action to protect themselves and their values.

**Did Johan Galtung Get It Right? The Norwegian Peace Researcher's 2004 Predictions**
Johan Galtung, a renowned peace researcher and founder of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), made several predictions in 2004, including that the American empire would collapse by 2020. He also predicted that the US would develop into a fascist dictatorship before that. While Galtung's predictions about the US empire's collapse were incorrect, some of his warnings about the country's direction seem eerily relevant today, particularly in the context of the MAGA movement's goal of preserving and strengthening the US position. As Galtung said, 'I love the USA, but I hate the empire.' The article concludes that while it's impossible to know what the future holds, Galtung's predictions are worth considering, and the thought of the US empire collapsing is 'scary.'

**When Will the USA Become a Dictatorship?**
Sigmund Aas, a Norwegian political scientist, asks when the United States will become a dictatorship. He argues that the US system of government, as outlined in the Constitution, is designed to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals. However, President Trump's behavior and policies are challenging this system. Trump's authoritarian style of leadership, where he issues executive orders without consulting Congress, is a threat to the separation of powers and the rule of law. Aas argues that Trump's actions are reminiscent of a king, rather than a president, and that his administration is becoming increasingly authoritarian. He warns that if the US becomes a dictatorship, it will follow the same path as Russia, with an oligarchic regime and increasing corruption and cronyism. Aas concludes that the US is not yet a dictatorship, but the signs are ominous.
