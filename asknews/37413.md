**Trump Faces Surge in Threats After James Comey's Provocative Post**
According to FBI Director Chris Wray, the agency has faced a surge in threats against Donald Trump after a provocative post by former FBI Director James Comey on social media. Comey posted a photo of oysters arranged in the numbers '86 47', which sparked a wave of imitations on social media. Wray noted that the term '86' in the criminal underworld can mean murder, making Comey's post particularly dangerous. As a result, agents had to be diverted from investigating pedophiles, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists to investigate threats against Trump. Wray expressed disappointment that such actions are perceived as a joke and emphasized that such incidents occur daily. The FBI did not provide details on the number of threats, but the situation worsened after two attempts on Trump's life last year, including an attack in Pennsylvania where a bullet grazed the former president's ear. Additionally, it was reported that Ryan Wesley Rut, the American arrested for attempting to kill Trump in September 2024, planned the attack with Ukrainian handlers. Rut had contacted an unknown Ukrainian individual a month before the attempt, who may have provided him with a weapon. Rut asked for a grenade or a FIM-92 Stinger portable air defense system to be sent to him.

**Undocumented Immigrant Threatens Trump, Arrested by ICE**
South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem stated, 'Thanks to our ICE agents, the undocumented immigrant who threatened to kill President Trump is now in prison.' The threat was made in a letter that included a plan to shoot Trump at a rally. Noem pointed out that the threat came just over a year after a failed assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania in July 2024. Noem also called on all politicians and media representatives to be more careful with their words, citing the recent threat as an example. Former FBI Director James Comey was criticized for a post on Instagram that some interpreted as a call to assassinate Trump. Comey shared a photo of a series of seashells arranged in the pattern '86 47', which was seen as a reference to the assassination attempt on Trump in 2024. Trump accused Comey of making a threat, saying, 'He knew exactly what it meant. Even a child would know what it means. If you're the FBI director and you don't know what it means, then it means assassination.'

**Undocumented Immigrant Threatens Trump, Arrested by ICE**
US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that an undocumented immigrant who threatened to assassinate President Donald Trump in a letter has been arrested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Noem stated that the threat was made just over a year after a failed assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania in July 2024. In the letter, the undocumented immigrant threatened to 'shoot Trump in the head at a rally.' Noem said, 'Thanks to our ICE agents, the undocumented immigrant who threatened to kill President Trump is now behind bars.' Noem also called on all politicians and media representatives to be more careful with their words, citing the recent threat as an example. This comes just two weeks after former FBI Director James Comey was accused of making a 'call to assassination' against Trump, after he posted a photo on Instagram of a shellfish arrangement that some interpreted as a threat. Trump responded by accusing Comey of making a direct threat, saying, 'He knew exactly what it meant. Even a child would know what it means. If you're the FBI director and you don't know what it means, then it means assassination.'

**Mexican Immigrant Arrested for Alleged Threats Against Donald Trump**
Mexican immigrant Morales Reyes was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill Donald Trump. In a letter, he expressed his intention to use a '30 yard 6' cartridge to shoot the president in the head during a rally, before 'self-deporting' to Mexico. The letter, written in blue ink, stated: 'We're tired of this president messing with us Mexicans. We've done more for this country than you white people.' Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem highlighted the gravity of the threat, referencing an attempt on Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania in July 2024, where a bullet grazed the president. Noem also mentioned a post on Instagram by former FBI Director James Comey, which showed seashells forming '86 47', although Comey denied any intention to incite violence and removed the post. Noem urged politicians and media to 'moderate their rhetoric' following these incidents, saying: 'I will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of President Trump.' Morales Reyes remains in custody while his deportation is processed, highlighting the challenges of national security and immigration control in the US.

**US investigating 'threat' to Trump by ex-FBI chief Comey**
US law enforcement agencies are investigating an alleged assassination threat against President Donald Trump made by former FBI director James Comey. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the investigation after Comey made a now-deleted post on Instagram that showed an image of '86 47' spelled out in sea shells, with '86' being slang for kill and Trump the 47th president. Noem stated, 'DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.' Comey later claimed the post was 'a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message.' However, he acknowledged that some people may have associated the numbers with violence and took the post down. Trump has faced other threats, including an assassination attempt in July 2024 that left him wounded in the ear.

**FBI Director Warns of Increased Threats to President Trump Following James Comey's Social Media Post**
FBI Director Kashyap Patel acknowledged that threats to assassinate President Donald Trump have increased, allegedly due to a social media post by James Comey. Comey, a former FBI director, shared an image on Instagram with the numbers '86 47', which is believed to be a reference to 'kill' and '47' as a reference to Trump's presidency. Patel stated that this has led to more threats, saying, 'Do you know how many impersonators we've had to investigate because of that beach adventure of the former director? Do you know how many agents I've had to take off the task of pursuing child sex predators, fentanyl traffickers, and terrorists? Everywhere in this country, people are appearing on social media thinking that a threat to the life of the President of the United States is a joke... and they can do it because (Comey) did it?' Patel has repositioned over 1,500 agents in the agency to make it more efficient in the fight against crime, but this does not seem to intimidate individuals like Ramón Morales-Reyes, a 54-year-old Mexican immigrant who was arrested last week for expressing his desire to kill Trump with a shotgun once he was close to him during one of his public appearances.

**Jailing James Comey**
The administration should not arrest James Comey over his social media posts, but rather investigate his tenure as FBI director during President Trump's first term. Comey recently posted a photo on Instagram with the numbers '86 47', which he claimed he didn't realize could be associated with violence, but many believe he intentionally stirred trouble to provoke an administration overreaction. This comes after the Justice Department arrested Douglass Mackey over a similar social media post during Hillary Clinton's 2016 election bid. Comey has previously stated that social media threats should be taken seriously, particularly when they involve his ideological opponents. However, documents are expected to be released soon that may shed light on potential criminal misconduct at the FBI during Comey's watch, including the Russia collusion hoax. Comey should be forced to answer for his conduct as FBI director, rather than being made into a martyr for free speech.

Former FBI Director James Comey expressed confidence in the US judiciary, saying he believes in the 'independent judiciary' and that it 'is alive and well.' He stated that he is not worried about being treated unfairly, citing the need for evidence and truth in court. Comey also criticized law firms that have submitted to pressure from the Trump administration, comparing them to mob movies. He posted and deleted a picture of shells on a beach to depict the numbers '8647' on Thursday, which was interpreted as a call for Trump's removal or assassination. Trump responded, saying the post was a threat and that it would be up to Attorney General Pam Bondi to decide whether to arrest or charge Comey.

**Secret Service agents question James Comey about his Trump social media post**
Former FBI Director James Comey deleted a social media post on X that showed seashells arranged in the shape of '8647', which President Trump claimed was a message about assassination. Comey said it was a political message, not violent. Trump stated, 'A child knows what that meant... that meant 'assassination,' and it says it loud and clear.' However, a former prosecutor said Comey's post does not meet the legal threshold for a crime. Trump also mentioned that he survived two assassination attempts during his 2024 campaign, including one in July where he was wounded in the ear at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The meaning of 'eighty-six' has been used in the past, including by Trump in 2020 when he was the 45th president, and by Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who denied that it meant 'assassinate'.

Comey is under scrutiny for posting a picture of seashells arranged to read '8647', which some interpret as a threat to kill President Donald Trump. Many believe that nothing major will come of this, while others think it may be a publicity stunt to promote Comey's upcoming crime novel. Republican lawmakers are considering a proposal to block Comey from working for the federal government again.

**US Launches Investigation into Former FBI Director James Comey over Trump Threat**
The US administration has launched an investigation into former FBI Director James Comey over a social media post that was deemed a call to kill Donald Trump, according to The New York Times. The post, which featured a photo of seashells on a beach forming the numbers '86 47', was seen as a reference to the criticism of Trump, with '86' being a slang term for 'to fire' or 'to remove' and '47' being Trump's presidential number. While representatives of the Trump administration had previously not seen the phrase as a threat, they announced an investigation after Comey's post. 'The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service are investigating this threat and will respond accordingly,' said Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. 'We take all potential threats to our protected individuals seriously,' said a Secret Service representative. Comey later deleted the post and wrote: 'I previously posted a photo of seashells I saw on a beach walk today, which I thought might be a political message. I didn't realize that some people associate these numbers with violence. I oppose all forms of violence, so I deleted the post.' Comey served as FBI Director from 2013 to 2017, when Trump fired him during his first presidential term. He has been a long-time critic of Trump, calling him 'morally unfit' for the presidency in 2018. In July 2024, Trump survived an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. In September 2024, there was another attempt on Trump's life when he was playing golf at his club in Florida. Agents of the Secret Service noticed a rifle in the bushes and opened fire. The suspect managed to escape but was later arrested. Trump was not harmed.

Former FBI Director James Comey has been accused of calling for the assassination of President Donald Trump on his social media accounts. Comey posted a message with seashells spelling out '86 47', which is a reference to getting rid of someone (86) and Trump (47). Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has called for Comey to be arrested and jailed for his threat against the President. Gabbard stated, 'The Secret Service, Trump family, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard don't find the message to get rid of POTUS all that humorous.'

CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig mocked the suggestion that former FBI Director James Comey should be prosecuted over a social media post about President Donald Trump. Comey posted a photo of seashells arranged to read '86 47,' a reference to Trump and the 47th president, and wrote 'Cool shell formation on my beach walk.' However, the post was interpreted as a call to violence against Trump, with Donald Trump Jr. tweeting that Comey was 'casually calling for my dad to be murdered.' The White House said Comey's post was 'being taken seriously' by the administration. Honig appeared on CNN's The Source and stated that he does not believe Comey should be in jail, despite the administration officials' calls for prosecution.

Ainge believes the concerns are being exaggerated, saying 'James Pearce doesn't want to talk to the media. Or me. Or you. Dude just wants to play football and he's elite at it.' Pearce was arrested in December 2023 for disobeying police orders during a traffic stop, but Ainge thinks this incident should not be a major issue. Pearce will attend the NFL Combine next week to meet with teams and showcase his athletic abilities.
