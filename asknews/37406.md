**The Anatomy of an Alex Cooper Interview**
Alex Cooper's interviewing style on her popular podcast Call Her Daddy has been analyzed. Cooper's approach is to create a comfortable atmosphere, often wearing sweats and sitting on a couch with her guests. She has said that she turns down interviews with guests who are unwilling to discuss their personal lives. Cooper maintains that she never provides questions to guests in advance and does not allow publicists in the room during interviews. She uses flattery to make her guests feel at ease, often referring to them as 'iconic' or 'legendary'. Cooper also uses a 'diabolical' approach, asking blunt and personal questions in a mock-serious tone, which can disarm her guests and make them more willing to open up. Her goal is to create a sense of equality with her guests, making them feel like they're hanging out with a friend. Cooper's style has been praised for its effectiveness in getting celebrities to share personal and intimate details, and her podcast has become a go-to destination for celebrities looking to open up about their lives.

**Michelle Obama humiliated amid dismal ratings for podcast**
Michelle Obama's new podcast, IMO [In My Opinion] with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson, has failed to meet expectations after its launch in early March. The podcast, which features the sibling duo discussing current events and interviewing special guests, has underperformed on the charts, ranking 34th on Spotify and 19th on Apple Podcasts. In comparison, other recently released podcasts like Good Hang with Amy Poehler and The Mel Robbins Podcast are outperforming IMO. Obama's podcast has released multiple episodes featuring notable guests, but has only 67,000 subscribers on YouTube, a far cry from popular podcasts like The Joe Rogan Experience and Call Her Daddy. The disappointing numbers come as Democrats strategize to find a 'Joe Rogan of the left' to appeal to the younger generation.

**Video podcasts could be the next Netflix expansion project**
Netflix is reportedly considering a move into podcasting, aiming to capitalize on the video podcast boom and add more content without significant production costs. According to a Business Insider report, the company is exploring the possibility of hosting podcasts on its platform, which could join original TV shows, movies, live sporting events, and video games. One talent agent stated, 'More recently, they are exploring: Is this doable? Which one would make sense for us? They ask about specific names.' The agent noted that the main cost is the talent itself, and Netflix has already attempted to sign 'Call Her Daddy' star Alex Cooper, who instead signed with SiriusXM. This move could generate significant ad revenue for subscribers who pay a cheaper monthly rate to tolerate advertisements, similar to rivals like Spotify and YouTube.
