**Star Destroyed by Supermassive Black Hole in Rare Cosmic Phenomenon**
A recent study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society revealed details of a rare and violent cosmic phenomenon: the complete destruction of a star by a supermassive black hole. This type of event is called a 'tidal disruption event' (TDE), where the extreme gravitational forces tear the star apart when it gets too close to the black hole. The event, named AT 2022wtn, occurred in a galaxy about 700 million light-years away from Earth. The star was captured by a black hole with a mass equivalent to one million suns, causing it to be completely torn apart, with part of its matter being 'consumed' by the cosmic titan. These events are extremely bright and release more light than all the stars in the galaxy where they occur. The intense brightness caught the attention of scientists. The phenomenon was initially detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), a survey conducted by the Palomar Observatory in California, dedicated to capturing rapid changes in the sky. It was then studied in various light bands, such as radio waves, infrared, and X-rays. The TDE AT 2022wtn occurred in a galaxy called SDSSJ232323.79+104107.7, which is in the process of merging with a nearby galaxy. The host galaxy is at least ten times smaller than the other galaxy involved in the collision. This detail is important because collisions between galaxies often favor the occurrence of these events, although this is only the second TDE observed in a system of this type. According to Francesca Onori, leader of the research, 'The data collected show that the accretion disk formed rapidly and that part of the matter was expelled almost simultaneously. This helped to better understand how these events emit light and how the material behaves around a black hole.'

**Invisible radiation leaking from private satellite 'megaconstellations' could ruin radio astronomy forever, experts warn**
Private satellite constellations, such as SpaceX's Starlink, are emitting invisible radiation that is disrupting radio astronomers' ability to detect important signals from across the universe. This radiation, known as unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR), is leaking out of the satellites at a much higher rate than other orbiting spacecraft. If left unchecked, we could reach an 'inflection point' beyond which we can no longer properly study the cosmos, researchers warn. The problem is particularly prevalent among private satellite constellations, and experts predict that we could have up to 100,000 private satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) by as early as 2050. This could lead to a 'serious problem' for radio astronomy, as faint signals from distant objects would be obscured by the intense radiation. Some radio telescopes, such as LOFAR, will be hit harder than others due to the frequencies they specialize in, but all radio telescopes will be affected. Experts are calling for stricter regulations on UEMR emissions from private spacecraft, and for satellite operators to minimize UEMR before launch. 'If satellite operators care about the UEMR, we will be OK,' said Federico Di Vruno, a radio astronomer at the Square Kilometre Array Observatory. 'It will be more difficult to conduct radio astronomy than it is now, but we understand technology evolves and we will evolve with it.'

**Astronomers Study a Star That Behaves Like No Other**
Astronomers have discovered a star that behaves unlike any other, emitting a unique combination of radio waves and X-rays. The star, located 15,000 light-years away in the Milky Way, flashes every 44 minutes in both radio waves and X-rays. According to researchers, it belongs to a class of objects called 'long-period radio transients', known for their bright bursts of radio waves that appear every few minutes or hours. The researchers used data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, and other telescopes to study the object. They have some hypotheses about the nature of the star, including that it could be a magnetar or a white dwarf, but none of them can explain all the observed characteristics. 'It's a very rare coincidence, like finding a needle in a haystack,' said astronomer Ziteng Wang, lead author of the study published in Nature. 'The brightness of the radio emission varies greatly. We didn't observe any radio emission from the object before November 2023. And in February 2024, we saw it become extremely bright.' Only about 30 objects in the sky have reached such brightness in radio waves. 'Surprisingly, at the same time, we also detected X-ray pulses from the object. We can still detect it in radio, but much weaker,' Wang explained.

**Asteroid 2024 YR4: No Longer a Threat to Earth, But a Possible Threat to the Moon**
The asteroid 2024 YR4, initially considered a potential threat to Earth, has been ruled out as such due to more precise observations and detailed analysis. According to NASA data, the probability of impact with Earth in 2032 is now 0.004%, placing the asteroid in the Level 0 of the Torino Scale, indicating a zero risk. Although the risk to Earth is practically non-existent, the probability of the asteroid impacting the Moon remains a remote possibility, estimated at around 1.7% for December 22, 2023. NASA has intensified its efforts to monitor the asteroid, with the James Webb Space Telescope scheduled to make observations in March 2025 to obtain more data on its size and composition. Additionally, NASA plans to send the NEO Surveyor telescope in 2027, which will use infrared technology to detect and characterize near-Earth objects, improving the response to potential future threats. As NASA's Dr. said, 'The asteroid 2024 YR4 is no longer considered a threat to Earth, but we will continue to monitor it to ensure its safe passage.'

**Scientists Use Sophisticated Techniques to Search for Life on Distant Planets**
Astronomers have developed sophisticated techniques to gather information about distant planets. They can measure the balance of stars and the gravity of planets orbiting around them. In 2010, researchers caught a glimpse of GJ 1214b, a planet 48 light-years away, as it passed in front of its star. When the star's light shone through the planet's atmosphere, certain wavelengths were absorbed, indicating that GJ 1214b may have a rich atmosphere of water vapor. In 2022, astronomers began using a powerful new tool to observe distant planets in this way. They pointed the James Webb Space Telescope at distant star systems and started detecting extremely faint patterns in the light of the stars, clues about the complexity of the atmospheres of exoplanets. In 2023, Nikku Madhusudhan, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge, and his colleagues focused on K2-18b as it passed in front of its own star, using extremely sensitive instruments on the Webb telescope to detect near-infrared light. As K2-18b passed in front of the star, the starlight underwent a subtle change - caused by a planetary atmosphere containing hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane, concluded the researchers. They also found suggestive signs of a fourth gas, dimethyl sulfide - which could be a big deal. On Earth, the only source of dimethyl sulfide in the atmosphere is life. Microorganisms photosynthetic in the ocean produce the molecule as a defense against the ultraviolet light of the sun. The molecule escapes from their cells and ends up in the air. But the signal was so weak that it was difficult to be sure it was real. So, Madhusudhan's team planned to look again at K2-18b in 2024. This time, they used a different instrument on the space telescope, which looks at longer wavelengths of mid-infrared light. In their second search, they again found a signature of dimethyl sulfide, apparently even stronger than the first. In April, Madhusudhan and his colleagues described their results in a paper published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Speaking at a press conference the day before, Madhusudhan said there was only 'a one in three hundred chance' of it being a coincidence. Rafael Luque, an astronomer at the University of Chicago, characterized Madhusudhan as a world expert on exoplanets. 'Madhu has been a pioneer in the field,' he said. 'I have the greatest respect for this team.' 'I can say directly that there is no statistically significant signal in the data that was published a month ago,' said Jacob Bean. Bean, an astronomer at the University of Chicago who discovered the atmosphere of GJ 1214b, worked with Luque on the study of May 19. Welbanks and his colleagues are not claiming that propiono is actually present in K2-18b. They simply argue that the faint light of the planet's atmosphere can create ambiguous patterns that could be the result of one of several gases. Such scarce data certainly are not enough to consider any planet as a possible home for life. On May 15, Madhusudhan and his colleagues responded to Welbanks' team with their own study.

**China's Tianwen 2 Spacecraft Successfully Launched to Collect Asteroid Sample**
China has successfully launched the Tianwen 2 spacecraft, which aims to collect a sample from the asteroid 'Camoealewa' (2016HO3). This is the first time a Chinese spacecraft has collected a sample from a quasi-satellite asteroid. The spacecraft will enter the asteroid's orbit in July 2026, collect a sample, and return to Earth in November 2027. If successful, China will become the third country to collect an asteroid sample, after Japan and the United States. Scientists believe that Camoealewa is a fragment of a larger asteroid that collided with the Moon about 400 million years ago, creating the 22km-wide Jordano Bruno crater. The sample collected by Tianwen 2 will provide valuable information about the asteroid's origin. The spacecraft will use a combination of 'touch-and-go' and 'anchor and attach' methods to collect the sample. However, the mission is challenging due to the asteroid's small size and fast rotation period. After collecting the sample, Tianwen 2 will head to the asteroid belt to explore the comet 311P/Panstarrs. The spacecraft will arrive at the comet in January 2035 and spend a year studying its orbit, shape, and composition. 'Tianwen' is a name derived from the ancient Chinese poem 'Tianwen' (天問), meaning 'to ask the heavens'.

**Mysterious Celestial Object Emitted Signals in Both Radio Waves and X-rays**
NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has detected a mysterious celestial object that is emitting signals simultaneously in both radio waves and X-rays. The signals repeat every 44 minutes, lasting for approximately two minutes. The object, located approximately 15,000 light-years away in the Milky Way galaxy, is known as ASKAP J1832-0911. This is the first time a 'long-period transient' (LPT) has been observed to emit both high-energy X-rays and low-energy radio waves simultaneously. The discovery has the potential to be a turning point in understanding the enigmatic nature of LPTs and how their signals are formed. According to lead researcher Zieng (Andy) Wang, 'This object is unlike anything we've ever seen before.' The team believes that ASKAP J1832-0911 is likely a dead star, but it is unclear whether it is a magnetar or a white dwarf in a binary star system. Wang notes that current theories are insufficient to fully explain this extraordinary behavior, and 'this discovery may point to a new understanding of physics or new models of star evolution.' The detection of both radio waves and X-rays in this object may also provide clues about how LPTs produce energy. Scientists believe that this extraordinary behavior may not be unique to ASKAP J1832-0911, and that other LPTs may exist in the universe. The research was published in the journal Nature on May 28, 2025.

**SETI Scientists Claim 1700 Intelligent Civilizations in the Universe**
Scientists from the SETI Institute claim that there are at least 1700 intelligent civilizations in the universe, excluding humanity. Astronomers are optimistic that humanity may receive responses from extraterrestrials to signals sent from Earth in the near future. Dr. Seth Shostak, former chief astronomer of the SETI Institute, predicts that the first messages from extraterrestrials may arrive as early as 2036, thanks to continuous improvements in telescopes and computer equipment. In 2002, scientists sent signals to the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which they now believe could have been detected by intelligent beings beyond our solar system. The impulses have already reached a star approximately 27 light-years from Earth. If there are planets around this star inhabited by intelligent beings, a response could arrive as early as 2029. Other scientists suggest that extraterrestrials may have used the transit method to detect Earth, when our planet passes behind the Sun, reducing its light. Thus, inhabitants of 1715 nearby systems could have detected Earth over the past 5000 years, and residents of 319 systems will be able to do so in the next 5000 years.

**Detection of Potential Biosignatures on K2-18b: A Turning Point in the Search for Life Beyond Earth?**
A recent study using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected potential biosignatures in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b. The results show signs of molecules associated with biological activity on Earth, such as dimethylsulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS). While the findings require further confirmation, this discovery could be a turning point in the search for life beyond our solar system. K2-18b, located 124 light-years from Earth, orbits a red dwarf star and has a surface temperature that could support liquid water. However, its internal structure is still unclear, and some scientists suggest it could be a 'water giant' with a thick atmosphere and a global ocean. The detection of DMS and DMDS is interpreted as the most convincing argument for biological activity on K2-18b, but some experts argue that alternative scenarios could explain the presence of these molecules. To resolve the controversy, the JWST consortium has allocated 28 hours of observation time in 2026-2027 to further study the planet's atmosphere. 'This could be a turning point when the question of our loneliness in the universe moves from philosophical to experimental science,' said Professor Nikku Madhusudhan. However, scientific rigor requires caution: 'Even five sigma is not enough to claim that a gas has a biological origin,' noted Professor Catherine Heymans.

Scientists are concerned about a never-before-seen solar eruption, which could have significant effects on our daily lives. The Sun is sending us a message, and we need to pay attention to some key details that could change everything in the coming days. According to Foxweather, the majority of the energy from the solar event did not directly hit the Earth, limiting the impacts to a few radio blackouts. However, when the Earth and Sun are in alignment, there could be possible impacts, such as auroras and disruptions to spacecraft and communication equipment. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) classified the recent solar event as an 'X', denoting the highest level of intensity. The scientists explain that the solar flares are classified based on their strength, with five categories: A, B, C, M, and X. The recent solar event was not unprecedented, and the experts from the University of Harvard anticipate that the Sun will remain in the Solar Cycle 25 until at least 2031, before starting the gradual increase in activity again in the Solar Cycle 2026. According to NASA, the solar cycles occur because the Sun's magnetic field flips: during a decade, the north pole will be on the north side and the south pole will be on the south side, which inverts during the previous decade or so. 'The recent solar flare of class X may have been surprising, but it is not completely without precedent,' they explain. 'The solar activity persists much longer than the maximum phase, so we need to be prepared for the potential impacts.'

**Venus Life Finder Mission Aims to Search for Signs of Life in the Clouds of Venus**
The Venus Life Finder mission, led by Sara Seager and Janusz Petkowski, aims to search for signs of life in the clouds of Venus. The mission, supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rocket Lab USA Inc., will use a device called a nephelometer of autofluorescence (AFN) to search for organic material in the clouds and characterize particles. Although it won't confirm the existence of life, it could identify conditions that make it possible. The mission will focus on staying in the clouds, rather than simply passing through them and observing them. This is a new approach, as previous missions have focused on mapping the surface or measuring sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, which is an indicator of volcanic processes. The first mission will last for five minutes, and the second phase, starting in 2026, will explore the habitability of the clouds in more depth. The third and final phase, projected for 2041, will involve a mission to return samples from the clouds of Venus to Earth for analysis. According to Segura Peralta, these expeditions will provide new information about Venus, also known as the Morning Star, and will help humans better understand themselves and their position in the cosmos. The possibility of finding organic compounds in such an extreme environment as the clouds of Venus not only expands our understanding of the chemistry of life, but also raises new questions about our existence and place in the universe.

**NHS shares nine-word cancer message that 'could save lives' - The Mirror**
The NHS is urging people to take advantage of its free bowel cancer screening kits, which can detect signs of cancer before symptoms appear. According to Cancer Research UK, 44,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year, and the number of cases could hit 47,700 by 2040. The NHS has sent out over four million kits since its home testing programme began in 2021, but uptake is slower among those in their 50s. Professor Peter Johnson said, 'The chances of surviving bowel cancer are very good when it is caught early.' Steve Russell added, 'Taking a test for bowel cancer may be the last thing you're thinking about, but it could save your life.' The NHS recommends eating a healthy diet, staying active, losing weight if overweight, quitting smoking, drinking less alcohol, and eating less red and processed meat to reduce the risk of developing bowel cancer.

**Mysterious Radio Signals from Space: Scientists Uncover Their Origin**
Scientists have successfully identified the origin of the mysterious radio signals that have been received by Earth for a long time. The signals, which arrive every 125 minutes, or approximately every two hours, were initially thought to be a possible attempt at contact from extraterrestrial civilizations. However, researchers have found that the signals are actually coming from a unique pair of stars, located about 1645 light-years from Earth. The pair consists of a white dwarf and a red dwarf, which are so close to each other that their magnetic fields interact, producing radio waves that reach our planet. Dr. Iris de Ruyter, a researcher from the University of Sydney, led the team that discovered the origin of the signals. She first detected the impulses in 2024 by analyzing archival data from the LOFAR telescope in the Netherlands, the largest low-frequency radio telescope. The first impulse was recorded in 2015, but after a more detailed study of the area, Dr. de Ruyter found six more signals, each lasting from a few seconds to a minute and repeating at regular intervals. Such well-ordered and regular signals are extremely rare. Initially, only the red dwarf was visible, but its rapid motion indicated the presence of a second object. The rapid oscillation of its position every two hours allowed scientists to understand that a white dwarf is part of this unique star system, as Dr. de Ruyter said, 'This is a very exciting discovery that allows us to better understand the properties of stars and the behavior of their magnetic fields.'

**Kazheta Akhmetjanova Predicts the End of the World: A Chilling Vision**
Kazheta Akhmetjanova, a star of the 'Battle of Psychics' show, has made a chilling prediction about the end of the world. According to her, humanity will face terrible trials that are barely survivable. Akhmetjanova believes that before the end of the world, humans will pollute the rivers, turn away from nature, and the Earth will quickly spin out of control. She claims that the planet will live for 3600 years and that humanity will survive two nuclear wars. Akhmetjanova also predicts a massive eruption in Siberia, which will occur between 2044-2046. She believes that a nuclear war will break out, and Siberia will be bombed, causing a massive earthquake. Akhmetjanova also warns that people should be careful about the energy they surround themselves with, as even money obtained through dark means can have a negative impact. She advises people to be mindful of their energy and to avoid carrying the karma of others, especially if their partner is involved in dark activities. 'If your husband is a scoundrel, and you live with him, sleep with him, then you're carrying his karma, bearing his sins. His dark forces protect him, and if you're weak, they'll devour you. A wife can work off her husband's karma, take his sins on her shoulders, and carry them further. What to do? Leave, of course. It's better to die standing up than to spend your whole life on your knees, carrying someone else's sins!' - Akhmetjanova said on her YouTube channel.

**Cosmic Neutrino with Record-Breaking Energy Detected in Mediterranean Sea**
Neutrinos, elementary particles that interact very weakly with matter, are of great interest to scientists. They are 'cosmic messengers' that can provide valuable information about astrophysical phenomena, such as supernovae explosions, neutron star mergers, and black hole activity. However, detecting these particles is extremely challenging. To detect a neutrino, an enormous volume of water is needed, equivalent to 400,000 Olympic-sized pools. The 'Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT)' is a detector located in the Mediterranean Sea, which is still under construction. On February 13, 2023, a muon, a heavy electron produced by a neutrino, was detected in the ARCA detector, inducing signals in over a third of the active sensors. The neutrino had an energy of 220 peta-electronvolts (PeV), a value never before observed on Earth. According to Aart Heijboer, a professor at the Dutch Institute for Subatomic Physics (Nikhef) and a member of the KM3NeT collaboration, this energy is equivalent to a ping-pong ball falling from a height of one meter, but contained in a single elementary particle. The origin of the neutrino is likely cosmic, and its distance from the event that produced it is unknown, but 'it's almost certain that it didn't come from our galaxy', said Damien Dornic, an investigator at the KM3NeT collaboration.

**Asteroid 2024 YR4: A 1.5% Chance of Collision with Earth in 2032**
According to calculations, the asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 1.5% chance of colliding with Earth in 2032, making it the highest threat among all known potentially hazardous celestial bodies. The asteroid is estimated to be between 40 and 100 meters in size, and its impact could be a significant event, comparable to the Tunguska meteorite. The discovery was made using the ATLAS system, a network of four robotic telescopes located in different parts of the world. The system scans the sky every night and is designed to detect close, near-Earth asteroids, even those of small size. The telescopes take four photos of each quarter of the visible sky, with a 12-minute interval, allowing them to detect the movement of nearby objects against the background of stars. The images are then analyzed by a computer, which checks if the detected object is a new, previously unknown celestial body. If confirmed, the program evaluates the asteroid's trajectory to assess the potential danger. The likelihood of detection by the ATLAS system depends on the asteroid's size and orbit: a 100-meter asteroid can be detected about three weeks before impact, while a 10-meter asteroid can be detected only two days before.
