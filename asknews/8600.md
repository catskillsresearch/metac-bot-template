**Semaglutida Reduces Cardiovascular Events in People with Obesity, Even Before Significant Weight Loss**
A new analysis of the SELECT clinical trial has revealed that semaglutida, initially approved for treating obesity, reduces severe cardiovascular events in just a few weeks, even before patients have lost significant weight. The study, presented at the 32nd European Congress on Obesity (ECO), found that administering 2.4 milligrams of semaglutida per week to adults with obesity and pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) resulted in a 37% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within the first three months of treatment. This decrease includes heart attacks, strokes, or deaths from cardiovascular causes. By six months, the risk of cardiovascular death decreased by 50% compared to the placebo group. The study's lead author, Dr. Jorge Plutzky, noted that 'the benefits were already evident in the first six months, and even before any significant weight loss and before most patients had been titrated to their full dose of 2.4 mg.' The results suggest that semaglutida's early action in reducing cardiovascular events may be independent of weight loss. Semaglutida is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that mimics the functions of natural incretins, which regulate blood glucose levels and signal satiety to the central nervous system. The study's findings have significant implications for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with obesity, which is a major cause of death worldwide. According to the study, two out of every three people with obesity die from cardiovascular causes. The results of the SELECT trial suggest that pharmacological intervention may play a complementary role to traditional strategies in preventing cardiovascular events.

**Regeneron (REGN) Phase 2 Trial Shows Promising Obesity Treatment**
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has released interim findings from its Phase 2 COURAGE study, which explores new treatment approaches for obesity. The trial examines the effects of semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, in combination with trevogrumab, with or without garetosmab. Results indicate that participants who received semaglutide paired with trevogrumab retained more lean mass while achieving greater fat reduction. However, the addition of garetosmab resulted in higher dropout rates due to side effects. The study aims to improve the quality of weight loss by preserving muscle mass while reducing fat. Analysts forecast Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' stock to reach an average price of $771.84, with a potential upside of 57.43% from the current price of $490.28.

**Interim Results from Ongoing Phase 2 COURAGE Trial Confirm Potential to Improve the Quality of Semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist)-induced Weight Loss by Preserving Lean Mass | Taiwan News | Jun. 2, 2025 19:00**
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has announced interim results from the ongoing Phase 2 COURAGE trial investigating novel combinations of semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and trevogrumab (anti-GDF8/anti-myostatin) with or without garetosmab (anti-activin A) for the treatment of obesity. The trial demonstrated that approximately 35% of semaglutide-induced weight loss was due to loss of lean mass. Combining semaglutide with trevogrumab with or without garetosmab helped preserve lean mass while increasing loss of fat mass. The combination of semaglutide with trevogrumab was generally well-tolerated, but the triplet combination of semaglutide with both antibodies had a substantially higher rate of discontinuations due to tolerability issues and other adverse events. 'These early insights from the COURAGE trial are consistent with recently published pre-clinical data in rodents and non-human primates, and clearly establish the principle that blocking GDF8 with or without activin A can preserve muscle and further increase fat loss in patients being treated with GLP-1 therapy, thereby improving the quality of weight loss,' said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board Co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. The full data set will be available later this year and will provide further insights to help optimize the dosing regimens in future trials.

**Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN) Announces Promising Interim**
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc has released interim results from its Phase 2 COURAGE trial, which combines semaglutide with muscle-preserving antibodies trevogrumab and garetosmab for obesity treatment. The trial showed that the combination therapies preserved 50%-80% of lean mass and increased fat loss compared to semaglutide alone, which led to a 35% loss of lean mass. However, the triplet therapy had a higher rate of adverse events and treatment discontinuations, with two deaths reported. The full data set is expected to be available later this year. The promising results may lead to a competitive edge over existing therapies, but the safety profile remains a concern that could impact marketability.

**Pharmaceuticals Rush to Create Next Weight Loss Pill**
For decades, obesity was seen as a 'lack of motivation' and people with obesity or excess weight were advised to 'exercise more and eat less'. However, according to El País, this approach only works in the short term for over 80% of cases. Obesity is considered an 'epidemic of the 21st century' and the numbers are clear: this disease affects almost one in eight people worldwide. Medications belonging to the GLP-1 receptor agonist class have emerged as a powerful tool in the fight against obesity, leading to weight losses of up to 24% in clinical trials, and the pharmaceutical industry is not stopping there. The big pharmaceutical companies have quickly joined the race for weight loss treatments, and according to El País, there are already over 100 new candidates for obesity medications in testing, a global market that could reach $100 billion by 2030. Novo Nordisk, the Danish company currently the most valuable in Europe thanks to its GLP-1 receptor agonist medications, is testing a wide range of drugs, including Cagrisema, a weekly injection that combines GLP-1 with an analog of amylina, a hormone that delays gastric emptying and reduces appetite. In a clinical trial presented in December, Cagrisema showed a mean weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks of treatment - results that the market considered a disappointment, leading to a drop in the company's shares. As these new obesity medications are administered through a subcutaneous injection (which is not always convenient), the next step will be to develop a medication that can be taken orally - in June last year, the president of AstraZeneca announced in Cambridge that the Anglo-Swedish company plans to develop an oral combined agent to treat people with excess weight and other comorbidities, with other companies (such as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk) also developing similar medications. According to information released by the multinational IQVIA, specialized in health information, there were 157 medications for obesity in clinical trials at the beginning of this year, covering more than 60 mechanisms of action, with 43% of all these drugs corresponding to oral therapies. It is worth noting that there is already an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist medication: Rybelsus, which is marketed in Portugal and has semaglutide as its active substance (like Ozempic), but is only indicated and subsidized for the treatment of type 2 diabetes - and not obesity. On the other hand, there are also oral treatments for obesity (such as Mysimba and Xenical), but they do not belong to this new class of medications and do not have the same mechanism of action. As happens in other areas, the development of alternative therapeutic options for obesity has turned to personalized medicine, and it is here that pharmaceutical companies can also make a difference. 'So far, we have been working by trial and error, but now we are close to having tools to measure which hormone is missing from our patient', explained Andreea Ciudin, coordinator of the obesity treatment unit at the Hospital Vall d'Hebron in Barcelona, Spain, cited by El País. One of the most important consequences of the emergence of other medications for obesity would be to increase accessibility and reduce costs, allowing access to more and more people.

**Semaglutide: Reversing Fatty Liver Disease and Protecting Kidney Health - Gringo Gazette**
Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has shown promise in reversing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and protecting kidney health. Recent studies have demonstrated its potential in reducing liver inflammation and fat accumulation, as well as mitigating the risks of kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The FDA has approved semaglutide for reducing the risk of kidney disease progression in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the FDA is phasing out the allowance for compounding pharmacies to produce semaglutide, making it less accessible to those who need it. This decision has been met with criticism, particularly from those who rely on affordable access to these medications. It is essential to consider potential side effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms and pancreatitis, and to work with a licensed doctor to ensure proper dosing and screening. 'We are lucky to have compounded GLPs still available here in Cabo San Lucas,' says the author, recommending a licensed doctor for referrals. 'The doctor I recommend here is taking very careful measures to ensure my referrals for compounded Semaglutide and Tirzepatide are being properly screened and dosed correctly.'

**Novo Nordisk's Semaglutide 25mg Oral Formulation: A Breakthrough in Obesity Treatment**
Novo Nordisk has developed a new 25mg oral formulation of semaglutide, aiming to provide personalized and accessible therapeutic options for the growing need to address obesity, which affects around 40% of the adult population in the US. According to the OASIS 4 clinical trial results, the oral formulation of semaglutide showed a significant reduction in body weight, with a mean weight loss of 13.6% in the semaglutide group compared to 2.2% in the placebo group after 64 weeks. The results also showed that 79.2% of patients treated with semaglutide achieved a weight loss of 5% or more, compared to 31.1% of patients treated with placebo. The safety profile of the oral formulation was consistent with that of GLP-1 agonists, with gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and diarrhea being the most common, but generally manageable. The clinical impact of semaglutide is significant, as obesity is a chronic, progressive, and multifactorial disease that requires long-term strategies that integrate pharmacological interventions, lifestyle changes, and, in severe cases, surgical approaches. The FDA's decision on the approval of the new oral formulation of semaglutide is expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. If approved, it would be the first oral GLP-1 agonist approved for the chronic management of weight, opening new therapeutic prospects for millions of people with obesity or overweight.

**Novo Nordisk's Semaglutide 2.4 mg: A Breakthrough in Obesity Treatment**
Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of semaglutide, stated that 'obesity is not just a number on the scale.' According to the company, semaglutide 2.4 mg is the only GLP-1-based obesity medication approved to prevent major cardiovascular events, such as heart death, heart attack, and stroke. The company commented on the results of the Surmount-5 study conducted by Lilly, which compared tirzepatide 15 mg to semaglutide 2.4 mg. The study found that the weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was lower than that demonstrated in the Step-1 clinical trial, which showed a median weight loss of 17% and one in three participants lost 20% of their weight. Novo Nordisk also highlighted that they are currently conducting the Step Up study on a higher dose of semaglutide 7.2 mg, which showed preliminary results of a 20.7% weight loss and one in three participants losing at least a quarter of their weight, with a 'positive and comparable' safety, tolerance, and gastrointestinal side effect profile to the Step study. The company plans to submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 'in the second half of 2025'.

**Beyond Ozempic: New Medications for Obesity**
Beyond Ozempic: new medications for obesity. The semaglutide, popularly known as Ozempic, has become a cultural and commercial phenomenon. Its success has sparked debates about its use, availability, new uses, and long-term consequences. Novo Nordisk has commercialized three brands of semaglutide: Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. Other pharmaceutical companies have developed similar treatments for diabetes and obesity. Lilly has developed and commercialized tirzepatida, a new medication that mimics the actions of incretins, but with some differences in its mechanism of action. Tirzepatida is sold under the names Mounjaro and Zepbound. Tirzepatida acts on the GLP-1 and GIP receptors, reducing blood sugar and promoting weight loss. It has been shown to be more effective than semaglutide in reducing weight, with a 22% reduction in body weight compared to 16% for semaglutida. The most common side effects are similar to those of semaglutide, affecting the digestive tract. The tirzepatida is approved and authorized by the FDA and EMA since April 2022, but has been delayed in arriving at Spanish pharmacies. It is not funded by the Spanish public system and its price can range from 270 to 350 euros. BPR, a promising contender. Scientists at Stanford Medicine have developed a natural molecule that could offer an alternative to semaglutide and tirzepatida. The molecule, called BRP, acts specifically on the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates appetite and metabolism. Experiments in rats and pigs have shown that BRP has fewer side effects than semaglutide. However, more research is needed to understand its effects and safety in humans.

**New Weight Loss Medications for 2025: A Breakthrough in Obesity Treatment**
The growing global demand for weight loss medications has driven the development of a new generation of drugs that could revolutionize current treatments. By 2025, the pharmaceutical industry plans to launch innovations that not only facilitate weight reduction but also provide metabolic and cardiovascular benefits. Among the most popular treatments are Ozempic and Wegovy, based on semaglutide, which have shown positive results in appetite control and blood sugar regulation. However, their high costs, the need for weekly injections, and long-term dependence have led to the search for more efficient options. One of them is tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro and Zepbound, which showed a 20% reduction in body weight in 72 weeks in clinical trials. It acts on two key hormones: GLP-1 and GIP, optimizing fat metabolism and reducing fat accumulation around the heart. An upcoming study in 2025 will further evaluate its effects on people with obesity and diabetes. Another promising advance is retatrutide, an experimental drug that activates GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon simultaneously. In clinical studies, participants experienced a 24% average weight reduction in 11 months, surpassing tirzepatide and semaglutide. It is currently in phase III trials, with approval expected in 2026. To avoid frequent injections, Orforglipron presents itself as an oral option with daily administration. Initial studies showed a 10% weight reduction in 26 weeks, with improvements in blood pressure and lipid levels. Its approval could be given in 2026. One of the main challenges of current treatments is the rebound effect after stopping the medication. MariTide, a monthly injection, has demonstrated its ability to maintain weight loss for months after the last dose. In preliminary studies, participants reduced up to 20% of their weight in 52 weeks. Developed by Novo Nordisk, CagriSema combines semaglutide with cagrilintide, a compound that enhances the feeling of satiety. In 68-week studies, participants achieved a 23% weight reduction. Its phase III trial is expected to conclude in 2025. Beyond these medications, the industry is investigating in 2025 treatments based on synthetic amylase, a hormone that regulates sugar and appetite without affecting muscle mass. Inhibitors of cannabinoid receptors are also being studied to reduce hunger in a more natural and sustainable way.

**Rani Therapeutics Announces Preclinical Data Demonstrating Successful Oral Delivery of Semaglutide via RaniPill® HC**
Rani Therapeutics announced preclinical data demonstrating the successful oral delivery of semaglutide via the RaniPill HC (RT-116) capsule. The results showed comparable bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and weight loss to subcutaneous administration of semaglutide. The study found that semaglutide administered via the RaniPill HC capsule was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. The data adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the RaniPill platform's potential to enable oral delivery of multiple obesity treatments. Rani Therapeutics is planning to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of RT-114, a GLP-1/GLP-2 dual agonist for the treatment of obesity, in 2025. 'We believe these data provide further validation of the RaniPill oral delivery platform across a wide variety of injectable obesity treatments,' said Talat Imran, Chief Executive Officer of Rani Therapeutics. 'The target product profile of semaglutide in the RaniPill capsule would be once-weekly oral administration of semaglutide therapy, which we believe may be more convenient for patients and could lead to improved adherence.' 'There are currently no approved orally-administered GLP-1 agonists on the market for the treatment of obesity,' said Jesper Høiland, Senior Strategic Advisor for Rani Therapeutics and former executive at Novo Nordisk. 'While RYBELSUS is an oral version of semaglutide approved to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, it requires daily administration at a significantly higher dose than the subcutaneous equivalent. In comparison, the RaniPill HC harnesses advanced technology to deliver the same dose as the subcutaneous injection of semaglutide with expected weekly oral administration.'
