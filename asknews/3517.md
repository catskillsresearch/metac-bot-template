**UK Plans to Expand Nuclear Arsenal, Sparking Concerns of Escalating Nuclear Threats**
The UK plans to expand its nuclear arsenal to 'reduce the risk of nuclear conflict', according to The Sunday Times. The British government is negotiating with the Pentagon to purchase F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying B61 thermonuclear bombs. The move is seen as a signal to Russia, with the new defense strategy to be presented on June 2, 2025, specifically aimed at Russia. However, the plan has its drawbacks, including a long waitlist for American jets and the possibility of Donald Trump blocking the deal. Colonel Andrei Koshkin, a military expert, believes that Trump's desire for a Nobel Peace Prize will not hinder the sale of jets to the UK. 'He will sell these planes, they are expensive,' Koshkin said. 'The Americans will sell them to the British, they are Anglo-Saxons. The Americans remember that the English oppressed them, the Americans traveled well to the English and showed them where they belong, but in this case, America is selling to Britain. The sale of American arms, its spread, especially in the European part, is to a significant extent the takeover of the main players in Europe under their influence.' Koshkin also noted that the F-35A is programmed and can perform functions determined by Washington, and those who buy the planes understand this factor. Finally, the US wants to upgrade its nuclear shield and help its allies obtain American-made nuclear weapons, which would allow them to contain not only Russia but also China. 'This is a serious threat not only to us but to the whole world,' Koshkin said. 'This is an escalation of nuclear threats. We see that the nuclear club of states is expanding, and this type of infrastructure, which is also equipped with American-made nuclear weapons, naturally very seriously exacerbates the situation. The United States sees a multipolar world through certain blocks, and their block they position as dominant, while they see Russia and China as opponents. In the end, there is an understanding that no one will help us except ourselves, and we need to work on perfecting our nuclear shield, technologies, strategy, and tactics for the use of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. We must maintain our mark in the world nuclear infrastructure as the second nuclear power in the world, possessing a nuclear triad. We cannot be satisfied with our achievements.'

**Nikola Tesla's Prophecy : The Silent War of Artificial Intelligence**
Nikola Tesla predicted in 1898 that future wars would be waged with intelligence and remotely controlled machines, rather than bullets and bombs. He believed that when both sides can calculate the outcome with certainty, the rational choice would be surrender. Today, Tesla's vision of 'teleautomata' or remotely controlled warfare is a reality, with global powers already engaging in silent wars of artificial intelligence. As Tesla said, 'War will cease to be possible, when all the world knows tomorrow that the most feeble of nations can supply itself immediately with a weapon which will render its coast secure and its ports impregnable.'

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**UK to Build 12 Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines to Counter Russian Aggression**
The United Kingdom will build 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of the AUKUS program to 'push back against Russian aggression.' The fleet will be expanded with SSN-AUKUS submarines equipped with nuclear reactors and conventional armament. They will be developed within the AUKUS - a military alliance between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. According to 'Glavkom' citing the government's website, Defense Minister John Gille said, 'We know that threats are growing, and we must act decisively to push back against Russian aggression.' The activation of the SSN-AUKUS program will also lead to the expansion of the country's industrial capabilities, with a new submarine being built every 18 months. The announcement of the submarine construction is scheduled for June 2, as part of the Prime Minister's Kir Starmer's strategic defense review, which will contain 62 recommendations for strengthening defense and list the main threats to the country. The UK is also in talks with the US to purchase F-35A Lightning fighter jets capable of carrying B61-12 thermonuclear bombs, which will be the largest step in the UK's deterrence efforts since the Cold War.

**UK Expands Nuclear Capabilities Amid Russian Threat**
The UK plans to acquire F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons as part of a major expansion of its deterrent capabilities. The UK has begun negotiations with the US to purchase the jets, which can carry the B61-12 thermonuclear bombs. This move is part of a broader effort to adapt to the changing security landscape, with the UK recognizing that the world is entering a new, more dangerous nuclear era. According to sources, the UK government has already approved the plan, and talks with the Pentagon have taken place. The UK's Defense Minister, John Gille, has stated that the lesson from the Ukraine conflict is that a country's military strength is only as strong as the industry behind it. Gille also acknowledged the need to adapt to new challenges, saying, 'The lesson of Ukraine is that the strength of a country's armed forces is only as strong as the industry that stands behind them.' The UK's strategic defense review, expected to be presented on Monday, will reportedly recommend considering the UK's participation in the expansion of the NATO nuclear program in Europe. However, the Defense Minister refused to comment on the progress of the negotiations, stating that the UK needs to adapt to new challenges.

**'Lurching towards war': UK plans for 'fighter jets carrying nuclear bombs' slammed**
The UK Government is reportedly planning to purchase fighter jets that can carry nuclear bombs, a move that would be the biggest expansion of the UK's nuclear deterrent since the Cold War. Defence Secretary John Healey refused to comment on the talks, but the strategic defence review, due to be published on Monday, will suggest the UK looks at expanding its nuclear capability. The F-35A jets would carry American B61 thermonuclear bombs, and the UK's nuclear arsenal would be expanded under NATO's nuclear-sharing arrangements. Critics, including David Kelly of the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Scottish Greens leader Patrick Harvie, have slammed the plans, calling them 'lurching towards war' and 'immoral and unsafe'. The UK Government has pledged £1.5 billion for munitions factories, with one rumoured to be in Scotland, and will support the procurement of up to 7000 UK-built long-range weapons. Healey said the additional funding for defence was a 'message to Moscow'.

**The UK Has Decided To Buy Additional Nuclear Fighter Jets From The US**
The UK has initiated talks with the US to purchase F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying B61-12 thermonuclear bombs, citing the growing threat from Russia. The decision was approved by Prime Minister Kir Starmer, marking the most significant change to Britain's nuclear deterrent since the Cold War. The F-35A will have a longer range of 1,400 kilometers and can be used in situations that do not involve a full-scale war. Defense Minister John Healey acknowledged that Britain must adapt to a 'new era of threats,' stating, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. And we are facing real threats of interstate conflict for the first time since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also investing 6 billion pounds ($8.1 billion) in the creation and procurement of munitions, including building six new military factories that will provide 1,000 jobs.

**UK Begins Negotiations to Purchase F-35A Fighter Jets Amid Growing Russian Threat**
The UK has begun negotiations with the US to purchase F-35A fighter jets, which can carry the B61-12 thermonuclear bomb. The decision was made in response to the growing threat from Russia, according to The Times. The initiative has been approved by Prime Minister Kier Starmer. The purchase of the jets will be the most significant change to the UK's nuclear deterrent system since the Cold War. The UK has already ordered 48 F-35B jets for its two aircraft carriers, with 47 already received. The F-35A Lightning has a longer range of 1,400 km and will be the second component of the UK's nuclear deterrent system. They can be used in situations that do not involve a full-scale war and can be deployed directly on the battlefield, which is not currently possible for the UK. The F-35A will partially replace the European Eurofighter Typhoon, which is inferior in characteristics. The Royal Air Force plans to retire 49 of these aircraft. Defense Minister John Healy refused to comment on the negotiations, but acknowledged that the UK must adapt to the 'new era of threats'. 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are growing. And we are facing real threats of interstate conflict for the first time since the end of the Cold War,' he said. The UK's nuclear arsenal is currently located on four Vanguard-class nuclear submarines. In December, it was also reported that the US plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the Lake Henwick military base in Suffolk in the coming years. In addition to expanding its nuclear arsenal, the UK government is investing £6 billion ($8.1 billion) in the development and procurement of ammunition. £1.5 billion of this amount will be spent on the construction of six new military factories, which will create 1,000 jobs. The Royal Navy also wants to increase the number of destroyers and frigates from 14 to 25.

**From moonshots to megawatts: Fusion's Cold War moment**
The pursuit of nuclear fusion, a clean and abundant energy source, is being driven by intense competition among the U.S., China, and Europe. This rivalry is reminiscent of the Cold War-era space race, which propelled humanity forward with unprecedented technological achievements. Private and national fusion efforts, such as Commonwealth Fusion Systems and the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak, are making rapid progress, while the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a multinational collaboration, has faced significant delays. The historical parallels suggest that competitive dynamics can accelerate progress in ways that international collaborations often cannot. As the world faces the challenges of climate change and increasing energy demands, the fusion race is not just a technological competition, but a vital competition for human survival and global prosperity.

**The World on the Brink of a Climate Apocalypse: Experts Warn of the Dangers of Nuclear War**
The world is on the brink of a climate apocalypse caused by nuclear war, not gradual greenhouse gas emissions. The possibility of such an event has become more apparent due to the conflict between India and Pakistan. According to Ted Nordhaus, an expert on ecology for The Wall Street Journal, a nuclear war would lead to an immediate nuclear winter. 'The worst consequences unfold long after the weapons detonate. A massive thermonuclear exchange would envelop the atmosphere in soot, plunging the world into darkness and starting a decade-long winter,' Nordhaus said. While hundreds of millions of people would likely die in the initial fires, the majority of the planet's population, including those in warring countries, would likely die from subsequent winter famine, he wrote. Nordhaus also noted that a regional conflict, such as between India and Pakistan, could be more limited, with only a few million deaths and little impact on global temperature. However, if India were to bomb Islamabad and Pakistan were to retaliate by bombing Mumbai, it would be difficult to prevent further escalation. Moreover, if intercontinental ballistic missiles were in the air, other nuclear states would be unable to determine their destination, Nordhaus emphasized. 'Leaders in Washington, Moscow, and Beijing would have to make a decision within minutes to launch their weapons. Scenarios of medium level, including several hundred warheads, would lead to a cooling of the climate, sufficient to destroy global food production and trade, and would likely kill hundreds of millions of people,' Nordhaus predicted. In the worst-case scenario, droughts and crop failures would spread rapidly around the world, resulting in hundreds of millions of refugees migrating to other continents in search of food, safety, and shelter. However, some would die from diseases and others from hunger. Therefore, as Nordhaus wrote, in such a scenario, human civilization would come to an end. 'The regime of arms control, which world leaders have carefully built over the past stages of the Cold War, is crumbling into pieces. In February next year, the term of the new Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed in 2010, will expire, which limits the number of deployed warheads in Russia and the United States to 1550 units - this is still enough to destroy civilization. Russia and the United States have over 5,000 warheads in reserve,' Nordhaus reminded. He also noted that conflicts between nuclear opponents remind humanity that there is no greater risk to society than nuclear war. 'Zero nuclear weapons may be as unattainable a dream as zero carbon emissions, but for politicians, philanthropists, and leaders of civil society, regardless of their political views, there should be no higher priority than de-escalating this threat,' Nordhaus concluded. Earlier, Axios reported that the US plans to spend one trillion dollars on nuclear weapons over the next 10 years, a sum greater than what is spent on many federal agencies. According to experts, this would require the US Department of Defense to make a 'difficult choice' about which programs to continue. Meanwhile, analysts also say that 'rapidly rising costs' divert resources away from 'other more pressing human needs and national security priorities.' General Nikolai Filatov also responded to whether Ukrainian forces would shoot down enemy missiles with nuclear warheads. According to him, Ukrainian forces should shoot down these enemy targets without immediately determining whether they are nuclear or not. He also explained whether there would be a detonation in the event of shooting down a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead, using the example of short- and medium-range missiles. 'When they shoot down short- and medium-range missiles, theoretically, the warhead should not detonate. Depending on where they hit. If they hit the engine and it is damaged - one situation, i.e., the missile will fall and there will be no explosion. Regarding the warhead, we need to explain the principle of operation. The warhead is composed of several segments, located so that there is no uncontrolled chain reaction. When applying these parts of the charge, they rapidly approach each other, a critical mass forms - a nuclear explosion occurs,' Filatov said.

**Global Nuclear Fusion Project Ready With World's Most Powerful Magnet**
The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, a global nuclear fusion project involving over 30 countries, has completed the final component of its magnetic system, the central solenoid. The system is crucial for creating an 'invisible cage' to confine super-hot plasma particles that combine and fuse to release energy. According to ITER's director general, Pietro Barabaschi, 'It is like the bottle in a bottle of wine: of course the wine is maybe more important than the bottle, but you need the bottle in order to put the wine inside.' The project, originally scheduled for completion in 2021, has been delayed by four years. However, Barabaschi claims that the 'crisis' is over and construction is proceeding at the fastest pace in ITER's history. The start-up phase of the project is scheduled to begin in 2033, when it is expected to start generating plasma. Barabaschi remains sceptical about the feasibility of commercial fusion reactors within a decade, stating, 'We already know that we can get fusion... The question is, are we going to get fusion in such a way that it would be cost-effective? I am quite sceptical that we will be able to achieve this within, say, one or even two decades. Frankly speaking, it will take more time.'

**Pentagon is preparing a potential war with Iran and its regional partners - Drago Bosnic**
The United States has been implementing a nuclear sharing policy with NATO member states for over 60 years. This policy has led to the deployment of nuclear weapons in several countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Turkey. Currently, there are at least 100 B61 variable yield thermonuclear gravity bombs stored in bases across these countries. According to Drago Bosnic, the Pentagon is preparing for a potential war with Iran and its regional partners, and it's possible that the US will expand its nuclear delivery systems in the future, including near Russian borders. Bosnic notes that the ability of these weapons to be used for nuclear war is limited, as they can only be delivered by aircraft. However, he warns that the US and its allies may seek to expand their capabilities in the future.

**Baba Vanga's 2025 Predictions: A Major War in Europe and Global Economic Collapse**
Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic, is believed to have predicted several events, including the 9/11 attacks and Princess Diana's death. According to her predictions, a major war will break out in Europe in 2025, leading to a significant decrease in population. Additionally, a global economic collapse is expected, marking the beginning of humanity's downfall. It is also believed that the world will end in 5079. Other predictions include: humans discovering a new energy source on Venus in 2028, the melting of polar ice caps causing sea levels to rise in 2033, the spread of communism worldwide in 2076, humanity establishing communication with aliens in 2130, a global drought threatening the world in 2170, a war between Earth and Mars colonies in 3005, and the world becoming uninhabitable in 3797, forcing humans to migrate to other planets. While Baba Vanga's predictions are often disputed, the recent earthquake in Myanmar has sparked renewed interest in her prophecies.

**Scientists Suggest Detonating a Thermonuclear Bomb to Save the Environment**
Andrew Haverly, a scientist from Rochester Institute of Technology (USA), has proposed detonating a massive nuclear bomb to save the environment. According to Haverly, a thermonuclear explosion at the bottom of the ocean could significantly delay the rise in global temperature. He suggests that the explosion would break down basalt rocks into particles that could react with carbon dioxide and neutralize it. Haverly estimates that the bomb should have a power of around 81 megatons, which is 1600 times more powerful than the 'Tsar Bomba' thermonuclear bomb. He proposes placing the charges under the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean, which is located at a depth of about five kilometers. Haverly notes that the basalt would absorb not only carbon dioxide but also a significant portion of the radioactive fallout. However, he acknowledges that the radioactive background at the blast site would increase in the long term, potentially leading to some casualties, but considers this a 'drop in the ocean' compared to the current rate of radiation release. Haverly points out that humanity releases massive amounts of radiation into the atmosphere every year, equivalent to 2000 nuclear bombs, and notes that climate change will threaten 30 million lives by 2100.

**Scientist Proposes Underground Thermonuclear Explosion to Combat Global Warming**
Andrew Haverly, a graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology, has proposed a highly ambitious and contentious theory to combat global warming. In his new study, he suggests conducting an underground thermonuclear explosion with a power of 81 gigatons, 1600 times more powerful than the most powerful 'Tsar Bomba' in history. According to Haverly, such an explosion would release basalt particles that would react with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, significantly reducing its levels. Haverly proposes conducting the explosion under the Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Ocean at a depth of about 5 kilometers, where radiation releases would be minimal due to the absorption by the basalt and water. He claims that this would lower carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to values from 30 years ago, significantly slowing down climate change. According to his calculations, the method would cost only $10 billion, much cheaper than the potential damage from warming by 2100, which is estimated to be up to $100 trillion. Haverly is convinced that this explosion would save millions of lives, as climate change could lead to catastrophic consequences, including mass migrations and loss of life in hot regions. However, the proposed idea has sparked a wave of criticism from experts. Scientists such as Mark Jacobson from Stanford University argue that such a measure is not only unlikely to be effective in capturing carbon dioxide, but also may lead to unpredictable environmental consequences. Moreover, using thermonuclear weapons for such purposes is dangerous due to the risks of radioactive contamination, which would be harder to control than Haverly suggests. In response to these concerns, many experts argue that solutions to combat warming should be more sustainable and less extreme. Reducing carbon emissions through the development of alternative energy sources, restoring forest ecosystems, and technological innovations in carbon capture are considered much safer and more promising methods.

**Scientists Propose Detonating 1600 Thermonuclear Bombs to Combat Global Warming**
Scientists propose detonating over 1600 thermonuclear bombs underwater to help mitigate global warming. According to researchers, this would accelerate the natural process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They suggest that thermonuclear explosions could help quickly break down silicate rocks, such as basalt, which would facilitate the binding of carbon dioxide and its removal from the atmosphere. However, the idea of using nuclear weapons to combat climate change raises many questions and concerns. Researchers assure that their method would be safe and effective, with the charges placed 4 km underwater and 8 km beneath the ocean floor. The water pressure would absorb the shockwave, and the power of the explosions would quickly break down the rocks. Meanwhile, the level of radiation would be minimal, and the ocean's ecosystem would be almost unaffected. The expected effect of such a large number of explosions would be equivalent to removing 30 years' worth of CO2 emissions. Scientists believe that this is necessary to prevent catastrophic consequences of global warming, such as ocean acidification and coral reef death. However, despite the researchers' assurances, the question of safety remains open and requires further study. 'We need to think outside the box and consider radical solutions to address this pressing issue,' said Dr. Elin, a researcher involved in the study. 'This is not a trivial matter, and we must be careful not to cause unintended harm to the environment.'
