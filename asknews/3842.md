**Slavov's Proposal: Time as a Multitude of Simultaneous Realities**
Philosopher Matias Slavov proposes a new vision of time, where past, present, and future exist simultaneously, like pages of a book already written. He combines the eternalism theory, which states that past, present, and future exist at the same time, with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. According to Slavov, this unification offers a new way to understand time as multiple, relative, and fully real in all its forms. He argues that the uncertainty of the future in quantum mechanics does not mean it does not exist, but rather that there are multiple possible futures, all equally real, although only one manifests for each observer. This vision does not deny the reality of time, but rather expands it, suggesting that there is not a single future, but many, each with its own timeline. Slavov also draws an analogy between the concept of 'now' in eternalism and the concept of 'current world' in the many-worlds theory, where there is no privileged moment or world. Each observer has their own 'now', their own universe, and their own history. This idea is related to the relativistic physics, which has already shown that time is not absolute. Slavov's proposal is that time is a network of trajectories, where each branch represents a different story, and each story exists, although we cannot see or experience the others. He also suggests that time itself could be 'ramified', with multiple timelines existing, although we cannot access them. Even a less radical version of this idea, where a single universe internally branches, leads to the same conclusion: there are many presents coexisting. The notion of a single 'now' true for all beings and places loses sense, and a complex structure emerges, where all moments and all realities exist, although they are out of our reach.

**Survey Reveals 61% of Turks Want Early General Election**
A recent survey conducted by TÜSİAR found that 61.28% of respondents want an early general election in Turkey, while 37.02% are against it. The survey, which was conducted through CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing) method, polled 3,177 voters. According to the results, the majority of the respondents, 'believe that an early general election should be held in Turkey,' as stated by the survey. This outcome may come as a surprise to President Erdoğan, who will have to 'think twice' about the current situation.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**The 2D Universe of Collapse: Why Measurement Ends Possibility**
Florin Ghidan presents a critique of the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics, arguing that it fails to account for the dimensional reduction, irreversibility, and informational finality of measurement. Ghidan proposes that when a photon interacts with a macroscopic detection surface, such as a screen in a delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, it does not merely branch, but terminates, collapsing into a 2D entropic boundary that absorbs the photon's energy and irreversibly deletes its informational degrees of freedom. This process constitutes an ontological event: a real collapse. Ghidan contends that MWI assumes unitary evolution and preserves information in the global wavefunction, but the interaction with the screen violates these assumptions, demonstrating that information is destroyed at the boundary and collapse occurs before any observer arrives. Ghidan's model preserves the data of entanglement and quantum correlations but frames them in terms of informational finality, not branching.

**Right-wing block consolidates with absolute majority, left-wing space weakened**
Recent polls confirm a clear trend: the right-wing block formed by the Partido Popular (PP) and Vox would consolidate with an absolute majority if elections were held today. According to Sigma Dos for El Mundo, the PP would achieve 149 seats, 12 more than in 2023, and Vox would rise to 39, its best result in two years. The sum would reach 188 seats, a comfortable absolute majority in a 350-seat Congress. El País and ABC polls also show a similar trend, with the PP-Vox block leading the left-wing block that supported Pedro Sánchez in November 2023. The PSOE has shown a slight improvement, but it would not be able to revalidate the absolute majority. According to El Mundo, the PSOE would get 118 seats, three less than in 2023, and a five-tenth increase in intention of vote. The polls also reflect a decline in the left-wing space, with Junts, one of the key pillars of Sánchez's investiture, obtaining only five seats, the worst result in its history. Sumar and Podemos show slight improvements, but their growth does not compensate for the global decline of the space they once represented. Pedro Sánchez is the best-valued leader and the most mentioned as the preferred candidate to occupy the presidency of the Government, according to 40dB. However, GAD3's poll for ABC offers a different reading, placing Alberto Núñez Feijóo as the best-valued leader, ahead of Sánchez, Yolanda Díaz, and Santiago Abascal. The rejection of current leaders grows: 25.4% of respondents answer that 'none' of the proposed names would be a good president, 10 points more than in 2023.

**The Invention of the Fourth and Fifth Age**
The concept of the fourth and fifth age is emerging as the global population ages. According to the World Health Organization, in 2020, the population over 60 surpassed that of children under 5 for the first time. By 2050, there will be over 2 billion people over 60 worldwide. In the US, centenarians are expected to quadruple in the next three decades. Harvard researcher David Sinclair predicts that the first person to live to 150 is already alive, and that advances in AI will accelerate discoveries and help find cures for complex diseases. However, there is a lack of thought and writing on how new older adults will adopt new customs, what social rules they will establish, and how they will differ from each other. Journalist Dariela Sosa has launched an investigation into this topic, asking questions such as how families with four or five generations will function, and how inheritances will be transferred between generations. The concept of retirement may also be replaced by new rhythms of work, pause, and re-invention. The invention of the fourth and fifth age is underway, and we are creating a new universe of ideas, objects, and interpretations.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Squamish editorial: Majority support seasonal campfire ban to prevent wildfires, poll shows**
A recent poll of 404 readers by the Squamish Chief showed that 55% of respondents support a seasonal ban on campfires to prevent wildfires, while 34% oppose it. The BC Wildfire Service notes that while banning fires may seem like a good idea, it doesn't always make sense, as controlled burns are necessary for agricultural and forestry purposes. However, many residents are concerned about the increasing number of visitors to the area and the associated wildfire risk. The BC Wildfire Service reports that vehicle traffic in the Squamish River Forest Service Road has doubled since 2012, with over 120,000 visitors in 2023. The article concludes that while campfires have value, the risk of wildfires outweighs the benefits, and authorities should consider banning campfires to mitigate the risk.

**Washington Post poll reveals majority support for public funding of D.C. stadium**
A Washington Post-Schar School poll found that 55% of respondents support using D.C. funds to build a new Commanders facility at RFK Stadium, with 47% supporting public funding in 2024 and 30% in 2022. However, the author of the article argues that the opinions of 651 adults in D.C. are not a reliable measure of public opinion and suggests putting the question to a vote. The author notes that D.C. currently has a budget crunch and that Mayor Muriel Bowser has delayed the submission of a proposed 2026 budget. The author concludes that a public vote would likely fail and that the question should be put to a vote to determine the true will of the people.

**What If You Could Live Forever? Scientists Explore Quantum Immortality**
Scientists have proposed the concept of quantum immortality, which suggests that our consciousness may never truly die but instead shift to an alternate reality upon encountering death. This theory is based on physicist Hugh Everett's many-worlds theory, which proposes the existence of multiple parallel universes. According to researchers, every time we face death in one universe, our consciousness would supposedly transfer to another universe where we survive. Physicists Frank Pollman and Ruben Verresen have contributed to the discussion, suggesting that strong interactions can stop decay entirely and lead to sustained oscillations between decay and rebirth. As Pollman said, 'We now know that the opposite is the case: strong interactions can even stop decay entirely.' Verresen added, 'If this decay proceeds very quickly, an inverse reaction will occur after a certain time, and the debris will converge again. This process can recur endlessly, and a sustained oscillation between decay and rebirth emerges.' While the concept of quantum immortality is still speculative, it challenges traditional notions of mortality and the nature of consciousness.

**Expert Kuznetsov Predicts Interstellar Travel by 2050**
According to futurist and director of Digital Evolution Ventures, Evgeny Kuznetsov, practical understanding of interstellar travel may be achieved by 2040-2050. Kuznetsov stated that current physics does not provide clear answers on how to travel beyond the Solar System, but with advancements in artificial intelligence and knowledge, he believes that the necessary breakthroughs will occur around 2050. 'There are theoretical ideas, but they look unattainable for our civilization's technological capabilities. But taking into account artificial intelligence and a breakthrough in knowledge, I think these trends will converge around the 2050 horizon. So, by 2040, we still have nothing to talk about, but around 2040-2050, it may become clear how this step can be made,' said Kuznetsov. He emphasized that by that time, human civilization should have a necessary and self-sufficient space infrastructure. 'Until 2040-2045, the main focus will be on lunar exploration and the 'sublunar economy' (space around the Moon up to its orbit - ed. TASS),' he noted, adding that the prospective Russian orbital station will be an important part of this process. According to Kuznetsov, from 2050 to 2070, the main focus of human activity in space will be on the boundaries of the Solar System - asteroids, planetary moons, and more distant objects. 'This is already a real attempt to touch the entire Solar System and study what can be extracted from it, and prepare for the next leap,' said the expert.

**Physicists' Disagreement on Fundamental Questions in Physics**
A recent survey of physicists conducted by Niayesh Afshordi, Alice Chen, and Phil Harper at the 'Black Holes Inside and Out' conference in Copenhagen showed that there is significant disagreement among physicists on fundamental questions in physics, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, dark matter, and dark energy. The survey found that most physicists have no clear opinion on these topics. Afshordi said, 'There's this saying among physicists, 'Shut up and calculate' - I think that's what 'no opinion' means.' The only area where there was widespread agreement was on the Big Bang theory, with 68% of respondents agreeing that it explains the universe's origin from a hot, dense state, but does not imply an absolute beginning of time. The survey's results highlight the significant uncertainty among physicists on these fundamental questions.

**Major Energy Consumers Commit to Tripling Nuclear Capacity by 2050**
A group of major energy consumers, including Google, Amazon, Meta, and Dow, have signed a commitment to at least triple the world's nuclear capacity by 2050. This is the first time that large companies outside of the nuclear industry have publicly supported the expansion of nuclear energy. The commitment was launched by the World Nuclear Association and is supported by 31 countries and over 140 nuclear companies. The signatories recognize the potential of nuclear energy to provide a reliable, clean, and abundant source of energy, and to help meet the growing demand for electricity worldwide. They also call on other energy consumers to support the goal of tripling nuclear capacity. Google's Lucia Tian said, 'We are proud to sign this commitment to triple the world's nuclear capacity by 2050, as nuclear energy will play a crucial role in building a reliable, safe, and sustainable energy future.' Amazon's Brandon Oyer added, 'Accelerating the development of nuclear energy will be essential to strengthen our country's security, meet future energy demands, and combat climate change.' Meta's Urvi Parekh stated, 'As global economies grow, the need for reliable, clean, and resilient energy is paramount. Nuclear energy, with its ability to provide continuous energy, can contribute to meeting this growing demand.' The commitment is seen as a significant step towards accelerating the growth of nuclear energy and meeting the world's energy needs.

**Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation: A Radical Departure from Quantum Mechanics**
Hugh Everett III proposed an alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics, which he called the 'many-worlds interpretation'. In this theory, the universe splits into multiple branches or parallel universes every time a measurement is made. This idea was presented in his 1957 dissertation, 'The Foundations of Quantum Mechanics', and later in a 1957 article in Reviews of Modern Physics. Everett's theory was met with criticism from the scientific community, including Niels Bohr, who saw it as a radical departure from the traditional Copenhagen interpretation. Despite this, Everett's work laid the foundation for future research in quantum mechanics and the concept of the multiverse. His ideas have been influential in the development of modern physics and continue to be studied and debated by physicists today.

**Scientists Simulate End of the World Using Quantum Computer**
Scientists have used a quantum computer to simulate the catastrophic collapse of the universe, according to a study published in Nature Physics. Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin employed a 5,564-qubit quantum system to study the decay of the false vacuum, a hypothetical state that could potentially threaten the existence of the universe. The team, using the D-Wave quantum computer, constructed a simplified model of the universe by encoding the quantum field states in qubits. According to one hypothesis, the cosmic vacuum may be unstable. If the Higgs field is in a metastable state, it could decay, creating a 'bubble' of true vacuum that would expand at the speed of light, destroying everything in its path. As the researchers noted, the results of the study matched theoretical predictions. The simulation successfully demonstrated the creation of particles in an expanding universe and allowed scientists to observe the process of bubble formation and interaction. The Higgs field is expected to remain stable for trillions of years. The study opens up new possibilities for quantum computing and cosmology, the researchers said, enabling them to test theories such as the instantaneous collapse of the universe. A previous study by the World One supercomputer predicted that modern civilization could cease to exist between 2040 and 2050. Meanwhile, NASA has identified a possible date for the impact of a recently discovered asteroid on Earth.
