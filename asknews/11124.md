**Healthcare Preview for the Week of: June 2, 2025**
Congress is back in session this week, focusing on the Senate's consideration of the House-passed reconciliation bill. The bill's fate is uncertain, as Senate Republicans must balance their three-vote margin with the need to maintain enough provisions to pass the bill in the House again. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is expected to release its official score in the next few days, which will include updated figures for the deficit and anticipated coverage losses. Senators have expressed concerns about the bill's Medicaid provisions and its failure to cut future deficits. Senate Democrats are united in opposition to the bill, citing concerns about Medicaid and ACA changes. Meanwhile, the House will consider the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025 and the fiscal year 2026 appropriations process will begin. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) budget highlights include various initiatives, but many details are still missing.

**Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Is Obamacare-Repeal Lite**
Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' aims to restrict both the Medicaid and private marketplace features of the Affordable Care Act, potentially leaving 10.7 million fewer Americans using its insurance marketplaces and Medicaid. The plan would increase the number of people without health insurance by narrowing the path for poor Americans to gain coverage and making it easier for them to be booted off it. Critics argue that the bill would sharply increase the number of people without health insurance, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimating that 3.1 million Americans would lose health insurance provided by federal subsidized private insurance, along with the 7.6 million who would lose Medicaid coverage. Dr. Mehmet Oz, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, argued that the Medicaid work requirements in the bill would 'future proof' the program, but critics say this is just a way to undermine the Affordable Care Act's expansion of health-care availability. As Dr. Oz said, 'Every great people takes care of their most vulnerable, and we're a great nation. We're gonna do that.' However, the underlying reality is that Trump and his allies do not accept the idea of universal access to affordable health insurance and will do everything possible to restrict it. 'This approach was most recently echoed in an interview with Politico by Dr. Mehmet Oz, the TV doc and unsuccessful U.S. Senate candidate who is now running the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates the federal-state Medicaid program,' said Paige Winfield Cunningham of the Washington Post. 'Oz argued in an interview on The Conversation with Dasha Burns that the Medicaid work requirements in the sprawling legislation will 'future proof' the program -- in line with administration goals to protect social services.'

**Republicans Are Flat-Out Lying About Their Medicaid Cuts**
Republicans are attempting to sell Medicaid cuts to voters by claiming they are 'protecting' the program and eliminating 'waste, fraud, and abuse.' However, the proposed cuts will result in 15 million Americans losing their health care coverage by 2034. The cuts will be fueled by increased requirements for Medicaid recipients, changes to Affordable Care Act marketplace policies, and the failure to renew tax benefits for ACA plan purchasers. Republicans, including President Trump and several lawmakers, have made false claims about the bill, stating that no one will lose coverage and that the cuts are necessary to eliminate waste and abuse. In reality, the bill cuts spending on Medicaid by at least $600 billion over the next 10 years and imposes administrative hurdles to complicate enrollment in the program.

**Additional Tk 41bn allocated for free treatment of poor**
The Bangladeshi government has proposed an additional allocation of Tk 41.66 billion in the 2025-26 budget to provide free medical treatment for the poor. The budget also extends tax exemptions on pharmaceutical raw material imports, which is expected to support local drug manufacturers. Finance Advisor Salehuddin Ahmed emphasized the importance of universal healthcare by 2030, and the government has taken initiatives to recruit skilled manpower, develop infrastructure, and provide necessary training. The budget also proposes to reduce customs and taxes on the import of machinery and equipment for hospitals, and expand the customs and tax exemption facility for pharmaceutical industries, including anti-cancer drugs. Dr Md Zakir Hossain, Secretary General of the Bangladesh Association of Pharmaceutical Industries, said that the extension of the tax exemption facility will benefit Bangladeshi patients and allow local companies to compete with multinational companies.

**Trump's presidency has only seen federal spending rise so far**
The US federal spending has increased by 8.7% since January 21, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, and 7.2% compared to 2023. The increase is driven by the growth of social insurance programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as interest payments on the federal debt. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that spending in the 2025 fiscal year is up 7% through April over the same period a year earlier. Despite some high-profile cutbacks, such as a 7.7% decline in spending at the National Institutes of Health, the overall spending increase appears to be real. The Trump-backed tax and spending bill that passed the House last week takes aim at Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but most other big spending categories appear to escape largely unscathed. The legislation also includes tax cuts, which most projections indicate will increase the deficit and federal debt.

**DWP dates for Universal Credit, benefits and pension payments in June 2025**
The UK government has announced changes to the welfare system, including a £5 million cut to benefits, which will affect Universal Credit claimants. The standard allowance for Universal Credit will increase by £7 a week from April 2026, but the rate of the additional Universal Credit health element will be frozen until 2029/30. New claimants for the health element after April 2026 will receive a reduced rate of £50 a week. The government also offers a 'budgeting advance loan' for people on Universal Credit who face an emergency lack of money. Additionally, energy suppliers offer help for those struggling with their energy bills, and British Gas offers a grant of up to £2,000 to customers of any energy provider. Working parents in the UK are entitled to 30 hours of free childcare for children aged 3 to 4, and from September 2025, all children under five will be eligible for 30 hours of free childcare.

**US Budget Director Dismisses Concerns Over Massive Spending Bill**
US Budget Director, Russ Vought, has dismissed concerns that cuts to benefits in the massive spending bill passed by the House of Representatives will lead to early deaths in America, calling them 'absurd'. According to The Guardian, the bill will repeal two major programs under the Federal Social Security Network, Medicaid, which provides healthcare to poor Americans and those with disabilities, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps people buy groceries, affecting millions of people if passed. Vought defended the bill on CNN's 'State of the Union' program, saying, 'This is absurd. This is fake news.' He claimed the bill will keep the programs and Social Security network intact, but make them more 'logical'. However, Ohio Nurses Association President said, 'These cuts will not only cause harm, but will lead to death.' The American Academy of Pediatrics warned that the bill, if passed, will lead to 'hungry children' and unaffordable options for many families, while the American Hospital Association warned of the possibility of rural hospital closures. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, condemned Vought's comments, saying, 'Everyone prefers to die of old age at 40.' Murphy claimed that losing people's healthcare to continue tax cuts for the wealthy will lead to more deaths, and that the bill is a 'real disaster' that will increase the US budget deficit.

**Mike Johnson and Russ Vought Continue to Lie About Medicaid Cuts**
House Speaker Mike Johnson and Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought claim that the proposed House budget will not cut Medicaid coverage, with Johnson stating 'People will not lose their Medicaid unless they choose to do so' and Vought saying 'no one will lose coverage as a result' of the bill. However, experts and organizations have exposed this as a lie, citing the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that the bill would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $723 billion and lead to 7.6 million people losing Medicaid coverage by 2034. Additionally, research shows that work requirements, which are included in the bill, do not increase employment but rather lead to coverage loss, medical debt, and delayed medical care. Losing coverage can have serious consequences, including increased mortality among low-income adults.

**US Treasury Secretary Confident US Will Never Default on Debt**
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling. 'The United States will never default, this will never happen', he said in an interview with CBS News. Bessent added that the US authorities 'are on a warning path and will not hit a wall'. According to the International Monetary Fund's calculations, the US government debt will increase to 122.5% of GDP by 2025 and continue to rise, reaching 128.2% by 2030. Earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the country's government debt is on an 'unsustainable trajectory', but has not yet reached an unacceptable level, and it is unknown when this threshold will be crossed.

**Government should do what the private sector cannot do - Part 1 - Businessday NG**
The author argues that governments should focus on what the private sector cannot do, and that healthcare is a key area where governments should lead. The author proposes that the federal government should reorganize the healthcare system, focusing on providing major infrastructure for health and letting states manage their own healthcare facilities. The author also suggests creating a levy to pay for universal healthcare coverage, with a 1% tax on all VAT-able purchases nationwide. This would generate approximately N72 billion annually, which would be used to underwrite healthcare costs and make healthcare free for all citizens. The author believes that this would have a huge multiplier effect, with healthy citizens contributing to the society and the economy.

**Sandoval Hernández Urges Guarantee of Free Medical Attention and Medications Nationwide**
Federal Deputy Mónica Elizabeth Sandoval Hernández has called for urgent actions to ensure universal and free access to healthcare services, clinical studies, and medications in public hospitals and clinics. She also demands transparency in the consolidated medication purchases made by Birmex, citing cases of corruption and overpricing. Sandoval Hernández emphasized that the right to health is non-negotiable and that the government must take immediate action to address the crisis in the healthcare system. 'We are facing the consequences of past mistakes and inaction. We cannot allow the continued violation of a fundamental right like access to healthcare. Citizens deserve dignified medical attention, sufficient supplies, and available medications,' she said. The deputy pointed out that denunciations of shortages have been repeated across the country, from hospitals with non-functional operating rooms to patients with chronic diseases and cancer who have been left without treatment due to the lack of medicines or functional medical equipment. She called on the Secretary of Health, David Kershenobich, and the Undersecretary, Eduardo Clark, to guarantee, without further delay, a universal, free, integral, and quality healthcare system, as established by the Constitution, international treaties, and the 2025-2030 National Development Plan. 'The right to health is not negotiable. It is a commitment of the State to its people. We demand immediate actions and concrete results that respond to the urgency and gravity of this health crisis,' she said.

**House Republican Bill Would Cut Medicaid Funding to States Providing Own Health Coverage to People Who Are Undocumented | Center on Budget and Policy Priorities**
The House Republican reconciliation legislation aims to cut at least $715 billion in health care spending, mostly from Medicaid. The bill would also cut the federal matching rate for the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion in 14 states that provide comprehensive health coverage to people without a documented immigration status using their own state funds. This would leave at least 8.6 million people uninsured and cut federal support for Medicaid expansion. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the policy would cut $75 billion in funds to these states from 2028 to 2034, doubling the expansion group costs that each state would be required to fund. States could respond by dropping their state-funded programs or cutting enrollment, benefits, or provider payments for enrollees.

**Dingell joins Sanders, Jayapal to introduce Medicare for All Act of 2025**
U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, along with U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell and U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, introduced the Medicare for All Act of 2025, which aims to provide universal healthcare to every American. Dingell stated, 'Every American has the right to health care, period.' The legislation would expand Medicare to cover every person in the United States, including primary care, vision, dental, prescription drugs, mental health, and reproductive health care. It would also allow patients to choose care without worrying about the provider being in-network and streamline the health care system to negotiate drug prices and reduce administrative waste. The bill has been endorsed by President Shawn Fain of the United Auto Workers labor union, who stated, 'Health care should be a human right.' A 2024 Gallup poll found 62% of Americans support universal healthcare, but the 2024 election was the first in decades where neither major party candidate campaigned on health care reform.

**Washington state Democrats ask feds for universal health care — a long shot in Trump's D.C. - The Reflector**
The Washington State Legislature passed a memorial calling on President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress to implement a universal healthcare system. Despite the long shot, state lawmakers are optimistic that a universal system could be implemented nationwide or that Washington state could be granted the ability to do so on its own. According to Rep. Dan Bronoske, 'We can figure out a specific policy that works very well for the people of the state, but we can’t get there without the partnership of our federal partners, and we do need the explicit permission from the federal government.' The current system is 'in a downward spiral,' with skyrocketing medical costs and debt driving many into bankruptcy. Critics argue that the current patchwork system is inefficient and redundant, with higher administrative costs than universal models in other countries. Rep. Joe Schmick stated, 'We need waivers from the federal government to be able to do this. I just don’t believe that they’re going to give us that freedom or flexibility.' The memorial emphasized support for federal legislation introduced by U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, which would create waivers for states to develop their own universal healthcare with federal funding. Some estimates suggest a universal system could save taxpayers upwards of $450 billion, but that might come with higher upfront costs for the federal government.

**NDP Promises Universal Access to Family Doctors by 2030**
The leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh, has promised to ensure that all Canadians have access to a family doctor by 2030. Currently, around 6.5 million people in Canada do not have access to basic healthcare, according to the party. Singh stated, 'We have people waiting 17 hours in emergency rooms to receive care. That's unacceptable.' A NDP government would provide 1% of Canadian transfer payments in healthcare to provinces that guarantee access to a family doctor. The party also aims to make it easier for American doctors to work in Canada and fund more residency programs for foreign-trained doctors living in the country. Additionally, the NDP plans to reduce administrative tasks that take up doctors' time and create a 'pan-Canadian practice permit' to allow healthcare professionals to practice more easily across the country.

**Rare unanimous support for B.C. mental health bill  | Globalnews.ca**
British Columbia's politicians have given unanimous support to a private member's bill, Bill 204, proposing universal access to mental health care for pregnant women and new mothers. The bill, introduced by Jody Toor, would give the government a year to create a strategy for universal access to perinatal and postnatal mental health care. The broad support for the bill reflects a shared commitment to addressing perinatal and postnatal mental health, according to the BC Conservatives. The bill will still need to be studied by a committee and pass third reading before it can come into effect.

Additionally, the plan aims to increase healthcare exports to at least $5 billion, improve healthcare services, and increase health insurance coverage to 100% of the population by 2030. The plan also targets reducing infant mortality rates, maternal mortality rates, and malnutrition among children under five. Dr. Ehab Abu El-Fadl, the Minister of Health, said, 'Our goal is to provide comprehensive healthcare services to all Egyptians, and we are committed to achieving this goal by 2030.'
