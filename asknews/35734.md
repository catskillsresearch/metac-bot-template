**Tariff court ruling throws another wrench into companies' trade strategies**
A recent court decision has blocked President Trump's emergency tariff powers, potentially allowing companies to apply for refunds on duties they've paid. Trade and legal experts told The Hill that it's likely companies will be able to apply for refunds, citing precedent. However, not all attorneys agree on this, with some noting that the decision is 'silent' on the issue of refunds and that further legal actions may be required. The decision strikes down IEEPA tariffs on China, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Canada, as well as the 10-percent general 'reciprocal' tariff. The total affected duties collected this year amount to about $13 billion. U.S. trade officials are ruing the decision, saying it will make ongoing trade negotiations more difficult. The ruling brings down the overall effective U.S. tariff rate, which was as high as 25 percent before China and the U.S. agreed to pause their triple-digit tariffs on each other. After the pause, the rate fell to about 13 percent and now stands around 7 percent, according to the Yale Budget Lab. 'Consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 6.9 percent, the highest since 1969,' members of the Yale Budget Lab wrote in a Thursday analysis. The decision leaves in place non-emergency Section 301 tariffs on China affecting about $23.4 billion worth of goods. Section 232 tariffs on steel, automobiles, and aluminum also remain in place, as do Section 201 tariffs on solar products. 'It's not a sufficient basis for [companies] to make their business decisions on,' Leila Carney, an attorney with Caplin Drysdale, said, adding that the environment of uncertainty around international trade will remain as a result of the decision.

**US Company Profits Decline as Economic Uncertainty Persists**
The profits of American companies decreased by $118.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025, following a significant gain of $204.7 billion in the previous quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) also decreased at an annual rate of 0.2%, contrasting with the 2.4% growth observed in the fourth quarter of 2024. The BEA stated, 'The slowdown in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected an increase in imports, a slowdown in consumption, and a decline in government spending, which were partially offset by an increase in investments and exports.' The decline in company profits and GDP is largely attributed to the increase in costs borne by companies due to the imposition of tariffs on imports. These tariffs have generated economic uncertainty, affecting both commercial activities and consumer sentiment. The anticipation of the effects of tariffs has led to changes in consumer and business behavior, including an increase in imports and purchases. A recent court ruling has further complicated the economic situation, as a US trade court ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his constitutional powers in imposing general tariffs on imports from trade partners. The court determined that the Constitution grants the Congress, and not the President, the exclusive power to regulate international trade, effectively blocking most of the tariff orders issued by the administration since January. Although this decision has dealt a blow to Trump's trade policy, which was centered on tariffs, the administration has appealed. The current economic uncertainty has led several major companies, particularly in the aviation and automotive sectors, to withdraw or not provide their financial forecasts for 2025 and 2026. Southwest Airlines, for example, has withdrawn its forecasts for these two years, citing the current macroeconomic uncertainty. Similarly, companies like Ford, Skechers USA, and United Parcel Service (UPS) have also revised their profit forecasts downward, reflecting the difficulties in predicting future performances in the context of tariff disputes and current economic volatility. In response to the evolving economic context, the Federal Reserve, at its meeting on May 6-7, 2025, acknowledged the increase in downside risks for employment and economic growth, as well as upside risks for inflation. Fed officials have not ruled out the risk that the US economy may enter a recession. The Fed's minutes highlighted a cautious approach, emphasizing the need to wait for greater clarity on economic prospects before making further policy adjustments.

**US GDP Contracts by 0.2% in Q1 2025, Trump's Trade Policy to Stimulate Economy**
The US Department of Commerce has revised its estimate of the country's GDP growth rate from -0.3% to -0.2% for the first quarter of 2025. The revised data shows that the economy contracted by 0.2% year-over-year. The growth was driven by an increase in consumer spending, which rose by 1.2% in the first quarter. According to Bloomberg, the economic growth slowed down at the beginning of the year due to a sharp increase in imports, as businesses tried to beat the introduction of new tariffs by President Donald Trump. Analysts expect the GDP to recover in the second quarter as higher tariffs will curb imports, and previously imported goods will start to be sold. Economists and policymakers will closely monitor how Trump's new policies affect consumer sentiment and business activity in the US. Trump has announced a 10% base tariff and 25% tariff on imported cars, with individual tariffs set for most countries. However, the introduction of most of these tariffs has been delayed, and countries are currently negotiating with Trump to lower the rates. Trump believes that his trade policy will stimulate the US economy, create jobs for Americans, and reduce prices for goods produced in the US. The International Monetary Fund has lowered its forecast for US GDP growth in 2025-2026 to 1.8% and 1.7% respectively.

**Here's what to know about Trump's tariffs after a U.S. trade court rules them illegal**
The U.S. Court of International Trade has ruled that President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation are illegal, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda. The ruling halts the tariffs, which were imposed on April 2, and introduces new uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses. The Trump administration plans to appeal the ruling, and experts say Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs. 'At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,' said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China. The effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year, but far lower than the 15% rate based on the assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place.

**More Americans file for unemployment help but layoffs remain low despite uncertainty over tariffs**
Despite economic uncertainty over global trade, American workers remain secure in their jobs. Jobless benefits applications rose by 14,000 to 240,000 for the week ending May 24, but analysts had forecast 226,000 new applications. The Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate held at a healthy 4.2%. Fed chair Jerome Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment, and that the potential for both higher unemployment and inflation are elevated. The government reported that the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.2% annual pace in the first quarter of 2025, but growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump's massive tariffs went into effect.

**European Stock Indexes Rise as US Court Blocks Tariffs**
European stock indexes are mostly rising on Thursday, according to data from exchanges. Investors are evaluating the US court's decision on the illegality of new import tariffs. As of 13:31 MSK, the British FTSE 100 index was down 0.05% to 8,721.33 points, the French CAC 40 was up 0.65% to 7,839.01 points, and the German DAX was up 0.21% to 24,116.86 points. Analysts are assessing the news on US trade policy. The US Court of International Trade ruled on Wednesday that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority in imposing tariffs, and ordered them to be blocked. According to CNN, the court's decision halts the tariffs against individual countries, but does not affect sectoral measures such as the 25% tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. 'We are unlikely to see the end of this tariff policy course. Trump will likely fight for trade talks. It's too early to make conclusions,' said Benedicte Lowe, a BNP Paribas SA derivatives strategist, to Bloomberg. On April 2, Trump announced the imposition of tariffs on goods from 185 countries and territories. Universal tariffs of 10% took effect on April 5, and individual tariffs on April 9. On the same day, the President announced a 90-day suspension of additional import tariffs, which were imposed on a principle of reciprocity, for some countries and territories. Only the 'universal tariff of 10%' will be in effect during this period. Additionally, the British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported earlier on Thursday that the country's car production volumes decreased by 15.8% year-on-year in April, to 59,203 units, the lowest level for this month since 1952, excluding the 2020 lockdown.

**US Jobless Claims Rise More Than Expected**
The number of jobless claims in the US rose by 14,000 to 240,000 for the week ending May 24, according to the Labor Department. This is higher than the expected 226,000 new claims, according to the Associated Press. The weekly jobless claims are seen as a measure of layoffs in the US, and have generally remained within a historic range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy in the spring of 2020. The markets showed a sense of relief early on Thursday after a federal court blocked President Donald Trump from imposing a comprehensive tariff on imports under the Emergency Powers Act. Trump's policy has shaken global markets, frustrated trade partners, and raised concerns about accelerating inflation and economic downturn. The Trump administration has filed a request for a stay, and it is likely that the case will be appealed to the Supreme Court. It is unclear whether the White House will comply with the ruling to temporarily halt all emergency power tariffs. Trump has already stopped or reduced the severity of many of his tariff threats, but concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could undermine US job market stability. The Federal Reserve kept the main lending rate at 4.3% for the third consecutive meeting in early May, after cutting it three times at the end of last year. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the chances of rising unemployment and inflation are high, a rare mix that makes the central bank's dual mission of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low more difficult. Powell added that tariffs have weakened consumer and business confidence. The government reported on Thursday that the US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, a slight improvement from its initial estimates. The growth slowed due to increased imports, as US companies tried to import goods before Trump's massive tariffs took effect. Trump aims to reshape the global economy by significantly increasing import taxes to boost the US manufacturing sector. Trump also tried to reduce the size of the federal workforce, but many of these cuts face challenges in courts and Congress. Despite some signs of weakness last year, the job market remains strong, with a surplus of jobs and a relatively low rate of layoffs. The government reported that US employers added 177,000 new jobs in April, a strong and unexpected number, while the unemployment rate remained at a healthy 4.2%. Among the companies that announced layoffs this year are Workday, Dow Jones, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, Meta, and Facebook. The Labor Department reported on Thursday that the four-week average of jobless claims, which is equivalent to some weekly fluctuations during periods of volatility, fell by 250 to 230,750. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending May 17 rose by 26,000 to 1.92 million.

**Temporary Trade Truce: Tariff Reduction Takes Effect**
A temporary truce has been reached in the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The agreement, which went into effect today, calls for a reduction in tariffs between the two countries for the next three months. According to the agreement, the US will reduce its tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce its tariffs on US goods from 125% to 10%. The agreement was reached after a meeting in Geneva over the weekend. Experts say that the reduction in tariffs will provide some relief to the markets in the short term, but that uncertainty will persist in the long term. US President Donald Trump had announced heavy tariffs on China and other countries on April 2, which had caused significant disruptions to global supply chains. These policies have been known to put pressure on emerging economies and increase production costs globally. 'A temporary measure against economic collapse' Fitch Ratings, an international credit rating agency, acknowledged that the agreement provides a temporary relief, but emphasized that it does not signal a lasting solution. According to Fitch, the agreement only shows a symbolic willingness to prevent an economic collapse between the world's two largest economies. The agency noted that the average tariff rate in the US has decreased from 23% to 13% with the agreement, but that this rate is still much higher than the 2.3% rate in 2024. Fitch also revised its global growth forecast for 2025 downward due to the rising trend of protectionism in trade.

**US Imposes 25% Tariff on All Smartphones, Prices May Skyrocket**
The US government has announced a new 25% import tariff on all smartphones, which could significantly increase the prices of phones sold in the US. The tariff is expected to come into effect in the fourth quarter of 2025. As a result, companies may shift their production to alternative countries such as India, Vietnam, or Mexico. According to experts, the tariff will directly affect consumer prices and could lead to a substantial increase in phone prices. As one expert noted, 'The tariff will have a direct impact on consumer prices and could lead to a significant increase in phone prices.'

**The post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire**
Despite the recent trade truce between the US and China, the post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire. China's benchmark CSI 300 index is up 1.4 percent this year, but the effective tariff rate on imports from China currently stands at 31.8 percent, the highest of any trading partner. The US administration has suspended the 34 percent reciprocal tariff on Chinese goods for 90 days, but cancelled triple-digit retaliatory levies. However, the White House has opened a national security probe into semiconductor imports, which could push the effective rate on China higher. As a result, manufacturers such as Apple and Vtech are planning to shift production out of China, with Vtech's CEO Allan Wong stating, 'despite the trade truce, my company planned to shift all production for the American market out of China by the end of 2026.'

**Canada Cools US Trade Tensions By Drawing Down Retaliatory Duties**
Canada has suspended retaliatory duties on US goods and services for six months, effectively bringing the tariff rate down to 0.4%. This move is expected to help reduce inflation and fuel economic growth. Oxford Economics economist Michael Davenport notes that the US will likely maintain a 12.6% average effective tariff rate on Canadian goods until the renegotiation of the USMCA in July 2026. The overall effective US tariff rate is expected to average 18% in 2025 before settling at 15% with the renegotiation of the free trade agreement. According to Davenport, the US tariff hikes do not spell the end of US economic exceptionalism, and the country is likely to return to the top of the growth pack by 2026. 'U.S. President Trump's tariffs are sparking a global trade war that no one will win,' said Oxford's Stillo. 'It's not in Canada's best interest to remain at the center of the fray, as the nation is heavily reliant on trade with exports to the U.S. making up about 20 percent of the country's GDP.'

**US Effective Tariff Rate Drops to 13.1% Following US-China Trade Agreement**
According to a report by credit rating agency Moody's, the US effective tariff rate has decreased significantly to 13.1% following the recent agreement to reduce mutual tariffs between the US and China. This is a substantial drop from the previous rate of 22.8%. Moody's estimates that the US effective tariff rate will remain high at 13% compared to the 2.3% level at the end of 2024, which is the lowest rate since 1941. The effective tariff rate is calculated as the total tariff amount divided by the total import value, and it will fluctuate based on the import source country and product structure. Moody's notes that the effective tariff rate on Chinese goods has decreased from 103.6% to 31.8%, but it remains the highest rate among all trading partners, including a 10% base tariff applied to most countries. The effective tariff rates for Japan, Mexico, Canada, and Germany, which are the US's next largest trading partners, are all above 10.5%. Moody's provides an interactive tariff tool, 'US Effective Tariff Rate Monitoring', which calculates the US effective tariff rate for all trading partners and quantifies the current tariffs. The tool will be updated in real-time when there are significant changes in US tariff policies, and users can adjust parameters such as the ad valorem tariff rate and import value to build hypothetical tariff scenarios.

**US Tariffs in Effect: Global Markets React to 10% Levy**
The United States has begun to collect tariffs of 10% on imported goods, as announced by President Donald Trump. The move has caused a significant drop in global stock markets, according to economist Carlo Cottarelli. The US has imported goods worth around $3.3 trillion in 2024. The tariffs will be applied to a wide range of products, with the exception of precious metals and non-essential goods. The European Union, China, and other countries have responded with their own tariffs, with China drawing up a list of US products to target in retaliation. Canadian Minister Ralph Goodale has stated, 'The US must feel pain.' The situation is being closely watched, with many experts warning of a potential trade war.

**Trump's sweeping import tariffs amp up global trade war**
President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 10% tariff on most imported goods to the United States has escalated a global trade war, threatening to increase inflation and stall economic growth. The move has drawn condemnation from other leaders and sparked a sharp decline in global markets. China, the world's second-largest economy, has urged the US to cancel the tariffs and vowed countermeasures. US Treasury chief Scott Bessent warned that retaliation could lead to dramatically higher prices for consumers. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average US family by thousands of dollars. 'If you retaliate, that's how we get escalation,' Bessent said. The effective US import tax rate has shot to 22% under Trump from just 2.5% in 2024, according to the head of US research at Fitch Ratings. 'This is a game-changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy. Many countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time,' Olu Sonola said. Trump argued that the new levies will boost manufacturing jobs at home. 'For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,' Trump said. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average US family by thousands of dollars.

**US Economic Growth Halted by Erratic Trade Policies and Public Spending Cuts**
The US economic growth is being hindered by erratic trade policies and attempts to cut public spending. We have reduced our GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 2% and expect general inflation to accelerate to 3.5%. Consumer spending has been disappointing in the first months of the year, and consumer confidence has been weak, suggesting that the new administration's policies are having a severe negative impact on consumer spending. According to the Atlanta Federal Reserve's PIB and component forecasts, consumer spending is expected to grow only 0.3% in the first quarter, compared to 4% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 3.7% in the third quarter of 2024. 'Erratic trade policies are driving consumer inflation expectations and restraining spending plans, while attempts to reduce public spending are another source of uncertainty that is holding back consumption,' said the report. The announced tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as on automobile and auto parts imports, are expected to increase the effective US tariff rate by six percentage points, and a wave of reciprocal tariffs, presented as a response to foreign tariffs, taxes on consumption, or currency manipulation, could add another eight percentage points to the effective tariff rate. 'The increase in tariffs has a similar effect to income taxes and, therefore, on US GDP growth,' said the report. The more restrictive financial conditions, due to market nervousness, are an additional obstacle to growth. We have revised downward our growth forecast for the US in 2025 and expect the GDP to grow only 2% and the unemployment rate to rise slightly to 4.4% by the end of the year. At the same time, we predict that tariffs will have a temporary impact on inflation in 2025, raising it to 3.5% before falling to 2.6% in 2026. We predict that the Fed will ignore this temporary increase in inflation and cut interest rates in September in response to the cooling labor market. A lower inflation rate in 2026 would allow for more rate cuts in 2026.

**US employers tap brakes as Tariff Policy dims outlook**
US employers are expected to have tempered their hiring in March, with payrolls rising by 138,000, below the 151,000 increase a month earlier. This would leave average job growth over the past three months at the slowest pace since October. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.1%. The latest report card on the labor market follows data that indicate a notable first-quarter slowing in the economy. Economists are also parsing business survey data for signs that more companies are putting expansion plans on ice until there's greater clarity on policy. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady due to clear upside risks to inflation, and the real risk is that if the labor market turns, rate cuts will come too late. The US administration is seeking to reverse trade imbalances, spark investment in the US, and spur the domestic output of critical goods and materials. President Donald Trump is expected to unleash his biggest tariff salvo to date, a package of blanket increases in duties on foreign imports. Effective tariffs on US imports could be around 15% next year, the highest in almost a century. 'Our baseline is that the actual tariffs will be substantially lower than the worst-case scenario, that many will be implemented only after investigations, and that some countries will receive exemptions,' said Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Estelle Ou & Chris G. Collins, economists. 'Still, after the dust settles, effective tariffs on US imports could be around 15% next year, the highest in almost a century.'

**S. Korea says tariffs on US imports 'effectively 0%' after Trump barb | Macau Business**
South Korea rejected US President Donald Trump's accusation that it charges steep levies on imports from the United States, saying that tariffs on American goods are 'effectively close to 0 percent'. According to the Korean trade ministry, the effective tariff rate on imports from the US stands at approximately 0.79 percent due to the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement. The ministry stated that South Korea imposes tariffs of 13.4 percent on some imports, but not on products from the United States. South Korea's Acting President Choi Sang-mok said that the impact of reciprocal tariff measures 'may not be significant due to the low applicable tariff rates under the Korea-US FTA.' US goods exports to South Korea amounted to $65.5 billion in 2024, while US imports from South Korea totalled $131.5 billion in 2024.

**Korean Government Refutes Foreign Reports on US Import Tariffs**
The Korean government has refuted foreign news reports that the country's effective tariff rate on US imports is 13.6%, stating that the effective tariff rate is around 0%. According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, South Korea has free trade agreements (FTAs) with most countries, and as a result, the FTA tariff rate is applied to imports from FTA partner countries, which is lower than the most-favored nation (MFN) tariff rate. The ministry explained that the average MFN tariff rate is around 13.4%, but due to the FTA, the average tariff rate on US imports is 0.79% (excluding refunds) as of 2024, and will be even lower in 2025. The government also stated that, according to the Korea-US FTA, no tariffs are applied to imports of consumer goods from the US. The government has announced that it will establish a task force to closely monitor the potential impact of the US's new trade measures, including non-tariff barriers, and prepare a response. President's Chief of Staff Kim said, 'We should closely monitor the situation, considering that the US has announced that it will evaluate not only tariffs but also non-tariff barriers such as value-added tax and digital service tax.' He instructed the relevant ministries to prepare a detailed explanation and take necessary measures to respond to the US's new trade measures.

**US businesses brace for Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China to drive up costs**
US businesses are bracing for the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. The levies of 25% on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% on Chinese goods will take effect on Tuesday. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that the tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power. Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, calculates that the tariffs would increase inflation by 0.4 percentage points this year and cause the US economy to fall by 1.5% this year and 2.1% in 2026. Small businesses, such as The Penny Ice Creamery in California, are particularly vulnerable to the tariffs, which could drive up the cost of imports and damage their slim profit margins. 'The margins are so slim,' said co-owner Zach Davis. 'Being able to offer that add-on can maybe generate an additional 10 cents in profit per scoop. If a tariff wipes that out, that can really be the difference between being profitable and being break-even and even being underwater by the end of the year.'
