**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**UK Announces 15 Billion Pound Investment in Nuclear Warheads**
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the UK will invest '15 billion pounds in the production of sovereign nuclear warheads as a key component of the country's defense and security.' Sunak revealed a comprehensive plan to reform the British army, including a costly expansion of the country's nuclear deterrent, but refused to set a deadline for the UK to meet its main goal of spending 3% of its GDP on defense. The UK will transition to a 'combat-ready' state in response to increasing threats and instability in the world, while the government has announced plans to invest 15 billion pounds (20 billion dollars) in its nuclear warhead program and build up to 12 submarines as part of the AUKUS partnership with the US and Australia. Britain is ready for a military confrontation with Russia, Defense Minister John Healey said, emphasizing that increasing military spending and expanding the defense industrial base is part of preparing for any possible developments. Healey said in a statement to the Daily Express: 'This is a message to Moscow: Britain is strengthening its armed forces and industrial base as part of its preparations for fighting if necessary.' The minister pointed out that the British government plans to spend 3% of its GDP on defense by 2034, adding: 'I have no doubts about our ability to achieve this goal.' The Kremlin said that President Vladimir Putin is in constant contact with security agencies and the Ministry of Emergency Situations regarding the consequences of the explosions in Yryansk and Kursk.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. This move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks across the globe. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, has also called for a transformation in how the UK defends itself, saying, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey, is planning to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War. This move includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. The goal is to increase the resilience of Britain in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The funding will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. Sir Keir Starmer said, 'In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests, is vital.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also set to meet with NATO heads of government in The Hague next month to discuss defence spending targets, with NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte suggesting a high defence spend target of 5%.

**Korea's presidential front runner Lee Jae-myung backs nuclear power  --  for now**
South Korea's presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors due to land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' This stance could undermine the nation's atomic energy expansion plans at home and abroad. Lee's main rival, Mr Kim Moon-soo, currently supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60 per cent of the mix by 2038. However, Mr Han Byung-Hwa, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities, expects Lee to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30 per cent of the power mix by 2030. 'One of the hurdles to entering the AI era is power,' said Mr Jaeseung Kim, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities. 'Whoever wins will have no choice but to accept and use nuclear power for the time being.'

**Russia May Return to Nuclear Testing if US Takes Similar Steps, Says Sergey Shoigu**
Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu stated in an interview with TASS that Russia may return to nuclear testing if the United States takes similar steps. According to Shoigu, the US is nearing the end of the warranty period for some nuclear warheads and is developing new types of weapons. These circumstances may prompt Washington to resume testing, which would in turn force Russia to respond. 'In this case, Russia may follow their example as a countermeasure,' Shoigu said, adding that the Ministry of Defense and 'Rosatom' are prepared for such work. However, Shoigu emphasized that Russia does not have an immediate need to conduct such tests due to its increased military potential and current circumstances. He noted that Russia has developed and adopted a range of new strategic systems without analogues in the world in recent years. Shoigu also commented on the growing military planning in the West, stating that European countries are launching an open campaign to prepare for a possible armed confrontation with Russia. He mentioned that European politicians and military officials are actively discussing the timing of a potential conflict, ranging from three to five years. 'By 2030, European politicians and military want to be ready to fight us,' Shoigu emphasized. He noted that such actions, including the large-scale buildup of potential and preparation of corresponding infrastructure, demonstrate a growing trend towards confrontation.

**Shoigu Warns of Possible Russian Nuclear Testing in Response to US Actions**
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu stated that Russia may resume nuclear testing in response to similar actions by the United States. According to Shoigu, 'US actions in this area directly affect our position on this issue. Currently, their guarantees for certain types of nuclear munitions are expiring, and they are developing new types of weapons, which may prompt them to resume nuclear testing.' Shoigu noted that Russia has adopted a 'complex of modern types of weapons, including strategic ones, with no analogues in the world.' He added that 'our country's military potential has significantly increased. In these circumstances, there is no urgent need to conduct nuclear tests.' Additionally, Shoigu stated that European countries aim to be prepared for a direct confrontation with Russia by 2030.

**US begins making new nuclear bomb seven months ahead of schedule amid growing WW3 fears - The Mirror**
The US has started making a new nuclear bomb, the B61-13, seven months ahead of schedule. The bomb can carry a 360-kiloton payload, making it 24 times more powerful than the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. According to Sandia National Laboratories, the project was expedited through 'aggressive planning' and 'innovative program planning', resulting in a 25% decrease in overall time to first production unit. The bomb will be deployable by strategic aircraft such as the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. Meanwhile, Britain is developing its own hypersonic missile, with a £1 billion initiative aiming to have the missile ready by 2030. The UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) has successfully carried out 223 propulsions tests over six weeks, setting the stage for the development of a game-changing weapon. The development of hypersonic missiles by both the West and Russia has raised concerns about the potential for real-world aggression, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

**German Intelligence Chief: Russia May Test NATO's Collective Defense Before 2030**
The head of German intelligence, Bruno Kahl, believes that Russia will likely try to test the effectiveness of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on collective defense. He suggests that if the war in Ukraine ends in the near future, this risk will become greater. 'We very much hope that this will not happen... But we must assume that Russia wants to test us, to check the unity of the West,' Kahl said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, as reported by 'European Truth' citing dpa. Kahl believes that the time and likelihood of such a 'test' are directly related to the development of events in the Russian-Ukrainian war. If the war ends before 2029-2030, Kahl said, Russia will be able to become a threat to Europe more quickly. 'It is also possible that a specific threat or attempt at blackmail by Russia against European states will occur earlier than previously thought... An earlier end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to redirect their energy to where they want it most - against Europe,' Kahl said. According to Kahl, Russia hopes that the future contours of the world order will be similar to those in the 1990s, and that Russia's sphere of influence will expand further westward, with the United States withdrawing its troops from Europe in the most desirable scenario.

**Scientists Propose Using Nuclear Bomb to Destroy Asteroid 2024 YR4**
A team of US scientists proposes a bold plan to neutralize the threat of asteroid 2024 YR4 by suggesting the use of a powerful nuclear bomb to destroy it and prevent potential catastrophic damage. According to NASA, the probability of impact has increased to 3.1% for the year 2032. Other strategies being considered include the use of impact probes, gravitational tractors, and white paint to change its trajectory. The scientists have already tested this theory in a laboratory. The plan involves detonating the nuclear explosion near the asteroid, which could vaporize its surface and push it in the opposite direction. However, this option raises 'ethical, political, and legal dilemmas' and could fragment the asteroid into unpredictable pieces that would still pose a threat to Earth. NASA has increased the probability of impact to 3.1% for the year 2032, making it the highest probability of impact of a large object in modern prediction history. A collision with this asteroid could destroy an entire city. Alternative plans include the NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which has already been tested successfully on the asteroid Dimorphos, as well as the use of a gravitational tractor or painting the asteroid with white paint to change its trajectory with the help of solar wind. Although there are still seven and a half years before the asteroid reaches Earth's orbit, there is no time to waste. However, it is worth noting that there is still a 97% probability that the asteroid will not impact our planet. 'We have to take action, but we also have to be careful,' said a scientist. 'The asteroid is a ticking time bomb, and we need to defuse it before it's too late.'

**Scientists Propose Destroying Asteroid 2024 YR4 with Nuclear Bomb**
Scientists in the United States are proposing to destroy the asteroid 2024 YR4 with a nuclear bomb due to the possibility of it impacting Earth and destroying a city. According to NASA, the chances of impact on December 22, 2032, are 3.1%, the highest probability of impact in modern prediction history for an object of this size. Researchers have tested this theory by simulating an explosion near a small asteroid, finding that the X-rays from the explosion vaporized its surface, pushing it in the opposite direction. However, this option raises ethical, political, and legal concerns, and could also fragment the asteroid into unpredictable pieces that would still pose a threat to Earth. Fortunately, there are other strategies being considered, and the final decision will be made by world leaders. With 97% of the asteroid not impacting Earth, there is still time to prepare.

**Scientists Propose Destroying Asteroid 2024 YR4 with Nuclear Bomb**
Scientists from the United States have proposed the extreme option of destroying the asteroid 2024 YR4 with a nuclear bomb due to its 3.1% chance of impact on December 22, 2032, the highest probability of impact in modern history for an object of this size. Instead of inserting the bomb into the asteroid, the explosion would occur near it. Researchers have tested this theory with a simulated asteroid the size of a marble, finding that the X-rays from the explosion would vaporize its surface, pushing it in the opposite direction. However, this option raises ethical, political, and legal dilemmas, as well as the risk of fragmenting the asteroid into unpredictable pieces that could still pose a threat to Earth. Alternative strategies for deflecting the asteroid include the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), a 'gravitational tractor', ion thrusters, and a reflective paint. The final decision on how to address this threat will be made by world leaders, who have several years to prepare before the asteroid reaches Earth's orbit, with a 97% chance of it not impacting the planet.

**US Secret Laboratory PULSE to Conduct Nuclear Tests**
The Principal Underground Laboratory for Subcritical Experimentation (PULSE) is a secret laboratory in Nevada that the US may soon reuse to conduct nuclear tests underground. With rising tensions between Russia and China, US officials have stated that Washington may need to restart its strategic programs. The US has not conducted a real nuclear test since 1992. The laboratory has a long tunnel with three main components that researchers use to conduct tests on nuclear arms without actually detonating a nuclear bomb. The machines control any decay that occurs in the radioactive nuclei of old American bombs. By the end of 2025, the laboratory will also use new top-secret devices to contain microscopic explosions, simulating the explosion of an atomic bomb. 'We are preparing for the possibility of a nuclear test,' said David Funk, who collaborates in the supervision of the underground works. The US had 3,748 nuclear warheads in 2023, but the Arms Control Association estimated that the number was significantly higher, at 5,225 in January 2025. The progress on a treaty banning nuclear tests is stalled, and there are already signs that the world powers are proceeding with nuclear rearmament. Therefore, Washington will re-enable the laboratory. Inside, at the end of a long corridor filled with tubes that transport air, water, and energy throughout the complex, there is a recently excavated empty space where Scorpius, a giant X-ray machine, will be installed. Scorpius, worth $2 billion, takes a series of X-ray images of the plutonium while it is traversed by the shockwave of a non-nuclear explosion. This process tests the aging of the plutonium nucleus of a bomb and helps the team to update the current American nuclear arms, if necessary.

**US May Resume Nuclear Testing Amid Global Tensions**
The US may soon resume nuclear testing amid global tensions, according to the Daily Mail. A secret US nuclear facility near Las Vegas may restart testing of nuclear bombs, as global tensions could lead to a new arms race. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) representatives claim that the US may soon have no choice but to resume its nuclear testing programs. The US has not conducted real nuclear bomb tests since 1992. NNSA sees a real possibility that more countries, including India, Pakistan, and North Korea, will join the nuclear arms race. The US has accelerated production of plutonium cores, necessary for nuclear bomb detonation, and NNSA aims to increase plutonium processing capacity to meet the goal of producing at least 80 units per year by 2030, as reported by KP.RU. 'The global situation may push countries to a new nuclear arms race,' the Daily Mail article states.

**Nuclear Explosions as a Means to Prevent Asteroid Impacts**
Scientists have proposed a new method to prevent asteroid impacts on Earth by 2032 using nuclear explosions. According to the research, a high-powered X-ray burst, similar to those produced by a nuclear explosion, could deflect even large asteroids that could destroy human civilization. The idea is to detonate a nuclear device near the asteroid, which would emit a massive amount of energy and momentum, causing the asteroid to change its trajectory. This method was tested by NASA's 'DART' mission in 2022, which successfully deflected a small asteroid. However, this method may not be effective for larger asteroids or those discovered too late. The researchers suggest that a nuclear device could be used to deflect an asteroid as large as 100 meters in diameter, which could destroy a city, by detonating it two weeks before impact. The team has already tested this theory using a device called the Z Machine at the Sandia National Laboratories, which can generate high temperatures and pressures, and has successfully deflected small asteroids. The researchers believe that even a 4-kilometer-long asteroid could be deflected by a nuclear explosion. However, the use of nuclear devices in space is unlikely due to the risk of radioactive material being released into the atmosphere, and the political tensions it could create.
