**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Professions at Risk: Experts Warn of AI's Impact on the Job Market**
Experts have identified professions that may disappear due to AI, including telemarketing and call center operators. According to Professor Alexander Safonov, AI has already surpassed human intelligence in solving many tasks. However, some experts believe that AI will create new job opportunities, with the World Economic Forum predicting that 170 million new jobs will emerge by 2030, while 92 million jobs may disappear. Safonov notes that the development and application of AI technologies are still costly, and in the short term, the risks of mass layoffs and job losses due to AI are low. He also emphasizes that live labor is currently cheaper than AI. Safonov predicts that AI will have the following impact on the Russian job market: chatbots will reduce the need for call center workers, sales managers, product consultants, and other roles. AI may become an additional tool for improving the quality and productivity of work in healthcare, but it will not solve the problem of staff shortages, especially in junior and middle management positions. AI will not be able to replace teachers and educators, where personal communication and trust are crucial. In science, AI will become an additional participant in research teams, but creative functions will remain with humans. Safonov notes that AI is not a threat to manual laborers, builders, and other workers. Fariyda Mirzabalaeva, a professor at the Russian University of People's Friendship, believes that AI will help high-skilled professionals, but will replace middle-level IT specialists, accountants, marketing specialists, media professionals, taxi drivers, warehouse workers, collectors, molders, locomotive drivers, and conveyor workers. Creative professions, such as copywriters, journalists, designers, and illustrators, are also vulnerable to AI. Mirzabalaeva notes that professions that are less susceptible to AI include doctors, scientists, military personnel, judges, and artists. She also emphasizes that AI will increase the demand for specialists in the field of AI and that the need for retraining and continuous education will grow.

**Is AI a Threat to Human Employment? The Truth No One Wants to Admit**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is sparking a heated debate about its impact on human employment. While some warn of massive job losses and growing inequality, others see AI as a catalyst for innovation, creating new opportunities and enhancing human work. According to a 2023 McKinsey study, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated by 2030. Real-world examples, such as tech company layoffs in 2024, suggest that AI-driven automation is already contributing to significant job cuts, with a 44% wave of job cuts reported. As AI continues to transform industries, it's essential to consider both sides of the argument and prepare for the future of work.

**Between opportunity and obsolescence: The human side of the AI revolution**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the world of work, presenting both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, AI can enhance productivity and create new, higher-value roles, while also emerging as a powerful tool for learning and training. On the other hand, it generates uncertainty about the replacement of traditional jobs and the potential erosion of certain human skills. According to the World Economic Forum, approximately two-fifths of current workers' knowledge and skills may become obsolete by 2030, while three out of five workers will require some form of training during that same period to remain employable. To address this challenge, companies must invest in reskilling and upskilling programs, facilitate access to certifications or microcredentials, and design career paths that help workers at risk of automation move into in-demand roles. Ultimately, the impact of AI on human capability will depend on how we integrate it into our mental and organizational processes, and companies must take responsibility for updating their employees' skills and resisting the temptation of 'easy layoffs' in response to each technological advance.

**AI Revolutionizes the Kitchen: A New Era of Cooking Experience**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is being integrated into kitchen appliances, promising to make cooking easier, more efficient, and enjoyable. According to Alberto Dani, product manager at AEG in Iberia, the arrival of AI in the kitchen is a significant change that will last for up to seven years and is centered around three key areas: design, sustainability, and experience. AI can be used to optimize cooking times, temperatures, and programs, and can even adapt recipes to the specific capabilities of the appliance. For example, AEG's AI can automatically adjust the temperature, time, and program of a recipe based on the user's preferences and the appliance's capabilities. BSH, another appliance manufacturer, is also using AI to improve the user experience and efficiency of its appliances, such as fridges and ovens. The company is working with universities and research centers to develop new AI-powered features, such as the ability to detect food in ovens and adjust cooking times accordingly. However, the compatibility between different manufacturers' systems remains a challenge. AEG and BSH are developing their own AI-powered solutions that are specific to their products, but are working to make them more compatible with other systems. In the future, AI is expected to be present in all categories of appliances, not just high-end models, and will be made possible by the use of 'virtual sensors' that can improve performance without the need for complex or expensive components.

**Can AI Save Democracy? Linda Zervakis Explores the Future of Politics**
Linda Zervakis explores the question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) will shape our democracy in the future. In her new reportage, she asks 'Can AI save democracy?' and conducts an experiment with AI, wondering if a computer can make future political decisions. Politicians are considering the possibility of AI replacing them, and a survey found that 51% of Europeans would prefer their representatives to be replaced by an AI algorithm. This is because AI, with access to personal data, could potentially better represent citizens' interests than current politicians. Zervakis' AI duplicate, 'KI-Linda,' is a central part of her investigation, which also includes interviews with politicians such as Jens Spahn, Katrin Göring-Eckardt, and Lars Klingbeil. The reportage raises questions about the future of work, with 60% of professions expected to be replaced by AI by 2030, and the potential for AI to take over leadership in politics.
