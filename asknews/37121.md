**Mamdani fundraises for Adrienne Adams in joint effort to de-throne...**
Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has encouraged his supporters to donate to City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams' mayoral campaign instead of his own, in an effort to thwart ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo's comeback bid. Mamdani, who has consistently polled second to Cuomo, stated, 'I'm asking you to donate to another candidate running for Mayor -- Her name is Adrienne Adams.' Adams has not yet reported enough qualifying funds to be eligible for the city's 8-to-1 match program. Mamdani believes that Adams can capture some of Cuomo's support in the outer boroughs, especially among Black voters. According to a recent Marist poll, half of Black Democratic primary voters said they would support Cuomo, while just 14% said they would back Adams. The primary will be a ranked choice vote, which could give other candidates hope in later rounds as the slate thins out.

**AUDIO: Rep Mike Lawler Endorses Nachman Caller in State Senate Race**
Congressman Mike Lawler has endorsed Nachman Caller in the New York State Senate special election, citing his commitment to fighting for Brooklyn, supporting schools, and keeping streets safe. Lawler emphasized the importance of electing someone with deep community roots and a proven track record, highlighting Caller's work on affordable housing and his involvement in drafting legislation that benefits families and mosdos. A win for Caller would bring Republicans closer to challenging the Democratic majority in the State Senate, potentially shifting the legislative balance on key issues. Lawler stated, 'Nachman is a Republican who will keep our streets safe, fight for our schools, and stop Governor Hochul and the radical liberal politicians in Albany.' The special election is on Tuesday, with polls open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.

**Trump Endorses Elise Stefanik for New York Governor, Potentially Challenging Kathy Hochul**
Donald Trump has publicly endorsed Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman, as a potential candidate for the governor of New York in 2026. Stefanik has not officially confirmed her candidacy, but her chances have increased with Trump's support. Trump has strategically intervened in the Republican primary to support the continuation of Mike Lawler and Bruce Blakeman in their current positions, which is seen as a move to favor Stefanik, his political ally. Stefanik, 40, has shifted from being a moderate legislator to a prominent figure in the conservative wing of the Republican Party, known for her strong defense of Trump during his first impeachment trial and her role in attempts to block the certification of Joe Biden's election in 2020. According to Axios, Stefanik is already in talks with donors, advisors, and potential campaign members, while her team analyzes polls and electoral strategies. Stefanik has stated that she is seriously considering running against Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul and has outlined her priorities, including fiscal reforms, immigration, education, security, and energy. Stefanik has criticized Hochul on X, calling her 'the worst governor in the country' and a 'dead weight' for Democrats. Hochul has downplayed the possibility of Stefanik's candidacy, saying she is prepared for any electoral contest: 'Let them come.' In an interview with CNN, Hochul expressed confidence in facing Stefanik or any other Republican candidate, criticizing the conservative agenda: 'The Republican Party is so tainted in New York that anyone who runs will have to explain why people lost healthcare, education, and benefits to finance tax cuts for the rich.'

**Crime Skyrockets in AOC's District - Moonbattery**
Crime in the 110th Precinct has increased by 105%. This is in the district of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 'defund the police' socialist lawmaker. Alvarez, a former supporter of AOC, now owns a brothel across the street from her home. The article suggests that Democrats, including AOC, view rising crime as a result of their policies as a positive outcome, rather than a problem to be addressed. This is evident in their proposed $1.5 billion cut to the NYPD and their opposition to a resolution condemning the actions of Derek Chauvin. The article argues that the election of leftist Democrats is both a cause and an effect of societal decay.

**She DOESN'T CARE: While AOC Fights the Oligarchy From Private Jets, Crime In Her Home District SKYROCKETS**
While Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) is on a 'Stop Oligarchy' tour with Bernie Sanders, taking private jets around the country, her home district in the Bronx and Queens is experiencing a surge in major crime. According to NYPD data, major crime has risen by 70% since AOC took office in 2019, more than double the citywide increase of 30%. The 110th Precinct in Queens saw a 105% surge, the highest increase of any NYC precinct. AOC has been criticized for her 'defund the police' policies and for blocking an Amazon warehouse, which would have brought in jobs. As one critic noted, 'It's not like she has to live with the consequences of her policies.'

**Philadelphia will likely decide its next district attorney this week. Here's what you need to know.**
The Democratic primary for Philadelphia's district attorney is taking place on Tuesday, with incumbent Larry Krasner facing a challenge from former Municipal Court Judge Patrick Dugan. Krasner, a progressive prosecutor, has won endorsements from various groups and politicians, including the Working Families Party and U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans. Dugan, who is backed by the Philadelphia Building and Construction Trades Council, has criticized Krasner's policies, saying they have led to historically high rates of homicides and other crimes. The election has been marked by contentious debates and public forums, with both candidates accusing each other of being ineffective. As of Friday, Dugan's campaign website listed 27 wards as endorsing him, while Krasner's campaign lists 32 Democratic wards in its corner. The Philadelphia Republican Party has organized a write-in campaign that could allow Dugan to run against Krasner in November as the GOP nominee, but Dugan has committed to declining the Republican nomination. 'We deserve a DA who will deliver compassionate reform, respect victims, and keep our communities safe by holding criminals accountable,' Dugan said in a statement. 'Under DA Larry Krasner, we endured historically high rates of homicides, gunshot victims, case withdrawals, retail thefts, carjackings and the lowest gun conviction rate in decades.'

**NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani leads 'BDS' chants, bashes...**
Mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has been caught on video leading 'BDS' chants at a pro-Palestinian rally in 2021. He claimed that elected officials are using taxpayer dollars to travel to Israel and that 'BDS' is the answer to what is happening in Palestine. Mamdani has been polling second in the Democratic primary for mayor. The Anti-Defamation League and other Jewish advocacy groups label the BDS movement as antisemitic, saying it seeks to delegitimize and destroy Israel. Mamdani's spokesman said he has been consistent and principled in his calls for equal rights and freedom for every person, including Palestinians. Mamdani's father, Mahmood Mamdani, has also called for the end of the Jewish state. The ranked-choice primary is scheduled for June 24.

**Cuomo has a commanding lead over Mamdani in NYC mayoral race, but his Jewish support is stuck**
Andrew Cuomo, a candidate in the NYC mayoral race, is struggling to gain support among Jewish voters, despite his efforts to court them. According to a new poll, Cuomo maintains a commanding lead in the June 24 Democratic primary, but his numbers among Jews have not increased. The Marist poll of 3,383 likely voters shows that Cuomo would beat his opponent, Zohran Mamdani, with 60% of the overall vote in the fifth round of the ranked-choice voting system. However, Mamdani leads Cuomo among younger voters under age 45 by 20 points. Cuomo said, 'They can be stopped,' suggesting that if all registered Jewish Democrats in New York mobilize and turn out to vote, it would 'send a message that resonates across the country that the Jewish community is fighting back and when hate and discrimination is revealed, it's defeated.'

**Two major unions endorse Cuomo ahead of Democratic mayoral primary**
Two major city unions, the Hotel Trades Council and 32BJ, have endorsed former Gov. Andrew Cuomo for mayor ahead of the Democratic primary. The Hotel Trades Council, which represents 40,000 non-managerial hotel and gaming workers, cited Cuomo's 'proven history of effective government management' and his support for union jobs. 32BJ, which represents around 90,000 property service employees, highlighted Cuomo's 'concrete plans to address our housing and healthcare affordability crises' and his ability to 'stand up to attacks on our city.' Cuomo has previously been endorsed by both unions during his gubernatorial runs. However, some union leaders have criticized Cuomo's behavior, with Rich Maroko calling it 'deeply disturbing' and Manny Pastreich stating that Cuomo should be held accountable for his actions.

**AOC Surges Ahead of Schumer in New York Primary Poll, Signaling Shift in Democratic Power**
A new poll by Data for Progress shows Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leading Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) by double digits in a hypothetical New York primary matchup, with 55% of likely Democratic voters supporting or leaning toward supporting AOC, compared to 36% for Schumer. This shift highlights the growing power of the far-left faction within the Democratic Party, as Ocasio-Cortez continues to build her base among younger, more progressive voters. Schumer, who has seen a dip in popularity among Democrats since siding with Republicans on a funding measure, now faces a growing challenge from within his own party. According to the survey, 82% of respondents strongly support Ocasio-Cortez's potential leadership of the Democratic Party, citing her endorsement of taxpayer-funded healthcare and the Green New Deal. Schumer has already filed paperwork to seek reelection, while AOC has teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders on a nationwide 'Fighting Oligarchy' tour to promote their progressive agenda.

**Queens Democratic Party endorses Cuomo in mayoral race**
Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo secured the endorsement of the Queens Democratic Party on Sunday, strengthening his frontrunner status in the mayoral race. Rep. Gregory Meeks declared, 'The next mayor of the city of New York, Andrew Cuomo!' Meeks framed Cuomo as the strongest candidate to challenge the White House, saying, 'The last person that Washington, D.C. wants to see be mayor of the city of New York is Andrew Cuomo.' Cuomo echoed that sentiment, presenting himself as a fighter. The endorsement comes despite Meeks' past call for Cuomo to resign in 2021 after an investigation found he had sexually harassed multiple women. The Queens Democratic endorsement deals a blow to City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, as local officials remain split between her and Cuomo.

**Queens County Democrats Endorse Andrew Cuomo for NYC Mayoralty**
The Democratic Party in Queens County, where thousands of Dominicans reside, has decided to support former Governor Andrew Cuomo for the NYC mayoralty. Cuomo received the endorsement of the organization and its president in Queens, Gregory Meeks. This endorsement is a significant show of support as Cuomo seeks a political comeback. Cuomo has been out of the public eye for over three years since his resignation as NY governor in 2021 amid an 11-accusation sexual harassment scandal. Cuomo has presented himself as a fighter, saying 'Queens supported me', 'Brooklyn supported me', and 'Staten Island supported me', solidifying his position as the favorite in the upcoming Democratic primaries. It is expected that charismatic and valued Dominican leaders in Manhattan and the Bronx will also endorse Cuomo in the coming weeks. Cuomo's popularity is on the rise, with some calling it 'Cuomomanía'. According to a recent Quinnipiac University-NY poll, only 11% of registered Democrats would support Adams in the June primaries, while 31% would support Cuomo. A study by Honan Strategy Group found that 74% of African American voters have an unfavorable opinion of Adams, while 79% support Cuomo. Cuomo also enjoys great sympathy among Hispanic voters, with 29% of the vote.

**Working Families Party endorses state Sen. Sean Ryan in Buffalo mayoral race**
The Working Families Party has endorsed state Sen. Sean Ryan in the Buffalo mayoral race, citing his work on affordable housing and his ability to lead the city to the future. The party's chairperson, Tom Roulley, said, 'We felt like he was best positioned to not only bring resources to Buffalo to fix a looming budget crisis that's coming over but also to lead Buffalo to the future.' Ryan said, 'The Working Families is part of a coalition that believes in good-paying jobs, strong schools and affordable housing so, happy to have received their endorsement.' The endorsement comes after the Erie County Democratic Committee also endorsed Ryan, and he has picked up key union support. Ryan views the Working Families Party as 'very important to the Democratic primary' and said their members will be involved in his ground game. The party is also collecting petitions for Ryan to appear on the party line during the general election, but could remove him from the line if he does not win the primary.

**Even Bernie Won't Endorse AOC for Senate | Frontpage Mag**
Sen. Bernie Sanders stormed out of an interview with ABC News when asked if he would support Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's potential Senate bid, saying 'You wanna do nonsense, do nonsense!' Sanders' reaction suggests he doesn't think much of AOC and isn't ready to back her over Sen. Chuck Schumer. AOC's 30% approval rating and potential challenges in a primary election in New York make her Senate bid uncertain. Despite her controversies, AOC may still have a chance in the state due to its liberal leanings and lack of engagement from the working class.

Democratic Bronx Rep. Ritchie Torres has endorsed former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the NYC mayoral race, citing Cuomo's 'competence and courage' to lead the city. Torres believes Cuomo can defeat mayoral contender Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, and criticized Mayor Eric Adams' administration for being compromised by allegations of a quid pro quo with President Trump's Justice Department. Torres said Cuomo's leadership is necessary to address the city's crisis, citing his accomplishments in office such as the modernization of LaGuardia Airport and the building of Moynihan Train Hall. Cuomo is expected to officially enter the race in the coming days, and is expected to be a frontrunner if and when he does.
