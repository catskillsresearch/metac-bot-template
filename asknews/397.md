**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Ukrainian Startup Introduces Robot Barista to Alleviate Human Workload**
A new format of coffee shops is being introduced by Ukrainian startup RoboL Robotics, where drinks are prepared by a robot, not a barista. According to 24 Kanal, citing dev.ua, the idea is to combine automation, artificial intelligence, and convenience for customers. Orders are placed through a terminal or app, and the robot prepares them quickly and accurately without emotional exhaustion. The machine not only makes coffee but also interacts with people, recognizing faces, emotions, and engaging in simple conversations. RoboL Robotics' founder, Anton Kotyk, emphasizes that the goal is not to replace humans but to alleviate their workload. A tired barista after hundreds of orders is not the best guarantee of service, while a robot can maintain the same pace without a decrease in quality. The system is currently in the final testing phase, and the first kiosk will soon appear in the 'Sільпо' supermarket from Fozzy group. Artificial intelligence may threaten the existence of several professions. A survey showed that 56% of AI experts believe that technologies will have a positive impact on the economy, but adult Americans are less optimistic, with only 17% expecting a positive impact.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Socceroos suffer big blow as star set for foot surgery**
Socceroos star Craig Goodwin will miss Australia's crucial World Cup qualifiers against Japan and Saudi Arabia due to a foot injury that requires surgery. Coach Tony Popovic named his 26-man squad on Sunday, but Goodwin was not included due to his injury. Popovic said, 'He has a foot problem and will be requiring surgery. It's something he's tried to avoid. I think the last month or so he's been trying to get through the games.' Goodwin had announced he would be rejoining Adelaide United on a three-year deal just days before the injury. The Socceroos will take on Japan in Perth on Thursday night and Saudi Arabia in Jeddah the following Tuesday, with the top two in the group automatically qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. Australia can guarantee their place if they beat Japan. Popovic also discussed the international future of Nectarios Triantis, who declined an offer to join the Socceroos' recent training camp in Abu Dhabi. Popovic said, 'I'm not too sure where it exactly sits. We had him in the squad for the camp, and on the day that he was supposed to travel he informed us that he's not coming in. He just said he's got a lot of things on at the moment, a lot on his mind in terms of what he wants to do. We have to respect that, and we'll see what happens.'

**Pessac High School Robotics Club Makes a Name for Itself in RoboCup**
At the Philadelphe-de-Gerde high school in Pessac, a group of students have formed a robotics club to compete in the RoboCup. The team, consisting of 11 students, meets every Wednesday to work on their robots, which are programmed to play soccer. Samuel, a student in the club, is a champion of the European junior soccer robot league and is now the team's leader. 'He has knowledge that surpasses that of adults, particularly in Python programming,' says one of his teachers. The club, which was created in 2023, has already gained recognition in the RSK league, a competition where two teams of autonomous robots compete against each other. The students program their robots to move, detect the ball, cooperate with their teammates, and shoot goals. To achieve this, they use a wide range of skills, including 3D modeling, electronics, mechanics, and coding. The club is now seeking support to become autonomous, as a complete kit costs 3,000 euros. 'A complete kit includes four robots, a field, a camera, and connections. Not to mention maintenance,' explains the teaching team. A crowdfunding campaign has been launched to help the club, and the Region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine and the City of Pessac are helping to cover travel costs.

**Human-Robot Collaboration Gains Momentum**
Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) is gaining momentum in the industry, with manufacturers evaluating robotics and advanced technologies to synergize human expertise and decision-making with the precision, strength, and repeatability of robots. According to Rob McKeel, CEO of FORTNA, 'Today they're not linear problems. They're multidimensional problems.' The parameters for robotics have been established, and the use of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) and enterprise software is becoming increasingly common. Companies like Agility Robotics, Fameccanica, and Onward Robotics are developing innovative solutions, such as humanoid robots, automated sorting systems, and intelligent Pyxis technology, to optimize the order-picking process and improve supply chain efficiency. However, there are still barriers to adoption, including budget constraints and the need to retrain an older existing workforce. A recent MHI/Deloitte survey found that upskilling current employees is the top action taken to address the surge in new technology, with almost two-thirds of respondents bridging their skills gap from within. The survey concluded that technologies, workforce, and global economics will converge in the coming decade, requiring capabilities enabled by end-to-end supply chain orchestration.

**Artemis, the Humanoid Robot that Plays Soccer like Messi**
Artemis, a humanoid robot designed to play soccer, has been developed by engineer Dennis Hong and his team at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The robot, which can run, walk, jump, and play soccer, was presented at the GITEX technology fair in Dubai. Artemis is the fastest bipedal robot, reaching a speed of 2.1 meters per second, and is designed to replicate human movements in everyday environments. The robot uses electric actuators that mimic human muscles, allowing it to be more silent, efficient, and clean compared to hydraulic systems. Artemis has the ability to play soccer and participate in competitions like the RoboCupSoccer, where robots are evaluated on their soccer skills. According to Dennis Hong, the robot's design is based on the rules of the RoboCup, which requires robots to replicate human behavior as closely as possible. The robot uses dual cameras to emulate human vision and maintains a structure similar to a person's. While Artemis does not use artificial intelligence for all its movements, it does use AI for autonomy and has stereo vision to recognize objects. However, the robot's creator, Dennis Hong, acknowledges that there are still many challenges to overcome, including perfecting the movement with both legs and ensuring the robot can safely fall and recover autonomously.
