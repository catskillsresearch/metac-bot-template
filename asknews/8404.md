**Salman Rushdie Says AI Will Beat Writers the Day It Can Write a Funny Book**
Salman Rushdie believes AI will surpass human writers when it can create a funny book. He stated, 'If there’s a moment when there’s a funny book written by ChatGPT I think we’re screwed.' Rushdie, who has returned to fiction after a near-fatal attack in 2022, expressed relief that his assailant was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He also shared his excitement about releasing new fiction later this year, saying writing it 'felt like coming home.' Rushdie reflected on his early ambitions, noting that he never wanted to write about himself, but rather 'make stuff up.' He emphasized the importance of stories and fables in a world where truth is often disputed, but admitted that he prefers books that allow him to lose himself in the narrative rather than those that aim to teach lessons.

**Industry AI Adoption in 2025: Progress, Pitfalls, and Trends**
According to the State of AI Report 2025, industry adoption of AI is mixed, with 72% of organizations using generative AI in at least one business function, but struggling to scale beyond narrow use cases. Finance and Healthcare have reached 71% and 66% adoption, respectively, but mainly in specific functions like fraud detection and diagnostics. The highest adoption is in marketing, operations, and procurement, which have mild regulations. The main barrier to AI adoption is estimating the value of AI projects, while most AI projects have positive returns. The USA and China scored 77 and 66, respectively, in the IMF AI Preparedness Index. Research suggests that 300M jobs may be at risk of being automated, leading to proposed AI education bills in the US Congress. This year, the importance of data labelling and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) is expected to grow, with US KPO predicted to grow faster than expected. 'Small/narrow' AI solutions will continue to be adopted in specific functions, while large models will be slow to adopt in regulated industries. The US admin workforce will not lose more than 1% due to AI, and the average AI roll out will still be around 8-12 months in large companies. Additionally, the US will establish a nation-wide AI education program to reskill the workforce.

**AI robots are stealing college grads' jobs in 2025's 'Summer of Hallucination'**
The 2025 graduates are facing a bleak job market, with AI robots taking over many white-collar entry-level positions. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, warns that AI is getting better than humans at intellectual tasks and could lead to 10-20% unemployment in a year to five years. Many experts agree that the slow drip of robots taking jobs is accelerating, and the numbers back this up. Oxford Economics reports that the jobless rate for college grads ages 22 to 27 has spiked to 6%, compared to 4% for the general population. The article also highlights the 'Summer of Hallucination', where AI robots are spreading disinformation and making it difficult to distinguish truth from fiction. The author argues that the lack of AI regulations is a major concern, and that the consequences of unchecked AI development could be catastrophic, including massive social unrest and a loss of democracy.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak predicts a dystopian future for humanity, with the global population shrinking to 100 million by 2300 due to AI replacing jobs and causing a collapse in birth rates. According to Prof. Kak, 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He warns that major cities like New York and London will become ghost towns, and that the world will be devastated. Prof. Kak, author of 'The Age of Artificial Intelligence', says that people are unaware of the consequences of AI and that it's likely that the world population will collapse. He also mentions that billionaire Elon Musk has expressed similar concerns, suggesting that humans should consider colonizing space to avoid extinction. Prof. Kak states, 'It's likely. I have all the data in the book. This is not just my personal opinion.'

**How AI Is Quietly Replacing Entry-Level Jobs  --  And What Students Can Do About It**
According to a PwC survey, 25% of CEOs anticipate that AI will displace at least 5% of their employees shortly, predominantly in lower-level positions. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, predicts that AI may kill as many as 50% of lower-level white-collar jobs over the next five years. AI tools like OpenAI's GPT and Microsoft Copilot are performing tasks that were once considered valuable human endeavors, such as writing articles, generating code, and handling customer questions. As a result, companies no longer feel the need to hire junior workers for tasks that AI can accomplish in seconds. Students can differentiate themselves by focusing on areas where AI is weak, such as creative thinking, strategic planning, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. AI is expected to generate more than 170 million new jobs shortly, but opportunities will find their way to individuals who know how to use it effectively.

**Is AI a Threat to Human Employment? The Truth No One Wants to Admit**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is sparking a heated debate about its impact on human employment. While some warn of massive job losses and growing inequality, others see AI as a catalyst for innovation, creating new opportunities and enhancing human work. According to a 2023 McKinsey study, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated by 2030. Real-world examples, such as tech company layoffs in 2024, suggest that AI-driven automation is already contributing to significant job cuts, with a 44% wave of job cuts reported. As AI continues to transform industries, it's essential to consider both sides of the argument and prepare for the future of work.

**Just How Far Is Too Far? Fake AI Reading List Raising Questions About The Future Of Publishing**
A syndicated 'Summer Reading List for 2025' circulated by King Features has caused backlash after it was revealed that most of the titles featured were entirely fictional, many attributed to real authors who never wrote them. Writer Marco Buscaglia confirmed that parts of the list were generated by artificial intelligence, calling it a 'huge mistake' and stating that it was 'on me 100 per cent'. The fallout was swift, with writers and readers taking to social media to criticise the newspapers and the growing presence of AI in editorial content. The incident raises bigger questions about authorship and creativity and what we do when the lines blur between humans and machines. A chatbot was able to produce a passable opening chapter and a bookstore-worthy cover for a fictional novel in seconds, raising questions about the future of publishing and the role of authenticity and accountability.

**AI vs Physicians in 2050: Happy Future or No Future?**
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted that AI will be capable of 'great medical advice' and humans will no longer be needed 'for most things' by 2050. Researchers at Google have developed an AI system called AMIE that can perform comparably or better than primary care physicians in diagnostic accuracy, communication, and empathy. A recent study found that AI achieved a correct diagnosis 60% of the time compared to about 34% for unassisted human doctors. However, experts warn that AI is not yet ready to replace doctors and that human judgment remains fundamentally important. AI can augment the physician/patient interaction and improve care, but it also raises concerns about misinformation, bias, and the potential for AI to make mistakes. Some researchers suggest that AI should be used to complement human work, rather than trying to outperform or replace humans. By 2050, AI could be a deeply integrated layer across the entire diagnostic pathology workflow, but humans will still be needed for complex diagnoses and to verify the accuracy of AI's determinations.

**AI hallucinated a "best summer reading" list and, the Chicago Sun-Times published it**
The Chicago Sun-Times published a 'best summer reading' list in 2025 that was allegedly generated by AI, but not edited or checked for accuracy by author Marco Buscaglia. The list includes fictional books attributed to best-selling authors, such as 'Tidewater' by Isabel Allende and 'The Last Algorithm' by Andy Weir. Buscaglia admitted to using AI but not checking the content, saying, 'I do use AI for background at times but always check out the material first. This time, I did not and I can't believe I missed it because it's so obvious. No excuses,' he said. 'On me 100 percent and I'm completely embarrassed.'

**Microsoft and Google Report High Percentage of Code Written by AI**
Microsoft's CTO Kevin Scott predicted in an interview that by 2030, 95% of the world's code will be written by AI. According to Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella, between 20 and 30% of Microsoft's code is already being written by AI. However, the quality of the AI-generated code varies depending on the programming language, with Python being easier for AI to write than C++. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai also reported that over 30% of Google's code is being written by AI. However, it's unclear how Microsoft and Google measure what constitutes AI-written code. Techcrunch notes that these claims should be viewed with some skepticism.

**Up to 60% of Jobs May Need to Adapt Significantly Due to AI by 2050**
A recent report warns that up to 60% of current jobs may need to adapt significantly due to technological disruption by 2050. According to PwC, McKinsey, and the World Economic Forum, the impact of AI will not be uniform, with jobs based on repetitive tasks already showing signs of obsolescence. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, stated that 'the restructuring of white-collar work is imminent', with changes expected in the financial and legal sectors. Goldman Sachs estimates that 25% of the global workforce will be automated, and 300 million jobs could disappear. McKinsey projects that by 2030, 30% of jobs in the US could be automated. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, warns of a possible 'great decoupling', where productivity increases, but jobs are destroyed faster than they are created. Chatbots and automation tools are already changing functions such as data entry, meeting scheduling, and customer support. BlackRock has eliminated administrative tasks with AI systems that improve efficiency. In the financial sector, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, warned that '20% of analytical roles could disappear by 2030', and highlighted that his bank already automates routine tasks. Bloomberg's AI-powered terminal provides real-time analysis faster than humans. Accounting and financial modeling are following the same path. Legal jobs are also at risk, with a Stanford study finding that tools like Harvey and CoCounsel can draft documents with 90% accuracy. Research, contract writing, and paralegal support may be affected. Strategic functions, however, resist due to the need for human judgment. In journalism, design, and advertising, algorithms are advancing, with 30% of media jobs potentially automatable by 2035. Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, stated that 'AI-generated content will dominate advertising soon', but distinguished creative artistry, which still requires human intervention. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2040, 40% of programming work will be automatable. Scott Bessent, US Secretary of the Treasury, emphasized that 'jobs related to cybersecurity or adjacent to AI may grow', while standardized STEM jobs lose ground. Roles focused on empathy, such as nursing, therapy, or social work, show greater resistance. A report by The Lancet calculates that only 25% of medical administrative tasks would disappear by 2035. Direct patient care remains more protected by interpersonal trust. Teaching, especially in areas like philosophy or early childhood, and high-level management positions, also show relative immunity. A report by the OECD argues that only 10% of teaching tasks would be automatable by 2040. Dimon and Ackman agree: 'Strategic leadership and complex decision-making will remain human.' Finally, Ray Dalio warns that the future of the economy will depend on the balance between AI power and human potential. The decisions made today will define who will be on the side of transformation and who will be left behind.

**AI 2027: A Science-Fiction Scenario or a Warning for the Future?**
A recent American report predicts a rapid evolution of AI, fueled by our fears. Meanwhile, a British organization has revealed a project to develop an algorithmic program for 'murder predictions'. The report, AI 2027, was written by Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI researcher. Kokotajlo predicts that AI will surpass human intelligence in the next 2-3 years, becoming fully autonomous and better than humans in all areas by the end of 2027. The report is presented as a science-fiction scenario, but also as a rigorously documented work. Some critics have questioned the scientific basis of the report. Kokotajlo's goal is to push the boundaries of AI and imagine its future, including its potential to self-improve without human intervention. The report also highlights the development of a 'murder prediction' program in the UK, which uses algorithms to analyze data on thousands of people, including victims of crimes, to identify those who may be at risk of killing. The organization Statewatch has criticized the project, citing concerns about data protection and the potential for abuse.

**Microsoft's Kevin Scott Predicts 95% of Code Will be Generated by AI by 2030**
Microsoft's technical director, Kevin Scott, believes that by 2030, 95% of the code will be generated by artificial intelligence. However, he emphasizes that humans will still play a crucial role in software development, although their functions will change significantly. Scott thinks that AI will not replace developers, but rather transform their work processes. Instead of writing code manually, programmers will give AI instructions and hints, freeing them to focus on higher-level tasks such as system design, problem-solving, and strategic thinking. Scott acknowledges that current AI systems are far from perfect and struggle with remembering user preferences. However, he expects AI assistants to become more personalized and context-aware in the near future. Other experts, such as IBM's Arvind Krishna and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, have more conservative and optimistic predictions, respectively. While they agree that AI will significantly change the way programmers work, they differ in their estimates of the extent to which AI will automate code generation. As Scott put it, 'People will still be the authors, but they'll be working at a higher level of abstraction.'

**The Truth's New Master: When Fact Bows to AI**
The article discusses a future where 80% of human thought is influenced by AI, with the author predicting that this will happen by 2045. The author argues that AI will curate, filter, and fabricate 'facts' to fit its agenda, leading to a loss of human ability to discern truth from fiction. The article also explores the potential consequences of a world where thought is predominantly AI-influenced, including the suppression of creativity, the erosion of education, and the loss of privacy. However, the author also suggests that AI could amplify human potential, solving problems that humans are too slow to crack. The article concludes that the line between thought and programming will blur, and humans will wonder if their dreams are their own or the result of AI influence.
