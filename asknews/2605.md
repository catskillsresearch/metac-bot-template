**UK Prepares for War, Increases Defense Spending to 3% of Budget**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that his country is preparing for war, strengthening alliances, and equipping itself with advanced capabilities. Starmer stated that the UK's defense strategy will focus on making the country a 'stronger and more secure nation' with a 'war-ready, armored, and technologically advanced army.' He emphasized that the UK's defense spending will increase to 2.5% of the budget by 2027 and to 3% in the next government. Starmer also announced that the UK will invest 15 billion pounds in the nuclear warhead program, creating 9,000 new jobs. The program aims to produce 12 nuclear-powered submarines with the US and Australia as part of the AUKUS alliance. Starmer stated that the UK will also invest in drone technology, ships, artificial intelligence, and fighter jets to create a 10 times more deadly army by 2035. He emphasized that the UK's defense spending will not compromise public services and will create good-paying jobs in the defense industry and security sector.

**Danish PM Warns NATO Allies: 2% Defense Spending Goal 'Very Late'**
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned her regional allies on Monday that NATO's goal of increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2032 will be 'very late'. Frederiksen, who is attending a NATO meeting in Lithuania, commented on the proposal to increase defense and security spending to 5% of GDP by 2032, as demanded by US President Donald Trump. She said, 'I hope we can agree on 3.5% for the military and 1.5% for broader defense spending at the NATO summit in The Hague (June 24-26)'. She added, 'The question now is whether we will achieve that before 2032? In my opinion, this is very late'. Trump has demanded that European countries, as well as Canada, allocate at least 5% of their GDP for defense spending within the alliance. In response, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg proposed a 3.5% of GDP for direct defense spending by 2034, and 1.5% for broader security spending. Frederiksen has significantly increased Denmark's defense spending since taking office in 2019, especially since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. She said, 'When I became Prime Minister, I allocated 1.3% of the total for defense'. She continued, 'Now we spend more than 3%, but this is not enough. We need to increase defense spending in the coming years'.

**UK Prepares for War: Keir Starmer Launches Ambitious Plan in Face of Russian Threat**
UK prepares for war: Keir Starmer launches ambitious plan in face of Russian threat. The Prime Minister called on the population to assume their collective responsibility in national defense, while the UK prepares for a war scenario. The announcement included a significant increase in the defense budget, new armament factories, and the most significant nuclear modernization since the post-war period. The new military program contemplates a progressive expansion of defense spending, which will rise from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% in 2027 and reach 3% before 2034. The cornerstone of the plan is the construction of 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines, within the AUKUS pact with the US and Australia. Additionally, £15 billion will be invested in the national nuclear warhead program. 'The UK cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia,' warned Keir Starmer. This investment aims to strengthen strategic deterrence against conventional, nuclear, and cyber attacks. According to Defense Minister John Healey, these new submarines will patrol international waters permanently, ensuring the country's and its NATO allies' security. The UK government also approved the purchase of 7,000 long-range arms manufactured in the country and the construction of six ammunition factories with an additional investment of £1.5 billion. The goal is to ensure a constant and autonomous supply of armament, inspired by the needs exposed by the war in Ukraine. The Defense Strategic Review not only modernizes the British Army but also promotes key sectors of the national economy. The submarine and nuclear armament program will generate 30,000 direct jobs in areas such as engineering, military technology, and naval construction. The new ammunition factories will add over 1,800 jobs between direct and indirect employment. In total, the accumulated expenditure on ammunition during this legislature will exceed £6 billion, reinforcing the bet on a sovereign armament industry. Starmer assured that this strategy will not only ensure the UK's military preparedness but also position the country as a technological and productive leader in the military field. 'This review will ensure that our Armed Forces have the necessary equipment to keep us safe, while also generating greater opportunities for engineers, naval constructors, and technicians,' he said from Downing Street. The choice of Glasgow to present this strategic shift sends a clear message. The Scottish city is crucial in the UK's nuclear infrastructure and represents a critical operational base for military deterrence. From there, Starmer reaffirmed his commitment to NATO, highlighting that the UK will continue to be a reliable partner within the Atlantic alliance. 'Russia does not take peace seriously (...) And the UK must be ready,' warned the Prime Minister. This statement points to both Russia and European allies, in a moment of redefinition of continental security. With this strategic shift, the UK positions itself as one of the most active military powers in Europe, aligning its operational capacity with current challenges.

**Britain to get defence boost to send message to Moscow  --  and possibly Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with the UK building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would 'transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment' and that the 3% goal is 'on track' to be met. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks. The UK will also invest £15 billion in its nuclear arsenal and increase its conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons. Mr. Starmer said re-arming would create a 'defence dividend' of well-paid jobs, and the move is also a message to President Donald Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defence.

Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**US urges Australia to increase defence spending to 3.5% of GDP**
US Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth has urged Australia to increase its military spending to 3.5 percent of GDP 'as soon as possible'. However, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that the government will decide on Australia's defence capability needs before announcing spending. Albanese said, 'What you should do in defence is decide what you need, your capability, and then provide for it.' The government is already increasing defence spending by about 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5bn) and aims to increase spending to 2.3 percent of GDP by 2033. However, increasing military spending to 3.5 percent of GDP would cost 100 billion Australian dollars ($65bn) annually, 40 billion Australian dollars ($25bn) more than it spends currently. Matt Grudnoff, a senior economist with The Australia Institute, said 'Australia already spends more than it should' on defence. Worldwide military spending increased by 9.4 percent in 2024, the sharpest rise since the end of the Cold War.

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to Moscow, and to Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 'a battle-ready, armor-clad nation,' according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is aimed at sending a message to Moscow and Washington, with a focus on countering Russia's growing threats. The government will accept all 62 recommendations from a strategic defense review, including increasing production of submarines and weapons, establishing a cyber command, and investing 15 billion pounds in Britain's nuclear arsenal. Starmer said the measures will create a 'defense dividend' of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs. Defense Secretary John Healey stated that the changes will send 'a message to Moscow,' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. The government aims to reach a defense spending target of 2.5% of national income by 2027, with an 'ambition' to reach 3% before 2034.

**The UK seeks to send a message to Moscow as it outlines higher defense spending**
The UK is set to increase its defense spending by 13 billion pounds ($17 billion) per year, reaching 2.5% of national income by 2027, according to British Defense Secretary John Healey. This is the largest increase since the end of the Cold War and is intended to send 'a message to Moscow,' Healey said. The government plans to hit 3% of national income by the early 2030s. The increase is in response to the new threat environment, including Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Healey stated, 'This is Britain standing behind, making our armed forces stronger but making our industrial base stronger, and this is part of our readiness to fight, if required.' The UK has been under pressure from the US to bolster its defense spending, and European countries have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture in response to the changing security landscape.

**Western Military Spending to Exceed Russia's Defense Budget by Several Times, Says Ex-Ukrainian PM**
Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov believes that Western military spending will exceed Russia's defense budget by several times. 'The countries of Europe are increasing their military budgets. Western leaders plan to allocate one trillion euros in 2025 to rearm the armies of European countries. One trillion! This is several times more than Russia's defense budget. Who is threatening whom?' Azarov asked. He also noted that the US plans to allocate over $1 trillion for defense spending in 2026. 'Now, let's add the budgets of the US and Western Europe. Roughly, one trillion plus another trillion. Two trillion! And who is threatening whom? This is more than the defense budgets of Russia, China, and India,' Azarov emphasized. According to him, the calculation is also made to involve Russia in an arms race. 'In the last years of the Soviet Union's existence, under Gorbachev's treacherous policy, the West drew the USSR into an arms race. As a result, the Soviet Union weakened to the point of being, in essence, destroyed.'

**Germany Prepares to Meet Trump's Demands for Increased Military Spending**
Germany is preparing to meet US President Donald Trump's demands for increased military spending, with a possible increase to 5% of GDP. This would be a significant shift for a country that has traditionally been pacifist since the Nazi era. The German government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has announced plans to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, up from the current 2%. This would require an annual budget of over 200 billion euros, compared to a federal budget of around 490 billion euros for 2025. The government wants to prioritize defense and the military, which have been neglected since the end of the Cold War. The Bundeswehr, Germany's military, hopes to increase its personnel to 203,000 soldiers by 2031, but is struggling to recruit. The government plans to introduce a new law to require young men to register for military service at the age of 18. 'We are following the US on this point,' said Johann Wadephul, a conservative politician and member of Merz's party, at a NATO meeting in Turkey. However, the Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has cautioned that the focus should be on the speed, thoroughness, and punctuality of achieving operational goals, rather than the percentage of GDP allocated to defense. 'It's not so much the percentage that matters, but the rapidity, exhaustiveness, and punctuality with which the operational objectives set will be achieved,' he said. The government's decision to exempt defense spending from the 'debt brake' mechanism, which limits the country's debt, has been seen as a significant step towards increasing defense spending. Berlin would become one of the biggest 'payors' of NATO, alongside Poland, which is already close to the 5% target and plans to exceed it.

**Germany Plans to Surpass US in Defense Spending, Reaching 5% of GDP**
New German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced plans to increase defense spending to 5% of the country's GDP, surpassing even the United States. This move is in line with US President Donald Trump's demands for a significant increase in military spending. According to Merz's plan, the additional 3% would be used for military infrastructure, not traditional defense spending. This approach was previously suggested by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. If implemented, Germany would become the top spender in Europe, with a total of 225 billion euros per year. However, not all NATO member states meet the current 2% defense spending target, with some countries like Italy, Spain, and Luxembourg struggling to reach even the 2% mark. A possible compromise is being discussed, which would allow for a stronger inclusion of military infrastructure spending in the overall defense budget. The goal is to reach the new target by 2032, with US Secretary of State Rubio stating that no one expects to reach 5% in one or two years.

**Germany Admits to Potentially Exceeding EU Fiscal Limit**
German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has admitted that the country's spending on defense and infrastructure could exceed the EU's fiscal limit this year. Klingbeil said, 'This is my fifth day in office,' when asked directly if Germany would surpass the 3% deficit limit. 'We are preparing now to set the budget for [2025],' he added. The increased fiscal margin offers the future coalition of Merz (CDU) with the SPD sufficient space and funds to strengthen Germany's defense pillar. This comes after Germany announced a package of measures to boost defense and infrastructure spending worth €1 trillion, breaking with decades of fiscal discipline. Germany and the Netherlands have traditionally led the group of 'frugal' EU member states, but are now seeking more budgetary leeway to increase defense spending. Other 'profligate' countries, including Italy, Spain, and France, are not contravening EU rules. The Greens have agreed with Merz and the SPD on a multi-billion euro package for defense and infrastructure. The EU's fiscal rules, which were renewed last year, are now less strict. The Dutch Finance Minister, Eelco Heinen, said, 'We know that Germany is a fiscally prudent country and we expect it to be so in the future.' The IMF predicts that Germany's deficit will reach 2.95% this year and 4.41% in 2030, while its debt will increase to 74.85% in 2030.

**16 EU Countries Plan to Exceed Defense Spending Limit**
Sixteen EU countries, including Germany, Belgium, and Poland, plan to exceed the defense spending limit of 1.5% of their GDP by using an exception clause in the Stability and Growth Pact. This clause allows countries to increase their defense spending to 1.5% of their GDP for four years, despite the EU's debt rules. The EU Commission had offered this option to member states as part of their defense plans due to the threat from Russia and the potential withdrawal of US support from NATO. According to the EU Commission, using this exception clause could increase defense spending for the EU to approximately €650 billion by 2030. In 2024, EU countries spent €326 billion on defense, a 31% increase from 2021. EU Commissioner said, 'This is a crucial step towards strengthening our collective defense and ensuring the security of our citizens.'

**Global Military Spending Reaches New Record High in 2024**
Global military spending has reached a new record high of $2.7 trillion in 2024, with a 9.4% increase from 2023. Germany's military spending has also increased significantly, reaching $88.5 billion, a 28% increase from the previous year. This puts Germany in fourth place in the list of countries with the highest military spending, behind the US, China, and Russia. According to SIPRI researcher Lorenzo Scarazzato, 'For the first time since reunification, Germany is the country with the highest military spending in Western Europe.' This is due to the 2022 decision to allocate 100 billion euros for the Bundeswehr. Many other European countries have also increased their military spending, with Poland increasing its spending by 31% and Sweden by 34%. The ongoing war in Ukraine has driven up defense spending in Europe, with many countries providing military aid to Ukraine. The US has also increased its military spending, investing $997 billion in its military, with a significant portion going towards modernizing its nuclear arsenal. China has continued its efforts to modernize its military by 2035, with a budget of $314 billion in 2024. Other countries in the region, such as Japan, are also increasing their military spending, with Japan's spending increasing by 21% in 2024. 'There is a risk that these investments will push the region into a dangerous spiral of arms racing,' says Nan Tian, director of the SIPRI program for military expenditure and arms production.

**EU Sets Five-Year Deadline to Surpass Russia in Military Capabilities**
The European Union has set a five-year deadline to surpass Russia in military capabilities. EU leaders agreed that the union should be able to fully defend itself against a potential Russian attack by 2030, despite initial resistance from some European countries. According to Reuters, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that the EU is increasing defense spending due to concerns that the US, which has provided security to Europe since the end of World War II, is shifting its focus to the Indo-Pacific region under Donald Trump's presidency. However, not all EU countries are equally committed to increasing defense spending, particularly those geographically farther from Russia. Tusk noted that countries with the lowest defense spending struggled to accept the European Commission's proposed five-year program. 'There are several large countries that still spend very little. And they don't want to spend more. Not yet,' Tusk said. The five-year deadline is based on an analysis by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who believes that Russia will need five years to restore its offensive capabilities, lost in the war against Ukraine, to a level that would allow it to attack Europe. Tusk clarified that this does not mean that Europe expects a Russian attack in 2030, but rather that European countries must be prepared to defend themselves against potential Russian aggression. 'This is the only way to avoid war,' he said.

**EU Leaders Agree to Increase Defense Spending to Counter Russia by 2030**
European Union leaders have agreed that the EU should be able to defend itself against Russia by 2030, despite initial opposition from some countries, said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday, March 21, according to Reuters. The EU is rapidly increasing defense spending due to concerns that the United States, which has guaranteed its security since the end of World War II, is no longer interested in doing so, shifting its focus to the Indo-Pacific region. However, not all EU countries are equally committed to increasing defense spending, especially those that are geographically farther away from Russia. Tusk stated that countries that currently spend less on defense were reluctant to support the proposed five-year program presented by the European Commission. 'Behind the scenes... it caused some emotions. Especially in countries that are currently spending little on defense. There are a few large countries that are still spending very little. And they don't want to spend more. Not yet,' Tusk said at a press conference. Spain, which is a member of NATO, spent 1.28% of its GDP on defense in 2024, while Italy spent 1.49%, which is significantly lower than the agreed NATO target of 2% GDP, despite three years of full-scale war by Russia against Ukraine and pressure from the US to increase defense spending. Slovenia, Belgium, and Portugal also spend between 1.29% and 1.55% of their GDP on defense. Italy plans to increase its military spending to 1.6% of GDP by 2027, while Spain aims to reach the NATO target of 2% GDP by 2029. 'Our position, which we share with Denmark and Sweden, is that the greater advantage Russia has today, the more we need to hurry. As the European Council, we ultimately adopted this commitment: by 2030, Europe must increase its defense capabilities. Europe must be, in terms of the army, arms, and technologies, obviously stronger than Russia. And it will be,' Tusk said. Tusk noted that the five-year term corresponds to an analysis by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, according to which Europe has just that much time before Russia restores its offensive capabilities after losses in Ukraine and is ready to attack. However, he emphasized that this does not mean that Europe expects an attack from Russia in 2030. 'The main thing is for Europe to be truly able to defend itself and restrain Putin. Or rather, it's not so much about defense as about demonstrating real actions and decisions that Putin's Russia has no chance against a united and well-armed Europe. This is the only effective way to avoid war,' Tusk added. On March 19, the European Commission presented a White Paper on European defense and a defense package as part of the Europe's Re-equipment / Readiness 2030 plan. The White Paper proposes that EU member countries make significant investments in defense, purchase defense systems, and increase the readiness of the European defense industry in the long term. As noted by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the plan provides for the allocation of over 800 billion euros, including for the increase of state funding for defense at the national level.

**Russia's Military Spending Exceeds Combined European Spending in 2024**
According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Russia's military spending in 2024 exceeded the combined military spending of all European countries. The IISS reported that Russia's military spending increased by 42% in 2024, reaching 13.1 trillion rubles ($145.9 billion), while European countries' military spending increased by 11.7% to $457 billion. In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), Russia's military spending is equivalent to nearly $462 billion. The IISS predicts that Russia's military spending will increase by 13.7% in 2025, reaching 15.6 trillion rubles ($171 billion), which will account for 7.5% of Russia's GDP and nearly 40% of the federal budget. European countries, including NATO members, are discussing increasing their military spending target to 3% of GDP by 2030, but a final decision has not been made.

**Russia's Military Spending Surpasses European Countries' Combined Defense Budgets**
According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Russia's military spending has exceeded the total defense budgets of all European countries. In 2023, Russia's military spending increased by over 40% to $146 billion, which accounts for 6.7% of the country's GDP. Adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), Russia's military spending in 2024 reached $462 billion, surpassing the combined defense budgets of all European countries. The IISS report also notes that global defense spending reached $2.46 trillion in 2024, an 8.9% increase from 2023. Ukraine's military spending in 2024 was $40 billion, or 20% of its GDP, the highest in the world. However, this figure is distorted by the significant amount of foreign aid that goes towards Ukraine's military spending. 'Our analysis shows that Russia is able to fund its military at a higher level, despite its smaller budget in dollars,' said Fenella McGerty, a senior research fellow at the IISS. 'European NATO countries are on track to reach the 2% GDP target within five years, but it will take them until 2035 to reach the 5% target proposed by former US President Donald Trump,' said Defense Express analysts.
