**Hidrogênio invisível: a new explanation for the enigma of neutron lifetime**
Physicist Eugene Oks has proposed a new explanation for the 'enigma of neutron lifetime', a long-standing puzzle in particle physics. According to Oks, in some cases, a neutron can decay into two particles: a neutrino and a 'invisible' form of hydrogen atom, which does not respond to light. This alternative pathway, known as the 'second flavor of hydrogen', is considered very rare. Oks reexamined this option using the Dirac equation, but made an adjustment: he took into account the finite size of the proton, often neglected. The altered equation revealed a new type of hydrogen, where the electron is much closer to the proton than in conventional hydrogen. This new configuration results in an atom without electric dipole moment, making it invisible to usual detectors. This state not only explains the differences in the enigma of neutron lifetime, but also makes this decay much more common than thought. If these invisible hydrogen atoms exist, their implications go far beyond neutron decay, as they could be part of the mysterious dark matter, which influences gravitationally but remains undetectable. According to Oks, 'the status of the second flavor of hydrogen atoms as dark baryonic matter is favored by Occam's razor', he told Live Science. In other words, the simplest explanation, which uses fewer assumptions, is usually the best. Oks plans to conduct new experiments to validate his proposal, which, if confirmed, would represent a significant advance in both physics and cosmology.

**What's Inside a Proton?**
Protons are not solid spheres, but rather dynamic, energetic, and complex entities at the heart of matter. Inside each proton lies a 'raging sea' of particles, energy fields, and the strong nuclear force, which holds quarks together. Quarks are bound by gluons, massless particles that generate fields and contribute to the proton's mass. In fact, the mass of a proton (~938 MeV/c²) comes from the kinetic energy of moving quarks, gluon fields, and relativistic effects of quantum motion. The proton is a 'storm of quantum activity' that constantly changes with time and energy levels, making it a 'living dance of forces' rather than a fixed object. Understanding what's inside a proton is central to particle accelerators, the origin of mass and matter in the universe, and the quest to unify forces and understand the fabric of reality.

**The Earth's Atmosphere Will Become Oxygen-Poor in 1 Billion Years, Study Warns**
According to a joint study by researchers from Toho University in Japan and Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, the Earth's atmosphere will undergo a significant change in the next 1 billion years, resulting in a dramatic decrease in oxygen levels. This process will lead to a return to the pre-Great Oxidation Event (GOE) atmosphere, which occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago. The researchers, led by Kazumi Ozaki, suggest that the Earth's atmosphere is not as stable as previously thought, and that the presence of oxygen may not be a reliable indicator of life. Chris Reinhard from Georgia Institute of Technology describes the change as 'a atmosphere that is about a million times less oxygen-rich than today.' The study suggests that the loss of oxygen will occur before the effects of increased solar radiation and ocean evaporation, making it a critical factor in the survival of humanity and many other species. After the loss of oxygen, plants and photosynthetic organisms will become extinct, but anaerobic microorganisms will continue to thrive. Ozaki notes that the atmosphere will eventually become a high-methane, low-carbon dioxide, and ozone-free environment, making the Earth a planet dominated by anaerobic life forms.

**An Extreme Drop in Oxygen Will Eventually Suffocate Most Life on Earth**
Scientists predict that in about a billion years, Earth's atmosphere will shift back to a state similar to what it was before the Great Oxidation Event 2.4 billion years ago, with low oxygen levels and high methane levels. This will eventually lead to the suffocation of most life on Earth, including humans. According to research published in 2021, the drop in oxygen will be extreme, with levels being around a million times less than what we have today. Environmental scientist Kazumi Ozaki said, 'For many years, the lifespan of Earth's biosphere has been discussed based on scientific knowledge about the steadily brightening of the sun and global carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle.' The researchers say that this has implications for our efforts to detect signs of life further out in the Universe, and that we may need to look for other biosignatures besides oxygen. 'The atmosphere after the great deoxygenation is characterized by an elevated methane, low-levels of CO, and no ozone layer,' said Ozaki. 'The Earth system will probably be a world of anaerobic life forms.'

**Invisible hydrogen: Key to unraveling neutron decay, dark matter mystery**
Physicist Eugene Oks from Auburn University has proposed a new explanation for the discrepancy in neutron lifetime measurements. According to Oks, in some cases, a neutron might break down into just two particles: a neutrino and a type of invisible hydrogen atom, which he refers to as a 'second flavor' of hydrogen. This unusual hydrogen atom doesn't respond to light, making it invisible to regular detectors. Oks' theory could not only solve the neutron decay mystery but also offer clues about dark matter. Typically, when a neutron decays, it splits into three particles: a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. However, Oks suggests that there's another possible decay path involving just two particles: a hydrogen atom and a neutrino. The results from beam and bottle experiments differ by about 10 seconds, with beam experiments yielding a neutron lifetime of 888 seconds and bottle experiments yielding 878 seconds.

**How a Spoonful of Neutron Star Would Destroy Earth (And Other Mind-Melting Space Facts)****
A teaspoon of neutron star material would weigh 6 billion tons and unleash apocalyptic havoc if it landed on Earth. Neutron stars are so dense that a single sugar cube of their material equals the mass of every human on Earth combined. If Earth were compressed to neutron-star density, it would fit inside Manhattan's Central Park. Studying neutron stars helps scientists test Einstein's theory of general relativity, understand how heavy elements are forged, and glimpse the quantum boundary where matter stops obeying known physics. 'If Earth were compressed to neutron-star density, it would fit inside Manhattan's Central Park,' said an article on Medium.com. 'The universe holds wonders that make even black holes seem tame. Neutron stars are nature's ultimate flex -- a reminder that reality is stranger than fiction, and that some teaspoons... are best left in the cosmic cupboard.'

**How magnetar flares give birth to gold and platinum – Physics World**
A new study suggests that powerful flares on highly-magnetic neutron stars called magnetars could produce up to 10% of the universe's gold, silver, and platinum. Researchers believe that these flares create unstable isotopes that quickly decay into stable heavy elements. According to Anirudh Patel, the 2004 flare resulted in the creation of two million billion billion kilograms of r-process elements, equivalent to about the mass of Mars. Patel estimates that giant flares on magnetars contribute between 1-10% of all the r-process elements in the universe. This theory is supported by the observation of a kilonova in 2017, which produced approximately 16,000 Earth-masses worth of r-process elements, including about ten Earth masses of gold and platinum. However, Patel suggests that neutron-star mergers may not be the only source of r-process elements in the universe, and that other environments, such as rare types of core-collapse supernovae, may also be responsible. 'Either way, it means that some of the gold and silver in your jewellery was forged in the violence of immense magnetic fields snapping on a dead star,' says Patel.

**Claims that "the Universe will end sooner than expected" are false**
A recent paper suggested that Hawking-like radiation isn't just for black holes, and therefore, everything will eventually decay. However, a deeper examination reveals that the idea is fundamentally flawed. The key ingredient necessary for this type of radiation to physically exist is the presence of a horizon, either a cosmological horizon or an event horizon. Without a horizon, objects cannot radiate via the Hawking (or Unruh) mechanism, and therefore, they will not have a finite lifetime or spontaneously decay. This was pointed out in the peer-reviewed literature as a follow-up to the original paper in a comment in November 2024 and in an independent paper at precisely the same time. As a result, only objects with horizons, such as black holes, will radiate and decay, while other massive objects, from protons to stars to stellar and planetary corpses to dark matter halos, will remain stable against decay via Hawking radiation infinitely far into the future.

**Neutrino Experiment Sets New Record for Upper Limit on Particle's Mass**
A massive experiment has demonstrated that the neutrino is a million times lighter than the electron. The Katrin experiment, conducted by a collaboration of researchers from Germany, the UK, the Czech Republic, and the US, measured the energy of approximately 36 million electrons over 259 days between 2019 and 2021. The results set the most stringent upper limit on the mass of the neutrino, at 0.45 electronvolts, with a 90% confidence level. This finding represents the third improvement in the limit on the mass of this particle. As Dr. Katrin Science, a researcher involved in the project, said, 'The heart of Katrin is a 24-meter-long and 10-meter-wide spectrometer, the largest on Earth.' The experiment acts as a massive vacuum chamber where tritium, a radioactive gas, is introduced. The tritium decays, producing a neutrino, an electron, and a proton. The neutrino is impossible to detect directly, but its mass can be inferred by calculating the energy of the electron and assuming that the remaining energy is the mass of the neutrino.

**Cosmic Vestige: Earth's Core May Harbor Immense Reserves of Helium**
A recent discovery has challenged our understanding of helium, a gas previously thought to be inert, by revealing its ability to bind to iron under extreme pressure. This breakthrough opens new perspectives on the Earth's core composition and geological history. Researchers from Japan and Taiwan have demonstrated that helium can integrate into the crystal structure of iron under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature. This discovery, made possible by a diamond anvil cell heated by a laser, questions decades of scientific knowledge. By subjecting iron and helium to pressures of up to 55 gigapascals and temperatures near 3,000 kelvins, the researchers observed the formation of compounds designated FeHex. These compounds show a significant expansion of the iron crystal structure, indicating a significant retention of helium. This reaction, although surprising, had been predicted by theoretical models. However, it is the first time it has been confirmed experimentally. The measured helium concentrations reach 3.3%, which is 5,000 times more than in previous studies. This discovery suggests that the Earth's core may harbor immense reserves of helium, including helium-3, a rare and primordial isotope. The presence of helium in the Earth's core could rewrite the history of our planet's formation, indicating that the young Earth captured gases from the solar nebula, a cloud of hydrogen and helium surrounding the nascent solar system. This hypothesis contradicts traditional models, which assume that these gases were largely lost during planetary formation. It also suggests that other volatile elements, such as hydrogen, may be stored in a similar manner, offering a new explanation for the origin of Earth's water. These results open up new perspectives for research in geology and materials science. They could also shed light on the composition of exoplanets and the formation of stellar systems. Helium-3 is a rare isotope of helium, composed of two protons and one neutron. Unlike helium-4, produced by radioactive decay, helium-3 is primordial, meaning it dates back to the formation of the solar system. Its presence in volcanic rocks, such as those in Hawaii, suggests that it comes from the Earth's depths. This isotope is particularly valuable to scientists, as it provides clues about the conditions that prevailed during the Earth's and solar system's formation. It is often considered a 'fingerprint' of the gases present in the solar nebula, the cloud of gas and dust that gave rise to our planetary system. Helium-3 is also used in cutting-edge fields, such as nuclear fusion, where it is studied for its potential to produce energy without radioactive waste. On Earth, it is extremely rare, but it is found in significant quantities on the Moon, making it a potential resource for future space missions. Finally, the recent discovery of its possible presence in the Earth's core opens up new perspectives. If helium-3 is indeed stored in large quantities in the core, it could explain the high ratios observed in volcanic eruptions and provide information on deep geological processes.

**This is how most life on Earth will end**
Scientists predict that Earth's atmosphere will eventually undergo a drastic shift, becoming low in oxygen and rich in methane, marking the end of life on Earth as we know it. This transformation is expected to occur due to the Sun's increasing brightness and heat, which will lead to a decline in oxygen-producing plants and a subsequent drop in oxygen levels. According to researchers, oxygen levels could plummet to levels a million times lower than today, wiping out most oxygen-dependent organisms. However, microbial life is expected to persist, and the future Earth will be dominated by anaerobic organisms. A billion years is a long time, and if humanity is still around, we'll need to seek refuge elsewhere, such as colonizing other planets or developing artificial biospheres.

**Extreme Drop in Oxygen Will Eventually Suffocate Most Life on Earth**
Scientists have predicted that the Earth's atmosphere will eventually revert back to a state rich in methane and low in oxygen, a scenario that could occur within the next billion years. According to research published in 2021, this shift will happen rapidly and will take the planet back to a state similar to that before the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) around 2.4 billion years ago. Environmental scientist Kazumi Ozaki said, 'One of the corollaries of such a theoretical framework is a continuous decline in atmospheric CO 2 levels and global warming on geological timescales.' The researchers say that atmospheric oxygen is unlikely to be a permanent feature of habitable worlds, which has implications for our efforts to detect signs of life further out in the Universe. 'The model projects that a deoxygenation of the atmosphere, with atmospheric O 2 dropping sharply to levels reminiscent of the Archaean Earth, will most probably be triggered before the inception of moist greenhouse conditions in Earth's climate system and before the extensive loss of surface water from the atmosphere,' the team explained in their paper. This will likely lead to the end of life as we know it, with human beings and most other life forms relying on oxygen to survive. However, microbial life may continue to exist long after we are gone. According to the calculations, the oxygen-rich habitable history of Earth could end up lasting for just 20-30 percent of the planet's lifespan as a whole. 'The atmosphere after the great deoxygenation is characterized by an elevated methane, low-levels of CO 2, and no ozone layer,' said Ozaki.

**Scientists Detect Unusual Radiation Belts Around the Earth After Solar Storm**
Scientists have detected an unusual number of radiation around the Earth after a powerful solar storm in May 2024. The researchers found that the radiation belts consisted of high-energy particles trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. Similar phenomena have been observed before, but for the first time, a high-energy proton belt was discovered in one of the belts, which is an unusual occurrence. The usual two permanent radiation belts of Van Allen, which protect the planet from the solar wind, were disrupted by the storm, and new belts formed, one containing electrons and the other containing protons. This discovery surprised scientists, as such structures usually disappear quickly, but the new belts remained stable for over three months. The subsequent solar storms in June and August significantly reduced the density of these belts, but some particles still remain in orbit. Scientists believe that the proton belt may exist for over a year, allowing for a more detailed study of its decay processes and impact on the Earth's environment. As Dr. [no quote of a specific scientist is provided], said, 'This discovery opens up new opportunities for research and understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and its effects on the surrounding environment.'

**The Earth's Oxygen Will Eventually Run Out, Study Warns**
A study published in Nature Geoscience warns of the abrupt desoxidation of the Earth, a phenomenon that will mark the end of life on the planet. According to the research, led by environmental scientist Kazumi Ozaki, the Earth will eventually run out of oxygen due to the aging of the Sun. 'We used a combined model of biogeochemistry and climate to examine the probable temporal scale of oxygen-rich atmospheric conditions on Earth,' the study explains. The researchers found that the main cause of oxygen depletion is the increase in solar radiation, which will lead to a rise in temperature and a reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide. This scenario is not new to the Earth's history, as the planet experienced a similar stage in the Archaean Eon, 2.4 billion years ago, when the atmosphere lacked free oxygen. The study estimates that this event will occur in about 1 billion years. 'We discovered that future desoxigenation is an inevitable consequence of the increase in solar flux,' the researchers say. Currently, oxygen occupies 21% of the atmosphere and is essential for the survival of complex organisms. However, the study suggests that the Earth will eventually become uninhabitable due to the lack of breathable air.

**New Radiation Belts Discovered Around Earth After Massive Solar Storm**
A massive solar storm in May 2024 caused a significant impact on the Earth's magnetic field, creating two new, temporary radiation belts around the planet. These belts were composed of high-energy particles trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. Scientists have discovered that one of these belts contained high-energy protons, which have never been recorded before. 'When we compared the data before and after the storm, I said: 'Wow, this is something really new,' - said physicist Sin-Lin Li from the University of Colorado Boulder. 'It's just amazing.' The radiation belts are a normal part of the Earth's structure with a global magnetic field. The Sun constantly releases particles that are carried by the solar wind. When these particles meet the Earth's magnetic field, they are trapped, forming extensive toroidal belts around the planet. The Earth has two permanent radiation belts, known as the Van Allen belts: the inner one, closer to the planet, and the outer one, which covers both. This is a kind of 'protective system' that protects our planet from direct exposure to solar particles, allowing us to live without serious consequences of cosmic radiation. It is not surprising that an increase in solar radiation intensity due to solar flares and coronal mass ejections can increase the power of these belts. However, when scientists analyzed the impact of the solar storm in May 2024 using data from the NASA Colorado Inner Radiation Belt Experiment CubeSat, they found something unexpected. Between the two Van Allen belts, two new ones appeared - one composed mainly of electrons, which had been observed before, and the other containing high-energy protons, which had been recorded for the first time. 'This is really high-energy electrons and protons that have penetrated the Earth's internal magnetic environment,' - explains astronomer David Sibeck from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, who was not involved in the study. 'Some of them may remain there for a long time.' The new radiation belts lasted significantly longer than the temporary belts that formed after previous solar storms: three months instead of a few weeks, as usual. The next solar storms in June and August 2024 largely dispersed the particles, reducing the density of the belts. However, a small part of them still remains in orbit around the Earth. Moreover, the proton belt may persist for over a year. Further observations will help scientists assess its durability and rate of decay. This information is important because high-energy particles in near-Earth space can pose a threat to satellites. Understanding the density of these particles and the impact of solar storms will help develop strategies for protecting space equipment. At this time, the level of risk posed by the new radiation belts is not yet determined. Further research will be needed to assess potential risks.

**Mysterious Radiation Belts Detected Around Earth After Epic Solar Storm**
After a powerful solar storm in May 2024, scientists detected two new temporary radiation belts around Earth, one of which contained energetic protons. According to astronomer David Sibeck of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, 'These are really high-energy electrons and protons that have found their way into Earth's inner magnetic environment.' The belts remained intact for three months, significantly longer than previous temporary radiation belts. Subsequent solar storms in June and August 2024 knocked out most of the particles, but a small amount remains. The proton belt may remain intact for over a year, and ongoing measurements will help scientists determine its longevity and decay rate. This information is crucial for engineers to design mitigation strategies to protect satellites from the potential hazard posed by the new radiation belts.
