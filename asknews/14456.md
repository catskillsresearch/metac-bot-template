**Is the EU funding Russia more than Ukraine?**
According to Russia Fossil Tracker, the EU remains the largest importer of Russian fossil fuels, despite a 90% decrease in official imports of Russian oil by the end of last year. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, stated that the alliance has not imposed 'the strongest sanctions' on Russian oil and gas due to concerns about escalating the conflict and the short-term cost savings of buying Russian energy. CREA estimates that the volume of Russian gas piped to Europe via Turkey rose by 26.77% in January and February 2025 compared to the same period last year. Russia has made €885 billion globally from its fossil fuel exports since the beginning of the war, with EU countries buying more than €209 billion of these exports. Ukrainian presidential adviser Vladyslav Vlasiuk stated that Russian gas exports to the bloc are directly 'fuelling Russia's aggression' and it is 'time to cut off the petrodollar flow.' The European Commission's own calculations put EU financial assistance for Ukraine at €147.9 billion, far below the revenue generated for the Kremlin by gas and oil exports. However, the collective amount of financial support given or earmarked for Ukraine by the EU and other European nations is significantly higher, at €247.37 billion.

**Ukraine's Scrap Metal Exports to Poland and Turkey: A Complex Issue**
The Ukrainian scrap metal market has seen a significant increase in exports to Poland, with a 95% rise in April 2025 compared to the previous year. Most of the scrap metal is being exported to Turkey through Poland. The Polish market for scrap metal has been growing rapidly, with a record 2.81 million tons exported in 2024. According to GMK Center, the export of scrap metal to third countries has increased from 25% in 2022 to 61% in 2023-2024. Turkey is the key market for Polish scrap metal exports, with 529,000 tons exported in 2024, a 2.3-fold increase from 2023. Ukraine is the main supplier of scrap metal to Poland, with 251,103 tons exported in 2024, a 57.4% increase from the previous year. 'The Polish market for scrap metal is showing steady growth in exports, driven by changes in logistics and geography of supplies,' said GMK Center. 'The record 2.8 million tons of exports in 2024 indicate an increase in external trade, mainly due to the activation of supplies to Turkey.' The growth in exports to Turkey is accompanied by a parallel increase in imports of scrap metal from Ukraine to Poland, indicating the formation of a transit role for Poland in the European supply chain of raw materials.' As a result of the Ukrainian government's 180-euro export duty on scrap metal to non-EU countries, many unscrupulous exporters are smuggling the metal to the EU and then to third countries, including Turkey, resulting in significant budget losses for Ukraine, estimated at over 2 billion euros.

**Poland Becomes Transit Hub for Ukrainian Scrap Metal**
Poland has become a transit hub for Ukrainian scrap metal, according to media reports. The scrap metal market in Poland has seen significant growth over the past few years, with exports reaching a record 2.81 million tons in 2024. In 2023-2024, 61% of Poland's scrap metal exports went to third countries, up from 25% in 2022. Turkey is the key market for Polish scrap metal, with 529,000 tons exported in 2024, a 2.3-fold increase from 2023. Poland imports scrap metal mainly from Ukraine, with 251,030 tons imported in 2024, a 57.4% increase from the previous year. 'The Polish scrap metal market is showing steady growth in exports against the backdrop of transformations in logistics chains and changes in the geography of supplies. The record 2.8 million tons of exports in 2024 indicate an increase in external trade, primarily due to the activation of supplies to Turkey. The growth of exports to Turkey is accompanied by a parallel increase in imports of scrap metal to Poland from Ukraine, indicating the formation of a transit role for Poland in the European supply chain of raw materials,' said GMK Center. Ukraine's scrap metal exports to countries outside the EU have increased by 95% in April 2025, with almost all of it going to Poland. This is due to a 180-euro customs duty on exports to non-EU countries, while exports to EU countries are duty-free. As a result, some unscrupulous exporters are smuggling scrap metal to the EU and then to third countries, including Turkey, to avoid customs payments. According to estimates by MP Dmytro Kyselyovskyy, Ukraine has lost over 2 billion budget revenues due to this re-export. Currently, 75 restrictions on scrap metal exports have been imposed in 48 countries worldwide, as the supply of scrap metal is decreasing, and it is needed more, especially with the modernization of metallurgy in the country. The EU has restrictions on exporting scrap metal to non-OECD countries, but the European Commission is already working to further reduce the outflow of raw materials.

**EU and Ukraine Develop New Trade Model to Replace ATM**
The European Union (EU) and Ukraine are developing a new trade model that will be in effect until Ukraine's accession to the EU. The new model will differ from the Autonomous Trade Measures (ATM) that are set to expire on June 5. According to Taras Kachka, Ukraine's trade representative, the new model will be presented jointly with the European Commission in June. 'We have certain modalities that will suit both European farmers and ours... I think we can present this model together with the European Commission in June,' he said. The new model will not be as catastrophic for Ukraine as previously feared, with the country's agricultural sector expected to continue exporting to the EU. However, there may be challenges for Ukraine's poultry and sugar exports. The EU has announced that quotas will be reintroduced on June 6 and will remain in place until the end of 2025, with 7/12 of the annual quota under the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) agreement. Ukrainian agricultural associations have warned that the end of the current trade rules with the EU could lead to a 3.3 billion euro reduction in exports and a 2.5% decline in GDP. The European Business Association has also expressed concerns that the end of ATM is not a cancellation of the DCFTA agreement, but rather a significant blow to Ukraine's economy. Experts believe that the EU is likely to choose a middle ground between the very bad and very good options for Ukraine.

**Ukraine Transformed into Transit Hub for Scrap Metal, GMK Center Reports**
According to GMK Center, Ukraine has transformed into a transit hub for its scrap metal, with exports reaching a record 2.81 million tons in 2024. The share of scrap metal exports to third countries via Poland has increased from 25% in 2022 to 61% in 2023-2024. The key market for Ukrainian scrap metal exports is Turkey, with 529,000 tons exported in 2024, a 2.3-fold increase from 2023. Meanwhile, Poland imports scrap metal mainly from Ukraine, with 251,030 tons imported in 2024, a 57.4% increase from the previous year. 'The market for black metal scrap in Poland shows stable growth in exports against the backdrop of transformations in logistics chains and changes in the geography of supplies,' GMK Center notes. The growth in exports to Turkey is accompanied by a parallel increase in imports of scrap metal to Poland from Ukraine, indicating the formation of a transit role for Poland in the European supply chain of raw materials.' As noted, the growth in exports to Turkey is accompanied by a parallel increase in imports of scrap metal to Poland from Ukraine, indicating the formation of a transit role for Poland in the European supply chain of raw materials. Additionally, scrap metal exports from Ukraine in April 2025 increased by 95% year-over-year, with almost all of it going to Poland. This is due to a 180-euro duty on exports of scrap metal to non-EU countries in Ukraine, while the duty on exports to the EU is zero. As a result, some unscrupulous exporters are using manipulations to export scrap metal to the EU first, and then to third countries, including Turkey. According to estimates by MP Dmytro Kyselyov, Ukraine has already lost over 2 billion budgetary receipts due to this re-export.

**Ukraine's IT Export Continues to Grow, Reaching $569 Million in April**
The export of IT services in Ukraine increased by 4.4% in April 2025, reaching $569 million. This is $24 million more than in March. According to the Lviv IT Cluster, this growth is the third consecutive month of improvement. 'Despite the unstable times, we are observing a monthly growth in the export of computer services. If this trend continues, we cautiously expect that the export of IT services will remain stable and even repeat the results of 2024. However, if there are no significant shocks in the industry, and the current dynamics are maintained, these indicators will be only 0.5% to 1%,' said Stepan Veselovsky, CEO of the Lviv IT Cluster. The total export revenue of all Ukrainian services in April 2025 was $1.32 billion, which is $40 million or 3.1% more than in March.

**Ukrainian Business Associations Call for Immediate Action to Postpone Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism**
Business associations in Ukraine have called on the government to immediately address the European Union to postpone the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). The Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (UUIE) stated that the implementation of CBAM without considering the war situation is 'a direct blow to the competitiveness of Ukrainian exports.' The Federation of Employers of Ukraine (FEU) predicts that the introduction of the carbon tax in 2026 will reduce Ukraine's export of goods subject to CBAM by $1.8 billion. The Ukrainian Cement Association, the National Association of Extractive Industry of Ukraine, Energy Club, the European Business Association, and other industry organizations have also joined the call, demanding the activation of negotiations with the European Commission and the initiation of a postponement of CBAM for Ukraine during the war and recovery period. Ukrainian lawmakers have also joined the call, with the Parliamentary Committee on Economic Development officially addressing the government on May 28 to initiate the necessary actions to obtain a postponement. According to MP Musa Magomedov, the process should involve the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada, and business. An official request to the European Commission has not yet been submitted, although it is a prerequisite for activating Article 30.7 of the CBAM regulation, which allows for exclusion for countries in force majeure conditions. Experts emphasize that due to lengthy bureaucratic procedures, it is crucial to send the request as soon as possible, ideally within the next few weeks, to avoid disruptions in trade with the EU. According to GMK Center estimates, 14.5% of Ukraine's exports to the EU in 2024 will be subject to CBAM, including metal, energy, cement, and chemical products. Total export losses in 2026-2030 may reach $4.7 billion, with investments totaling $2.7 billion.

**Ukraine's Trade Deficit Reaches Historic High Amid War-Driven Imports**
Ukraine's trade deficit has reached a historic high, with imports exceeding exports by $8.6 billion in the first three months of 2025. According to the State Customs Service, Ukraine's export of goods decreased by 7% in January-March 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, while imports increased by 16%. The trade deficit is currently being covered by external financial assistance, which is expected to reach $56.9 billion in 2025. However, the flow of dollars and euros from partners is not infinite. 'The situation with external financing will significantly worsen in 2026,' warns Tetyana Bogdan, director of scientific work at Growford Institute. The increase in imports is due to several factors, including the war, which has led to a shortage of gas, chemicals, and energy. The import of gas has increased fourfold in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, reaching $629 million. The crisis in the chemical industry has also led to a 50% decrease in the production of fertilizers in March. The import of fertilizers has increased by $220 million, while the import of energy equipment has increased by $900 million. The military import has also increased, with a 15% increase in the import of 'other goods' (including weapons) to $1.36 billion. The import of consumer goods has decreased, with the largest decrease in the import of medicines, cars, mobile phones, fuel, and household appliances. The increase in the trade deficit is primarily due to the import of gas, energy equipment, and military needs, which account for $2.1-2.2 billion of the $2.4 billion increase in imports in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The import of these categories of goods is a direct result of Russia's military aggression. 'It is obvious that the economic block of the government needs to take additional measures to support Ukrainian exporters,' advises Danylo Getmanets, head of the parliamentary committee on taxation.

**Ukraine's Economic Growth Forecast for 2025: 2.0% According to the European Commission**
The European Commission forecasts a 2.0% economic growth in Ukraine in 2025, due to the ongoing war, which is putting pressure on production capacities and business activity. Export is expected to decline due to a decrease in industrial production, particularly in energy-intensive sectors, as well as the closure of 'Pokrovskvugillia', a key supplier for the metal industry. The export of agricultural products is also expected to decline due to the 2024 crop failure caused by unfavorable weather conditions. A high import of energy resources, coal, and materials for defense and reconstruction will support a significant level of imports, leading to a negative impact on the country's trade balance. In 2025, export is expected to grow by 1.8%, while import will grow by 5.5%. In 2026, export will grow by 11.4%, and import will grow by 6.0%. Domestic demand will remain stable due to growing investments, including in defense, repair, and reconstruction of the energy sector. Private consumption will also support growth, although high inflation will limit purchasing power. By 2026, economic growth will accelerate to 4.7% under the assumption of gradual economic recovery due to investments in reconstruction, solving export problems, and growing economic confidence. However, the current account will remain in deficit due to a significant trade deficit and the replacement of grants with loans. The trade deficit will increase to 16.2% of GDP in 2025 (from 15.9% in 2024) and decrease to 14.8% in 2026. The payment balance deficit will increase to 13.2% of GDP in 2025 (from 8.1% in 2024) and decrease to 11.5% in 2026. The forecast is accompanied by high uncertainty with risks of worsening the situation. A deterioration in security may exacerbate infrastructure destruction, export disruptions, and labor shortages due to mobilization and migration. On the other hand, a rapid improvement in the situation may accelerate recovery. Due to the war and mobilization, the number of the workforce has significantly decreased, resulting in a deficit and a 23% increase in nominal wages in 2024. The labor shortage will remain acute due to slow reintegration, migration, and mismatch of qualifications. The unemployment rate will decrease from 14.8% in 2024 to 13.8% in 2025 and 11.6% in 2026. Inflation will peak at 12.6% in 2025 but decrease to 7.7% in 2026 due to a tight monetary policy and a weakening of supply shocks. The budget deficit decreased to 17.3% of GDP in 2024 due to an increase in taxes on fuel and tobacco. In 2025, additional revenue from the war levy (1.4% of GDP) and the bank profit tax (0.8% of GDP) will support the budget, but high defense spending will keep the deficit at 18.4% of GDP. In 2026, the deficit will decrease to 10.6% of GDP due to stronger economic growth and a shift in spending towards reconstruction. The public debt will peak at 109.8% of GDP in 2025 and decrease to 108.9% in 2026.

**Ukraine Exceeds Tax Collection Plan by $1 Billion in First Quarter of 2025**
Ukraine has exceeded its tax collection plan by $1 billion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Ministry of Finance. This is a significant improvement in the country's economic situation compared to initial forecasts. As stated by Minister of Finance Sergey Marchenko, 'The tax revenues for the first quarter of 2025 exceeded the planned indicator by $1 billion, which indicates a significant improvement in the financial situation in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the initial budgetary forecasts.' The main reason for the excess tax revenue is the better-than-expected electricity supply situation during the winter season, which positively affected production. Marchenko noted that this trend has been observed since 2023. 'This is not just a part of some trend. This situation was observed in 2024 and 2023 as well. For example, in 2024, we collected an additional $10 million compared to 2023,' he explained. The stable growth of tax revenues confirms the effectiveness of the country's internal fiscal policy and is an important component of macroeconomic stability in Ukraine. 'This allows us to consider the possibility of gradual reduction of dependence on international aid. However, this process will be slow, as we need to balance the 2026 budget in accordance with the commitments agreed with the IMF,' Marchenko emphasized. He also noted that the main challenge remains the need to reduce the budget deficit in 2026 compared to 2025.

**Ukraine's Export in 2024: Key Findings**
According to the Financial Pulse Center for Economic Research, Ukraine's export of goods in 2024 reached $38.9 billion, accounting for 61.6% of the 2021 level. Food products and raw materials for their production made up the largest share of exports, accounting for 63.4% of all shipments abroad. This segment grew by 12.1% in 2024, reaching 89.09% of the 2021 level, said Dilyara Mustafayeva, head of the analytical department of Financial Pulse. 'Product from the metal industry made up a significant part of Ukraine's export in 2024, accounting for 11.4% of the total volume,' she said. However, due to power outages, falling metal prices, and decreased demand, the volume of metal products exported decreased to 28% of the 2021 level. Approximately 59% of currency inflows from exports in 2024 came from European countries, particularly 57% from EU countries.

**Ukraine's Exports in 2024: Key Findings and Trends**
According to the Center for Economic Research 'Financial Pulse', the total value of Ukraine's exports in 2024 was $38.9 billion, which is 61.6% of the 2021 level. Food products and raw materials for their production accounted for 63.4% of all exports, with a 12.1% increase in 2024, reaching 89.09% of the 2021 level, says Dilyara Mustafayeva, head of the analytical department of 'Financial Pulse'. 'The main part of Ukraine's exports in 2024 was metal products, which accounted for 11.4% of the total value. However, due to the shutdown of electricity, a decline in global metal prices, and a decrease in demand, the volume of metal products exports decreased to 28% of the 2021 level.' Additionally, 59% of the country's foreign exchange earnings from exports in 2024 came from European countries, including 57% from EU countries. Furthermore, the import of goods increased by 8.14% in 2024 compared to 2023, reaching $69 billion, which is 98.9% of the 2021 level. The main item of import remains machinery products, with expenses accounting for 35.4% of the total import value.

**Ukraine's Economy Faces Challenges from Foreign Imports and Online Shopping**
The Ukrainian economy is facing significant challenges due to the increasing imports of goods from foreign websites. According to statistics, in 2024, the country's imports exceeded its exports by 1.69 times. The situation may worsen in 2025, as the European Commission may not extend the special trade regime with Ukraine, and the US has introduced a 25% tariff on imports of steel and aluminum. Ukrainian manufacturers are struggling to compete with imported goods on the domestic market, as the country primarily exports raw materials. The rise of foreign brands in Ukraine, such as Zara and Sinsay, is also a concern. Online shopping is becoming increasingly popular in Ukraine, with 20-25% annual growth in e-commerce. However, this trend is also contributing to the problem, as many Ukrainians are buying goods from foreign websites, often through gray import schemes. The Ukrainian parliament is considering a law to tax postal deliveries from abroad, which could help protect domestic businesses. Currently, deliveries under 150 euros are exempt from tax, giving foreign marketplaces a significant advantage over Ukrainian manufacturers and official importers.

**Ukraine's Beef Exports Increase, but Demand Exceeds Supply**
According to Georgiy Kukhaleishvili, an analyst from the Association of Milk Producers, the demand for beef on the market exceeds supply at the beginning of 2025, which may lead to an increase in prices. In January 2025, Ukraine exported 1,420 tons of live cattle, which is 65% less than in December 2024, but 150% more than in January 2024. The country also exported 21 tons of fresh or chilled beef, a 20-ton increase from December and January 2024. The natural volumes of beef exports grew by 20 tons compared to December and January 2024. Georgiy Kukhaleishvili notes that there is some activity on the external markets. Hanne Clarke, a senior analyst at AHDB, believes that at the beginning of 2025, demand for beef will exceed supply, which may lead to an increase in prices. Demand for red meat is active in Japan and South Korea. The reduction of cattle herd in the US has led to an increase in beef imports from Australia. Meanwhile, the protectionist policy of the Trump administration may affect the change in the geography of beef exports from Mexico and Canada, which were previously the main export markets for the US. According to Rabobank, there is likely to be a reduction in beef production in the US, Brazil, Europe, China, New Zealand in 2025. In January 2025, Ukraine increased imports of live cattle by 39% to 58 tons, and chilled beef by 85% to 6 tons compared to the previous year. The volumes of frozen beef imports were 252,000 tons, matching last year's figures.

**Zelenskyy: Ukraine faces significant trade deficit, trend must be reversed**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the country faces a significant trade deficit, with imports exceeding exports. According to Zelenskyy, 'A significant problem is the imbalance between imports and exports. Imports - and this is not about weapons - far exceed our exports. This is a trend that must be reversed.' To address this issue, Zelenskyy emphasized the need to create more opportunities for Ukrainian production and support all forms of economic activity within the country. He also highlighted the importance of working with partners to increase resources and ensure the security of economic activities, including demining agricultural land and bolstering air defence. In 2024, Ukraine imported agricultural products worth US$7.82 billion, a 9% increase from the previous year.
