**NATO's 5% Defense Spending Target: A 'Hard' Requirement or a 'Soft' Goal?**
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has called for member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP by 2032. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte recently announced this latest development after a cabinet meeting. According to Reuters, Stoltenberg has written to all NATO member countries, suggesting that they meet the 5% target within 7 years, as proposed by US President Donald Trump. The 5% target is divided into two parts: 3.5% for 'hard defense spending' and 1.5% for 'defense-related spending', including cybersecurity and infrastructure improvements. As the host of the upcoming NATO summit in June, Rutte confirmed this news and stated that the Netherlands and other NATO member countries are discussing this issue. Trump has been pushing for a significant increase in defense spending since his first presidential term, arguing that the US is shouldering too much of the burden for European security. Although the 5% target is ambitious, even for the US, Trump is still demanding that NATO formally adopt this standard at the upcoming summit in The Hague and has threatened to withdraw protection from countries that do not meet this standard, in his opinion.

**NATO Secretary-General Proposes Increased Defense Spending by 2032**
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has proposed increasing defense spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with an additional 1.5% allocated to infrastructure and other security-related expenses. This proposal is in response to US President Trump's call for a 5% increase in defense spending. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte confirmed that Stoltenberg sent a letter to all member countries outlining the proposal, which aims to achieve a new target value by 2032. NATO's current defense spending target is 2% of GDP, and the organization is aiming to reach a new agreement on this at its upcoming summit in The Hague on June 24-25. Rutte stated that the Dutch government will continue to discuss its response to the proposal and that other NATO member countries are also considering the proposal, with the need for parliamentary consultations in each country.

**Turkish city set for critical NATO meeting over defense spending**
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan will host a NATO meeting in Antalya on May 14-15, where defense spending will be a key topic. Fidan will emphasize the importance of unity among NATO members and the need for non-EU member allies like Turkey to be included in EU defense efforts. He will also highlight Turkey's commitment to investing in defense and its modern capabilities. NATO chief Mark Rutte wants member countries to agree to reach 5% of GDP on defense-related spending by 2032, but diplomats say discussions are at an early stage and there is no clear consensus. U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that NATO allies ramp up their military spending to five percent of GDP, but European countries have ramped up their defense spending since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Fidan said, 'European countries are clear on minimizing their dependence on the U.S. for the defense industry,' and emphasized the need for a '360-degree security' approach to establish peace and stability in NATO's surrounding regions and the Middle East.

**PM Schoof confirms NATO's plans for members to increase defense spending by 2032**
Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof confirmed that NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte wants to increase the standard for defense spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with an additional 1.5% for infrastructure and cybersecurity. Rutte stated, 'To be able to defend ourselves in five years’ time and to keep the deterrence and defense at the level we need, we must not only spend much more, but also build a defense industrial base across the Atlantic, across the whole Euro-Atlantic area, including the United States and Canada, and all the European countries in NATO. It’s crucial.' Schoof said that most of his ministers have already discussed the proposal and will continue to discuss it in the coming weeks to determine the Netherlands' commitment to the NATO summit. The countries of the alliance must agree on the new standard at the summit in the end of June. Rutte mentioned the threat of Russia as one of the reasons for the increased spending, stating, 'The Russians are producing in three months in ammunition, what the whole of NATO, which is 25 times bigger than Russia, in terms of the overall economy, is producing in a year. So that’s not sustainable. So this is both spending and more production.' U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that NATO member states spend 5% of their GDP on defense, but Rutte's proposal is seen as an attempt to appease Trump without caving in to his demands.

**NATO Foreign Ministers to Meet in Turkey: A Discussion on Ukraine and Military Spending**
The informal Foreign Ministers' meeting of NATO will take place in Antalya, Turkey on May 14-15. On May 14, the allied ministers will have dinner as guests of their Turkish counterpart, while on May 15, the actual session will be held. According to diplomatic sources, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is trying to make the informal meetings truly open, allowing for a frank exchange of opinions on various issues without reading prepared speeches. The ministers are expected to discuss Ukraine and the upcoming NATO summit in June. Rutte has proposed a plan to reach the 5% military spending target, as requested by Donald Trump, but at two levels: 3.5% for 'classic' defense and 1.5% for new challenges such as hybrid threats, resilience, and societal preparedness. 'The 3.5% represents the minimum to implement what we have already committed to in terms of capability objectives,' explains an allied diplomat. The negotiations are ongoing to define what can be included in the additional 1.5% and how the two indices will be related. It is also clear that the targets will not apply to the US, which will essentially do what they want and waive the request for 'back pay'.

**NATO Proposes New Plan to Meet 5% Defense Spending Target**
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has proposed a new plan to meet the 5% defense spending target set by US President Donald Trump. The plan involves dividing the 5% into two separate categories: 3.5% for traditional defense spending, such as tanks, aircraft, and missiles, and an additional 1.5% for new challenges like cyber warfare, hybrid threats, and societal resilience. Rutte presented the plan to the Atlantic Council and now the allies will have to study it. The first step will be taken at the informal foreign ministers' meeting in Antalya, Turkey, next week. However, the real discussion will take place at the defense ministers' meeting in June, where the 'agreement in principle' will be signed and then announced at the summit of leaders. But will this be enough to convince Donald Trump? US sources say they want to reach the 5% target but have no additional suggestions on how to achieve it. A diplomat notes that it's too early to say what the new 1.5% quota will include. The idea behind the proposal is to look to the future, as security now applies in many different ways compared to the past. For example, many capitals are already working on resilience of critical infrastructure, which is increasingly threatened by hybrid attacks. The Rutte proposal could provide some flexibility. 'Even the 3.5% will be a bitter pill to swallow for many allies,' notes another diplomat. Finally, there is the timeline for implementation, which will be a key point of negotiation, with some sources suggesting 'very wide gaps to bridge.' The reality is that Europe is facing a complex situation, with the potential threat of Russia and the US reducing its presence in the region.

**NATO's New Spending Targets: A 5% Goal, with a Twist**
The North Atlantic Council of NATO is officially examining the proposal of Secretary Mark Rutte on new spending targets for countries, to be agreed upon at the summit of leaders in The Hague, scheduled for June. The US does not give in on the 5% target, and Rutte has therefore presented an option that is structured on two levels: a 3.5% GDP expenditure for classical defense (tanks, planes, missiles, armies) and an additional 1.5% for new challenges, such as cyber, hybrid, and societal resilience. Rutte's proposal is seen as a compromise, aiming to find a middle ground between the US and other countries.

**Trump threatens to boycott NATO summit over European defense spending demands - Tajul Islam**
US President Trump has threatened to boycott the upcoming NATO summit due to demands for increased European defense spending. The pressure on NATO allies to spend more on defense is not new, but the current administration's demands represent a sharp intensification. Traditionally, NATO aims for member states to spend 2% of their GDP on defense, a goal set in 2014. However, by 2024, only 23 out of 32 member states have met this target, according to NATO's own estimates. The US remains the largest contributor to NATO, spending about 3.5% of its GDP on defense.

**Trump Threatens to Skip NATO Summit if European Members Don't Increase Defense Spending**
According to Der Spiegel, US President Donald Trump may skip the NATO summit in The Hague in June 2025 if European members of the alliance do not increase their defense spending. The American leader's warning is based on the reports of US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Wittaker, who has been emphasizing the need for European countries to increase their defense spending. As Der Spiegel notes, Wittaker's warnings are now being taken seriously by NATO members. The US has been pushing European countries to increase their defense spending from 2% to 5% of their GDP. If the financial issue is not resolved by June, Trump will not attend the summit in The Hague. Interestingly, only 23 out of 32 NATO members have reached the 2% GDP target in 2024, according to NATO's own statistics. The alliance acknowledges that significant increase in defense spending is necessary to ensure its own security.

**Trump's Pressure Bears Fruit: NATO Agrees to Increase Defense Spending**
US President Donald Trump may not attend the upcoming NATO summit unless other member countries take concrete action to share defense costs. According to European diplomatic sources, cited by German magazine Der Spiegel, Washington has issued a warning to this effect. Germany is under particular pressure to significantly increase its defense budget. Last week, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to discuss the issue. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has proposed a new plan, suggesting that member countries increase their defense spending to 3.5% of their GDP, with 1.5% going towards broader security-related projects to respond to Trump's call for 5% of GDP in defense spending. This proposal is seen as a compromise, helping Trump to declare victory at the June NATO summit in The Hague, while avoiding asking all European countries and Canada to directly commit to the 5% target, which many countries consider unachievable. Currently, NATO's official target is for member countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense, with 22 out of 32 member countries having already reached this standard. However, many leaders believe this level is insufficient to counter the threat posed by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The classification of projects that can be included in 'broader security-related expenditures' still needs to be agreed upon by all parties. Officials suggest that this category may include investments in upgrading infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, to support the movement of heavy military vehicles. When asked if Stoltenberg had formally proposed this suggestion, NATO spokesperson Allison Harte did not directly respond, saying that Stoltenberg has repeatedly emphasized the need to increase defense spending to achieve member countries' soon-to-be-agreed capability goals and promote a fairer burden-sharing. Harte added in an email that 'this may not only include increasing defense budgets according to NATO standards, but also cover investments in areas such as infrastructure, resilience, etc.' She further stated that the Secretary-General is closely consulting with countries to reach consensus for the Hague summit. As of 2025, no NATO member country has increased its defense spending to 5% of GDP. However, Estonia and Poland, which currently have defense ratios exceeding those of the US, have committed to achieving or surpassing this target next year, while Lithuania has made a similar commitment.

**Spain to Meet NATO Defense Spending Target by 2025**
Spain will meet the NATO defense spending target of 2% of its GDP by 2025, according to Prime Minister Sánchez. The additional funds will be allocated to military training, cyber security, and additional weapons. This move comes as many NATO member states are increasing their defense spending in response to Russia's aggression and the perceived need for greater European self-defense. Despite some countries, including Spain, initially taking a more relaxed approach to meeting the 2% target, the pressure to do so has grown, and the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague may be seen as a test of the alliance's commitment to this goal.

**NATO discusses civil defence spending target, Swedish PM says**
NATO members are discussing setting a spending target for civil defence and support for Ukraine, in addition to their core military budget goals. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson stated that a summit in June may agree on a defence spending target above 3% of GDP, along with a second target for other security and defence-related spending. Kristersson suggested that the defence spending target could be set at 3.5% with an additional 1.5% for civil defence, Ukraine support, and other non-military defence areas. Currently, 23 of the 32 NATO members meet or exceed the 2% target, but some European economies, such as Italy and Spain, spend only around 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. Kristersson emphasized Sweden's commitment to meeting NATO's spending targets, saying, 'I'm very determined to see that we in Sweden live up to the commitments that NATO decides upon.' A European diplomat noted that meeting the proposed 3.5% target would require additional elements, including enhancing resilience and military mobility.

**NATO's New Defense Spending Targets: A Challenge for Spain**
The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to mark a turning point in the European Union's defense spending. The Spanish government is on high alert, assuming that the alliance will confirm a new military investment target of 2.5% to 3% of GDP. Initially, the goal was set at 2.5%, but the arrival of Donald Trump in the US administration has led to a shift towards 3%. This new scenario would limit the ability of member countries to renegotiate conditions, unlike in the past. Spain, for example, has already extended its target from 2% to 2029. The next summit will not leave room for countries to opt out of the new objectives, and those who do not comply will face sanctions and tariffs from the US. According to NATO, current defense spending is 19,723 million euros, and reaching 2% would increase it to around 31,000 million euros. A 3% target would imply reaching 46,000 million euros, or 51,000 million euros by 2029. Trump's arrival has added to the instability of the Spanish legislature, with left-wing parties considering him a factor to be taken into account when evaluating the timing of the next election. NATO planners estimate that the new defense objectives require the formation of 35-50 additional brigades, increased investment in air defense and missile systems, and larger ammunition reserves. The UK has already committed to this goal, and Poland and the Baltic states are already meeting it.

**Rutte Urges Allies to Reach 2% Defense Spending Target Before Summer**
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has emphasized the importance of increasing military spending among European allies, which have increased their defense budgets by 20% in 2024. However, he has also stressed that all member states must reach the 2% target before the summer and increase their investment 'as soon as possible' to meet the new benchmark, which will be set above 3% of GDP. Rutte has expressed his hope that more allies will reach and exceed the 2% target in 2025, but acknowledged that there are still 'too great' shortcomings in European armies. He has also warned that the current 2% target is insufficient to deter and defend against the Russian threat to Euro-Atlantic security. 'It is my assumption at this moment. We will see exactly what that number should be later,' he said, referring to the ongoing discussion among allies to agree on a new spending commitment, expected to be finalized at the NATO summit in The Hague in late June. Rutte has also emphasized that the increase in national defense budgets must be accompanied by a strengthening of the military industrial base to ensure that armies have the necessary equipment for the future. 'We must ensure that we produce enough, and this is not a problem only for the European part of NATO, but also for the American part of NATO, because all of us, from California to Ankara, are not producing enough,' he warned.

**NATO to 'Significantly' Increase Defense Spending, Says Secretary-General Mark Rutte**
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced plans to 'significantly' increase defense spending, with a new target to be set later in 2025. The current target of 2% of GDP will be surpassed, according to Rutte. The final figure will be agreed upon at the NATO summit in The Hague in the summer. 'We need to increase defense spending and military production, but the specific level of costs will be determined later based on the tasks set. The assessment of gaps in each country's current level and the required level is ongoing. Based on this assessment, we will make a decision on new defense funding commitments, but it will be significantly higher than 2% of GDP,' Rutte said before the informal EU summit in Brussels. Currently, only 23 out of 32 NATO member countries have met the 2% target for defense spending in 2024, according to NATO data. European NATO members began discussing increasing the target to 3% of GDP before Donald Trump's presidency, with the Republican later suggesting 5% of GDP, which NATO members deemed unachievable in the short term.

**NATO Allies to Increase Defense Spending Above 2% of GDP, Says European Council President**
The President of the European Council, Antonio Costa, stated that the 23 European Union countries that are also members of NATO are likely to agree to increase the target defense spending above the current 2% of GDP at the upcoming NATO summit in June. According to Reuters, Costa plans to hold an informal meeting with EU leaders on February 3 to discuss investments in defense and security. The NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak, will also attend the meeting. Costa noted that the combined defense spending of the 23 EU countries in NATO already meets the target of 2% of GDP, thanks to the increase in defense spending after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 'There is a very well-founded consensus among member states to continue this path. I would expect that at the next NATO summit in June, a target will be set that exceeds 2%. Whether it will be 5% or 3%, I don't know, it's a decision that will be made by the member states within NATO,' he added. Costa, a former Prime Minister of Portugal, identified Russia as the main threat to NATO and emphasized the need for allies to prioritize the improvement of air defense and electronic warfare systems. He also explained that defense technology and industry spending will enhance the competitiveness of the EU economy. In the future, there will be a need to discuss 'joint funding' for collective defense. US President Donald Trump has been pressuring NATO allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a target that none of the 32 NATO member countries, including the US, have yet achieved. Analysts and officials told Reuters that spending 5% of GDP on defense is politically and economically impossible for almost all NATO members, as it would require billions of dollars in additional funding. However, it is expected that at the upcoming NATO summit, allies will likely agree to go beyond the current 2% of GDP on defense.
