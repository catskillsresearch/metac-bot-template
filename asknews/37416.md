**Yemen's Border Crossings: A Key to Peace and Economic Recovery**
The closure of border crossings between Yemen and Saudi Arabia has severely affected the lives of Yemenis, particularly after the destruction of Sana'a airport. The reopening of these crossings is seen as a crucial step in building trust between Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government, which could lead to peace negotiations. However, the Saudi response to Yemeni initiatives has been weak, complicating political solutions. The closure of the crossings has had a significant impact on Yemen's trade and economy, increasing transportation costs and damaging products. According to economist Rashid Al-Haddad, 'opening these crossings requires a political decision from Saudi Arabia and the agreement of the internationally recognized government and the Houthis to implement a temporary plan to reopen and manage them.' The Yemeni people are suffering greatly due to the closure of these crossings, and some are calling for the reopening of the 'Wadi Al-Dhahab' crossing in Hadhramaut and the 'Shahn' crossing in Mahra. The economist Marad Mansour believes that 'the reopening of these crossings is a matter of a political decision from Saudi Arabia, and the agreement of the internationally recognized government and the Houthis to implement a temporary plan to reopen and manage them.'

**UNRWA Calls for Border Crossings to be Opened to Allow Aid to Reach Gaza**
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has called on the Israeli entity to open border crossings to allow vital aid to reach the population of Gaza, which has been under a suffocating humanitarian blockade for nearly three months. 'The border crossings must be fully opened to allow the delivery of vital aid to Gaza,' wrote Juliette Touma, UNRWA spokesperson, on social media. She emphasized, 'We have over 3,000 trucks not only carrying food but also medicine waiting for clearance.' Touma added, 'These trucks carry medicines that are soon to expire.' The statement comes as Gaza continues to suffer from a catastrophic humanitarian crisis since Israel closed the crossing points on March 2, preventing any aid from entering the territory. The death toll from the Israeli genocide against Gaza has risen to 54,056 martyrs and 123,129 injured since October 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities.

**Venezuela Reopens Border with Colombia After Temporary Closure**
The Venezuelan authorities reopened the border crossings between the state of Táchira and the department of Norte de Santander in Colombia on Tuesday, May 27, after a four-day temporary closure due to the regional and parliamentary elections held in Venezuela on Sunday. According to reports by journalist Jonathan Maldonado of La Nación, the barriers at the San Antonio customs entrance were removed before 6:00 am. The movement began immediately, as dozens of pedestrians, motorcyclists, and vehicles waited to cross into Colombia. Many citizens travel daily to Cúcuta or La Parada, some for work, others for study, and others for medical procedures or migration. The previous closure left many people unable to cross the Simón Bolívar bridge. The border closure, which started at midnight on Friday and lasted until Tuesday morning, caught many citizens by surprise, who were waiting to cross with their luggage, unaware that the border was closed. The government applied the measure for security reasons and informed that the goal was to preserve the inviolability of the borders and prevent activities that could represent threats during the electoral process. It is worth noting that during the temporary closure, a humanitarian channel was opened, which attended to people with health emergencies or special situations. More than 1,000 citizens were assisted during those 96 hours. The reopening was welcomed with relief by merchants, students, workers, and migrants. The binational flow, which is part of the daily routine at the border, regained its usual dynamism. It is expected that the border crossings will continue to operate unless new restrictions are announced.

**Court orders Oyo mosque's reopening three years after**
The Ado-Awaye Central Mosque in Oyo State, Nigeria, will resume Jum'ah prayers on Friday, May 30, 2025, after a three-year hiatus due to leadership disputes and security concerns. A court ruling, delivered by Justice E. O. Ajayi on May 20, 2025, affirmed the fundamental right to freedom of worship and declared the applicant entitled to practise Islam at the mosque. According to the mosque's leadership, the disruption began after the death of the Chief Imam, Shaykh Solahudeen Oniyo, on August 13, 2021, which led to a succession crisis and security threats. The mosque's legal counsel, Abdul-Waheed Olowonjaye, stated in a letter to the Chairman of Iseyin Local Government, 'We have the firm instruction of our clients to notify Your Excellency that Jum'ah (Friday) prayers, regular daily prayers, and all other services shall resume from tomorrow, Friday, May 30, 2025.' The mosque's leadership urged members to remain law-abiding and move past the turbulence, saying, 'We implore all the disciples of the Chief Imam and the respected leaders and members of Ado-Awaye Central Mosque not to allow the ugly past to preoccupy them.'

**Tinubu to grace Gateway Games' closing ceremony as Delta retains title**
President Bola Tinubu is expected to declare the 22nd National Sports Festival closed in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, today.

**Nigeria: Reps Seek End to Blockade of Kwara/Benin Border**
The Nigerian House of Representatives has urged the Federal Government to engage the Republic of Benin over the blockade of the Tabera border in Kwara state. The blockade, which was initiated by Beninese security personnel on May 6, 2025, has disrupted the movement of people, goods, and services between Nigeria and Benin. According to Hon Mohammed Bio, the blockade has caused significant strain on bilateral relations and ECOWAS trade cooperation. Bio said, 'This presidential directive of blockade has disrupted the movement of people, seasonal cashew and soya beans trade that are critical to the rural livelihood of people in the border communities of the two countries.' The House also called for the immediate and unconditional release of 18 persons abducted by sea pirates along the Billy and Bonny waterways in Rivers State.

**BREAKING: Benin Republic Extends Border Clampdown To Lagos Over Suspected Arms Smuggling, Terror Attacks**
The Republic of Benin has extended its border security operations to the Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State, Nigeria, further escalating tensions between the two West African neighbours. According to a source, 'Bénin Republic continues its operations on borders; today was Sèmè and Owode border in Lagos State.' The move comes after the Beninese government shut down a key border route between Taberu village in Baruten Local Government Area of Kwara State and the neighbouring Tanu village in Benin Republic, reportedly due to intelligence linking the area to illegal arms smuggling and the emergence of a militant group known as 'Mahmuda.' Security experts suggest that Benin's drastic measures may be aimed at curbing the suspected operations of the Mahmuda group, which is believed to be behind a recent surge in cross-border violence and the illegal arms trade in the region. The Nigerian Customs Service has been contacted for comments, but a spokesperson said they would need to make further findings before making a statement.

**Exclusive: Benin Rep. closes land borders with Nigerian communities over soya, others' exportation**
The Benin Republic has closed its land borders with Nigeria to prevent the exportation of locally-produced agricultural commodities such as soya beans, cashew nuts, maize, and guinea corn. According to a community source, the move is aimed at stopping the exportation of these goods from the country. Officials of the Benin Republic Customs have barricaded bush paths and unofficial roads around Tabira, Tandu to Boyi, routes commonly used by farmers and traders to move produce into Nigeria. Abdullahi Maiwada, assistant comptroller and national public relations officer at the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), stated that this is not the first time such an action has been taken by the neighbouring country, citing a similar incident in Bukoro a few months ago. The move comes in the wake of several attacks by a newly formed terror group known as Mahmuda, which has been terrorizing communities near the borders of two West African countries. Adamu Yahuza, a resident of Kemanji, described the group as deadly and highly organised, claiming that they have been terrorizing the community since 2020, kidnapping and killing residents.

**BREAKING: Benin Republic Shuts Border With Kwara Communities Over Attacks By New Terror Group Mahmuda, Arms Smuggling - Sources**
The Government of the Republic of Benin has closed its borders with some communities in Nigeria's Kwara State due to alleged arms smuggling and the emergence of a new terror group known as 'Mahmuda.' According to sources, the President of Benin Republic ordered the closure of the border route between Taberu, a village in Baruten Local Government Area of Kwara State, and Tanu, a neighbouring village in Benin Republic. The move is believed to be linked to growing fears about the activities of the Mahmuda group, which is suspected to be behind a recent rise in cross-border attacks and illegal arms trade in the region. A local security personnel confirmed the development, stating, 'The President of Benin Republic yesterday on the 7th of May 2025, closed the borders between certain villages, Taberu in Nigeria's Baruten Local Government Area (in Kwara State) and Tanlu in Benin Republic, restricting the movement of goods and services.' The closure is also linked to intelligence on frequent illegal importation of arms and ammunition from Benin into Nigeria, especially via the air route from Parakou, the capital of Borgou Department in Benin. 'Most at times, some people normally bring in arms and ammunition from Parakou. Parakou is the capital of Borgu state in Benin Republic. That is our state in Benin. We have a whole state. It is a business era,' the narrator said in a viral video. The Nigerian Customs Service Public Relations Officer, Abdullahi Maiwada, said he would make his findings and get back to the matter. 'I will make my findings and get across. I don't think it is an issue I will jump into conclusion without adequate findings. Thank you and best regards,' he said.

**Former Beninese Presidents to Visit Niger for Border Talks**
Former Beninese presidents Nicéphore Soglo and Boni Yayi are expected to visit Niger soon to discuss the possible reopening of the border between the two countries. According to Soglo, the invitation was made by Niger's transitional president, General Abdourahamane Tiani. The border has been closed since August 2023, following a military coup that overthrew Mohamed Bazoum on July 26, 2023. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) imposed severe economic and diplomatic sanctions on Niger, including the closure of land and air borders. However, Benin has since revised its position. Despite the efforts of Beninese authorities, the Nigerien authorities have maintained the closure of the border under the pretext of security concerns.

**Benin-Niger: Alternative Routes for Trade Amid Border Closure**
The economic situation in Malanville, a Beninese town bordering Niger, has improved slightly since the Beninese authorities reopened their land border with Niger, but the situation is still complicated. The Nigerien authorities have not reopened their border, so traders are using alternative routes, such as crossing the Niger River, to transport goods. Grossist Souley Issifou says, 'We loaded 7,000 sacks this week. When the market is at its peak, we unload over 15,000 sacks per week.' However, the Nigerien authorities have banned the export of staple foods, including peanuts, except to other Sahel Alliance countries. Issifou admits, 'It passes, but it's a risk. The products increase in price due to transportation costs and purchase prices. We currently sell Nigerien peanuts for 44,000 CFA francs.' Some trade between Benin and Niger is done through Nigeria, while others use pirogues to cross the Niger River. Salifou, a truck driver, says, 'We unload at the water's edge, but we don't find a place to unload the same day. We wait 5-6 days to unload. It's by order of arrival. This morning, I'm in 79th position. How will we do it? We don't have the money to pay for a hotel. We sleep under the trucks with the mosquitoes. We're truck drivers and guards!' The reopening of the Niger River crossing has eased the economic situation in Malanville, but not everyone is convinced. Some traders continue to hope for the reopening of the border with Niger.

**Benin-Niger River Crossing Reopens, but Diplomatic Tensions Persist**
After six months of suspension, the crossing of the river between Benin and Niger has been reopened, facilitating the movement of people and goods. This decision is a significant step forward for local traders and populations, particularly those in the international market, who are slowly regaining their economic activity. However, the situation remains far from normal, as the land border between the two countries remains closed due to ongoing diplomatic tensions following the coup in Niamey on July 26, 2023. Despite this limited reopening, relations between Cotonou and Niamey remain marked by deep divergences. The recent recall of Benin's ambassador to Niger, Gildas Agonkan, after his statements in early February, illustrates the persistence of tensions between the two states. While the lifting of restrictions on the river is seen as a gesture of appeasement, observers remain cautious, and it is difficult to predict when the land border might reopen. In the meantime, traders and transporters must still adapt to the constraints imposed by the prolonged closure, which is weighing on economic exchanges between the two countries.

**Benin's Border with Niger Remains Closed, Despite Reopening of River Crossing**
Since the coup d'état in Niger, the Benin has reopened its border with Niger, but the Niger has kept it closed. The bridge connecting the Beninese city of Malanville to the Nigerien riverbank is still blocked. However, the Beninese authorities have reauthorized the crossing of the Niger River, which was forbidden for 6 months. This small relief is not enough for the merchants of Malanville, who are still waiting for the border to reopen. An student, who had to take a bus to Gaya and then a pirogue to Malanville, said, 'It was a very complicated journey. I have a fear of pirogues near the river. There are often crowds that tend to tip over the pirogue, but what can you do? We have to make do with it for now.' The market, the economic hub of the area, is still well-stocked despite the difficulties.
