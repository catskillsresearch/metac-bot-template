**It's Kamala Harris's nomination to lose in 2028 -- and she's already losing it**
Despite having a wealth of advantages, Kamala Harris's team seems uncertain about her next move. Her recent reappearance in the public sphere has been unremarkable, rehashing Democratic tropes about Donald Trump and offering policy bromides. Harris's polling numbers and identity qualifications should make her a front-runner for the 2028 Democratic nomination, but she lacks strategic vision and confidence. Her team's tentative rollout has shown that she is petrified of angering or annoying anyone in her fractious party. Harris needs to establish herself independently, take risks, and show she has the political chops to run for president on her own. As Keith Naughton writes, 'The 2028 nomination is not going to be handed to her. She is going to have to work for it and show she has the political chops to run for president on her own.'

**21 Democrats who may try to succeed Trump in the 2028 presidential election**
The 2028 presidential election is already generating buzz, with several Democrats considering a run. Former Vice President Kamala Harris is weighing a 2026 gubernatorial campaign in California and a potential 2028 presidential bid. Other potential contenders include Pete Buttigieg, who has been active in the party and has made a high-profile stop in Iowa; Andy Beshear, the 47-year-old governor of Kentucky, who has expressed interest in running if he can unite the country; and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has co-headlined rallies with Sen. Bernie Sanders and has been floated as a potential primary challenger to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Other notable Democrats mentioned as potential contenders include Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and Gina Raimondo, the former governor of Rhode Island. The field is wide open, and it won't be long before we see clear maneuvering from a litany of candidates.

**Trump rules out 2028 run as Republican contenders quietly position for next race**
President Donald Trump has ruled out running for a third term in 2028, stating 'I'm not looking at that' and 'I'll be a two-term president.' Despite this, Trump's 2028 flirtations have kept the spotlight on him, and potential Republican contenders are quietly positioning themselves for the next election. Vice President JD Vance appears to be the heir apparent to the 'America First' movement, but has not taken steps towards a 2028 presidential run. Other potential contenders include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Governor Ron DeSantis, Governor Glenn Youngkin, Governor Brian Kemp, Senator Ted Cruz, and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and former Vice President Mike Pence are also being considered as possible 2028 contenders.

**Can the Democrats be saved? Potential candidates for the 2028 election are emerging**
The Democratic Party is struggling to find a strong candidate for the 2028 presidential election. The party has a significant image problem, with only 27% of voters in key swing states believing that the Democrats care about their concerns. The party is plagued by internal conflicts and a lack of consistency, with some members advocating for a return to the moderate policies of the Clinton era and others pushing for a more populist, 'America first' approach. Despite this, several potential candidates are emerging, including Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, who has been praised for her pragmatic and bipartisan approach; Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary, who has been positioning himself as a centrist and has been critical of the party's tendency to lecture voters; Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, who has been endorsed by former President Barack Obama and has a strong track record of winning in swing states; Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, who has been trying to distance himself from the party's image problem and has been critical of some of its more liberal policies; J.B. Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, who has been critical of President Trump and has been positioning himself as a more moderate Democrat; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young and outspoken congresswoman from New York, who has been seen as a potential leader of the party's left wing; and Kamala Harris, the former vice president, who has been sending signals that she may run again in 2028. However, it is unclear whether any of these candidates will be able to overcome the party's image problem and win the nomination.

**Omar Fernández Receives Support for Fuerza Pueblo Candidacy**
Rafael Pérez, a deputy from the Pedernales province, stated that his support for the upcoming 2028 elections is leaning towards Omar Fernández, the current senator from Fuerza del Pueblo for the Distrito Nacional. Pérez emphasized that this support is not limited to opposition deputies, but also includes some official party members. 'Casi todos los diputados de la Fuerza del Pueblo apoyamos a Omar Fernández... son más de los 29 que tenemos, porque incluso hay algunos del PRM que quieren apoyarlo si termina siendo el candidato', Pérez said. Pérez also clarified that he has always been 'a rajatabla' with Dr. Leonel Fernández, but that democracy prevails in decisions of this nature. 'Yo siempre he sido a rajatabla con Leonel, pero es la demócracia, es la decisión que tenemos cada uno al elegir y decidir a quien apoyar en un momento dado', Pérez expressed. Pérez concluded that almost all deputies from the party agree that Omar Fernández, a 33-year-old politician and former deputy, is the best candidate to run for president in 2028. 'Estamos frente al político del momento, a un liderazgo encarnado y motivado en las fuerzas vivas de la República Dominicana', Pérez said.

**Rahm Emanuel or Running for 2028 US Presidential Election**
Rahm Emanuel, a senior Democratic Party politician, has criticized the Democratic Party in an article published in the Wall Street Journal, calling the party's brand 'toxic', 'weak', and 'woke'. Emanuel, 65, has been speculated to run for president in 2028. In the article, he described, 'I'm tired of sitting in the backseat, watching people drive towards the cliff at 90 miles per hour... Whoever wants to get the 'keys to the country' must have a plan to fight for America, not just against Trump.' Emanuel has a long history of public service, including serving as a White House chief of staff, congressman, and mayor of Chicago. He has recently been making frequent appearances in the media, expressing concerns about the Democratic Party's direction after their losses in the November elections. This has sparked speculation about his political future. Emanuel has signed contracts with CNN and The Washington Post to write political commentary and has been in talks with moderate Democrats in Maryland. He plans to host a fish fry in Iowa this fall. Emanuel's next steps are described as 'coy' but he seems to be cautiously moving towards a presidential campaign. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said, 'Voters will be lucky to see a real debate - one that we didn't have in 2024.' In the 2024 election, the Democratic Party initially supported incumbent President Biden's re-election, but after Biden dropped out, they nominated Vice President Kamala Harris to run against Trump. Harris ultimately lost to Trump with 226 electoral votes to Trump's 312. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told The Free Press that she believes Emanuel will run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2028. Other potential candidates include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

**2028 podcast primary is underway as Democrats try to reshape their image**
Potential 2028 presidential contenders, including Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as well as former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, are using podcasts to connect with younger voters and showcase their personalities. Newsom has welcomed conservatives onto his podcast, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, and has agreed with them on issues such as trans participation in women's sports. Beshear has hosted his teenagers to teach him how to use youth slang, while Whitmer has appeared on 'Pod Save America' and discussed her recent hug with President Trump. Buttigieg has appeared on Andrew Schulz's 'Flagrant' podcast and discussed his personal life, including his experiences serving in the military and raising his biracial children. 'The way that politicians communicate and need to be seen by their audience is changing,' said Liz Minnella, a liberal strategist. 'I hate to give him credit, but he found a way to connect with people, talk to them like human beings in non-political speak.'

**Polling guru reveals likeliest Democrat to take on MAGA in 2028**
Polling guru Nate Silver and journalist Galen Druke have both predicted that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be the Democratic nominee for the 2028 presidential election. Silver cited AOC's progressive lane, youth, and media savvy as reasons for his pick, while Druke pointed to her high net favorability rating among Democrats, with 62% of Democrats having a positive view of her. Druke noted that AOC has broad appeal across the Democratic Party and has learned to stick to economic messages rather than social issues that may be unpopular. Silver expressed uncertainty about whether AOC will even run for the presidency, but Druke is 'pretty sure' she will. Their second-place pick was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, while Silver's third-place pick was Sen. Cory Booker and Druke's was 2024 nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

**Nate Silver Predicts Who Will Be The 2028 Democratic Presidential Nominee**
Nate Silver and Galen Druke, former FiveThirtyEight podcast host, predict that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be the 2028 Democratic Presidential Nominee. They point to her high net favorability rating, as shown in a recent Yale poll, and her ability to garner attention through her criticism of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump's agendas. Silver notes that Ocasio-Cortez's polling numbers, progressive stance, age, and understanding of media are all advantages over her potential opponents. However, he expresses doubts about whether she will actually run for the nomination. Druke agrees that Ocasio-Cortez would be their first pick and highlights her experience and ability to effectively criticize Trump's policies, particularly his Cabinet's high number of billionaires.

**Kamala Harris emerges as clear frontrunner for 2028 Democratic Party nomination: New poll | Today News**
A new Morning Consult poll has revealed that former US Vice President Kamala Harris is the clear frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, with a commanding lead over other potential contenders. Harris has not yet announced her intentions for another presidential run, but the poll shows her with 13% support, far ahead of other candidates such as California Governor Gavin Newsom, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who trailed behind with 5% support. The poll also found that 13% of Democratic voters remain undecided, and no formal announcements have been made from any candidates, leaving the 2028 race wide open. As one observer noted, 'The race is far from decided,' and Harris will need to continue to build her support to secure the nomination.

**In the 2028 Dem Sweepstakes, This Candidate Has a HUGE Lead**
A new poll suggests that former Vice President Kamala Harris is the front-runner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, leading the field by a 26-point margin. Harris' lead is attributed to the party's lack of viable candidates, with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz tied at 5% each. Other candidates, including Mark Cuban, Josh Shapiro, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar, trail behind with 4% or less. The poll results have been met with caution, as the political landscape can change significantly over the next three years. However, the fact that Harris remains the party's favorite suggests that no lessons have been learned from the 2024 election, and the Democrats are determined to continue pushing policies that Americans are rejecting.

**2028 US Presidential Election: Top Democratic Candidates Emerge**
Despite the 2028 presidential election being relatively far away, the competition within the Democratic Party is already heating up. Several prominent leaders are seeking to strengthen their national presence and build strong support networks in preparation for the biggest race in the United States. While no official candidate has announced their candidacy yet, the actions of some political figures clearly indicate their future ambitions. Amidst the ongoing uncertainty within the party about how to deal with President Donald Trump's policies after his 2024 win, the competition between Democrats in 2028 appears more open than ever. A report by Axios highlighted the top names vying for the potential presidential race, and their political moves that may pave the way to the White House. Pete Buttigieg has shown his national ambitions clearly by running for president in 2020 while serving as the mayor of South Bend in Indiana. He served as the Transportation Secretary in President Biden's administration, where he faced numerous crises. He was considered a strong candidate for the Michigan governor or Senate race next year, but he announced his withdrawal from both races last week. Stacey Abrams has long been considered a potential Democratic presidential candidate, as she has worked to build a national network of supporters and donors over the years and has received more media attention. After Trump's 2024 win, Abrams called for a special legislative session in California to raise funds to challenge the Republican president's policies legally. Abrams has recently tried to present himself as a moderate politician to expand his base of support, and he sparked controversy when he said in a conversation with right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk that allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' and women's sports is 'extremely unfair.' Emanuel, who served as the US Ambassador to Japan during the previous Biden administration, has raised questions about his potential candidacy. Emanuel was Obama's White House Chief of Staff and has appeared in several public events warning of the need for Democrats to reassess their political strategies before the 2026 midterm elections. Emanuel joined CNN as a commentator last month and writes an article in The Washington Post. Walz announced last month that he would not run for the new Senate seat in Minnesota in 2026, leaving the door open for a potential presidential candidacy. Walz, who served as the Governor of Minnesota for two terms and was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in the 2024 presidential election, began a national tour of town halls in Republican-leaning districts. Pritzker is a wealthy businessman who has established himself as one of the symbols of 'Democratic resistance' in Illinois. He has worked to strengthen his national image in recent years and was included in unofficial lists as a potential alternative to President Biden after his poor performance in the first presidential debate last year. Whitmer is considered one of the rising stars in the Democratic Party and has presented herself as a pragmatic and moderate leader since Trump's win. She met with Trump this week to discuss issues related to jobs, tariffs, and defense investments. In recent weeks, she has praised the deployment of National Guard troops to the border to combat illegal immigration and expressed openness to imposing new tariffs to protect industry. However, she refused to join a multi-state lawsuit against Trump's attempt to ban birthright citizenship. Polis, who served as Governor of Colorado for two terms, was one of the names floated as a potential alternative to Biden in the 2024 election. Like Yoder, he has taken a centrist approach since Trump took office, saying in his address to the state that he hopes to work with Trump and Congress 'to secure the border, stop human trafficking, and prevent the flow of illegal weapons and drugs.' He supported Trump's controversial nomination of Robert Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services. The list of potential candidates also includes Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. Axios believes that Democratic leaders are divided on how to face Trump, given the party's identity crisis after the 2024 elections. This time, there is no consensus on the strategy, as Democratic leaders are taking different paths.

**More on the 2028 Democratic Presidential Nomination….**
The NY Times has joined the early media focus on potential Democratic presidential nominees for the 2028 election. Many are looking at a talented crop of governors, including Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, who have been building relationships with the party's donor class. Additionally, Gavin Newsom, the term-limited governor of California, is making his first serious moves towards a potential presidential run. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is being mentioned as a possible House Speaker and presidential nominee, but some question whether she is too young for the presidency.
