**Forte baisse de taux en vue pour le Livret A**
The Livret A savings product has seen a surge in deposits, with 1.22 billion euros deposited in May, according to the Caisse des dépôts (CDC). This is a record for the year and a significant increase from the previous month. The Livrets de développement durable et solidaire (LDDS) also saw a significant increase, with 660 million euros deposited, bringing the total 'net collection' of these two products to 1.88 billion euros. This could be a sign of the product's revival after a slow start to the year, or it could be a last-minute rush to take advantage of the current 2.4% interest rate before it is lowered. Experts expect the new interest rate to be between 1.5% and 1.7%, as the inflation rate and the interbank interest rate set by the European Central Bank are both decreasing. Philippe Crevel, director of the Cercle de l'Epargne, estimates that the minister of the Economy will likely follow the formula and not deviate from it, as it is in line with the government's goal of lowering credit rates and stimulating consumption. The new interest rate will be calculated by the Banque de France in mid-July and will be applied from August 1st to January 2026.

**Lagarde: Europe Faces Unprecedented Economic and Geopolitical Uncertainty**
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde stated that the eurozone is facing an extraordinary year of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, with rising global tensions and increasing conflicts. She emphasized the need for Europe to reaffirm its role as a cornerstone of international political and economic stability. Lagarde noted that the global financial system is undergoing an unprecedented transformation driven by the rapid rise of digital assets and stablecoins. She identified this as one of the major challenges facing central banks today. In terms of the eurozone's economic performance, Lagarde forecasted a 0.9% growth rate in 2025, increasing to 1.1% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. She pointed out that the labor market remains strong, with an unemployment rate of 6.2% in April, the lowest level since the introduction of the euro. However, she warned that trade tensions and a strong euro could weaken exports and slow down investment decisions in the short term. Lagarde also highlighted factors such as rising real income, eased financing conditions, and the stability of private sector budgets as key drivers of medium-term growth. Regarding inflation rates, she stated that the inflation rate was 1.9% in May, down from 2.2% in April, reflecting a slowdown in service prices. She also noted that most core inflation indicators point to a stabilization near the medium-term target of 2%. Lagarde forecasted an average inflation rate of 2% in 2025, decreasing to 1.6% in 2026, before returning to 2% in 2027. She warned of risks arising from supply chain fragmentation and another from a decline in demand for European exports. Lagarde announced that the bank had decided to cut the main interest rate by 25 basis points this month. She emphasized that monetary policy will be built on a regular review of economic data, without prior commitment to a specific interest rate path. She also called for a swift adoption of the 'Competitiveness Compass' proposals, completion of the Savings and Investment Union, and acceleration of the launch of a regulatory framework to enable the euro digital project. In conclusion, Lagarde stated that 'moments of change can also be moments of opportunity'.

**Lagarde: 'We are in a good position to navigate uncertain circumstances'**
Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (BCE), stated, 'We are in a good position to navigate uncertain circumstances' with current interest rates. She emphasized that the BCE's decisions on interest rates will be based on inflation prospects, underlying inflation dynamics, and the transmission of monetary policy. Lagarde also noted that the risks for growth prospects remain tilted to the downside, citing potential new escalations in global trade tensions, market confidence, and geopolitical tensions. However, she also mentioned that a rapid resolution of trade and geopolitical tensions or increased defense and infrastructure spending could boost activity more than expected. The BCE president highlighted that the global economic outlook is facing exceptionally high economic and political uncertainty, but also sees opportunities in times of change. Lagarde emphasized the need for specific fiscal and structural policies, as well as strategic investments to make the eurozone economy more productive, competitive, and resilient. According to the BCE's projections, inflation is expected to remain below 2% in 2026, driven by a stronger euro and lower energy commodity prices, before returning to the target in 2027. The inflation forecast for the eurozone is 'more uncertain than usual', with risks both upwards and downwards, including potential supply chain fragmentation and reduced demand for eurozone exports.

**CHP's Ağbaba: Asgari Ücretin 4 Bin Lira Kaybı Var**
CHP's Ağbaba stated, 'According to TÜİK's data, the consumer inflation rates for 2025 are 5.03% in January, 2.27% in February, 2.46% in March, 3.00% in April, and 1.53% in May. Based on the Central Bank's market expectations, the 6-month inflation rate is expected to be 17.81%. Even with TÜİK's manipulated data, the minimum wage earner has already lost 4,000 lira in value.' Ağbaba added, 'In a time of chronic and deepening economic crisis, the annual increase in the minimum wage has led to the systematic poverty of the working class. The loss of purchasing power is evident in all metrics. In a country with the world's 7th highest inflation rate, evaluating the minimum wage only once a year is a death sentence for millions of workers. While Turkey has the highest inflation rate in Europe and the highest food inflation rate, the government is trying to create an illusion that the cause of inflation is the increase in wages. However, when we look at other countries, their minimum wages are much higher than ours, but their inflation rates are much lower. In fact, almost all countries in the world have annual inflation rates lower than our monthly inflation rate. A worker in Turkey can only buy 22 kilograms of meat with the minimum wage, while a worker in France can buy at least 147 kilograms, in Germany at least 82.5 kilograms, and in Belgium at least 129 kilograms. The difference in our purchasing power is even more striking when it comes to oil. A worker in France can buy 589 liters, in Germany 513 liters, and in the Netherlands 1,218 liters more oil than a worker in Turkey, who can only buy 234 liters. This situation shows how high food inflation in Turkey restricts citizens' access to basic food items like oil. In Germany, a worker with a minimum wage of 2,054 euros can buy 8,500 eggs, 822 kilograms of rice, and 1,834 kilograms of potatoes, while in Turkey, a worker with the same minimum wage can only buy 2,843 eggs, 350 kilograms of rice, and 1,080 kilograms of potatoes. This shows how limited access to basic food items is for the minimum wage earner in Turkey compared to Germany. A similar picture is seen in dairy products, sugar, and oil. In France, a worker can buy 1,329 liters more milk than a worker in Turkey, and in neighboring Greece, a worker can buy 511 liters more milk. Even in the country with the highest inflation rate, Argentina, a worker can buy 947 liters of milk with the minimum wage, while in Turkey, a worker can only buy 377 liters. These data clearly show how high food inflation in Turkey is making it difficult for citizens to meet their basic food needs. According to TÜİK's 5-month inflation data and the Central Bank's June inflation forecast, the minimum wage has already lost 4,000 lira in value. Based on ENAG's data, the 5-month inflation rate is 25.87%, and with the addition of June, it is expected to reach 30%. The minimum wage has lost over 6,000 lira in real value in the first half of the year. Therefore, it is necessary to replace this loss and set the new minimum wage above this amount in July.'

**Eurozone Inflation Rate Decreases to 1.9% in May**
The Eurozone's inflation rate decreased to 1.9% in May, down from 2.2% in the previous month, according to Eurostat. The core inflation rate remained at 2.3% annually and 0% monthly.

Inflation rates in individual countries were as follows: Germany 2.1%, France 0.6%, Italy 1.7%, and Spain 2%. The European Central Bank's medium-term inflation target is 2%. This article was added on June 18, 2025, at 16:48:12. European Union inflation decreased from 2.4% in April to 2.2% in May. As stated by the European Central Bank, 'the medium-term inflation target is 2%.'

**Euro zone yields steady as Israel-Iran ceasefire douses inflation...**
The euro zone government bonds traded steadily on Tuesday after a ceasefire between Israel and Iran was announced, raising hopes of an end to the 12-day war. Oil prices dropped sharply, bringing losses over the past week to around 10%, which helped soothe investor concerns about a potential energy price shock. German 10-year yields were little changed, while two-year Schatz yields held at 1.838%. The German government is expected to approve the draft budget for 2025 and the budget framework for 2026, with record investments of 115.7 billion euros in 2025 and 123.6 billion euros in 2026. Traders expect the European Central Bank to deliver one more rate cut this year as inflation is nearing the central bank's target. 'Until the data turns into a material deterioration, we see no reason for markets to deviate from the expected European Central Bank landing zone of 1.75%,' said ING strategists Michiel Tukker and Benjamin Schroeder. Italian 10-year BTP yields eased 2 bps to 3.482%, leaving the premium over Bunds at 97.05 bps.

**Euro Exchange Rate Rises Above $1.16, Economic Data and Powell's Testimony in Focus**
The euro exchange rate continues to rise, surpassing $1.16. However, economic data may take center stage later in the trading day. The Ifo Business Climate for Germany is scheduled for 10:00 AM, with a positive outlook expected, according to Helaba. In the afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony before the US House Financial Services Committee may provide insight into the US central bank's future monetary policy. Investors are looking for hints on potential interest rate decisions, but a rate hike on July 30 remains unlikely, especially with the US jobs report on July 3.

**US Dollar Falls After Federal Reserve Official Hints at Rate Cut**
The US dollar fell on Monday after a Federal Reserve official, Michelle Bowman, hinted that she would support a rate cut at the next meeting in July, if inflation remains under control. This comes after the US launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on Sunday. Bowman said, 'If inflation remains under control until the next Federal Reserve meeting in July, I will support a rate cut then.' Another Fed member, Christopher Waller, also hinted at a rate cut in July. David Mericle, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said that 'tariffs will leave the US economy with a slightly higher unemployment rate and lower GDP growth, but without a recession, and a one-time inflation spike.' The US dollar fell by 0.08% against the euro, to 1.1533 dollars, around 15:10 GMT. Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at XTB, said that the pound and euro are affected by this possibility because 'in the event of a US-Iran escalation, it is likely that Europe and the UK will be drawn into the conflict.' The market is currently discounting the possibility of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, which carries a third of the world's oil shipments, and oil prices have not risen. Therefore, the US dollar rose against the Australian dollar and Norwegian krone, which are major oil exporters. The dollar also rose by 0.28% against the Japanese yen, reaching 146.50 yen per dollar.

**ANSES Announces Pension Increases for July 2025**
The ANSES (National Social Security Administration) announced that pension increases will be implemented in July 2025 to keep up with the inflation rate. The inflation rate has decreased to 43.5% and the year-to-date rate is 13.3%, influenced by lower prices for fruits and vegetables and a more stable exchange rate due to the relaxation of the currency cap. Additionally, seasonal factors such as the Hot Sale helped to contain prices in May. The increase will be added to the existing $70,000 bonus for those who earn less than $379,265.5, which was implemented in March 2024. According to the ANSES, the total pension will be as follows: For those with the highest pensions, who earn the maximum benefit, will receive $2,081,086.28 in July, up from $2,050,331.31 in the previous month. This adjustment will continue to be made every month, based on the inflation rate, and is expected to continue if the exchange rate and tariffs remain stable.

**Eurozone inflation falls below ECB target to 1.9%**
Eurozone inflation has fallen below the European Central Bank's (ECB) 2% target for the first time in seven months, dropping to 1.9% in May. This is down from 2.2% in April and 2.6% a year earlier. Annual inflation in the European Union came in at 2.2% in May, down from 2.4% in April and 2.7% the previous year. The ECB cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point earlier this month, and investors are now pricing in a pause in rate cuts in July. ECB policymaker Robert Holzmann said that 'the ECB should pause further interest rate cuts until at least September,' while board member Isabel Schnabel warned of 'new shocks posing new challenges' even as disinflation remains on track.

**ECB May Take Another Rate Cut in July, But Easing Process May Be Short-Lived**
According to UBS's interest rate strategists, the European Central Bank (ECB) may take another step by reducing the deposit rate to 1.75% in July, following the expected rate cut this week. However, this easing process is expected to be short-lived. It is predicted that the increasing public expenditures may push inflation upwards in the medium term, and the ECB may start to consider rate hikes from 2026 onwards. UBS's strategists also stated that 'The ECB may be forced to raise interest rates again in 2026 to counter the increasing inflation pressure in a Eurozone (Germany) labor market facing structural rigidity during the demographic transition.'

Consumers in the eurozone expect inflation to reach 3.1% in the next 12 months, the highest level since February 2024, compared to the 2.9% estimated in the March survey by the European Central Bank (BCE). The perceived inflation over the past year (interannual) remained stable at 3.1%, the lowest level since September 2021. For the first time since July 2021, the expectations of inflation for the next 12 months are not below the interannual perceived inflation, both setting at 3.1%. According to the sample, the expectations of inflation for the next three years remained at 2.5% and for the next five years at 2.1%. The uncertainty about the expectations of inflation for the next 12 months increased in April to the level of June 2024. In April, eurozone consumers predicted a 1.9% economic contraction in the next 12 months (contraction of 1.2% in the March survey) and a 10.5% unemployment rate (10.4% in March). Eurozone consumers also expect the labor market to remain stable.

**ECB Lowers Base Rate to 2.65%, Predicts Stabilization of Inflation**
The European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered its base rate to 2.65%, according to a release from the regulator. The ECB believes that the disinflation process is proceeding as planned, and that consumer price growth will soon stabilize at a sustainable level of 2%. The ECB predicts that the average inflation rate in the eurozone countries will be 2.3% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026, and 2% in 2027. The ECB notes that internal inflation remains high due to delayed adjustments in wages and prices in certain sectors. However, the growth of wages is slowing down, and profits are partially mitigating the impact on inflation. The ECB's monetary policy in the eurozone is becoming less restrictive, as lower interest rates make new borrowing cheaper for companies and households, and credit growth is picking up. However, past interest rate hikes are still affecting credit growth, the ECB adds. The ECB has lowered its growth forecasts for the eurozone economy, predicting 0.9% growth in 2025, 1.2% in 2026, and 1.3% in 2027. 'Downward revisions for 2025 and 2026 reflect a decline in exports and ongoing weakness in investments, partly due to high uncertainty in trade policy and broader political uncertainty. Real income growth and the gradual disappearance of the effects of past rate hikes remain key factors underlying the expected increase in demand over time,' the ECB notes. The ECB launched a cycle of monetary policy easing in June last year, starting with a record-high base rate of 4.5%. The current rate cut is the sixth in this cycle, but not consecutive, as the ECB kept the previous rate in July. The next decision on interest rates in the eurozone will be announced on April 17.

**ECB Cuts Interest Rate for Sixth Time**
The European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered the interest rate for the fifth consecutive time by 25 basis points. This move aims to stimulate the economy in the eurozone by making borrowing cheaper. On the other hand, a rate hike would slow down economic growth and inflation. According to the ECB, the disinflation process is on track, with an expected average inflation rate of 2.3% in the eurozone this year, followed by 1.9% in 2026 and 2% in 2027. The inflation forecast was revised upwards due to stronger energy price dynamics. However, the economic growth forecasts were lowered to 0.9% for 2025, 1.2% for 2026, and 1.3% for 2027. This is the sixth interest rate cut since June last year, with the exception of the July 2024 policy meeting where the rates remained unchanged.

**Euro Remains Stable Amid Low Expectations**
The Euro showed stability on Thursday morning, after experiencing slight losses mid-week. The currency traded at around 1.0473 US dollars in the morning, similar to the previous evening's level. The European Central Bank had set the reference rate slightly lower the previous day at 1.0487 dollars. Recent inflation data from Spain met analyst expectations, with inflation stagnating in February after four consecutive months of increases. The annual inflation rate was 2.9%, a level last seen in July 2024. US President Donald Trump's announcement of new import tariffs on EU goods had a minimal impact on the Euro. Trump plans to impose a 25% tariff on imports from the EU, including cars and other products. Investors will focus on US data on durable goods orders, which could provide insights into consumer behavior and business investment interest. Experts at the Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen noted that recent consumer confidence data was disappointing, raising doubts about the strength of the economic recovery.
