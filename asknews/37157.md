**Trump's Tax Reform Bill Hits Roadblock as Republican Party Divided**
US President Trump held a meeting with Republican Party members who oppose the tax reform bill, but it did not resolve the issue. According to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, the meeting was 'productive and moved the situation in the right direction.' However, several members, including Ralph Norman from South Carolina and John Rose from Tennessee, still oppose the current version of the bill. Conservative members are demanding a significant reduction in medical aid and a faster cancellation of clean energy tax incentives, which is opposed by moderate members, leaving House Speaker John Johnson in a difficult position. Despite this, Republican leaders plan to move forward with a vote as early as Wednesday night.

**Trump's Fiscal Plan Stalls in Congress as Republicans Resist**
US President Donald Trump met with Republican lawmakers who are resisting to approve his fiscal plan without resolving the objections of hardline conservatives over the multi-billion dollar cost of the package. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the meeting was 'productive and moved things in the right direction', a characterization shared by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was also present. However, several lawmakers, including Ralph Norman of South Carolina, continue to oppose the legislation as written. Representative John Rose of Tennessee joined the 'no' column on Wednesday night. Conservatives are demanding more drastic cuts to Medicaid and a faster elimination of clean energy tax credits, positions opposed by moderate party members. This puts House leaders in a tight spot. Despite this, party leaders plan to move forward with the vote on Wednesday. 'We're going to vote tonight,' said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise to reporters. The White House increased pressure on Republicans, urging lawmakers to quickly approve the fiscal plan, and added in a statement that not doing so would be the 'greatest betrayal'. However, as negotiations continued, there were signs that investors were becoming increasingly cautious about the US debt burden, which would be exacerbated by the fiscal package. Republicans made progress on Trump's fiscal plan on Wednesday. Johnson announced that he had reached an agreement with lawmakers from high-tax states to increase the state and local tax deduction limit to $40,000, securing the support of a key faction of members who had threatened to block the legislation. 'Members of the SALT caucus negotiated in good faith yesterday,' declared Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican from New York, to Bloomberg Television. 'We agreed on something we believe in and support'.

**More lawmakers fall asleep during early morning vote**
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are struggling to stay awake during overnight sessions, with several members caught dozing off on camera. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) was the latest to be exposed, falling asleep at 2:15 a.m. during a crucial vote on President Trump's 'big beautiful bill.' Critics claim that Republicans are being bullied by Trump into holding the vote, which includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and gutting social programs like Medicaid and food assistance. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) tore into Norman, saying, 'Rep. Ralph Norman is ripping health care away from 13 million Americans not exciting enough to stay awake?' The issue has sparked outrage online, with some calling for mandatory retirement for politicians and term limits. This is not the first time lawmakers have been caught sleeping on the job, with three other members, including Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah), 44, and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), 71, previously falling asleep during late-night sessions.

**Trump tries to broker peace between Freedom Caucus and GOP leadership**
Donald Trump has attempted to broker peace between the Freedom Caucus and GOP leadership at the White House, after his speech to the House GOP failed to sway key holdouts. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) said that conversations were 'not good' early Wednesday, but the White House officials rebutted that, saying 'there was no deal.' The White House presented policy options to the Freedom Caucus, but Rep. Roy said that portions of the deal were taken off the table. The fiscal hawks strongly oppose the legislation, which calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset renewing the 2017 tax breaks. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) said that they are 'hoping we can get something that will satisfy the 12-15 members who have got to see some offsets.' The committee is still meeting, with Johnson hopeful that the reconciliation bill can be voted on the House floor as soon as Wednesday evening. Freedom Caucus members said the bill is 'en route to get passed,' but they do not think it can be passed this week.

**Trump Trade: Conservatives fight to end IRA tax credits sooner**
Conservative Republican lawmakers have secured a commitment from House leadership to end key clean-energy tax credits earlier than planned as part of a deal aimed at allowing President Donald Trump's tax and spending package to advance. According to South Carolina Representative Ralph Norman, 'After last night's budget vote, we made some progress. Yes, we're moving up Medicaid work requirements. Yes, we're putting an end to the Green New Scam subsidies.' Norman stated that the US credit rating being downgraded is evidence of how the country's fiscal house is out of order. Meanwhile, President Trump stated in a post to Truth Social that he had a 'very well' two-hour call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and that Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and an end to the War. Trump also stated that Russia wants to do large-scale trade with the United States when the war is over, and that Ukraine can be a great beneficiary on trade in the process of rebuilding its country.

**Trump's Tax Reform Package Faces Resistance from Conservative Lawmakers**
US President Donald Trump stated that his tax reform package is close to being finalized, after reaching an agreement on state and local tax deductions. However, the White House still struggles to convince a faction of conservatives who demand more spending cuts. 'We're doing very well. We're very close', Trump told reporters on Wednesday. Despite this, some ultra-conservatives have attacked the measure. Several hardline Republicans claimed that party leaders in the House of Representatives are not respecting the concessions promised by the White House and threaten to sink the bill. However, the White House claims that it never reached an agreement, but rather presented some of the most resistant conservatives with a series of political options that the Trump administration could accept, according to a White House official. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson are set to meet with some of the ultra-conservative lawmakers in the White House at 3 pm, according to a person familiar with the plans. Representative Andy Harris, a Maryland ultra-conservative, described the conversations with the White House as a last chance to cut more Medicaid and quickly eliminate clean energy incentives from the Biden era. Harris stated that the bill does not reflect that agreement and that hardline supporters will block the package if it is put to a vote. Representative Ralph Norman, a South Carolina ultra-conservative, said that the bill 'does not have the votes and is not even close'.

**An Update on the 2026 Senate Races**
The 2026 Senate races are shaping up to be competitive, with several seats potentially flipping from Republican to Democrat. However, the national environment does not currently favor the Democrats, with President Donald Trump's approval rating at 47.1% and a Republican edge in the RCP average. The article analyzes the individual Senate races, including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The Democrats are expected to have a strong chance in Georgia, Michigan, and Minnesota, while the Republicans are favored in Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, and South Carolina. The article concludes that the Democrats will need to pick up all five Republican seats without losing any of their own, which will require a bad national environment or a lot of luck. Currently, this does not appear to be happening.

South Carolina Senator Stephen Goldfinch is exploring a run for attorney general, citing his experience as a lawyer and his dedication to fighting government and bureaucracy. Goldfinch, a Republican from Murrell's Inlet, told the Richland County Republican Party that he is 'strongly considering' a bid for the position, saying it's a critical time to establish a strong bulwark of resistance to the federal bureaucracy. He emphasized his own experience with pushback from state environmental regulators, saying, 'I hated the government... They had stymied me. They had stymied my friends. They had stymied my family every step of the way.' Goldfinch has been considered a leading candidate for the position, amid speculation that incumbent AG Alan Wilson is planning a run for governor.

**Trump mega-bill clears hurdle after rebels drop opposition | News**
A key hurdle has been cleared for the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill', a mega-bill central to US President Donald Trump's domestic agenda, after several lawmakers dropped their opposition. The bill, which pairs an extension of Trump's first-term tax cuts with savings that will see millions of the poorest Americans lose their health coverage, is expected to add more than $4.8 trillion to the federal deficit over the coming decade. Republicans plan significant cuts in spending, including new restrictions on the Medicaid program that would result in more than 10 million people losing coverage. Moderate Republicans fear the cuts could upset the party's prospects in the midterm elections, while deficit hawks on the far right insist the cuts don't go far enough. 'We don't like smoke and mirrors,' said Ralph Norman of South Carolina. 'We want real cuts.' The bill will face challenges in the Senate, where Republicans are demanding major changes. 'This is the largest spending reduction in at least three decades, probably longer,' Norman said. 'It's historic.'

**Trump's big bill advances in rare weekend vote as House conservatives negotiate changes**
The House Budget Committee advanced the 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act' in a rare weekend vote, despite concerns from conservative Republicans and Democrats. The bill, which includes new spending and tax cuts, was met with criticism from Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who said, 'We are writing checks we cannot cash, and our children are going to pay the price.' The start date for work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid participants was pushed back to 2029, with some Republicans arguing that it should be sooner. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina said, 'We've got a lot more work to do,' and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the bill 'one big, beautiful betrayal.' The bill now moves to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are eyeing changes that could make final passage more difficult.

**SC Rep. Ralph Norman joins hardline Republicans stalling Trump's tax megabill**
U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman joined a group of hardline conservatives in delaying the GOP megabill, which would reshape U.S. domestic policy and stymie Republican efforts to pass the legislation desired by President Donald Trump. Norman stated, 'No bill is better than a bad bill,' and said that he would vote 'no' until substantial changes were made to address spending concerns. The bill includes a massive overhaul of the Medicaid program, shifting increased costs to states, adding new work requirements, and more frequent eligibility verifications. Norman said, 'We've made progress, but it just takes time,' and that lawmakers might have to work through the weekend to address concerns. Trump wrote on social media, 'Not only does it cut Taxes for ALL Americans, but it will kick millions of Illegal Aliens off of Medicaid to PROTECT it for those who are the ones in real need.' However, Norman and other conservatives remain opposed to the bill, with Norman stating, 'If we're going to continue to have just what I mentioned — able-bodied Americans getting checks, illegals getting checks, subsidies that go to corporations that shouldn't get them — I'm out.'

**SCOOP: Key House Freedom Caucus member 'seriously considering' run for governor in 2026**
Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., is 'seriously considering' a run for South Carolina governor in 2026, according to Norman himself. Norman, a conservative fiscal hawk and key member of the House Freedom Caucus, has been in office for eight years and believes he is doing a good job. However, he also stated that he may return to Congress, citing his support for term limits. Norman's comments appear to be a marked escalation in his flirtations with higher office, following previous reports that he was thinking about running for governor. Norman would be on a collision course with fellow House conservative Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who is also 'seriously considering' a run for governor.

**South Carolina congressman heaps praise on Musk and DOGE at Spartanburg town hall forum**
Rep. Ralph Norman praised Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at a town hall event in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Norman acknowledged that tariffs will affect prices but believes they will be used as leverage for better trade deals and immigration control. He also stated that there will be a 'shock' from DOGE recommendations and cuts, but reassured constituents that Social Security will not be cut. However, concerns were raised about the potential impact on education and special needs students, with Norman advocating for the elimination of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs in education. Norman said, 'There's not going to be cuts in Social Security,' but critics dispute DOGE's claims of finding massive amounts of fraud. Norman also stated that public education will be in DOGE's sights, and that he supports the eradication of DEI programs at all levels of education.

Thomas Ravenel, a former Republican state treasurer and reality TV star, announced his candidacy for governor of South Carolina on X, but then withdrew his intentions five days later citing family obligations.

Attorney General Alan Wilson, 1st District U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, and wealthy Upstate businessman John Warren. Meanwhile, the S.C.

In other news, Mace accused her former fiancé and three other men of rape, sexual exploitation, and domestic abuse, and the S.C.

**Check them off: In just over 2 weeks, Trump has completed most of his campaign platform**
President Donald Trump has completed most of his campaign platform in just over two weeks, according to analysts. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said, 'This is comparable to the full presidencies of other Presidents and those who’ve preceded him in the Oval Office.' Trump has delivered on several key promises, including: sealing the border and stopping the invasion of illegal aliens, conducting the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, making America the world's dominant energy producer, implementing large tax cuts for workers and no tax on tips, ending the weaponization of government against the American people, strengthening and modernizing the military, keeping men out of women's sports, and securing elections. South Carolina Republican Rep. Ralph Norman expressed optimism that the current Congress will pass legislation to make these changes permanent, saying, 'We want to fund that. And you know, it’s just a real relief that now we’re not just talking about it, but we’re doing it.'

**House Republicans leave Florida retreat with little guidance on how...**
House Republicans returned from their Florida retreat with no clear plan on how to fulfill their promises for a legislative package that will define the 119th Congress. Despite two-plus days of discussions, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) bluntly stated that 'everything's up in the air.' The GOP wants to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, add Trump's campaign promises of no taxes on tips, Social Security checks, or overtime pay, and increase the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap. However, the Tax Foundation estimates that extending the 2017 tax cuts alone would add $3.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. Republicans are planning to utilize a process known as reconciliation to bypass the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a legislative filibuster. They are poised to kick off that process next week by beginning markup on the budget resolution, which GOP leadership hopes to get passed by late February. However, Senate Republicans almost universally prefer breaking Trump's agenda package into two separate reconciliation bills to get a quick win on the border, energy and defense, then having more time to focus on the more difficult task of figuring out the tax components.
