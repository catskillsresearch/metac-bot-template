**The Enduring Appeal of Online Poker and Blackjack**
The online versions of poker and blackjack have maintained their popularity over the years, thanks to their perfect balance of simple rules, deep strategies, and constant excitement. The blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the oldest and most popular casino games, where the objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. In its online version, the game maintains its classic essence but adds speed, dynamism, and accessibility. The player can join a game in seconds from anywhere and at any time, and there are various online variants available, including the classic blackjack and versions like 'Lo interesante del blackjack es que, pese a su simplicidad, la estrategia importa mucho.' The poker online is a universe in itself, combining mathematical skill, psychological intuition, and patience. The Texas Hold'em, its most popular version, has conquered both informal tables and international tournaments. The online poker offers multiple formats, and what makes it so attractive is that the player's decisions can make a difference. It's not just about cards, but also about reading opponents, managing chips, and knowing when to retreat or press. This strategic layer makes it one of the favorite games of those who seek more than just luck. Additionally, online poker offers a sense of community, with tournaments creating rivalries, friendships, and trajectories. Many players have started out of curiosity and have ended up turning the game into a passion or even a source of income. Both games share a key quality: longevidad and adaptabilidad. They have been entertaining people around the world for centuries, and today they remain vibrant in online casinos thanks to their ability to adapt to new technologies and player preferences.

**Astronomer Reveals: In 2039, Hajj Pilgrims Will Gather on 'Arafah Twice**
According to Dr. Abdullah Al-Masned, a renowned astronomer, the year 2039 will witness two 'Arafah gatherings and three Eid celebrations. January 2039 will coincide with the first ten days of Dhu al-Hijjah, and Eid al-Fitr will fall on October 19, 2039. The second 'Arafah gathering will take place on December 25, 2039, which will also be the first day of Eid al-Adha. Dr. Al-Masned explained that this phenomenon occurs due to the difference between the Islamic and Gregorian calendars, with the former being approximately 10-12 days shorter than the latter. This discrepancy allows the Islamic calendar to complete a full cycle every 33 years, resulting in the possibility of two 'Arafah gatherings in the year 2039. 'Arafah is a significant day in the Islamic calendar, where Muslims from around the world gather to seek forgiveness and mercy from Allah. As the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, 'There is no day more deserving of forgiveness than 'Arafah.' ' According to Dr. Al-Masned, this event is rare in the timeline, and he emphasized that the year 2039 will be a unique occasion for Muslims to gather on 'Arafah twice.

**New Energy Efficiency Requirements for Property Owners when Selling or Renting**
As of January 1, 2030, only properties that meet the minimum energy efficiency class E can be sold or newly rented. By 2033, the minimum standard will be raised to class D. This is part of the new European building directive, which aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. According to the Spanish Real Decreto 390/2021, the implementation of this directive has been regulated, introducing an updated method for issuing energy certificates and expanding the requirements for energy efficiency for both new and existing buildings. Property owners must ensure that their property meets the required minimum standards for energy efficiency before it can be sold or rented. This particularly affects older houses that are often not well-insulated or have outdated heating systems. The new regulations will initially require investments, but will ultimately increase the value of the property in the long term. To prove compliance with the efficiency class, a current energy certificate is mandatory. Only authorized professionals such as architects, engineers, and specialized technicians can issue the energy certificate. The certificate must be presented when selling or renting the property. The energy efficiency class of the accommodation must also be clearly stated in the marketing, such as on online platforms. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in fines and the property cannot be legally rented. Additionally, the reform of the Balearic Tourism Law in 2022 brought comprehensive changes to make tourism more sustainable, reduce environmental impact, and improve living conditions on the island. By May 1, 2026, heating systems that run on heating oil or gas must be replaced with more environmentally friendly alternatives. Vacation rentals are required to install water-saving devices such as double-flush toilets and flow restrictors on water faucets. The deadline for this was May 1, 2024. The provision of single-use toilet articles is only allowed if they are provided on request and in environmentally friendly packaging.

**Online Gambling Market Expected to Reach $15.37 Billion by 2030**
The online gambling market is expected to reach $15.37 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.9% from 2025. The growth is driven by the rise of free-to-play online games, such as betting apps and websites, which generate revenue through user-integrated advertising. The increasing popularity of smartphones and internet, as well as easy access to casino game platforms, are also contributing to the market's growth. According to GSMA, there will be 333 million new mobile internet subscribers in the Asia-Pacific region by 2025. The proliferation of cost-effective betting applications is also expected to drive market growth. In 2021, there were over 650,000 unique accounts created on mobile betting apps in New York state. Online casino software providers are partnering with developers to meet the demand for immersive casino games. For example, Sisal, a subsidiary of Flutter Entertainment Plc, obtained an online gambling license from the Moroccan La Marcocaine des Jeux et des Sports (MDJS) in February 2023. FanDuel, another subsidiary of Flutter Entertainment Plc, launched a mobile sports betting platform in Ohio in January 2023 and announced the opening of a sportsbook at the Bellterra Park in Cincinnati. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of online gambling, with people spending more time indoors and turning to online games as a form of entertainment. A study by the University of Bristol in May 2021 found that the likelihood of online gamblers regularly engaging in online gambling increased by over six times compared to pre-pandemic levels. The introduction of digital payment options with secure payment gateways has also promoted the adoption of online gambling apps. The proliferation of digital currencies and websites provided by gambling and gaming companies is expected to further accelerate market growth.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Mexico to co-host 2031 Women's World Cup with U.S.**

**Cryptocurrencies and Online Gaming in 2025: Will They Remain the Future of Online Casinos?**
Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the way players manage payments in online casinos and betting platforms. Many online gaming operators have adopted digital currencies due to their promise of instant payments, lower transaction fees, and greater privacy. In 2025, this trend continues to grow, with more platforms incorporating Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins to facilitate access to deposits and withdrawals for players. One of the most significant positive aspects of crypto in gaming is its extreme decentralization, which allows for a type of payment from user to platform, giving more online players worldwide greater accessibility. The security and confidentiality of each transaction are high due to blockchain technology, which permanently records each operation within the system. This allows participants and operators to verify any transaction or bet at any time, ensuring no alterations or traps. However, there are also challenges, such as regulations, which vary across jurisdictions, with some accepting and regulating crypto use while others impose severe restrictions or even complete bans. The volatility of cryptocurrencies is another factor to consider, as their value can change drastically in a short time, posing challenges for both players and operators. Despite these challenges, the current trends indicate that the adoption of cryptocurrencies in online gaming will continue to grow. The security, decentralization, and speed of transactions remain attractive for both players and operators, and the advancement of blockchain technology and new solutions to reduce volatility will likely lead to an increase in cryptocurrency use in online gaming. 2025 will be the decisive year for this transformation, as more online gaming platforms will adopt the demands of players along with clearer regulations in many parts of the world.
