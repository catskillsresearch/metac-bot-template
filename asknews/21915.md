**NATO defence spending target may come 'too late' for Ukraine crisis: Denmark**
Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that NATO's target to boost defence spending by 2032 may come 'too late' as countries in the region rapidly increase their military budgets in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Frederiksen emphasized the need for increased defence spending, stating that 'that's not enough. We need to increase defence spending in the years to come.' She also expressed concerns that the proposed 5 per cent goal may not be achievable by 2032. Meanwhile, the UK has announced plans to build 12 new attack submarines to move the country to 'war-fighting readiness' in the face of 'Russian aggression' and the changing nature of conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his demand to be invited to the June NATO summit, warning that excluding Ukraine would be 'a victory for Putin, not over Ukraine, but over NATO.' Zelensky also rejected Russia's demands, calling them an 'imperialist land grab.'

**Lithuanian President Calls on NATO to Speed Up Defense Funding Commitments**
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda called on NATO to accelerate the implementation of future defense funding commitments, warning that Russia is moving quickly to reorganize its military forces. Nauseda said, 'Russia is not waiting, it is currently reforming its military forces. We have very limited time to do the same. We should be talking about a period of three to five years.' He noted that his country has already reached the goal of allocating 5% of its GDP for military spending, calling for a collective agreement on this ambitious goal at the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague in June. Nauseda emphasized the need to reduce the timeline, saying, 'There is no need to talk about transitional periods extending until 2035 or 2040. We have, at most, five years to take decisive and committed actions.' The Vilnius summit aims to unify regional positions in preparation for the NATO summit in The Hague on June 24, which is expected to make critical decisions on defense spending and keeping pace with increasing security threats, particularly from Russia. Currently, NATO member states are committed to spending 2% of their GDP on defense, but several countries have not yet achieved this goal. In contrast, the Baltic states and Poland have announced plans to increase their defense spending to 5% or more of their GDP.

**Zelensky: Aggressor Should Not Receive Any Rewards for War**
President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia should not receive any benefits from the war against Ukraine. Commenting on the negotiations in Istanbul, he emphasized that the main condition for achieving peace is the preservation of strong international pressure on the Kremlin. 'It is very important that each of our partners supports this approach. Sanctions against Russia are necessary. It is essential to seriously limit Russian oil trade and its use by tankers. Sanctions, including secondary sanctions, tariffs, and price caps, can work and push Russia towards peace. Without pressure, Putin will simply continue to play games with everyone who wants this war to end,' he said. Zelensky also stressed that the aggressor has no right to any 'reward' - neither in the form of territories nor political concessions. 'Putin should receive nothing that could justify his aggression. Any reward will only show him that war brings dividends. Geopolitical gains for Russia are as important as money or territories. If Putin is allowed to decide who joins NATO, where NATO infrastructure can or cannot be, then Russian appetites for war will only grow. Our common goal is the opposite,' he added. The Ukrainian delegation, led by Defense Minister Rustem Umeyev, met with the Russian delegation, led by Vladimir Medinsky, in Istanbul on June 2, 2024, with Turkey as a mediator. The Ukrainian delegation was expected to present a roadmap for achieving peace in Istanbul on Monday, June 3, 2024, in the form of a memorandum.

**Negotiations for Peace: Two Weeks of Fighting, Drone Attacks, and Sabotage Operations**
The two weeks following the first and second rounds of peace negotiations in Istanbul have seen no decrease in fighting between Russians and Ukrainians, with the conflict far from being resolved. Russia launched a record-breaking 500 drones against Ukrainian territory on Saturday night, which Ukraine responded to with its most audacious sabotage operation since February 2022. For the first time, Ukrainian drones, activated remotely from trailers parked near military airfields, reached Siberian territory, destroying 41 Russian aircraft, a third of their bombers, in four airfields. According to Ukrainian security services, the drones also destroyed eight Tu-95MS, four Tu-22M, and one An-12 bombers. 'It's a tragic loss for the entire Russian air fleet,' wrote Rybar, a popular blogger, on Telegram. The Ukrainian analysts compare the success of the operation to the sinking of the cruiser Moskv√°, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, in the first year of the war. The new Russian nuclear doctrine also contemplates the use of nuclear weapons in the event of a massive drone attack on national territory. The Russian security zone, which aims to keep Ukrainian artillery at bay, should include the Russian regions of Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk, as well as the Ukrainian regions of Sumy and Kharkiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky estimated that 50,000 Russian soldiers are concentrated north of Sumy, whose capital is just over 300 kilometers from Kiev. Meanwhile, fixed-wing drones continue to wreak havoc on both countries, a battle in which Ukraine appears to be gaining the upper hand, allowing them to save lives in the midst of a chronic shortage of men. The positions of the two countries remain irreconcilable, with Ukraine demanding an unconditional ceasefire, prisoner exchanges, and the return of all children taken to Russia, which led to an international arrest warrant being issued against Putin. Kiev also demands security guarantees, refuses to be neutral (it can join NATO if there is a consensus in the block), and rejects the imposition of limits on the size of its army, red lines for the Kremlin. In contrast, Russia maintains its proposals in secret and will only present them once the meeting in the Turkish city begins today.

**German Defense Chief Warns NATO of Potential Russian Attack by 2029**
General Carsten Breuer, the German defense chief, has warned NATO member countries of a potential Russian attack within the next four years. According to Breuer, NATO should prepare for the risk of a Russian attack by 2029. 'It's what the analysts estimate - in 2029. So we need to be ready by 2029. If you ask me now, is it a guarantee that it won't be earlier than 2029? I would say no, it's not. So we need to be able to fight tonight,' Breuer told BBC at a military summit in Singapore. The Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, are particularly at risk, he assesses. Breuer considers the threat from Russia to be 'very serious', one he has not seen in his 40-year career. He notes that Russia produces around 1,500 tanks and millions of artillery shells every year. 'Not every tank is sent to Ukraine. They are also sent to storage and into new military structures that are always directed at the West,' Breuer said. The warning comes ahead of a NATO summit in the Hague at the end of June, where member countries will discuss defense budgets and military buildup.

**NATO Warns of Possible Russian Attack by 2029**
NATO's member countries should prepare for a possible Russian attack within the next four years, according to Germany's defense chief, General Carsten Breuer. He told the BBC that Russia is producing hundreds of tanks annually and many of these could be used in an attack on NATO's Baltic member countries by 2029 or earlier. 'We are facing a very serious threat from Russia, a threat I have never seen in my 40 years of service,' Breuer said. He claims that Russia is building up its forces 'to an enormous degree' and producing around 1500 tanks per year, not all of which are being used in the war in Ukraine, but also stored for future use against the West. 'There is an intention and a buildup of reserves for a possible future attack on NATO's Baltic member countries. Analysts estimate that this could happen in 2029. So we must be clear by 2029,' Breuer said. 'If you ask me now if this is a guarantee that it won't happen before 2029, I would say no. So we must be able to fight already tonight,' he added. Breuer pointed out the Suwalki Corridor, a region bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable areas. NATO forces, including those from Norway, have had a significant presence in the Suwalki Corridor in recent years to show muscle against Russia. 'What we need to do now is really to lean in and tell everyone: Come on, step up... engage more in this, because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves and thus also build up deterrence,' Breuer said.

**Germany's Top General Warns of Potential Russian Attack on NATO by 2029**
German Chief of Staff, General Carsten Breuer, believes that Russia may attack NATO within the next four years. He stated in an interview with the BBC, published on June 1, that NATO members must prepare for a possible Russian attack by 2029 or even earlier. According to Breuer, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never encountered in his 40-year career. He noted that Russia is rapidly increasing its military capabilities, producing around 1,500 main battle tanks per year and 4 million 152mm shells in 2024, not all of which were sent to Ukraine. Some of the military equipment is being stored in warehouses, awaiting a potential attack on the West. 'There is an intention and a buildup of reserves' for a possible future attack on Baltic states, he said. 'We must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it won't happen before 2029, I would say no, it's not. So we must be able to fight tonight,' Breuer said. He highlighted the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable areas. General Breuer asserts that NATO members must again increase their military forces. He added that it will take years for the European military-industrial base to ramp up to match the scale of Russia's military production.

**Former CIA Director Warns of Potential Russian Invasion of NATO Country**
Former CIA Director David Petraeus believes that if Russia wins in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin may attempt to invade a NATO country, with the Baltic states being the most likely target. According to Petraeus, Russia's goal was to overthrow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and 'establish a puppet leader and control all of Ukraine.' He stated, 'As soon as that is done, you will see them focus on one of the Baltic states.' Petraeus also criticized former US President Donald Trump for giving Putin 'a second chance' and former President Joe Biden for failing to adequately arm Ukrainian forces. Petraeus said, 'We've seen three cases where the President of the United States threatened to take a different approach in two weeks. This time, we'll see what actually happens.' He also emphasized that the US has delayed making key decisions, such as providing M1 Abrams tanks, F-16s, and missile systems, which has been 'very costly for the Ukrainians.' Special Representative of Donald Trump, Keith Kellogg, confirmed that the head of the White House is willing to promise Putin that NATO will not expand if it is a key condition for ending the war. Kellogg said, 'This is a legitimate concern. This is a question Russia will always raise. They talk not only about Ukraine, but also about Moldova and Georgia. And we say: well, we can discuss the cessation of NATO expansion to your border. This is their security interest.'

**NATO Excludes Zelenski from Summit Amid Trump's Skepticism and Putin's Pressure**
Ukrainian President Volod√≠mir Zelenski has not received an invitation to participate in the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague on June 24-25. This comes as Donald Trump is in the White House, and there are concerns about the level of support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian President Vlad√≠mir Putin is increasing pressure on NATO to exclude Ukraine from the negotiations for peace. Last year, Ukraine secured a commitment to its 'irreversible path' to the Atlantic alliance. NATO allies are preparing for the summit, including setting a new goal of a 5% military spending increase by 2032. Invitations have been sent to the four Indo-Pacific partners (Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand), as the US focuses on the challenge posed by China in the region, while maintaining its commitment to European security.

**Russia's Demands for Ending the War: A Threat to Ukraine and NATO**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russia's main goals remain the capitulation of Ukraine and the destruction of NATO. The ISW analysis of a Reuters article from May 28, 2025, confirms that Russia's demands for ending the war are consistent with public statements from Russian officials. The demands include a ban on NATO expansion, Ukraine's neutrality, and a change of government in Ukraine. These demands are similar to those made by Russia before and during the full-scale invasion in 2021. ISW believes that these demands are part of Russia's efforts to force the West to push Ukraine towards capitulation and to divide NATO as a security alliance. Reuters reported that Vladimir Putin demands 4 regions that Russia has not fully occupied, but has territorial ambitions beyond these regions. Putin continues to demand the full territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. ISW notes that Putin first demanded these regions in June 2024, and the Kremlin has repeatedly repeated this demand. Russia has deployed 125,000 soldiers near Sumy and Kharkiv regions, which it has not formally annexed. Russian forces have been conducting offensive operations in Kharkiv and Sumy regions since May 2024, aimed at creating a 'buffer zone'. ISW believes that Russia's territorial ambitions go beyond these four regions, and that its military efforts are aimed at creating a 'buffer zone' in these regions. Putin continues to demonstrate his willingness to achieve his military goals through a long and brutal war against Ukraine, with Russian forces gradually advancing and waiting for Western aid to Ukraine to dwindle.

**Nato to ask Germany for 40,000 more troops  under new targets, sources say**
Nato plans to ask Germany to provide 40,000 more troops, or seven additional brigades, under new targets for weapons and troop numbers. The alliance is increasing its military capability targets as it views Russia as a greater threat since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The target for the total number of brigades will be raised to between 120 and 130, a 50% increase from the current target of around 80 brigades. Germany has agreed to provide 10 brigades by 2030, but is currently short-staffed by 20,000 regular troops. Providing the additional 40,000 troops will be a significant challenge for Berlin. Nato members have increased defence spending since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and alliance head Mark Rutte will seek an agreement to more than double their current spending target from 2% to 5% of GDP at a summit in The Hague in June.

**Putin's Message to the West: Russia Will Not Be Intimidated**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent a clear message to the West by not inviting Ukrainian representatives to the main NATO summit in June, and explicitly stating that President Zelensky's presence would be 'unwelcome' due to the potential for 'tension'. Meanwhile, the US has proposed reviving the Russia-NATO Council, which was suspended in 2022. This move has been seen as a significant shift in tone, particularly in light of a recent report by the Atlantic Council, which described Russia as the 'most direct and serious threat to the security of NATO member states'. The report called for NATO to 'win the war against Russia in Ukraine', 'contain Russian aggression towards allies and partners', and 'limit Russia's influence beyond its borders'. However, Russia has responded by extending its Defense Plan, which outlines the country's main risks and threats to national security. This move has been seen as a sign that Russia is taking a serious and proactive approach to its national security, and is not intimidated by Western rhetoric. The extension of the Defense Plan has been seen as a response to the growing threat from NATO, and a signal that Russia is preparing for a potential conflict. The move has caused a stir in the West, with some analysts warning that Russia's military capabilities will soon surpass those of NATO. A recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) warned that Russia will have military capabilities comparable to those of NATO within two years, and that the alliance will need to spend at least $1 trillion and 25 years to fill the gap in its defenses. Putin's message is clear: Russia will not be intimidated or deterred by Western rhetoric, and will take all necessary steps to protect its national security.

**NATO Aims to Become 'More Deadly' in Response to Russia**
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has called for the alliance to become 'more deadly' in response to Russia. He emphasized that the alliance's military capabilities should be increased to a level where 'no one would dare to attack' it. Rutte suggested that this could be achieved by increasing military spending among member states, which would be distributed evenly among all countries. This comes as European NATO members are set to discuss the possibility of requiring member states to increase their defense spending from 2% to 3% of their GDP at the upcoming June summit. The goal is to reach 2.5% of GDP in the short term and 3% by 2030. This move is a response to the demands of former US President Donald Trump, who initially called for member states to spend 5% of their GDP on defense by 2032, later reduced to 3.5%. The expansion of NATO has been a concern for Russia, particularly after Finland and Sweden joined the alliance in 2022 and 2024, respectively. The alliance's new Strategic Concept, adopted in June 2022, identifies Russia as the 'most significant and direct threat to the security' of NATO. As NATO's military capabilities continue to grow, so does its involvement in conflicts around the world, with over 1 million civilians killed in its operations over the past 30 years.

**The West has now capitulated to Russia on Ukraine.**
The West has officially capitulated to Russia on Ukraine, with NATO's informal political capitulation on April 24, 2025, deciding Russia's victory in the Cold War. The decision not to send troops to Ukraine signals that The West finally understands the need to respect Russia's national-security necessities. The UK and France are planning to withdraw troops and instead deploy trainers to western Ukraine, a move that Russia has preemptively rejected. Valentina Matvienko, chair of the Russian Federation Council, stated that Russia will never participate in negotiations or talks to discuss the terms for foreign troop deployment in Ukraine. The West is now betting that stepping back from boots on the ground might be the concession Moscow needs to rethink its hardline terms, a strategic gamble that could either open the door to peace or be read as retreat. The author, Eric Zuesse, suggests that the war in Ukraine will end with Russia offering the Lviv area to the U.S. empire in exchange for a treaty promising not to place or allow nuclear weapons in the surviving territory of Ukraine.

**Russia may be ready to attack Europe by 2030: Poland's foreign minister**
Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski warned that Russia could be ready to attack Europe by 2030 if Ukraine is forced to surrender. Sikorski stated, 'But if Ukraine were forced to capitulate, and if Russia took over its army... then this calculation would change.' He emphasized that Europe must prepare for Russia's ability to attack 'by the end of the decade.' Sikorski's remarks come amid ceasefire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Riyadh. He also expressed support for an international peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, but ruled out the deployment of Polish units, citing national security priorities. Poland has significantly increased its defense spending since the beginning of Russia's war on Ukraine in 2022, reaching 4.12% of GDP last year, the highest in NATO.

**Europe Prepares for 'Russian Invasion' in 2030**
Europe is actively preparing for a potential Russian invasion, which it believes will occur in 2030. According to the British newspaper The Sun, European countries are arming themselves, building bunkers, introducing military service, and creating survival plans for civilians. France has released a guide to surviving an invasion, recommending the collection of emergency kits. President Emmanuel Macron has deployed French fighter jets with hypersonic nuclear missiles to the border with Germany. Norway is preparing for mass evacuation drills, while Sweden and Finland have released survival guides, and Denmark has issued a warning with a list of essential products and medications for a three-day crisis. Germany has shared secret plans for preparing for a Third World War, including a list of bunkers for civilians. Berlin is planning to transport 200,000 units of equipment and 800,000 NATO soldiers through its territory. The Baltic countries are building a joint defense line on the border with Russia and have withdrawn from an international treaty banning anti-personnel mines. The European Union has launched a massive plan to spend up to 800 billion euros on long-term defense and supporting Ukraine. The possibility of creating a drone defense system is also being considered to deter a potential Russian invasion. 'Europe is considering creating a drone defense system from the Baltic to the Black Sea to deter a potential Russian invasion and cause maximum inconvenience to President Putin if he decides to go ahead,' the publication states.

**Trump Disagrees with Zelensky's Claim of Potential Russian Invasion of NATO Countries**
Former US President Donald Trump stated that he does not agree with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's claim that Russia may invade NATO countries in the future. 'No, I do not agree. I do not agree at all,' Trump said to journalists, without explaining his response. This comes after Zelensky's statement at the Munich Security Conference, where he claimed that Russia plans to send troops to Belarus in 2025 under the guise of 'training' that could be used for an attack on NATO countries. European politicians have previously warned of a potential Russian attack on the alliance, which could occur in 2025, 2026, or 2030. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also stated that there is a possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2029-2030. The Institute for the Study of War reported on February 9 that Russia has increased its hybrid and diversionary attacks on NATO, including the use of drones.

**Germany Accelerates Defense Reform Amid Russian Threat**
Germany is accelerating its defense reform, with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia 'changing everything' and now betting on six new regiments, each with between 6,000 and 8,000 troops, ready by 2026. Germany has bet on a significant expansion of its troops to defend its territory in case of a Russian invasion. The threat of Vladimir Putin, who often points to Berlin, the capital, when recalling the world's nuclear arms, and the invasion of Ukraine have made defense a top priority. The so-called Heimatschutz will be formed by six regiments, each with between 6,000 and 8,000 troops in 2026. Their training will be rigorous and will cover techniques such as shooting and survival, as well as a series of scenarios that include conflicts and natural disasters, according to the government. The invasion of Ukraine led Chancellor Olaf Scholz to promise to transform the German army, which had been reduced by 40% after the Cold War. According to the head of the Defense General Staff, General Carsten Breuer, Germany has 'between five and eight years' to prepare for a situation in which 'it could be possible to attack NATO territory', citing the British newspaper Express. A prediction that, in his eyes, justifies the changes and investments. Germany currently has around 179,000 uniformed soldiers, making it the sixth largest military force in NATO, after the United States, Turkey, Poland, France, and the United Kingdom. But Germany is the most populous country in the EU, with a population of 84.5 million inhabitants. The German leaders know they can do better and plan to expand this figure to 203,000 by 2031. Part of this is the Operation Deutschland, also called Oplan, a comprehensive 1,000-page plan to protect critical infrastructure and mobilize its own forces, as well as help with the mobilization of NATO troops in times of war. The teniente general Andr√© Bodemann, head of the National Defense Command of Germany and self-proclaimed architect of the plan, recognizes that everything changed in 2022 when Russia launched its full invasion of Ukraine. 'I do not expect tank battles in the north of Germany and, hopefully, I do not expect Russian paratroopers to land,' he said last month. 'But our critical infrastructure, ports, bridges, energy companies are threatened by sabotage, possibly also by special forces that try to interrupt these critical infrastructure.' Another concern are 'diversions of special forces, for example, irregular forces that try to sabotage something to obstruct or prevent deployment,' he said. 'We live in a hybrid phase with threats that include disinformation, cyberattacks, espionage, and sabotage.' When asked recently if this is the most dangerous period, in terms of risk of war for Germany since the Cold War, he replied to Sky News: 'Yes, definitely. I do not think we are at war, but we no longer live in times of peace.' Although the rhetoric is strong, it is not easy to convince a country whose main contribution to NATO for decades has been the provision of training fields for war. The country faces a significant shortage of military personnel and equipment. At the end of 2023, the number of troops decreased by 1,537 compared to the previous year, with over 20,000 vacancies. And in 2018, an official report on defense dominance concluded that the majority of the main systems of arms of the German army were not available for training exercises or deployment, and less than a third were operational. In 2022, a 100,000 million euro fund was announced to rectify this situation. One of the solutions have been the youth camps, in which young people can know how it is to live in the army. During a one-week course near Leipzig, young people practice navigation, teamwork, outdoor skills, and a timed obstacle course. Recruitment has been postponed for now, in favor of a bill that would approve the sending of a questionnaire to all 18-year-olds to evaluate their willingness to serve. All men who turn 18 this year -around 300,000- will be required by law to respond, although recruitment will be optional for women. 'Russia is reorganizing, restructuring, and reinforcing its forces,' added General Bodemann. 'We have to speed up to be ready before that happens,' concludes.
