**OpenAI and Apple Collaborate on Revolutionary AI Device**
OpenAI and Apple's product designer Jonathan Ive are developing a new device that interacts with artificial intelligence without a screen. According to the Wall Street Journal, the device will be compact and can be worn or placed on a desk. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman called the project 'the most significant in the company's history', highlighting that the device can analyze the environment and user actions without visual interfaces. The launch is planned for late 2025, with OpenAI aiming to release 100 million devices, a record for the speed of product launch. The team has been working with manufacturers for the past four months to finalize the conditions. The project was initially developed by Ive's startup, io, but after OpenAI evaluated its potential, they acquired the company for $6.5 billion to combine the design and generative AI technologies. The main goal of the device is to become the 'third gadget' after smartphones and laptops, working in the background. Altman ruled out the creation of augmented reality glasses, while Ive rejected the concept of wearable devices. Instead, the product will recognize context through a microphone and sensors, offering assistance based on OpenAI's algorithms. For example, it can automatically remind users of tasks or search for information without a request. However, the market has already faced similar ideas, such as Humane's Ai Pin, which was discontinued in February 2024 due to technical issues. OpenAI believes that their approach, based on the absence of a screen and integration with AI, will avoid such problems. To protect against copying, the project details are kept secret, even partners signing non-disclosure agreements. The success will depend on the balance between OpenAI's technologies and Ive's minimalist design. If the device meets its claims, it may become a new standard for interacting with AI. Otherwise, it may repeat the fate of Ai Pin, which critics called 'an unfinished concept'.

**OpenAI aims to begin shipping AI devices by late-2026, Altman says- WSJ**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman plans to lead the company in shipping an AI device by at least end-2026, targeting sales of 100 million devices, according to the Wall Street Journal. Altman aims to create a new class of devices as integral as a smartphone, and the AI device will reportedly feature no screens, not be a phone, and not be a wearable. Altman said the device will be able to rest in a user's pocket or desk, and will be capable of being fully aware of a user's surroundings and life. The acquisition of Jony Ive's company for $6.5 billion is aimed at helping OpenAI reach consumers directly with its software offerings. Altman claimed that the deal has the potential to add $1 trillion in value to OpenAI. However, OpenAI is burning through cash and does not expect to generate a profit until 2029.

**Apple iPhone design legend Jony Ive joins OpenAI**
Jony Ive, the legendary designer behind Apple's iPhone and MacBook Pro, has joined OpenAI to create devices tailored for using generative artificial intelligence. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, a prototype designed by Ive is 'the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.' Altman noted that AI technology deserves a revolutionary new way to interact with it, saying 'We have like magic intelligence in the cloud... This technology deserves something much better' than typing questions into a laptop. Ive and Altman have been collaborating for two years, and their company, 'io,' is merging with OpenAI, with Ive assuming design and creative responsibilities. 'The products that we're using to deliver and connect us to unimaginable technology, they are decades old,' Ive said. 'So it's just common sense to at least think surely there's something beyond these legacy products.' OpenAI will continue to be run as a nonprofit, abandoning a plan to convert into a for-profit organisation.

**EXCLUSIVE: Christian Group Accuses OpenAI Of 'Brazen' Religious Discrimination**
Holy Sexuality, a Christian organization, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Goodstack, alleging religious discrimination. The group claims that OpenAI denied its application for a nonprofit discount because of its Christian beliefs, violating California law. Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Vice President Ryan Bangert said, 'This is a lawsuit that is purely focused on corporate discrimination against a nonprofit because of its religious character.' Holy Sexuality's founder, Dr. Christopher Yuan, stated, 'Our nation was founded on the principle of the free exercise of religion -- a cornerstone of our democracy.' The suit asks a judge to declare that the tech companies violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act and to block OpenAI from enforcing its policy toward religious organizations.

**Two books tell a similar tale about OpenAI. It is worrying**
The story of Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has a Promethean ring to it, similar to the Greek myth of Prometheus stealing fire from the gods. Altman spearheaded the creation of ChatGPT, a revolutionary generative artificial intelligence, but was later sought to be banned by OpenAI's non-profit board. Unlike Prometheus, Altman emerged unscathed. Two new books explore the tensions and mistrust at OpenAI leading up to the launch of ChatGPT and the abortive boardroom coup in November 2023, which attempted to fire Altman. As one might say, the story of Altman's 'great technology' has a price, but unlike Prometheus, he has so far escaped the consequences.

**OpenAI's next big bet: 100 million physical AI 'companions'**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced plans to roll out 100 million AI-powered devices designed to integrate seamlessly into daily life. According to The Wall Street Journal, Altman made the promise to employees in a company-wide meeting, detailing plans for a family of consumer hardware products created in collaboration with Jony Ive. The device, an AI 'companion', will be fully aware of surroundings, unobtrusively embedded, and capable of changing how humans interact with technology. Altman claimed OpenAI could reach 100 million units sold faster than any company in history, with the goal of shipping the first version by the end of 2026. The project aims to fulfill the 'sci-fi dream' of AI, departing from typing, swiping, and screens. The stakes are high, with OpenAI projected to lose $44 billion before turning a profit in 2029, but the logic behind the bet seems strategic as much as ambitious.

**Meet Fidji Simo, the Instacart CEO Tasked With Getting OpenAI to Turn a Profit**
Fidji Simo, the CEO of Instacart, has been appointed as the CEO of Applications at OpenAI, where she will oversee major business functions and help the company become profitable. According to Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, Simo will be the one leading earnings calls when the company goes public. OpenAI has seen significant growth, with a fivefold increase in headcount and a threefold increase in traffic to ChatGPT, but it is also bleeding cash, expecting to lose $44 billion before becoming profitable in 2029. Altman plans to delegate more responsibility and bring in seasoned leadership to helm the company's infrastructure division. The company has faced executive infighting and high-profile departures, including the loss of two key executives who left to start competitors. As Simo said, 'she will need to waste no time' in helping OpenAI become a profitable global business.

**Elon Musk says will spend 'a lot less' on political campaigns**
Elon Musk announced that he will 'do a lot less' in terms of political spending in the future, citing that he doesn't currently see a reason to do so. This comes after he spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support Donald Trump's 2024 presidential election bid. Musk also stated that he has reduced his role as the unofficial head of the administration's 'Department of Government Efficiency,' working there now just one or two days a week. Despite the potential backlash from his political positions, Musk expressed confidence in Tesla's performance, saying the company is 'strong everywhere else' aside from a sales decline in Europe. He also pushed back on the idea that his political positions are affecting sales, stating that the company's market cap has returned to over a trillion dollars. Additionally, Musk discussed his lawsuit against OpenAI, which he co-founded, stating that he is pushing ahead despite the company's recent restructuring and claims of non-profit oversight. Musk expressed anger towards OpenAI for becoming a profit-driven AI giant, saying it was intended to be a nonprofit, open source company.

**OpenAI Abandons Plans for Full Commercialization**
OpenAI has decided to abandon plans to fully transition to a commercial company, despite months of debate and legal challenges, including a lawsuit from Elon Musk. Instead, the company will maintain its non-profit status through a subsidiary and its business direction will be converted to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). As stated by OpenAI, 'We were founded as a non-profit and today we are still governed as one, and that will continue to be the case.' The company initially considered transitioning to a for-profit model to attract more investments, but in 2019, it adopted a 'capped-profit' model, where the commercial direction was controlled by a non-profit foundation. The new attempts at radical reform to a fully commercialized model sparked widespread criticism, including from Elon Musk, one of the company's first investors, who filed a lawsuit, claiming that OpenAI had abandoned its original mission. Musk stated, 'The goal of OpenAI was to make AI technologies accessible to all humanity.' The court rejected his request to stop the transformation, but the case is still ongoing and will be reviewed in 2026. Supporters of Musk include former OpenAI employees, human rights organizations, and Nobel laureates, who sent letters to the general prosecutors requesting to block the company's transformation. Labor unions also joined the protests. It remains unclear how the abandonment of the transition to a fully commercial basis will affect OpenAI's funding, as it was previously reported that the company may lose some of the invested funds without the transformation.

OpenAI has decided to abandon its plans to fully transition into a commercial company, despite months of controversy and legal challenges, including a lawsuit from Elon Musk. Instead, the company will maintain control through its non-profit subsidiary and shift its business direction to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) status. 'OpenAI was founded as a non-profit organization and today it is managed as such,' said Bret Taylor, chairman of the OpenAI board of directors. 'And it will continue to be.' The decision was made after consultations with the attorneys general of California and Delaware. OpenAI was initially created as a non-profit organization, but later considered transitioning to a profit-oriented status to attract more investments. However, in 2019, it adopted a 'capped-profit' model, where the commercial direction was controlled by a non-profit foundation. The new attempts at radical reform to a fully commercialized status sparked widespread criticism, including from Elon Musk, one of the company's early investors, who filed a lawsuit, accusing the company of abandoning its original mission.

**OpenAI says its nonprofit will remain in control of its for-profit business**
OpenAI has announced that its nonprofit will remain in control of its for-profit business, despite initial plans to transition its commercial subsidiary to a for-profit public benefit corporation. The decision comes after a coalition of California nonprofits, foundations, and labor groups raised concerns about how OpenAI's charitable assets would be protected. According to Chief Executive Sam Altman, the nonprofit board will become a 'big shareholder' in the public benefit corporation, giving it resources to support programs that benefit different communities. Altman expressed commitment to OpenAI's nonprofit continuing to control the for-profit business as it does today, stating, 'That will not change.' The announcement provides clarity to the company's original plans, which were outlined in December. Other AI startups, such as Anthropic and xAI, are structured as public benefit corporations.

**OpenAI scraps controversial plan to become for-profit after mounting pressure**
OpenAI has scrapped its plan to become a for-profit company after facing mounting pressure from critics. CEO Sam Altman announced the decision in a blog post, stating that the nonprofit board will remain in control of the company. The decision comes after a lawsuit from Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, who had criticized the plan, saying it would remove important oversight of the company's technology. The revised plan keeps the nonprofit firmly in control of operations, and OpenAI will transition to a Public Benefit Corporation with the same mission. However, the plan may cause uncertainty for OpenAI's financial future, as Japanese conglomerate SoftBank had stipulated that it would reduce its contribution to $20 billion if OpenAI failed to restructure into a fully for-profit entity by the end of 2025.

**OpenAI Board Rejects Elon Musk's Acquisition Proposal**
OpenAI's board of directors has rejected Elon Musk's proposal to buy the company. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, stated that he believes Musk is trying to slow them down, saying, 'I think he's probably just trying to slow us down. Obviously, he's a competitor.' Mark Tobeyoff, Musk's lawyer, responded by saying that he is not surprised by OpenAI's decision, and also disputed OpenAI's claim that the company is not for sale. He stated, 'Of course, they are selling the assets of a non-profit organization (control over a commercial enterprise) for sale. That's what their 'restructuring' is all about - they're just selling it to themselves at a lower price than Musk offered, enriching the board members, Altman, Brockman, and others, rather than the non-profit organization, as in a classic self-dealing deal.' OpenAI announced plans to restructure the company into a socially beneficial corporation at the end of December.

**OpenAI Board Rejects Elon Musk's Acquisition Proposal**
The OpenAI board of directors has unanimously rejected Elon Musk's proposal to buy the company. 'OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt its competition. Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our non-profit organization and its mission to ensure that both strong and weak artificial intelligences benefit humanity,' the company stated. OpenAI is known for creating the popular chatbot ChatGPT, which gained a million users in less than a week after its launch in November 2022. Musk, one of OpenAI's co-founders in 2015, has since severed ties with the company. In August, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI's leadership, seeking a US court order to block the company's attempt to become a commercial organization. The company noted that Musk's lawsuit contradicts his attempts to acquire OpenAI, as previously reported by Reuters.

**OpenAI says its board of directors 'unanimously' rejects Elon Musk's bid | TechCrunch**
OpenAI's board of directors has 'unanimously' rejected billionaire Elon Musk's offer to buy the nonprofit that governs OpenAI, citing concerns that the bid is an attempt to disrupt competition. Bret Taylor, board chair, stated, 'OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition.' The rejection comes after Musk, xAI, and investors offered to buy OpenAI's nonprofit for $97.4 billion. OpenAI is in the process of restructuring to a traditional for-profit company, but Musk is seeking to enjoin the conversion through a lawsuit, which alleges anticompetitive behavior and fraud. Musk's lawyers have stated that he will withdraw his bid if OpenAI's board 'preserve[s] the charity's mission' and halt the conversion.

**Will Elon Musk pull his $97.4 billion offer for OpenAI?**
Elon Musk has offered to withdraw his $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI's nonprofit arm if the company ceases its transition into a for-profit organization. According to a court filing, Musk's team stated, 'If OpenAI, Inc.'s Board is prepared to preserve the charity's mission and stipulate to take the 'for sale' sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid.' Musk has expressed concerns about OpenAI's shift towards a profit-driven model, stating, 'I think the evidence was there in that OpenAI has gotten this far while having at least a sort of dual profit, nonprofit role. What they're trying to do now is completely delete the nonprofit. And that seems really going too far.' Musk believes that OpenAI should rebrand itself as 'maximum profit AI' or 'closed for voracious profit' if it continues to prioritize profit over its original mission. If OpenAI does not adhere to Musk's stipulations, the nonprofit must receive fair compensation for its assets, which could establish a high valuation for the nonprofit and complicate OpenAI's restructuring efforts.

**Elon Musk Withdraws Offer to Acquire OpenAI's Non-Profit Entity**
Elon Musk has stated that he will withdraw his $97.4 billion offer to acquire the non-profit part of OpenAI if the board of directors decides to halt the transition to a for-profit structure. According to a document filed in the Northern California District Court, Musk's offer is 'serious' and the non-profit organization should receive fair compensation for its assets if sold. The document states, 'If the OpenAI board is willing to preserve the organization's mission and stop its conversion, Musk will withdraw the offer.' Musk and a group of investors presented the offer on Monday, seeking to acquire control of the non-profit entity overseeing OpenAI. However, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, and the board of directors rejected the proposal, arguing that the entity is not for sale and the offer does not establish a real value for the organization. OpenAI was founded as a non-profit and adopted a 'limited profit' model in 2019, where the non-profit entity maintains control over the commercial company. Currently, OpenAI is undergoing restructuring to become a public benefit corporation, allowing for greater flexibility in its commercial operations. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has been in a legal dispute with the company since 2024, alleging that its conversion to a for-profit entity violates the organization's original mission. The OpenAI board considers Musk's offer as an attempt to weaken a competitor and contradicts his own arguments in the lawsuit.
