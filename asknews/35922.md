**Daily on Energy, presented by CRES Forum: Legislative text - Washington Examiner**
The House Ways and Means Republicans have released a reconciliation text that aims to cut clean energy tax credits established by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. The proposal would terminate the $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicles, commercial clean vehicle tax credits, and the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit. The bill would also phase out the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits and the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is set to mark up its portion of the budget reconciliation package, which would cancel up to $6.5 billion in unspent funding from the IRA. The Department of Energy is also moving forward with the president's deregulatory agenda by walking back 47 different climate and energy-related regulations. Oil prices surged after the US and China announced a temporary trade agreement to lower tariffs. Chinese battery company CATL plans to raise at least $4 billion to expand overseas. The European Union is asking the Czech Republic to delay signing a nuclear contract with South Korea amid an investigation into foreign subsidies.

**House GOP unveils bill text for slashing Biden energy tax credits**
The House GOP has unveiled a bill that would terminate and modify clean energy and manufacturing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed by Democrats in 2022. The bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, terminate the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit, and block wind energy from the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax. The legislation also subjects the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits to a phase-out period and restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) criticized the bill, saying it would 'jack up prices on American families,' 'kill jobs,' and 'create chaos in the business community.'

**Trump Must Bury Biden's Subsidies for Russian and Chinese Minerals**
The US is heavily reliant on mineral imports from China, which is using its control of supply chains to exert leverage. To break China's hold, the US needs to increase the competitiveness of its mining industry and strengthen incentives for domestic production. However, Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, has failed to achieve its goal due to loopholes that allow foreign-mined minerals to be processed in the US and receive tax credits. This hands subsidies to refiners who import minerals from China and Russia while denying access to US-based mining operations. The author argues that Congress should fix 45X to support American production at every level of the supply chain, close loopholes, and expand eligibility to include domestic mining operations. This would strengthen US competitiveness, take on China, and keep American tax policy focused on supporting domestic investment, jobs, and national security.

**Q2 2025 Fluence Energy Inc Earnings Call**
Fluence Energy Inc's Q2 2025 earnings call highlighted the company's revenue growth, adjusted gross profit margin, and liquidity. Despite the impact of US tariffs on Chinese imports, Fluence remains optimistic about the future of energy storage. The company's backlog remains robust at $4.9 billion, with $1.9 billion scheduled for delivery this fiscal year. Fluence's domestic content strategy, which involves blending US cells with imported cells, is approximately 10% cheaper than using all imported cells from China, even without considering the IRA domestic content bonus. The company's US cell manufacturing facility is operational, enabling the offer of domestically produced batteries, modules, enclosures, communication systems, and inverters. Fluence expects to serve 12 gigawatt hours of annual domestic content volume in the US, assuming 50% of US sales represent domestically produced products. The company's liquidity remains robust, with over $1.1 billion in total cash and committed working capital facilities. Fluence's revised guidance for 2025 reflects current market conditions in the US, with a midpoint of $2.7 billion in revenue and a midpoint of $10 million in adjusted EBITDA. The company remains confident in its long-term prospects and is optimistic about its ability to navigate the current environment and emerge stronger.

**Russia's Finance Minister Sees No Need to Change Exporter Requirements**
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov does not see the need to change the requirements for exporters to sell their foreign exchange earnings. 'We are for stability, including in this matter', Siluanov said at a press conference, responding to a question about whether the requirements for the mandatory sale of foreign exchange earnings by exporters have changed. 'In fact, more foreign exchange earnings are being sold and returned than the existing regulatory norms. Therefore, there is no reason to change anything now', the minister added. The regime of mandatory repatriation and sale of a portion of foreign exchange earnings by major exporters, introduced by presidential decree in 2023, will be extended again, Interfax was told by the press secretary of the head of state, Dmitry Peskov, last week. The last edition of the decree was in effect until the end of April. The requirement for repatriation of foreign exchange earnings 'The mandatory repatriation and sale of a portion of foreign exchange earnings by exporters was introduced in October 2023 for six months, later the decree was extended for a year - until April 30, 2025. The decree itself, as well as subsequent decrees making adjustments to it, are not published: these documents have a 'for official use only' classification due to the closed list of exporting companies. Details of the regime introduced by the decree are regulated by a government resolution. Initially, exporters were required to credit to their accounts in authorized banks no less than 80% of foreign currency received under foreign trade contracts and to sell 90% of this amount on the domestic market. In June 2024, the government announced a reduction of the threshold from 80% to 60%, and in July - to 40%, i.e. exporters are required to sell on the market 36% of foreign exchange earnings. At the same time, an initial condition was in effect, according to which not less than 50% of the funds received (regardless of the currency in which they were received) under each export contract must be realized within 30 days from the date of receipt. In October 2024, this threshold was reduced to 25%. Finally, another change concerns clearing - in December, a government resolution was issued, according to which the clearing commission may grant exporters permits not to credit to authorized banks the currency in the amount necessary for them to fulfill their currency obligations. The Ministry of Finance proposed to extend the decree for another year, clarifying at the same time a number of norms, reported in early March by the deputy head of the department, Alexei Moiseev. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance did not see the need to adjust the basic parameters of the existing regime. Even the current norms are exceeded by exporters, and the trend to strengthen the ruble is not related to the operation of the decree, Moiseev said. According to him, the Central Bank was not in agreement with the extension of the existing regime in the current situation. At the same time, the departments discussed the actualization of the list of exporters subject to the decree, an Interfax source reported: the exclusion of several companies receiving foreign exchange earnings in symbolic amounts and the addition of enterprises with significant export flows. At the same time, the authorities discussed the abolition of the norms of mandatory repatriation and sale of foreign exchange earnings, reported earlier 'Vedomosti' with reference to officials.

**Mexican Government Presents Measures to Strengthen Steel and Textile Industries**
The Mexican government, through the Secretaries of Economy, Energy, and Hacienda and Public Credit, presented measures to strengthen the steel and textile industries, establish prices of reference, and increase the content of national production in projects of investment of the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo emphasized that these measures were discussed with the different productive sectors of the country to strengthen the Plan Mexico, which aims to promote national production and guarantee the well-being of Mexicans. The Secretary of Economy, Marcelo Ebrard Casaubon, explained that in the steel industry, 1,062 mills were canceled and deregistered for inconsistencies and irregularities, and that the goal is to ensure that the steel that enters Mexico meets all the requirements of the law to guarantee a fair trade for national producers. In the textile industry, he recalled that since December 19, 2024, a 35% tariff was imposed on 138 fractions related to clothing and a 15% tariff on 17 textile fractions from countries without a commercial treaty, resulting in a 12% decrease in imports of these products in the first half of 2025. The government also announced the expansion of prices of reference to products such as furniture, lighting fixtures, toys, games, and guitars, as well as the launch of the 'Hecho en México' campaign in June. The Secretary of Energy, Luz Elena González Escobar, stated that by 2030, the goal is to increase the national content of inputs and materials required in CFE investment projects, particularly in three blocks: Generation, increasing to 35% the national content to give way to greater national integration; in Transmission and Distribution, the goal is to reach 50 or 60%. The Secretary of Hacienda and Public Credit, Edgar Amador Zamora, presented the Strategy to promote economic growth and employment, which consists of increasing government purchases by 10%, substituting 10% of manufactured imports, and stimulating internal demand and strengthening national suppliers, which is expected to generate an impact of +0.7 percentage points on the annual growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 700,000 additional jobs per year, sustained growth in vehicle production, and consolidation of the sector as a growth engine and regional integration.

**Energy & Sustainability Washington Update -- May 2025**
The Trump administration has made significant changes to federal energy and environmental policy, including a dramatic reduction in the federal workforce, with over 260,000 employees either dismissed, retired, or voluntarily separated. The administration has also taken steps to reshape the federal permitting landscape, including the use of emergency authorities to accelerate approvals and the addition of high-profile mining projects to the national permitting dashboard. Meanwhile, Congress has continued deliberations around potential reconciliation bills to preserve the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax rates that expire this year. Key to this will be the fate of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, such as the 45E Investment Tax Credit (ITC), the 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC), 45V Hydrogen Credit and the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit. Despite ideological divisions, bipartisan efforts have emerged to preserve incentives critical to domestic industry and job creation. Staff cuts have also been made at key energy agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Department of the Interior (DOI). The administration has framed these changes as necessary efficiency measures, although clean energy advocates, industry coalitions, and public sector stakeholders have raised concerns about diminished institutional capacity and potential delays in project execution.

**Treasury Issues Final Regulations on Technology Neutral Clean Energy Projects**
The US Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have issued final regulations for technology-neutral tax credits for clean energy projects under Sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code. The regulations provide additional rules and guidelines for calculating a facility's greenhouse gas emissions rate and boundaries for performing lifecycle analysis. The technology-neutral production tax credit (45Y PTC) and technology-neutral investment tax credit (48E ITC) will replace many existing credits, and are available for facilities that are placed in service after December 31, 2024. The regulations also clarify the definition of 'hydrogen energy storage property' and provide updates on eligible components and boundaries between storage and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, the regulations introduce the Incremental Production Rule, which allows for additional tax credits after a property is placed in service, and clarify the domestic content bonus credit, energy communities, and prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.

**IRA domestic content bonus uncertain under Trump government – CEA**
A report from Clean Energy Associates (CEA) says that the impact of the new Republican administration on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is uncertain, but potential legislative changes could alter the domestic content guidelines for solar PV projects. Currently, the domestic content bonus offers a 10% bump on top of the IRA's 30% investment and production tax credits if projects meet the minimum 40% threshold for domestic components. However, CEA said that this could change in the future, with the potential for domestic content to become 'required to achieve the base 30% ITC'. The report also noted that the safe harbour method under the domestic content bonus could be eliminated, making it harder for solar projects to qualify for the 30% base credit. CEA said that a repeal of the entire IRA remains unlikely, despite proposals to change the domestic content guidelines.

The US Treasury has released final rules for the 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit, which now includes hydropower, geothermal, and other zero-emissions technologies. The Treasury has also published final rules for the IRA low-income bonus credit program, expanding the list of qualifying technologies and clarifying eligibility requirements. The ITC has made an affirmative determination in its preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty investigations concerning active anode material from China. The ITC has also terminated the Sec. 337 investigation between Shoals and Voltage concerning solar panel connector products. Five solar companies have been added to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity List, including Donghai JA Solar, which was investigated by European solar supply chain experts and found to have ceased production efforts in 2018. The Dept. of the Treasury and IRS have released additional guidance on the IRA's domestic content bonus, giving more weight to American-made solar wafers. A coalition of 17 attorneys general has asked Congress to protect the IRA, highlighting its benefits to states across the political spectrum. The Dept. of Labor has approved national guidelines for Registered Apprenticeship programs for the solar industry, and the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has updated its Energy Storage Solutions program. Massachusetts Sen. James Eldridge and Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis have proposed two new bills to prioritize access to local solar projects and distributed energy resources, and two democratic state legislators in Washington State have introduced the Fair Access to Community Solar Act.

**Maximize Your Section 45X Tax Credit Ahead of Tax Season**
The section 45X tax credit, introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, aims to incentivize domestic clean energy manufacturing by rewarding manufacturers for producing qualifying advanced energy components. The credit is calculated based on specific metrics, such as production volume, electrical capacity, or cost, and is fully transferable, allowing manufacturers to sell unused credits for immediate cash benefits. The program offers full credit benefits through 2029, with a phased reduction beginning in 2030. To claim the credit, manufacturers must meet the IRS's definition of 'substantial transformation,' which requires significant processing of raw materials or components to become a new and distinct product. The credit is also subject to eligibility and domestic manufacturing requirements, including the sale of manufactured products to unrelated third-parties. The IRS has emphasized rigorous oversight of tax credits like section 45X to prevent misuse, and manufacturers should carefully evaluate their processes and maintain meticulous documentation to validate their eligibility.

**Find Regulations for the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit**
The IRS has released final regulations for the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, clarifying key provisions and expanding the definition of 'eligible component'. The credit incentivizes the domestic production and sale of clean energy components, such as solar and wind energy components, between December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2032. The final regulations define 'produced by the taxpayer' as 'substantial transformation' of constituent elements, and expand the definition to recognize primary and secondary production types. They also allow producers of EAMs and ACMs to include direct and indirect material costs in their production costs, and permit the inclusion of extraction costs for raw materials in the United States or a U.S. territory. Manufacturers can specify in the manufacturing agreement which party can claim the credit, and must provide substantiation requirements for direct or indirect materials included as production costs. The regulations clarify that property that otherwise qualifies as an eligible component under Section 45X is eligible only if no part of its Section 45X facility is included in the qualified investment of a Section 48C facility.

The US Treasury has finalized the rules for the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (Section 45V), a key component of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The rules provide a pathway for hydrogen producers to claim a tax credit of up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen, provided they meet certain requirements. The rules require hydrogen producers to obtain and retire Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) that meet the 'three pillars' requirements: incrementality, temporal matching, and deliverability. The rules also provide a pathway for existing nuclear plants to power hydrogen production, exempt hydrogen producers in certain 'Qualifying States' from the incrementality requirement, and extend the deadline for hourly matching of clean power generation to hydrogen production. Additionally, the rules clarify key requirements for determining lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the 45VH2-GREET model. Hydrogen producers can choose to lock in an emissions rate for the 10-year duration of their credit based on the version of the model in effect at the time they start construction. The rules also establish pathways to produce creditable hydrogen from biogas, renewable natural gas (RNG), and fugitive methane. The Trump administration could seek to rescind or modify the rules, but it's still too soon to tell what actions it might take.
