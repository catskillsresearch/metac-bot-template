**The Democratic Party is not dying  --  it's evolving | Blaze Media**
Contrary to popular opinion, the Democratic Party is not dying, but rather evolving. Despite low party approval ratings, Democrats are still winning elections, such as Rep. Abigail Spanberger's (D-Va.) bid for Virginia governor. Spanberger, a liberal Democrat, is running away in her race despite the party's poor national standing. The article argues that voters often treat parties as abstractions, but candidates as individuals, and that Democrats are skilled at presenting themselves in a way that appeals to voters. The author also notes that Democrats have a strong ground game, with support from teachers' unions, public sector workers, and other groups, and that they enjoy bountiful donations from wealthy donors. The article concludes that the Republican National Committee should stop pretending that the Democratic Party is in its death throes and start focusing on winning elections.

**Republicans brace for chaotic primary in competitive Iowa governor's race**
Iowa Republicans are facing a potentially contentious primary in the state's gubernatorial race, with Rep. Randy Feenstra being the first high-profile candidate to jump in. Feenstra has raised $1.1 million in the 24-hour period since launching his exploratory committee and has reserved $294,000 in television ad reservations. State Attorney General Brenna Bird is also considering a run, and could potentially secure an endorsement from President Trump, who has spoken fondly of her. Democrats are thrilled with the idea of a Republican primary, with one national Democratic operative saying it will be 'a very crowded, messy, and expensive Republican primary.' On the Democratic side, Rob Sand is seeking to get a head start, and is seen as a potentially formidable general election opponent.

**6 Democrats want to be Va.'s lieutenant governor. Here's what to know.**
Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary to become the party's nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor. The candidates agree on many issues, including repealing Virginia's right-to-work law, increasing the minimum wage, and protecting abortion access. However, they differ on specific policies, such as their stances on gaming and education. Alex Bastani, a retired economist and lawyer, is running to the left of the other candidates, proposing a slate of pro-worker policies, including raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour and providing free college to all Virginians. State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, a former literature professor and community college administrator, touts her six years of experience in the Senate, where she chairs the Education and Health Committee. Babur B. Lateef, a prominent Northern Virginia eye surgeon, has made opposition to a Northern Virginia casino a prominent issue and calls for eliminating skill games. State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, plays up the fact that he is the only candidate who has been elected to positions in both local and state government. Victor Salgado, a former federal prosecutor, bills himself as a political outsider with the integrity to resist the influence of money in a state with some of the nation's loosest campaign finance laws. Levar Stoney, the former mayor of Richmond, talks often of his underprivileged background and positions himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families and people in need.

**New York Attorney General Letitia James Gets Worst News Of Her Life - She's About To Regret Going After Trump**
New York Attorney General Letitia James may face severe consequences for her actions against President Donald Trump. CNN legal analyst Elie Honig stated that James's legal issues with the Trump administration are a result of her own actions, as she chose to 'weaponize the law' against the president. James sued Trump and won a $500 million verdict, but Honig argues that her theory of liability was 'flimsy' and that she made 'wildly inappropriate' out-of-court statements. Meanwhile, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte has sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Todd Blanche, alleging that James 'falsified records' to secure home loans for a Virginia property she listed as her 'principal residence' in 2023. Pulte also noted that James has 'consistently misrepresented' the number of units in a Brooklyn property she purchased in 2001, and that she inaccurately identified herself and her father as 'husband and wife' in mortgage documents. 'It appears Ms. James' property and mortgage-related misrepresentations may have continued to her recent 2023 Norfolk, VA property purchase in order to secure a lower interest rate and more favorable loan terms,' Pulte wrote. Honig stated, 'James did sue Trump, of course, and won (for the moment). After a circuslike bench trial focused on Trump's habitual overvaluation of his assets in bank loan applications, New York State judge Arthur Engoron found Trump civilly liable for fraud and slammed him with damages amounting to over $500 million, including mounting interest.' However, Honig noted that James's theory of liability was 'so flimsy that it barely concealed her previously acknowledged motivation to stick one to Trump by any means available.'

**Lee Jae-myung's Prosecution for Embezzlement and Abuse of Power Continues**
The prosecution of Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, for embezzlement and abuse of power has been ongoing. In the third pre-trial hearing, Lee's lawyer stated, 'The defendant did not conspire or instruct anyone to commit the crime.' The prosecution argued that the defendant was included in the investigation as a suspect after the police failed to obtain a search warrant in October 2023, and that the defendant's lawyer was distorting the facts. The lawyer for Jeong, the former secretary general, also denied the charges, stating, 'I only received official schedules and attended meetings, but I did not receive any reports related to the charges or take any separate control measures.' The prosecution has argued that the charges are lawful, but the defendant's lawyer has claimed that the prosecution's actions are unlawful and motivated by a desire to prosecute regardless of the defendant's statements. The court has decided to hold an additional pre-trial hearing on July 1, considering the defendant's request and the fact that the defendant's lawyer has denied the charges.

**Eggleston issues endorsement in lieutenant governor's race**
Former lieutenant governor candidate Carl Eggleston has endorsed Levar Stoney in the Democratic primary. Eggleston cited Stoney's executive experience and commitment to serving all Virginians as key reasons for his endorsement. Eggleston, a longtime public servant and small business owner, stated, 'I believe Levar Stoney is that candidate. He understands the challenges our communities face, and he has the leadership skills to bring people together and deliver meaningful progress.' Stoney praised Eggleston, saying, 'Carl Eggleston is a deeply respected leader whose service has helped shape Virginia for the better.' Eggleston's endorsement is significant, given his experience as the first African American to be elected to the Farmville Town Council and his continued influence in civic life across the Commonwealth.

**Battle for District 13 heats up as Democrats aim to unseat Bronx GOP incumbent – Bronx Times**
The 2025 election for Council District 13 in the Bronx is heating up as Democrats aim to unseat Republican incumbent Kristy Marmorato. The district, which has been historically Democratic, flipped red in 2023 when Marmorato narrowly defeated Council Member Marjorie Velázquez. Democrats argue that Marmorato's win was not a mandate for her policies, but rather a rebuke of her predecessor's inconsistency and absence in the community. Six Democratic candidates have emerged in the race, each with deep roots to the district and a message aimed at building trust. They include Aldebol, who has secured endorsements from the Bronx Democratic Party and several major labor groups; Rivera, a former Vice Chair of the Bronx party and current executive director of Servicing Our Youth; and Diaz, a City Island civic volunteer running a grassroots campaign focused on constituent services and government transparency. The candidates are prioritizing community service and reengaging disillusioned voters, with some criticizing the city's handling of the migrant crisis and the decline in trust and credibility of the Democratic leadership. The winner of next month's primary will face Marmorato in the general election this November.

**Virginia's 2025 primary election: A guide on voting and key races to watch**
Early voting for Virginia's June 17 primary elections begins on May 2. The state is holding elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) is seeking to cement his legacy by helping the GOP win, but his close ties to Donald Trump's policies may hinder his efforts. The lieutenant governor's race between Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R) and former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger (D) is a key matchup that could result in Virginia's first female governor. Voters can participate in either party's primary without party registration, but not both. The elections will serve as a trial run for next year's congressional midterms and a referendum on Trump's policies.

**Early voting begins Friday for Virginia Primary**
Early voting for the Virginia primary election starts on Friday, May 2, and runs until June 14. There will be no primary for Governor as Republican Winsome Earl-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger are running unopposed. For Attorney General, Jason Miyares is the only Republican candidate, while Democrats will choose between Jerrauld Jones and Shannon Taylor. In the Lieutenant Governor race, Republican John Reid is the only candidate, but Democrats have six options. According to Professor Karen Hult, 'They want to be sure that they make a strong showing in those races and that's why primary competition is a good way to not only mobilize the party but also draw the rest of people's attention in the same state to the other possibilities than the Republicans who have been getting most of the attention.' Hult emphasizes that local elections matter and so does your vote.

**Virginia races heat up as candidates raise more than $20 million ahead of November**
Candidates for Virginia's statewide offices have raised over $20 million in the first quarter, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Dr. Dave Richards, ABC13's political analyst, said fundraising is significant, but not everything. 'It helps you get your message out, it helps you with commercials and running media and all of that kind of stuff, but really what it is, at this point, is an indicator of support from the party, from party faithful who are willing to put their money where their mouth is and support a candidate,' Richards said. In the race for Attorney General, incumbent Republican Jason Miyares has raised over $1.5 million, while Democrats Jay Jones and Shannon Taylor have raised $931,000 and $534,000, respectively. Richards believes Jones has a slight edge over Taylor, but Miyares has an advantage in the general election due to not having to fundraise for a primary. The Lieutenant Governor's seat is also up for grabs, with nine candidates running, including Republican Pat Herrity and Democrats Levar Stoney, Aaron Rouse, and Babur Lateef. Richards said it's anyone's race at this point.

**Big Bucks, big stakes: Virginia candidates raise over $20 Million as 2025 election season heats up - WTOP News**
Virginia candidates have raised over $20.4 million in the first quarter of 2025, with Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger leading the governor's race with $6.7 million, nearly three times more than her Republican opponent Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears' $3.1 million. In the lieutenant governor's race, 12 contenders reported a combined $2.4 million, with Republican Pat Herrity leading at $540,000. Democrats Levar Stoney and Aaron Rouse are virtually tied at just under $400,000. Fundraising is a key indicator of campaign strength and viability, and the flow of early money offers a roadmap for where parties and donors see the biggest opportunities or threats. Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, noted that Stoney's strong showing is likely helped by a familiar fundraising machine - former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who endorsed Stoney's bid early on. 'McAuliffe's greatest skill as a politician has always been fundraising. And that pipeline will be very useful to the former mayor,' he said. The race for attorney general has also attracted big money early, with incumbent Jason Miyares raising $1.5 million and former Del. Jay Jones following with $931,000. Democrat Shannon Taylor pulled in $534,000.
