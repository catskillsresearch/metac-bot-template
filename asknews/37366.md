**Anheuser-Busch Screwed Over Its Distributors With Its Latest Canned-Cocktail Moves**
Anheuser-Busch (ABI) has made a move that has left its distributors in California feeling screwed over. The company has pulled its NÜTRL vodka seltzer from its independent wholesalers and handed it over to Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits (SGWS). This decision has caused concern among ABI's distributors, who had been seeing growth in sales of NÜTRL, which had posted ~35-percent growth in both dollars and volume in the 52 weeks ending mid-April. ABI's move is seen as a slap in the face, especially considering the company's high-profile flops in the past, such as Bud Light Next and Bud Light Seltzer. As ABI's CEO, Jim Koch, once said, 'Total beverage is a high-stakes game, and beer distributors aren't guaranteed the win.'

**Liang Adjusts Target Prices for Giant and Merida Amidst Market Volatility**
According to a recent report by Liang, despite the impact of tax policies, the stock prices of Giant (9921) and Merida (9914) have declined. However, Liang maintains a positive outlook for the market from 2025 to 2026, but has temporarily lowered its target price due to short-term unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations and weak demand in the Chinese market. The target prices for Giant and Merida have been adjusted to NT$160 and NT$150, respectively. Liang notes that Giant, Merida, and Guimeng (5306) performed better than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with healthy inventory levels. However, the second quarter is expected to see a decline in shipments compared to the first quarter and the same period last year. Liang points out that despite the weak Chinese market, the overall outlook for this year is better than last year, mainly due to the reduced inventory days in the US and European markets, supporting the expected decline in bicycle industry inventory levels. Giant's inventory levels have decreased to around 2-4 months as of the end of the first quarter, while Merida's shipments from Taiwan to the US have recovered year-over-year. In April, sales in the US and most European countries remained healthy. However, the Chinese market is expected to see a decline in sales, with Giant's Chinese inventory levels increasing to around 3 months as of the end of the first quarter, and Merida adopting a conservative strategy to maintain low inventory levels. Liang estimates that Giant and Merida's sales in China will decline by 14% and 51%, respectively, this year. In terms of market share, Liang predicts that Giant and Merida's revenue from China will decrease from around 30% in 2024 to 25-30% in 2025. However, from the second half of 2025, the improvement in the US and European markets is expected to offset the weakness in the Chinese market.

**Anheuser-Busch invests $300M in US manufacturing amid beer optimism**

This move comes as the company sees a recovery in alcohol consumption among older Gen Zers and younger millennials.

Despite a 6.4% decline in volumes in the first quarter of this year, Anheuser-Busch remains confident in its ability to grow beer sales, particularly among adults nearing their 30s. The company is also seeing substantial growth in its nonalcoholic offerings, with revenue of nonalcoholic beer growing 34% in the first quarter of 2025.

**Tequila, mezcal are the only spirits growing in sales, but tariffs would be ‘catastrophic,’ industry group says**
The US spirits industry maintained its market share leadership for a third consecutive year in 2024, despite a 1.1% decline in revenue to $37.2 billion. The Distilled Spirits Council reported that volumes rose 1.1% and that spirits revenues have grown an average 5.1% annually since 2019. Tequila and mezcal were the only spirits category showing sales growth, with revenue climbing 2.9% to $6.7 billion. However, the industry faces challenges, including the threat of tariffs on Mexican spirits and beer, which would be 'catastrophic,' according to DISCUS President and CEO Chris Swonger. Sonat Birnecker Hart, president and founder of KOVAL Distillery, added that tariffs have 'wreaked havoc' on the craft distilling community. Swonger noted that tariffs would add to the pressure on the industry's supply chain, which is already strained by high interest rates and depleted inventory buildups. 'Consumers were contending with some of the highest prices and interest rates in decades, which put a strain on their wallets and forced many to reduce spending on little luxuries like distilled spirits,' Swonger said.

**B.C. booze sales on the rocks: spending drops despite inflation**
British Columbians are spending less money on alcohol, despite inflation. According to the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch (BCLDB), wholesale buyers purchased $3.5 billion worth of alcohol in 2024, down 3.82% from $3.6 billion in 2023. Every category of alcohol wholesales, including beer, wine, spirits, and refreshment, saw a decline in both volume and dollars spent. Wine was the category where sales fell the most, with a 4.85% decline in dollars spent and a 6.68% decline in volume. B.C. Premier David Eby has threatened retaliation if U.S. President Donald Trump invokes tariffs on Canada, which could impact 2025 alcohol wholesales. Eby has suggested that drinkers could substitute Canadian rye for U.S. whiskey or bourbon, despite differences in taste and ingredients.
