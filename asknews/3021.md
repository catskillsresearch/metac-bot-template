**Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy Collision May Not Be Inevitable**
A collision between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, previously considered inevitable, may not be as certain as thought. According to a study published in Nature Astronomy, there is only a 50% chance that the two galaxies will merge in the next 10 billion years. 'It was surprising to discover that the fusion is so uncertain', said Til Sawala, researcher at the University of Helsinki, Finland, and lead author of the study, to Space.com. The researchers created simulations of the Milky Way's movement over the next 10 billion years, using more precise data from the Gaia mission and the Hubble Space Telescope. They also considered the effect of smaller galaxies around our own, which can influence its trajectory due to gravity. The study included the Large Magellanic Cloud, the largest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, which exerts a significant force and may alter the path of our galaxy. The model presented several possible scenarios, with less than 2% of cases resulting in a direct collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda. In most cases, the two galaxies would pass each other first, losing energy until they might merge in the future. However, if they do not approach close enough - less than 500 million light-years - it is possible that they will never merge. 'Foi surpreendente descobrir que a fusão é tão incerta', disse Til Sawala, pesquisador da Universidade de Helsinque, na Finlândia, e autor principal do estudo, ao site Space.com.

**New Study Reduces Probability of Milky Way-Andromeda Collision**
A new study has reduced the probability of a collision between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy from 100% to 2% in the next 5 billion years. Scientists from the universities of Helsinki, Durham, and Toulouse used data from the Hubble and Gaia space telescopes to simulate the evolution of the two galaxies over the next 10 billion years. The study, published in Nature Astronomy, found that in over half of the simulated scenarios, the Milky Way and Andromeda experience at least one close encounter before eventually colliding and merging, but not in the next 5 billion years. Dr. Till Sawala, the lead author, stated, 'Our new conclusions do not imply an error in the previous calculations, but rather that we were able to include more variables in our simulations thanks to the modern data from the space telescopes.'

**Andromeda Galaxy Collision: New Simulations Suggest Collision May Not Occur Until 8-10 Billion Years**
A team of international scientists has used data from the Hubble telescope and the Gaia mission to simulate the collision between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way. The simulations, which took into account the gravitational influence of two other galaxies in the Local Group, found that the probability of a collision in the next 5 billion years is only 2%. The team's results, published in Nature Astronomy, suggest that the collision may not occur until 8-10 billion years from now. The scientists also noted that the inclusion of the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which has a perpendicular orbit to the Milky Way and Andromeda, reduces the likelihood of a collision. The team's findings are a significant update to previous simulations, which had predicted a collision in 4-5 billion years. The Andromeda galaxy's trajectory is still uncertain, but the new simulations provide a more accurate picture of the galaxy's future path.

**Collision between Milky Way and Andromeda: A New Simulation Challenges the Assumption**
A new simulation published in 'Nature Astronomy' challenges a long-held assumption in astronomy: the collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may not be inevitable. For decades, the most widely accepted narrative in astronomy predicted that the two galaxies would collide in about five billion years, giving rise to a new elliptical galaxy called 'Milkomeda'. However, a recent study led by Till Sawala and published in Nature Astronomy has overturned this scenario: including updated data from the Gaia and Hubble telescopes, and taking into account the gravitational influence of galaxies like the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Triangulum (M33), the study found that the probability of collision is only 50% in the next 10 billion years. The study uses an innovative approach: instead of a simple two-body simulation (Milky Way and Andromeda), Sawala and colleagues modeled the evolution of the entire Local Group (LG) with four-body simulations, including M33 and the LMC. The study's key points include: Using 50,000 Monte Carlo simulations, the study explored the possible galactic trajectories. The results show a bifurcated future: The evolution of the future depends on: The study also showed that even using the best estimates available today, it is not possible to determine with certainty the fate of our galaxy. Future versions of the Gaia catalog and new observational campaigns will be crucial for refining the measurements of proper motions, masses, and dark matter distributions. Contrary to what was believed for years, the collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda is not guaranteed. Our galaxy may only merge with the Large Magellanic Cloud, while Andromeda may remain a distant neighbor. Galactic cosmology is still full of surprises.

**The Milky Way Might Not Crash Into The Andromeda Galaxy After All**
Scientists have reevaluated the possibility of a collision between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies, concluding that the chance of a collision is now around 50 percent. Led by astrophysicist Till Sawala, the team used data from the Hubble and Gaia space telescopes and simulations to show that the presence of other galaxies in the Local Group, such as the Triangulum galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud, significantly alter the probability of a collision. Sawala stated, 'We don't find that previous calculations were wrong - quite the contrary, when we start from the same assumptions, we reproduce the earlier results.' However, the team found that the earlier prediction of a collision is only one of several possibilities, and that there is still significant uncertainty about the future evolution and eventual fate of the Milky Way galaxy. Sawala added, 'The main result of our work is that there is still significant uncertainty about the future evolution - and eventual fate - of our galaxy.'

**Astronomers Detect Anomalous Expansion of the Universe**
Astronomers have detected an anomalous expansion of the universe, previously unknown. This discovery highlights the importance of developing new observation technologies and using modern telescopes to study cosmic mysteries. It also shows that even the most bold assumptions can be correct - or require a reevaluation in the future. Astronomers have solved a long-standing puzzle related to the different results of measuring the speed of the universe's expansion - the Hubble constant. For decades, data from the cosmic microwave background and supernovae observations did not match, casting doubts on the standard cosmological model. Now, new data from the Webb telescope has narrowed the gap between these values to a statistical error. Previous measurements from the Hubble telescope showed a value of 72.8 km/s/Mpc, while data from the cosmic microwave background showed 67.4 km/s/Mpc. New observations from the Webb telescope gave a value of 70.4 km/s/Mpc, which is much closer to other results. This means that cosmologists no longer see these discrepancies as a serious threat to the standard model. Researchers say that this does not rule out possible future discoveries that could change our understanding of the universe's evolution. However, for now, all indications point to the universe expanding as predicted by the current theory, which helps to better explain the evolution of galaxies and the structure of the universe. Scientists plan to continue observing to more accurately measure the Hubble constant. They are confident that further data will help to narrow the error and finally confirm the results. 'This discovery emphasizes the importance of developing new observation technologies and using modern telescopes to study cosmic mysteries,' said scientists. 'It also shows that even the most bold assumptions can be correct - or require a reevaluation in the future.'

**New Hubble Constant Measurement from James Webb Space Telescope**
A new analysis by astrophysicist Wendy Freedman and her team at the University of Chicago has combined measurements from the Hubble Telescope with high-resolution data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to determine a new value for the Hubble Constant. The new value of 70.4 km/s per Megaparsec is between the previously measured values from the early and modern universe, and its error margins overlap with both. This means that the tension between the two central measurement methods has been alleviated, and a statistical compromise is now possible. The James Webb Space Telescope's high resolution and sensitivity in the infrared range have enabled more precise measurements of the brightness of individual stars in distant galaxies, even through interstellar dust. According to Freedman, the number of galaxies used for calibrating supernovae has been more than doubled, allowing for a more robust statistical analysis. 'The Standard Model seems to be holding up in light of the new data,' she explains. The results were published in the Astrophysical Journal.

**Ripples in the Standard Model: Marcel S. Pawlowski's Quest for a New Understanding of the Universe**
Marcel S. Pawlowski examines the weaknesses in the standard model of the universe, specifically in the way it describes the behavior of small galaxies. While the ΛCDM model has been successful in simulating the development of the universe, Pawlowski argues that it is not sufficient to explain the observed phenomena. He presents four areas where the model is flawed, including the behavior of dark matter and dark energy. Pawlowski's work is a critical examination of the standard model, and while his alternative theories are not yet well-supported, they may lead to a new understanding of the universe. As Pawlowski notes, 'it is the job of science to test established theories and find inconsistencies that can lead to a new perspective.'

**The Universe Is Becoming More Complex, Cosmological Data Reveals**
Recent research led by Joshua Kim and Mathew Madhavacheril suggests that the universe has become more complex over its 13.8 billion-year history, with subtle discrepancies in how matter is distributed across the cosmos. By cross-referencing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the team found that the universe is less clumpy than predicted by standard models. Madhavacheril explained, 'This research is like a cosmic CT scan, enabling a deeper understanding of how matter has evolved over billions of years.' The findings raise questions about the role of dark energy, the mysterious force driving the universe's accelerating expansion, and may indicate that it influences cosmic structure formation more than previously understood. To refine these findings, scientists plan to utilize next-generation telescopes like the Simons Observatory.

**Scientists Resolve Long-Standing Cosmic Controversy on Universe Expansion**
Scientists from the University of Chicago have solved the long-standing cosmic controversy about the expansion of the universe using the James Webb Telescope. The team of astronomers, led by Wendy Freedman, used new data from the telescope, which has a four times higher resolution than the Hubble telescope, to measure the Hubble constant, a key parameter in the standard model of the universe. They also accounted for cosmic dust and other factors that affect measurements. The new measurements yielded a value of 70.4 km/s/Mpc with an uncertainty of ±3%, which is in good agreement with the data from the cosmic microwave background radiation, 67.4 km/s/Mpc. This result removes the need to radically revise the standard cosmological model. The researchers note that this discovery not only helps to better understand the universe but also facilitates further research on dark matter and dark energy. Next year, the team plans to measure the distances to galaxies in the Coma cluster to further refine the results.

**Hubble Constant Resolved? New Webb Data Show Clear Picture**
Scientists have used data from the James Webb Space Telescope to recalculate the rate at which the universe is expanding. The new measurements suggest that the Hubble constant lies between previous values and could stabilize the cosmological standard model (ΛCDM). Three independent methods and infrared measurements of red giant and carbon stars provided consistent results. This could mean that many previously suspected systematic errors are the main cause of the discrepancy. The Hubble constant is a measure of how fast the universe is expanding, but different methods have yielded different values. Local measurements with supernovae and the Hubble Space Telescope gave values of around 73 km/s/Megaparsec, while early observations with the Planck satellite gave about 67.4 km/s/Megaparsec. The James Webb Telescope has provided new data that suggests the opposing values are converging without the need to adjust the cosmological model. Taylor Hoyt from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory said, 'We really see how helpful the James Webb Space Telescope is for the precise measurement of distances to galaxies.' The study used three independent methods: the Tully-Fisher relation, the Fundamental Plane, and the surface brightness fluctuations. Each method was applied to the same ten galaxies, all with documented type Ia supernovae. The calibration was done using the galaxy NGC 4258, whose distance was determined with extremely high accuracy using water megamasers. The result is a mean value of the Hubble constant of 70.4 km/s/Mpc with an uncertainty of under 3%. This new value lies between the previous extremes and reduces the tensions significantly. Further individual values also show a clear convergence: all three methods agree in the mean on under 1%. Wendy Freedman said, 'These new evidence suggests that our standard model of the universe holds up.' This means that the theory of the ΛCDM model (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) remains viable without the need for new hypotheses about exotic particles or changed gravity.

**Scientists: The universe is constantly expanding, but not as we thought**
Astronomers have solved a long-standing mystery about the expansion of the universe. For the past 10 years, astronomers have been trying to resolve a discrepancy in the measurement of the universe's expansion rate. Depending on the method used, different results were obtained. If the discrepancy existed, the standard cosmological model describing the evolution of the universe would be incorrect. However, scientists have obtained more accurate data and believe that the discrepancy may not exist. The study was published in The Astrophysical Journal, as reported by Phys. The expansion rate of the universe: the discrepancy Astronomers have long known that the universe has been expanding since its inception. The speed of this expansion is called the Hubble constant. It has been measured using the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the light left over from the Big Bang, and the brightness of supernovae and variable stars. If you know the brightness of these objects, you can determine the distance to the galaxies where they are located, and thus measure the speed at which these galaxies are moving away from us. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation showed that the Hubble constant is 67.4 km/s per megaparsec, plus or minus 0.7%. 1 megaparsec is equal to 3.26 million light-years. This means that if two galaxies are 1 megaparsec apart, the expansion of the universe will cause them to appear to be moving away from each other at a speed of 67.4 km/s. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have previously measured the expansion rate of the universe by observing the recession of galaxies containing supernovae or variable stars. As a result, it turned out that the Hubble constant is 72.8 km/s per megaparsec. This created a discrepancy, indicating that we do not fully understand the evolution of the cosmos. The explanation for this discrepancy was that the standard cosmological model of the universe is incorrect, so it needs to be changed. Some scientists also suggested that one or both of the Hubble constant measurements do not take into account some factors that could have affected the measurement. New value of the expansion rate of the universe Astronomers used the Webb Space Telescope to observe supernovae in the local universe and initially determined that the expansion rate of the universe is 69.96 km/s per megaparsec. Further observations showed that the Hubble constant is indeed 70.4 km/s per megaparsec, plus or minus 3%. This significantly reduced the gap in the value of the Hubble constant between the measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation and supernovae. Astronomers say that this confirms that the standard cosmological model of the universe is correct, as both values of the Hubble constant are close to each other within the statistical error. The authors of the study also say that this does not mean that in the future there will not be found something that does not correspond to the current model of the universe, but for now, this has not been found. Astronomers plan to conduct observations of even more galaxies, which will further refine the value of the Hubble constant. Perhaps then, the value of the expansion rate of the universe, obtained by observing the local cosmos, will become even closer to the value of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Visible size of the universe We recall that, according to the standard cosmological model, the universe emerged approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. Due to this, the most distant galaxies that can be seen are currently located at a distance of approximately 45 billion light-years in any direction from Earth. One light-year is the distance that light travels in one Earth year at the speed of light, which is 300,000 km/s. Therefore, a light-year is approximately 9.6 trillion kilometers.

**James Webb Space Telescope Resolves Long-Standing Cosmological Discrepancy**
A long-standing question in cosmology has been the rate at which the universe is expanding. New data from the James Webb Space Telescope has brought clarity to this issue, suggesting that the panic may be premature. The data, combined with the Standard Model of cosmology, has led to a revised estimate of the Hubble constant, which is a key parameter in understanding the universe's expansion. The new value of 70.4 km/s/Mpc (+-3%) is in statistical agreement with the value obtained from the analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation, 67.4 km/s/Mpc (+-0.7%). This resolution has significant implications for our understanding of the universe and its evolution. The Standard Model, while not perfect, appears to be robust, and the discrepancy between the two methods has been largely resolved. The James Webb Space Telescope has played a crucial role in this discovery, allowing for more accurate measurements of the universe's expansion. The team of Wendy Freedman, who led the research, plans to continue observing the universe with the James Webb Space Telescope, with the goal of further refining our understanding of the universe's expansion and the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.

**Anomalies in Dark Matter Density Energy: A Step Beyond the Standard Cosmological Model?**
A group of cosmologists presented detailed results of an analysis of the evolution of dark matter density energy, based on a combination of data from the largest astrophysical projects. The study checks the standard ΛCDM model, which assumes that dark matter does not interact with dark energy, and its density decreases proportionally to the cube of the scale factor of the universe (ρDM(a) = ρDM,0a-3?1+β?). The parameter β in this equation characterizes the deviation from the standard scenario: if β = 0, then the model corresponds to ΛCDM. The researchers used data from the first release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), including measurements of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), distances measured by the Planck satellite (cosmic microwave background, CMB), the rate of expansion of the universe (cosmic chronometers, CC), observations of type Ia supernovae (SNIa, Pantheon catalog), and distortions in the distribution of galaxies (RSD). When combining DESI, CMB, and CC data, the parameter β was close to zero, confirming ΛCDM. However, adding SNIa shifted β to -0.0080, and including RSD to -0.0073, indicating a deviation from the standard model at the 1σ level (low statistical significance, but a repeating trend). To evaluate the reliability of the hypothesis of interaction between dark matter and dark energy, the researchers applied the Akaike criterion (AIC), which takes into account the complexity of the model. The analysis showed: when using DESI, CMB, and CC, the standard ΛCDM is preferred. However, with the addition of SNIa and RSD, the model with interaction becomes statistically more justified. This contradiction indicates dependence on the choice of data - a key problem in modern cosmology. Comparison with previous works revealed ambiguity. For example, studies using data on large-scale structure of the universe (LSS) and DESI BAO demonstrate greater accuracy in estimating β and deviations from ΛCDM. However, discrepancies between results obtained on different SNIa datasets remain unexplained. The authors emphasize that even minor systematic errors in the data can radically change the conclusions. The results of the study pose two questions to cosmologists. Firstly, are the anomalies in β (up to -0.0080) a hint at new physics or an artifact of the analysis? Secondly, how to reconcile the contradictions between different datasets? The researchers emphasize: for answers, a full release of DESI data (expected in 2025) and new observations of large-scale structure are needed. Current results already show that combining DESI BAO, CMB, and LSS allows for more accurate testing of models. 'A deviation of 1σ is not enough to reconsider ΛCDM, but its stability in different combinations of data deserves attention,' the authors note. 'If future experiments confirm the interaction of dark matter and energy, this will be the first step beyond the standard cosmological model.'

**Does the Dual Sheet Model Solve the Dark Energy Puzzle?**
The Dual Sheet Model (DSM) proposes that the universe consists of two spacetime sheets: one we inhabit (Sheet 1, matter-dominated) and a hidden antimatter mirror (Sheet 2). These sheets interact through fields and gravity, offering a dynamic model for dark energy that could resolve cosmological tensions. The DSM predicts a time-varying equation of state w(z) for dark energy, from ~ -0.9 at z = 0 to ~ -1.1 at z = 2, contrasting with ΛCDM's w = -1. The model also suggests that the Hubble parameter H(z) might be intermediate, easing the H_0 tension. The DSM's predictions are testable with cutting-edge cosmological data, offering a window into its validity. The model proposes that ψ_C, a quintessence-like field, influences the cosmic web, potentially leaving imprints on galaxy distributions. Euclid (2024) and LSST will map the cosmic web in unprecedented detail, searching for anomalies in filament alignments or void densities that might reflect ψ_C's dynamics, offering a novel test of the model. The DSM reimagines dark energy as a dynamic force, echoing between two sheets, one expanding, the other perhaps contracting, their interplay shaping the universe's fate. If the DSM is right, dark energy isn't a static backdrop but a living, evolving field, influenced by a hidden antimatter realm. The accelerated expansion we observe might be a duet between sheets, with ψ_C as the conductor, orchestrating a cosmic symphony. This dynamic dark energy could reshape our understanding of the universe's past, present, and future, revealing a deeper connection between the physics of the cosmos and the structures we see in the stars.

**S8 tension: cosmologists can't agree on how clumpy the universe is**
Cosmologists are facing a challenge known as the 'S8 tension' due to a disagreement on the value of Sigma 8 (S8), a measure of the clumpiness of the universe. The S8 value is calculated by studying the distribution of matter in the universe, and different methods have yielded different estimates. A recent survey using the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru Telescope found a value of 0.747 for S8, which is consistent with previous surveys. However, this value does not agree with the higher value predicted by data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The discrepancy is thought to be related to dark matter and dark energy, which make up a significant portion of the universe. The ΛCDM model, which is the standard cosmological model, may need to be modified to account for this discrepancy. The Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to provide more insights into the universe and help resolve the S8 tension. 'The Subaru HSC survey is one of the deepest wide area surveys of the sky,' said Surhud S. More, a co-author of the study. 'We were able to show that any movement of ordinary matter will not be sufficient to explain the smaller value of the clumpiness.'

**A Rotating Universe: A Possible Solution to the Hubble Tension**
A team of international researchers, led by István Szapudi from the University of Hawaii, has proposed a new theory that the universe could be rotating at an extremely slow speed. This finding could help resolve one of the most significant enigmas in modern astronomy, the Hubble tension. 'Perhaps 'Panta Kykloutai' -- everything rotates -- ', Szapudi explained, summarizing the essence of his research, paraphrasing the famous Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who said 'Panta Rhei' - everything flows. The Hubble tension is a persistent discrepancy between two different methods for measuring the rate at which the universe is expanding, known as the Hubble constant. The researchers propose a variant of dark fluid in slow rotation inspired by Gödel's model, which resolves this tension with a slow angular velocity. According to the study, 'the discrepancy between the measurements of the Hubble constant at low and high redshift is the most significant tension within the Lambda-CDM concordance paradigm'. The team developed this innovative mathematical model by initially following the standard rules of cosmology and then adding a minimal rotation component. 'To our surprise, we discovered that our model with rotation resolves the paradox without contradicting current astronomical measurements', Szapudi highlighted. The proposed rotation is close to the maximum theoretical possible, and the model suggests that the universe could complete a rotation every 500 million years, a pace too slow to be easily detected with current technology but sufficient to affect the way space expands over time. The researchers note a consistent pattern: 'All objects within our universe rotate, including planets, stars, solar systems, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Additionally, black holes, spherically symmetric objects with horizons, show almost maximum rotation'. This observation leads to a logical conclusion: 'The idea that everything rotates naturally extends to the entire universe, as suggested by recent claims of anisotropic Hubble expansion in X-ray observations'. This approach has the merit of not contradicting any known physical law and could explain why measurements of the universe's growth do not exactly match. The team notes that 'the average rotation effect has a functional form similar to that of dark photons, one of the promising contenders to resolve the Hubble puzzle'. The proposal of a rotating universe adds a dynamic nuance that could have profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos, including possible connections with theories suggesting that 'the universe is the interior of a black hole'. The next step for the researchers will be to transform this theory into a complete computational model and develop methods to detect evidence of this slow cosmic rotation. Empirical validation of this hypothesis could revolutionize our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe.

**Scientists Suggest Universe May be Rotating, Resolving Hubble Tension**
Researchers from the University of Hawaii at Manoa have proposed an unusual hypothesis: the universe may be slowly rotating, completing one rotation in 500 billion years. Their work offers a solution to one of the most complex puzzles in cosmology - the 'Hubble tension'. This problem is related to the discrepancy between two methods of measuring the speed of the universe's expansion, which give different results. The new assumption of the universe's rotation may resolve this conflict without contradicting existing observations. Traditional cosmological models suggest that the universe expands uniformly in all directions without any rotation. However, two main methods of measuring the speed of this expansion show a discrepancy. The first method analyzes the light from distant supernovae to determine the distances to galaxies and calculate the expansion speed over the last few billion years. The second method studies the cosmic microwave background radiation, remaining from the Big Bang, to estimate the expansion speed in the early universe, about 13 billion years ago. The difference between these values, known as the 'Hubble tension', has puzzled scientists for years. The team developed a mathematical model that initially followed standard cosmological laws but then included a small rotation of the universe. This slight turn proved crucial: it eliminated the discrepancy between the measurements while maintaining compatibility with current observational data. The rotation, according to their calculations, is so slow that it is difficult to detect, but it affects the dynamics of space expansion over time. Scientists now plan to create a full computer simulation and find ways to confirm the hypothesis, for example, by analyzing the distribution of galaxies or other cosmological data. Dr. [researcher's name] said, 'Our work suggests that the universe may be rotating, and this could explain the Hubble tension.'

**DESI Data Reveals Anomalies in Gravity, Challenging Standard Model of the Universe**
The latest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) project, combined with measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation from the Planck satellite and observations of Type Ia supernovae, suggest possible deviations from the standard model of the universe. Researchers have found anomalies in the distribution of galaxies and properties of dark energy, which challenge classical notions of gravity described by Einstein. The key puzzle is the discrepancy in data on the expansion of the universe. On one hand, measurements of the speed of this process based on nearby objects (such as supernovae) give one set of values, while analysis of the Planck CMB data gives another. This discrepancy, known as the 'Hubble tension,' is complemented by a new DESI discovery: the behavior of dark energy, responsible for the acceleration of expansion, does not match the predictions of the ΛCDM model. In particular, a hint of a 'phantom crossing' - a change in the properties of dark energy, previously considered theoretically impossible, has been detected. One possible explanation is modified gravity, where the force of attraction depends not only on mass and distance, but also on interaction with dark energy. Such a connection implies that gravity and matter are subject to more complex rules than in general relativity. To test the hypothesis, researchers used the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE) - a flexible mathematical tool that allows evaluating deviations from the standard model through special parameters. For example, the parameter describing the strength of the connection between gravity and matter, within EFTofDE, was found to be non-zero with a confidence level of 99.7% (3σ) for the era from the present day to the time when the age of the universe was 3 billion years. Early attempts to describe anomalies were limited to simple models, where the connection between gravity and matter was represented as a linear dependence. However, DESI data required more complex equations - including quadratic and even higher-order terms. If the conclusions are confirmed, this will be the first step towards revising the ΛCDM model - the 'gold standard' of cosmology. However, it is crucial to check how modified gravity affected the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures of the universe. Projects like Euclid (mapping dark matter) and new data on weak gravitational lensing will help with this. For now, researchers are cautious, but it is clear that fundamental physics is ready for new challenges.
