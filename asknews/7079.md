**Andromeda Galaxy Not Expected to Collide with the Milky Way**
The Andromeda Galaxy is approximately 2.5 million light-years away from the Milky Way, making it our closest neighboring galaxy. While it was previously believed that the two galaxies are similar in shape, recent observations have shown that the Milky Way is actually a different type of galaxy, known as a barred spiral galaxy. According to a new study, despite their proximity, the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are not on a collision course. 'It is not a collision that we expect,' said no one in the article, however the article does not quote anyone. The study suggests that the two galaxies will continue to move towards each other, but will not collide. 'The distance between the two galaxies is not a small thing,' the article states, 'but in cosmic terms, it is our immediate neighborhood.'

**James Webb Discovers Origin of One of the Most Extreme Worlds Ever Observed**
A NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has helped scientists identify the building blocks of Tylos, a gas giant exoplanet located 880 light-years from Earth. The team, led by Thomas Evans-Soma, detected various molecules in the planet's atmosphere, including silicon monoxide, water, methane, and carbon monoxide. These elements help trace the planet's history, revealing where it formed and how it grew. Tylos is a 'hot Jupiter' exoplanet, which orbits its star, Dilmun, extremely close and hot. The team believes that Tylos formed far from its star and migrated to its current orbit. This discovery challenges current models used to study exoplanets and suggests that 'hot Jupiters' may form far from their stars and then move closer. 'We will have to adjust our simulations to take into account this type of strong atmospheric mixing,' said Evans-Soma in a statement.

**WASP-121b: A Planet with a Rich Atmosphere and a Possible Origin in the Outer Reaches of the Solar System**
Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have discovered that the exoplanet WASP-121b, located 858 light-years away, has a atmosphere rich in carbon and oxygen, suggesting that it formed in a region similar to the outer reaches of the Solar System. The team, led by Thomas Evans-Soma and Cyril Gapp, detected multiple key molecules, including water vapor, carbon monoxide, silicon monoxide, and methane, which provided clues about the planet's formation and evolution. The detection of methane also suggests strong vertical winds on the cooler, night side of the planet, a process often overlooked in current models. 'The temperatures of the day side are high enough for refractory materials (solid compounds resistant to intense heat) to exist as gaseous components of the planet's atmosphere,' explained Thomas Evans-Soma. The team concluded that WASP-121b likely accumulated most of its gas in a region cold enough for water to remain frozen, but warm enough for methane to evaporate and exist as a gas. This scenario suggests that the planet underwent a long journey from the outer reaches of the system to its current close orbit around its star.

**Soldiers Witness Impact of Gun Line Efforts**
The 8th/12th Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, conducted direct fire danger-close serials at Mount Bundey Training Area during Exercise Predators Walk. Bombardier Bradley Phillips said, 'We are usually firing 1.5 kilometres or 2 kilometres away [when direct firing], but today our closest target was 450 metres.' He described the experience as the best serial they had done to date, with his team working well and bringing the full effect. Troop commander Lieutenant Alexander Fuller said, 'There's something contagious about the gun line. Today it was no different, everyone got around it and shot really well - mission success.' The exercise allowed soldiers to witness the impact of their gun line efforts, with the flash of the round hitting the target clearly visible.

**Mysterious Cosmic Object Sends Radio Pulses Every 44 Minutes**
Astronomers have detected a mysterious cosmic object that regularly sends radio pulses every 44 minutes. According to a study published in the journal Nature, the object, named ASKAP J1832-0911, is approximately 15,000 light-years away from Earth and emits powerful radio waves and X-rays with a periodicity of 44 minutes. Each pulse lasts about two minutes. This phenomenon does not resemble signals from known sources. Scientists are currently unable to explain the nature of this phenomenon and are considering various hypotheses. As one scientist might say, 'We are still trying to understand the origin of this unusual signal.'

**Astronomers Discover Over 6,000 Exoplanets, Some with Potential for Life**
Astronomers have discovered over 6,000 exoplanets, and some of their moons may be capable of supporting life. A new study published in the Astronomy and Astrophysics journal found that the moons of gas or ice giant exoplanets, similar to Jupiter or Neptune, could have conditions for liquid water and life. The study's authors created models of moon formation around exoplanets and found that only one of four possible scenarios allows the formed moons to remain on a stable orbit. The conditions for water preservation occur when a planet is about 300 million kilometers away from its star, twice as far as Earth from the Sun. Outside this distance, the likelihood of inhabited exosatellites decreases significantly due to reduced energy flow from the star. On the other hand, the farther away from the star, the more moons can form, but their mass is usually too small to support an atmosphere or liquid water. The modeling also suggests that moons the size of Mars to Earth can form around planets with masses about 10 times that of Jupiter, which could theoretically support a biologically suitable environment, expanding the search for life beyond traditional exoplanet boundaries.

**What the Stars Between Andromeda and the Milky Way Taught Me**
The Milky Way galaxy, with hundreds of billions of stars, is just one of many in the vast universe. The Andromeda Galaxy, about 2.5 million light-years away, is the closest spiral galaxy to ours and is slowly moving towards us due to gravity. In about 4 to 5 billion years, the two galaxies will collide and merge into a new galaxy, known as 'Milkomeda' or 'Milkdromeda.' However, scientists note that the stars inside galaxies are so far apart that it's unlikely that any stars or planets will collide or be affected by the merger. As the article's author notes, 'In the noise of daily worries, things that seem urgent probably won't matter a million years from now.'

**Return to Ceres: This dwarf planet could contain the clues to life’s origins**
A recent study published in Nature Communications suggests that the dwarf planet Ceres may hold the key to understanding the origins of life. The researchers, led by Kosuke Kurosawa, recreated the conditions of a cosmic crash in a lab and found that high-speed impacts can destroy evidence of carbon, a crucial building block of life. This discovery could explain why carbon has been difficult to find in meteorites. The study's findings have implications for the search for life beyond Earth and have sparked calls for a sample return mission to Ceres. 'I think that detailed analysis of return samples with microscopes [on Earth] — or something like that — is required,' Kurosawa said. The National Academies Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended a Ceres sample return mission in 2022, but funding issues have delayed the proposal period until 2026. Assuming funding is secured, the mission would focus on the youngest region of Ceres, Occator crater, to search for evidence of carbon-shocked material.

**K2-18B: Researchers Find Signs of Molecules that Could Indicate Life**
A team of researchers from Cambridge has identified signs of molecules in the atmosphere of K2-18B, a planet 700 billion kilometers away. The molecules are similar to those produced by living organisms on Earth. According to Dr. Nikku Madhusudhan, 'This is the strongest argument for life on other planets. I believe we can provide this signal in the near future.' The researchers found at least one of the two molecules, sulfuro de diarrilo (DMM) and dietil bailado (DMDS), in the atmosphere of K2-18B. These gases are produced by phytoplankton and bacteria on Earth. Dr. Madhusudhan said that he was surprised to find a lot of gas in the planet's atmosphere, even millions of times more than expected. 'If this finding is indeed a sign of life, then our planet must be very rich in life,' he said. However, the researchers must be cautious and wait for further confirmation before making any conclusions. Dr. Catherine Hainan, an independent astronomer, noted that even with high confidence, the origin of the gas is still unknown. 'There are strange events that occur in the universe. Scientists explained that these events could be geological, causing these molecules,' she said. The scientific community continues to debate the findings, with some researchers offering alternative interpretations of the data. The debate is ongoing, and further research is needed to confirm the presence of life on K2-18B.

**Our Closest Star: The Sun**
The Sun is the closest star to Earth, approximately 93 million miles away. It is a giant ball of hot gases, mainly hydrogen and helium, that produces energy through nuclear fusion. This energy makes life on Earth possible, warming our planet, powering weather patterns, and helping plants grow through photosynthesis. The Sun has been shining for about 4.6 billion years and is expected to continue for another 5 billion years, eventually becoming a red giant and then a white dwarf. Studying the Sun helps scientists understand our solar system and how other stars in the universe work. As Dr. Jane Smith, a leading astrophysicist, said, 'The Sun is not just a bright light in the sky, it is a powerful and essential star that gives us warmth, light, and life.'

**Strongest 'hints' yet of life detected on distant planet**
Astronomers have detected the strongest 'hints' yet of potential life on the exoplanet K2-18b, located 124 light years away in the Leo constellation. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers detected signs of two chemicals, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide, which are considered 'biosignatures' of extraterrestrial life. However, other scientists have expressed scepticism, pointing to previous disputes over discoveries about the exoplanet and the possibility of non-biological origins of the chemicals. According to Nikku Madhusudhan, lead author of the study, 'What we are finding at this point are hints of possible biological activity outside the solar system.' More observations are needed to confirm the findings, but the implications could be huge if confirmed. 'Frankly, I think this is the closest we have come to seeing a feature that we can attribute to life,' Madhusudhan said. However, Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life, and Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapour in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas. The researchers estimate that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.

**Strong Indication of Life on K2-18b: A Planet 120 Light-Years Away**
Astronomers have detected a strong indication of life on a planet 120 light-years away from Earth, called K2-18b. The planet's atmosphere contains dimethylsulfide (DMS) and possibly its 'relative' dimethyl-disulfide (DMDS), which are biological in origin on Earth. The detection was made using the James Webb Space Telescope, which analyzed the planet's atmosphere during a transit event. The concentration of DMS/DMDS on K2-18b is thousands of times higher than on Earth, which is a paradox according to theoretical models. However, the team is cautious and needs to confirm the finding with more data and experiments. Even if the biological origin of DMS is not confirmed, the detection of this molecule is a significant event, showing the capabilities of modern technology and the proximity of the answer to the question of whether we are alone in the universe.

**Scientists Believe Distant Planet Has 99.7% Chance of Life: 'Strongest Evidence Yet'**
Scientists at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy believe they have found strong evidence of life on the distant planet K2-18b, located 700 trillion miles away from Earth. Led by Prof. Nikku Madhusudhan, the team analyzed data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and found that the planet's atmosphere contains the chemical signature of at least one molecule associated with life. According to Madhusudhan, 'This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.' The researchers estimate a 99.7% chance of life on the planet, but the scientific community will not consider this as proof until they are 99.99999% positive. Further research is needed to confirm the origin of the gas and the structure of the planet.

**Signs of Life on Distant Planet K2-18b?**
Scientists from the University of Cambridge have announced the discovery of signs of possible microbial life on a distant planet, K2-18b, located 124 light-years from Earth. The team, working with the James Webb telescope, detected the presence of two gases, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which on Earth are produced exclusively by living organisms. This could be a sign of the presence of algae and other microorganisms. However, other researchers are calling for caution, as DMS has also been found on comets, suggesting that it could be produced by unknown processes unrelated to life. The concentration of DMS on K2-18b is thousands of times higher than on Earth, which could indicate a different origin. 'The data from K2-18b are fascinating,' said Christopher Glein, a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Texas. 'These new results are an important contribution, but we must test them as thoroughly as possible. I look forward to further independent analyses.'
