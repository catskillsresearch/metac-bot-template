**UNWTO to Choose New Leader, Five Candidates Vying for Position**
The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) will choose its new leader on Friday, May 31, 2024, in a meeting of its executive council. Five candidates are vying for the position of Secretary-General for the next four years (2026-2029), including Mexican Gloria Guevara. The other candidates are Muhammad Adam (Ghana), Shaikha Al Nowais (United Arab Emirates), Habib Ammar (Tunisia), and Harry Theoharis (Greece). To win, they need at least 18 votes out of 35 members. The new leader will be revalidated in the UNWTO General Assembly in November in Riyadh. Initially, there were six candidates, including the current Secretary-General, Zurab Pololikashvili, who was seeking a third term, but has since withdrawn his candidacy. Spain and 19 other countries are calling for an interim mandate, from June 1 to December 31, which would lead to Pololikashvili's early departure. They accuse him of 'unacceptable violation of impartiality and professional ethics expected of a UN official.' Gloria Guevara, a former Mexican Secretary of Tourism, proposes that UNWTO function as a platform to facilitate access to international resources. Harry Theoharis, a former Greek Minister of Tourism, prioritizes reforming the organization to ensure greater transparency and accountability, with strict supervision and measurable results. Shaikha Al Nowais calls for a 'deep and urgent' governance reform to prevent the organization from becoming 'one that serves the few rather than the many.'

**GOCC heads, top execs ordered to submit courtesy resignations**
President Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr. has ordered the heads and top executives of government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs) to submit courtesy resignations. The Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG) directed non-ex-officio chairpersons, CEOs, and appointive directors/trustees/members of GOCCs' governing boards to submit their resignations to the President through the Office of the Executive Secretary. The affected officers will continue to report for work and perform their duties until further notice. This move comes after Marcos directed the courtesy resignations of Cabinet secretaries to 'recalibrate' his administration after the 2025 national and local elections. The President had lamented that the people are 'tired of politics and they are disappointed with the government.' GOCCs have remitted over P76 billion to the state coffers as of May 15, 2025, with the Finance Department expecting the remittances to exceed P100 billion by the end of the year.

**Coast Guard to Reduce Flag Officer Positions by 25%**
The U.S. Coast Guard has been ordered to reduce the number of admirals by at least 25% by January 1, 2026, as part of its Force Design 2028 initiative. The reduction is aimed at eliminating redundant executive oversight and improving decision-making and service effectiveness. The Coast Guard currently has approximately 45 flag officers, and the positions to be eliminated and the plan to reorganize the flag corps will be announced separately.

According to the announcement, 'As part of Force Design 2028, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has determined that there is redundant executive oversight in our force structure which hinders efficient decision making and Service effectiveness,' said the opening statement of the announcement. 'The Secretary has ordered a reduction of no less than 25% of flag officer positions by 1 January 2026,' it added. 'The positions to be eliminated and the plan to reorganize the flag corps will be announced in separate correspondence,' the announcement said. 'The Secretary also disapproved the Promotion Year (PY) 2025 rear admiral (lower half) (RDML) selection board report after determining that the guidance to that board did not align with this Administration’s policies,' it said. 'The Secretary’s action also supports planning to reorganize the leadership structure,' it added.

**Leadership shakeups at agency tasked with carrying out Trump's mass deportations agenda**
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is undergoing a major staff reorganization, with leadership changes at the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) departments. Kenneth Genalo, the acting director of ERO, is retiring, while Robert Hammer will transition to another leadership role. Marcos Charles will become the new acting head of ERO, and Derek Gordon will take over as acting head of HSI. The changes aim to help ICE achieve President Trump's goal of arresting and deporting 3,000 'criminal illegal aliens' per day, as stated by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. This would be a significant increase from the current average of 656 arrests per day. The administration is pushing for a major funding boost to support immigration enforcement, including funding for the removal of 1 million immigrants annually and the hiring of 10,000 more ICE officers and investigators.

**BHA imposes deadlines for weighing room upgrades**
The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has imposed new deadlines for upgrading weighing room facilities at British racecourses. Racecourses that have committed to complete the required work by December 31, 2026, may face sanctions if they fail to do so, while the remaining 12 racecourses have until December 2027 to comply. Brant Dunshea, the BHA's acting chief executive officer, said, 'Our jockeys are elite athletes and the facilities they use should reflect this.' The Professional Jockeys Association has criticized the BHA's deadlines, saying members will have to use 'sub-standard and discriminatory facilities' for a further two years. The Racecourse Association feels the BHA announcement provides 'clarity' and 'a clear backstop to agree a costed and feasible plan' for tracks continuing work beyond 2026.

**Executive Branch Promulgates Law Allowing 100% Withdrawal of CTS Funds**
The Executive branch has promulgated a law that allows workers to withdraw up to 100% of their Compensación por Tiempo de Servicios (CTS) funds until December 31, 2026. The law modifies the Decreto Legislativo 650, Ley de Compensación por Tiempo de Servicios, and was signed by President Dina Boluarte and President of the Council of Ministers Gustavo Adrianzén.

**48 New Public Institution Heads Appointed Since '12·3 Internal Strife' Incident**
Since the '12·3 internal strife' incident, 48 new public institution heads have been appointed, accounting for 14.0% of all public institution heads. This has raised concerns about the 'albakgi' controversy. According to the Public Institution Management Information Disclosure System (Alrio), 48 public institution heads were appointed from December 3, 2023, to the present. The Ministry of Science and ICT had the most appointments, with 6 institutions. The Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries each appointed 4 people. The Ministry of Employment and Labor and the Ministry of Health and Welfare each appointed 3 people. Among them, 45 people were appointed after the National Assembly passed the impeachment resolution on December 14, 2023. Even during the 'power vacuum period' after the impeachment, public institution heads were appointed one after another. Eight public institution heads were appointed after the Constitutional Court decided to remove former President Yoon Suk-yeol on March 4, 2024. The appointment of public institution heads during this period has raised concerns about the 'albakgi' controversy. 'It is a matter of concern that many of the newly appointed public institution heads lack expertise in their respective fields,' said a source. The Democratic Party of Korea has proposed the 'Term-Alignment Act' to prevent the 'albakgi' controversy, which would limit the term of public institution heads to two years, similar to other executives, and automatically terminate their term three months after the president's term ends.

**PSOE of Cádiz Heads into Provincial Congress with Division**
The PSOE of Cádiz is heading into the provincial congress infected with the virus of division. According to Juan Carlos Ruiz Boix, the party's leader, the mayor of San Roque should have formed an executive committee with 'real integration, not just for show', as was done in December 2021, 'a mistake that cannot be repeated'. Ruiz Boix emphasized that 'if this is to work, there must be representation of all sensitivities in the proportion given by the results.' María Jesús Montero stated that the congress is 'an opportunity to strengthen the socialist project in the province and reactivate the party to face the challenges of the next four years.' The socialists will also discuss and vote on the 276 amendments presented to the draft report by the municipal groups. Ruiz Arana urged Ruiz Boix to form an executive committee with 'real integration, not just for show'. Cornejo emphasized that 'we start this path with our sights set on the new electoral cycle and with great expectations to return to the Junta in 2026 with María Jesús Montero, as well as to defend the social policies of the Government of Spain.' 'It is a task that we assume with enthusiasm and responsibility under the leadership of Pedro Sánchez, María Jesús Montero in Andalusia, and Juan Carlos Ruiz Boix in the province, so that Cádiz can once again be a reference for progressive left-wing policies.'

**Trump Expected to Abolish US Department of Education**
According to The Wall Street Journal, US President Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order on March 6, 2025, to abolish the US Department of Education. The order has been prepared since Trump's inauguration, but the current version is still preliminary and may be changed. The order instructs the department's head, Linda McMaughon, to 'take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure' of the department in accordance with the law. McMaughon stated that the President has tasked her with eliminating 'bureaucratic inflation' in the Department of Education. Experts believe that a complete dismantling of the department requires a majority in the Senate, 60 votes. The WSJ notes that a detailed roadmap for the department's closure was outlined in the 'Project 2025' of the 'Heritage' foundation, a conservative project of the Trump administration. The plan includes transferring the management of civil rights in the department to the US Department of Justice and the regulation of student loan portfolios to the US Department of the Treasury. Trump has repeatedly called for the closure of the Department of Education, promising to abolish it during his re-election campaign in December 2024. He believes that the department's activities are excessive and create unnecessary bureaucracy, and that its functions can be performed by state departments. The Department of Education, in particular, monitors the rights of teachers and students, works with vulnerable groups, and distributes federal grants, including programs aimed at helping children from low-income families.

**Republicans Propose Bill to Fast-Track Trump's Efficiency Drive**
The Reorganization Act of 2025 proposes to reauthorize President Trump's ability to submit federal restructuring plans to Congress by Dec. 31, 2026, with a 90-day voting period. The bill would also allow the president to propose abolishing executive departments, reducing the federal workforce, and eliminating 'unnecessary and burdensome' rules and regulations. According to Rep. Lee, 'This legislation allows the president to use his constitutional authority as chief executive to reorganize federal agencies, eliminate weaponization, and right-size the government to better serve the American people.' Rep. Comer added, 'The federal bureaucracy has grown dramatically in size and scope, creating unnecessary red tape. We must cut through the inefficiency and streamline government to improve service delivery and save taxpayers money.' The bill aims to bolster Trump's legal defense against lawsuits seeking to halt his efforts to streamline the government.
