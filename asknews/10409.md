**Britain's 'War Readiness': £15 Billion Investment in Nuclear Programs**
In light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, British Prime Minister Starmer stated that 'the things have changed' and that the 'frontline' is 'here'. To address this, the government plans to invest £15 billion (approximately €18 billion) in programs for producing nuclear warheads, creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country. The British military is expected to be ten times more powerful by 2035, with Starmer emphasizing that being 'prepared to secure peace through strength' is the most effective way to deter countries that directly threaten the UK.

**UK must change approach to defence in an insecure world, Starmer warns**
Sir Keir Starmer has warned that the UK must change its approach to defence in a changing world, which is more unstable and insecure than before. The Labour leader said that the world has changed and the UK needs to be ready, citing a 'new era' of instability on defence and security. The Government has pledged to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, but Starmer refused to guarantee that defence spending would reach 3% of GDP by 2034, calling it an 'ambition'. The strategic defence review will support regions across the UK, with 70% of defence jobs outside of London and the South East. The review will also commit to building up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines, investing £15 billion in the warhead programme, and boosting weapons and equipment stockpiles. However, the Conservatives and Lib Dems have questioned Labour's commitment to funding the promises it was making.

**Russia's Propagandists Call for Nuclear Response to Ukraine's Operation 'Pavutina'**
On June 1, 2025, the SBU conducted a special operation 'Pavutina' targeting enemy territory, hitting several airfields. Russian state media and war correspondents attempted to portray the attack as a threat to nuclear stability. According to the ISW report, the reason for this claim is the targeting of 'Russia's strategic nuclear potential.' The ISW noted that Russia has been using nuclear rhetoric throughout the war to influence the West and limit aid to Ukraine or its ability to develop its own strike capabilities. 'Russia has been trying to use nuclear rhetoric throughout the war to influence the West and limit aid to Ukraine or its ability to develop its own strike capabilities,' said the ISW. Russian propagandists called for the use of nuclear weapons, citing the country's doctrine. 'Propagandists called for the use of nuclear weapons, citing Russia's doctrine,' said the ISW. The ISW also noted that Russia's updated nuclear doctrine, signed by Vladimir Putin in November 2024, does not significantly change the country's stance on nuclear weapons. 'The changes are not significant, and the use of nuclear weapons is unlikely,' said the ISW.

**Russia's Vladimir Putin to order nuclear attack against Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Ukraine after recent drone strikes? Report claims...**
Ukraine's recent drone attack on Russian air bases has raised concerns that President Vladimir Putin may consider using nuclear weapons. Ukraine claimed it destroyed around 40 Russian aircraft, including strategic bombers. Observers believe President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants to put pressure on Moscow ahead of peace talks. However, experts are not hopeful about a ceasefire being agreed upon soon. Putin previously stated that he hoped not to use nuclear weapons, but updated Russia's nuclear policy in November 2024 to allow their use in response to a conventional attack backed by a nuclear-armed country. The United States has blamed Russia for the breakdown of important nuclear agreements, such as the ABM Treaty and the INF Treaty. With tensions rising, the world is watching closely, hoping that diplomacy can prevent further escalation in the conflict.

**Western Media Predicts Devastating War by 2025**
Western media has gathered predictions from four well-known psychics, including Nostradamus and Bulgarian Baba Vanga, who claim that a devastating war will occur by the end of 2025. According to their predictions, the war will be so catastrophic that it will 'destroy' the population and lead to the 'destruction of humanity'. Atoos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian, also known as the 'Living Nostradamus', warned that the world is on the brink of a Third World War, stating that 'it will not be just a war between people, but also between machines, and the worst is yet to come'. Nicholas Aujula, a hypnotherapist from London, agrees that 2025 will be a year of 'lack of compassion' in the world, predicting 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence towards each other - in the name of religion and nationalism'. The article concludes by speculating that Russia's recent actions, including the annexation of Ukraine and the threat of nuclear war, may be a cause for concern, but ultimately, the predictions of the psychics are unclear and may be a form of propaganda.

**UK Plans to Acquire American Fighter Jets for Tactical Nuclear Deterrence**
The UK government is reportedly considering a significant increase in its defense capabilities, which could be the largest upgrade in over three decades. The plan involves purchasing American fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than traditional nuclear warheads. This 'tactical' weapon would allow for a more localized conflict. UK Defense Minister John Gilly stated, 'The world is undoubtedly becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are growing. We are facing real threats of interstate conflict for the first time since the end of the Cold War.' The UK plans to present a strategic defense review on June 2, which recommends considering an expansion of its contribution to NATO's joint nuclear deterrence in Europe. These plans come amid Russia's aggressive policies, with British officials confirming that Moscow is increasing nuclear threats in Europe. The UK government acknowledges that the current situation requires a reevaluation of its defense and deterrence approaches.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. The move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks globally. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and will move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, wrote in The Sun on Sunday, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey, is planning to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War. This move includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. The goal is to increase the resilience of Britain in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The funding will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. Sir Keir Starmer said, 'In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests, is vital.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also set to meet with NATO heads of government in The Hague next month to discuss defence spending targets, with NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte suggesting a high defence spend target of 5%.

**「消えゆく声、つむぐ　～ノーベル平和賞と被爆者～」英語版配信開始！**
In response to the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the Japan Confederation of Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Sufferers Organization (Nihon Hidankyo), a special program was produced by TV Setouchi (TSS) in Hiroshima, which will be broadcast on December 29, 2024. Starting from May 12, 2025, the English version of the program will be available on the TSS Archive Project official website for global distribution. The program will look back on the activities of the Hiroshima Prefectural Nihon Hidankyo, a regional organization of Nihon Hidankyo, and will also cover the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo, Norway. The program will explore the challenges we face in achieving a 'nuclear-weapon-free world' before the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing. 'The impact of the atomic bombing is still felt today,' said a representative of Nihon Hidankyo. 'We hope that this program will raise awareness about the importance of nuclear disarmament and the need for a nuclear-weapon-free world.'

**A Terrifying Scenario: How the World Could End Before 2045**
According to scientific estimates and security studies, several scenarios are possible for the end of human civilization, including deadly pandemics, major climate disasters, economic system collapse, and a more frightening threat: a global nuclear war. If environmental, political, and economic crises continue to escalate over the next two decades, the world may find itself on the brink of collapse. Climate change, resource depletion, armed conflicts, and pandemics could combine to create a fertile ground for a catastrophic event. In this scenario, major powers would lose their ability to control, and the global system would begin to shake and eventually collapse completely, according to the Daily Mail. A nuclear war could spark a chain reaction of automatic responses that cannot be controlled. Imagine a massive cloud of smoke blocking the sun and engulfing the planet in a dark, lasting environmental disaster. A nuclear winter: an era of artificial ice. If a nuclear war were to occur, scientific estimates suggest that global temperatures could drop catastrophically, plunging the world into a nuclear winter, where agriculture would collapse, supply chains would stop, and food security, which relies on billions of people, would disappear. In such a situation, famine and extreme cold would be common enemies for those who remain alive. On the other hand, with the breakdown of global trade chains and production, the international economy could collapse completely, with banks closing, currencies becoming worthless, and communities turning to bartering or controlling resources through force. The global financial system we rely on today could become a distant memory, replaced by a constant struggle for survival. Pandemics and health collapse. In a post-catastrophe world, diseases are expected to spread rapidly, and with the destruction of medical infrastructure and air and water pollution, new diseases will emerge that are difficult to treat. Human survival would depend more on avoiding infection than adapting to economic or political situations. However, even with the bleakness of this scenario, there is still a chance to avoid the catastrophe, where countries can work on signing new agreements to limit nuclear weapons, intensify efforts to combat climate change, and rebuild international trust.

**Why a Nuclear-Free World Remains a Vision**
The world is moving towards a more nuclear-armed world, with nine countries currently possessing nuclear weapons. This number is expected to grow in the coming years. The development of nuclear weapons is a dangerous trend. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) has not been effective in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, as none of the existing nuclear powers have signed it. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has also been ineffective in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, as India, Pakistan, and Israel have not signed it. North Korea has withdrawn from the NPT and has developed nuclear weapons. Iran is also close to developing nuclear weapons. The article suggests that the idea of a nuclear-free world is a vision that may not be achievable. The author, Oliver Thränert, argues that the increasing number of nuclear-armed states will make it more difficult to control the spread of nuclear weapons. He also suggests that the focus on nuclear disarmament may weaken the ability of democracies to resist nuclear-armed autocratic aggressors. The article concludes that a nuclear-free world remains a vision, and the nuclear threats will increase in the coming years.

**Earth Day Tokyo 2025: Focusing on Nuclear Abolition and World Peace**
This year marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Despite the risk of nuclear war, the fact that no nuclear weapons have been used in 80 years is a testament to the efforts of atomic bomb survivors who have shared their experiences with the world. The development and possession of nuclear weapons is now prohibited by the Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty, which was adopted by the United Nations in 2021. In 2024, the Japanese Atomic Bomb Victims Association was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to share the experiences of atomic bomb survivors. In this context, the Earth Day Tokyo 2025 event is focusing on the themes of 'nuclear abolition' and 'world peace'. The event will feature various activities, including an opening ceremony at Yoyogi Park on April 19, where atomic bomb survivor Fumiko Hattori will be honored, and a 'Peace Action' stage where people will come together to pray for world peace.

Hannover's Mayor Belit Onay has called for a nuclear-weapon-free world at a UN conference in New York. According to Onay, 'in a time where international law is being violated by world powers, security guarantees are being dismantled, and a global arms buildup has begun, the risk and threat situation is increasing.' Onay warns that the growing tensions could lead people to believe that nuclear weapons would bring more security. However, he emphasizes that the risk of nuclear deterrence failing one day, with dramatic consequences for life on Earth, is real. Onay believes that the only way to prevent this is through nuclear disarmament with the goal of abolishing nuclear weapons.
