**Is Lucid Group (LCID) the High Growth EV Stock to Invest In?**
The electric vehicle (EV) market is facing challenges despite growth. According to a Cox Automotive report, EV sales in the US rose 11.4% year-over-year in Q1 2025 to around 300,000 units, making up 7.5% of all new vehicle sales. However, a well-known EV brand experienced a 26% decline in sales from its 2023 peak, and future growth is threatened by ongoing tariffs on vehicles and essential commodities. S&P Global Mobility estimates that around 46% of the US auto market is affected by President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported cars, which have been in effect since March 2024. The administration has unveiled a two-year relief plan, allowing automakers to deduct import tariffs on parts up to 3.75% and 2.5% of the suggested retail price of a car.

**Electric Vehicles Gain Market Share in Europe Despite Decline in Traditional Car Sales**
Despite a decline in sales for traditional gasoline and diesel-powered cars, the market share of electric vehicles (EVs) in Europe is increasing. According to recent data, the majority of new cars registered in Europe now use alternative propulsion methods, including hybrids. The dominance of pure combustion engines is broken. However, the cost of EVs is still around 20% higher than comparable combustion engines, which is why many governments offer incentives to encourage their purchase. In some European countries, such as Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Portugal, the market share of EVs is growing rapidly, with over 50% of new cars registered in these countries being electric. These countries offer generous incentives, including tax breaks and subsidies, to encourage the adoption of EVs. In contrast, Tesla, a manufacturer that only produces EVs, has seen a significant decline in sales, with a 37% drop in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. However, the data for the first quarter of 2025 shows that the number of EVs registered in Europe is growing, with a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2024. This growth is particularly pronounced in countries that have previously been slow to adopt EVs, such as Germany and Italy. 'The prospects for EVs in 2025 have brightened,' said a spokesperson for the International Energy Agency. 'The decline in prices due to cheaper batteries and increased competition, as well as the increasing range of EVs, are contributing to this growth.'

**Zapped: Electric vehicle sales nosedive as Republicans take buzzsaw to Biden mandate * WorldNetDaily * by Thomas English, Daily Caller News Foundation**
U.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales declined by 5% in April, marking the third monthly drop since 2021, according to Motor Intelligence data. Tesla's sales fell by nearly 13%, while Rivian's flagship electric pickup and SUV sales were cut in half, prompting the company to lower its 2025 forecast by 5,000 units. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, said, 'The challenge is consumers are more price-sensitive than they typically have been and are looking for lower-price alternatives.' In contrast, sales of traditional gas-powered vehicles rose 10% in April. Dealers reported growing inventories of unsold EVs, reflecting slower consumer uptake following years of high demand. Mickey Anderson, a dealership chain owner, said, 'I think the natural demand is probably half that,' referring to past EV demand artificially inflated by discounts.

**China Leads the Electric Vehicle Market with 10 Million Cars Produced in 2024**
China has maintained its dominance in the electric vehicle market, producing 10 million cars in 2024 alone, with expectations of a significant increase in this number during the current year 2025. This highlights the significant technological progress made by China in this field, despite the technological challenges imposed by the US decisions to ban China from obtaining advanced semiconductor chips, as well as the protectionist measures that coincide with the trade war led by US President Donald Trump. China's production of electric vehicles has led to its dominance of the global market, with a 60% market share, surpassing Europe and the US combined. The Chinese company BYD has led the charge in the electric vehicle industry, with a significant increase in sales, reaching 4.27 million electric and hybrid vehicles. Other Chinese companies, such as Li Auto and Leapmotor, have also seen significant increases in sales. However, some well-known brands, such as Nio and Xpeng, have failed to meet their targets despite a significant increase in demand at the end of the year. A recent report by Bloomberg highlighted that countries that are more open to Chinese companies entering their markets have seen higher rates of adoption of electric vehicles compared to countries that impose strict tariffs. The report also noted that the competition from Chinese companies has forced Western companies to improve their offers and launch more competitive electric vehicle models. The adoption of electric vehicles in emerging markets has begun to surpass that of developed countries, with Thailand now surpassing the US in the percentage of electric vehicle adoption, and Brazil advancing ahead of Japan in this regard.

**US Automotive Market Shows Resilience in First Quarter of 2025**
The US automotive sector has maintained its dynamism in the first quarter of 2025, despite the political issues surrounding the economy. According to the sales figures for new cars from January to April, there is a general growth trend, although with important nuances that need to be analyzed. In the first four months, a total of 5,386,547 units were sold, representing a 5.3% increase compared to the same period last year, when 5,116,523 vehicles were sold. The growth in April was particularly notable, with 1,465,356 new vehicles sold, a 10.0% increase compared to the same month last year. This increase is attributed to a combination of factors, including a growing demand from consumers, who are concerned about potential price increases in the near future and a decrease in inventory levels. The imposition of a 25% tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the US on April 3 has also contributed to the trend. The uncertainty caused by this tariff has led to a surge in sales, with many consumers opting to buy now rather than later. The trend is expected to continue, with the sales of light trucks (including pickups and SUVs) increasing by 15.2% in April and 8.3% in the first four months. In contrast, traditional passenger cars continue to lose ground, with sales falling by 9.7% in April and 6.1% in the first four months. General Motors experienced a notable increase of 19.6%, while Ford grew by 13.3%, thanks in part to its incentive program that extended price discounts to the general public. Stellantis also saw an increase of 3.9% after adopting similar incentives. Tesla, on the other hand, suffered a significant decline of 19.6%, indicating that the brand continues to face a shift in consumer preference both in the US and Europe. Toyota saw an increase of 10.2% in April, driven by its electrified vehicles, while Lexus achieved its best April sales ever. Honda also had a strong month, with an increase of 18.1%, supported by the good sales of its electrified models and the Acura brand, which also set a record for April. Nissan reported a slight decline of 2.4%, while Subaru maintained its positive trend for 33 consecutive months with a discreet increase of 0.3%. Mazda celebrated a growth of 21.0%, adding 12 months of increases, and Mitsubishi advanced by 7.5%. Hyundai and Kia continued their winning streak, with increases of 18.5% and 13.8% respectively in April. The strength of their hybrid and electric vehicles remains a fundamental pillar, leading to both companies registering record monthly sales for the seventh consecutive month. Even their luxury brand, Genesis, set a new record for sales in April. Finally, European brands had a mixed performance in April: Volkswagen decreased by 14.2%, Mercedes-Benz grew by a slight 1.2%, BMW stood out with an increase of 16.1%, Audi fell by 3.7%, and Volvo experienced a healthy growth of 22.6%. In general, the US automotive market in the first four months of 2025 shows a notable resilience, although clearly influenced by external factors such as trade policies and consumer response to these.

**US Electric Vehicle Sales See 10.6% Growth in Q1 2025**
In the US, 294,250 electric vehicles were sold in the first quarter of 2025, a 10.6% increase from the same period in 2024. According to the Kelley Blue Book EV Sales Report, pure electric vehicles accounted for 7.5% of total sales in the US, up from 7% in the same period last year. The report notes that General Motors is driving electric vehicle growth, while Tesla's sales are declining. The authors of the report highlight that the latest numbers show uneven growth, with new models from Acura, Audi, Chevrolet, Honda, and Porsche contributing to higher sales, while established products are experiencing a decline. The report also notes that the market is becoming increasingly competitive, with more options available to customers. Looking ahead to the rest of 2025, the authors predict that the electric vehicle market in the US will be uncertain, despite the introduction of new products and incentives. They cite the potential impact of new auto tariffs, which could be a significant challenge for many automakers, as well as the ongoing trade war with China, which is a major supplier of battery materials for electric vehicles. Additionally, the report notes that there are speculations that the new government may reverse the electric vehicle incentives introduced during the Biden era.

**US grids must harness electric vehicle growth to tackle load risks**
The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) in the US is expected to significantly impact the country's electricity demand, with estimates suggesting that EVs will add between 100 and 185 terawatt-hours (TWh) to US electricity demand by 2030. Experts predict that EV adoption will be driven by manufacturers introducing more affordable EVs to the public, with EVs expected to make up 30% of all US light-duty vehicle sales by 2030 and 60% by 2040. To mitigate the strain on the grid, grid operators are exploring new grid management measures, including managed and flexible EV charging, which can reduce the strain on the grid and improve grid reliability. According to Jaron Weston, manager of the California Energy Commission's Zero Emission Vehicle Acceleration Branch, 'Through vehicle-to-grid integration, electric vehicles represent substantially more potential for grid benefits than any other distributed resource.'

**Despite everything, US EV sales are up 28% this year**
Despite announcements from automakers planning for more gasoline and hybrid cars, global EV sales are up 30% this year, with the US seeing a 28% increase. Analysts at Rho Motion attribute the growth to American drivers taking advantage of the final months of IRA tax breaks before they are expected to be pulled later this year. Charles Lester, Rho Motion data manager, said, 'American drivers bought 30 percent more electric vehicles than they had by this time last year, making use of the final months of IRA tax breaks before the incentives are expected to be pulled later this year.' The European Union saw a 29% growth, while Germany and the UK saw a 40% increase. China led the way with a 35% growth, and a 73% increase year over year due to the lunar new year falling in 2025.

**Every Fourth Car Sold in the US in 2025 Will Be Electric, Predicts Cox Automotive**
According to Cox Automotive analysts, 2025 will be the strongest year for the automotive industry since the pandemic, with every fourth car sold in the US being electric. This prediction is based on a study of 2557 car buyers and 526 dealers in the US. The study found that, excluding Stellantis and Tesla, almost all car manufacturers reported an increase in sales in 2024, with General Motors, Honda, and Mazda showing significant growth. The number of people considering buying a used electric car has also increased, from 62% in 2021 to 77% in 2024. Electric vehicles made up 7.5% of the market in 2024, but are expected to reach 10% in 2025. Meanwhile, sales of internal combustion engine cars are expected to decline to a record low of 75%, with 15% of the market going to pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In 2025, 15 new electric car models are expected to be released, and most buyers will try to purchase them before the new US administration's tax credit of $7500 is reduced. While the lack of charging infrastructure is currently a major obstacle to the development of the electric car market, 86% of dealers have pledged to continue investing in this area in 2025, which should help alleviate the problem. Additionally, electric cars are expected to become more accessible, with increased availability of credit and a potential decrease in interest rates if the economy stabilizes.

**US New Energy Vehicle Sales Reach 20% of Total Market for First Time**
For the first time, new energy vehicles in the US accounted for 20% of the total sales of new cars and trucks in 2024. This milestone marks significant progress for 'green' vehicles in the US market, although the growth rate is slower than many had expected. According to Motor Intelligence, over 3.2 million new energy vehicles were sold in the US in 2024, including 1.9 million hybrid vehicles and 1.3 million electric vehicles. Meanwhile, traditional gasoline-powered car sales fell below 80% for the first time, dropping to 79.8%, a new low in modern automotive history. In the electric vehicle market, Tesla continues to lead, but its market share has declined slightly. According to Cox Automotive, Tesla's sales declined in 2024, with its market share falling from 55% in 2023 to around 49%. However, Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 remained the best-selling electric vehicles in 2024. The top five electric vehicle manufacturers are Tesla, Hyundai Motor Group (including Kia), General Motors, Ford Motor, and BMW, with market shares of 49%, 9.3%, 8.7%, 7.5%, and 4.1%, respectively. These brands continue to compete fiercely in the market, driving the diversification of the electric vehicle market. The US electric vehicle market is highly competitive, with varying performances from different brands. According to Kelley Blue Book, 24 out of 68 mainstream electric vehicle models tracked by Cox saw year-over-year sales growth, 17 were new launches, and 27 saw sales declines. Looking ahead, Cox Automotive predicts that US electric vehicle sales will reach a new high in 2025, accounting for around 10% of new car sales. If hybrid vehicles are included, it is estimated that one in four new cars sold will be a new energy vehicle. However, analysis suggests that potential policy changes from the Trump administration could impact new energy vehicle sales. Currently, consumers who purchase electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles can enjoy a federal tax credit of up to $7,500. However, Trump may cancel this subsidy and other support policies for electric vehicles.

**EV World: Charting electric vehicle popularity**
Canada is bucking the trend of declining electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with 16.5% of new vehicle sales being zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in the third quarter of 2024. This is up from 13.4% in the second quarter and 12.5% at the start of the year. Experts attribute this growth to Canada's more favorable policies and incentives for EVs, as well as a more pragmatic approach to adoption. In contrast, the US has seen stalling EV buying rates, with only 10% of new vehicle sales being ZEVs. S&P Global Mobility expects ZEVs to account for 15.2% of light-duty vehicle sales in 2024, reaching nearly 267,000 units. However, the real test will be in 2025, when incentives are reduced in provinces like Quebec and BC. If Canada can continue to grow its percentage of new vehicles that are ZEV, it will indicate that the maturation of the electric vehicle has come to a point where it can support itself.
