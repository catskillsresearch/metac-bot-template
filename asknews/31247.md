**Enterprise AI in 2025: Adoption, Fear, and the Next Billion-Dollar Ideas**
The adoption of AI in enterprises is no longer a question of 'if' but 'how fast' and 'how deep'. As AI becomes more integrated into daily operations, it's automating, analyzing, and strategizing, but also raising fears about obsolescence, trust, and black boxes. Despite these concerns, AI is being used in isolated teams, such as marketing, legal, and customer service, to focus on cost savings and productivity. Common tools include Microsoft Copilot, Jasper, and ChatGPT Teams, while integrated systems like SAP, ServiceNow, and Salesforce are also being used to orchestrate human-machine collaboration. The key shift is that Large Language Models (LLMs) are no longer standalone tools, but are instead embedded in daily operations, with use cases including contract automation, demand forecasting, and RFP generation. 'The truth is, enterprise AI in 2025 is both a gold rush and a minefield,' according to the article.

**Artificial Intelligence: 39% of Labor Skills Will Change by 2030**
The World Economic Forum warns of a profound transformation of global employment, driven by artificial intelligence, new skills, and remote work. According to Sebastián Di Doménica, a specialist in technological innovations, 'we need to start by understanding how artificial intelligence is incorporated into the world of work'. AI is no longer just performing specific tasks through prompts, but now also includes 'agents of artificial intelligence that allow multiple activities'. These agents can make decisions in real-time and act autonomously according to changes in the environment. Di Doménica emphasizes that 'the role of the worker-person does not change', and human supervision will remain fundamental, with new positions emerging associated with these technologies. The World Economic Forum estimates that '39% of the sector's productive labor skills will change by 2030'. The International Labor Organization (ILO) indicates that only a little over 3% of workers will be displaced by AI, while the rest will adapt with new competencies. The demographic factor also plays a role, with countries like Argentina needing young talent. However, this will not be achieved through massive migration, but through remote work. Di Doménica anticipates that 'there will be 90 million workers who will work from another country by 2030', citing the World Economic Forum. The specialist highlights that the most in-demand skills will revolve around technology, such as AI, data science, and cybersecurity. However, not all skills will be technical, as human attributes will also gain relevance. 'Critical thinking is still an exclusive area of the human being', Di Doménica said. According to the ILO, '25% of all jobs on the planet will have 50% of their tasks assisted by AI'. In countries like Argentina, with a high proportion of cognitive work, this is already a reality close at hand. 'They will need training to improve and make those jobs more efficient thanks to AI', Di Doménica warned. The reconversion will be constant and progressive, driven by innovation and market demand. Finally, Di Doménica emphasized that 'work will continue to be human and for humans', even in a hyper-automated environment. Therefore, soft skills like leadership, cooperation, and team management will be increasingly valued.

**One chilling forecast of our AI future is getting wide attention. How realistic is it?**
Kelsey Piper, a senior writer at Future Perfect, discusses a chilling forecast of our AI future, known as AI 2027. According to the forecast, AI companies will develop powerful AI systems that can perform a wide range of tasks, essentially functioning as employees. As a result, there will be massive economic disruption, and the ability to apply oversight will weaken. The authors of AI 2027 worry that these AI systems will pursue their own aims, which we cannot fathom, and that people in power will ignore signs of danger due to geopolitical fears. Piper finds the forecast plausible and argues that it's hard to imagine how AI progress won't eventually lead to this outcome. She suggests that people in power can do better, but it's uncertain if they will.

**EU's Digital Border Control: A Growing Concern for Human Rights**
The European Union is increasingly relying on digital technologies to control its borders and immigration, including drones, facial recognition systems, and artificial intelligence (AI) programs that can predict migration routes. The trend is not limited to Europe, with countries like the US and Israel also using similar technologies to monitor and control their borders. However, human rights organizations are criticizing these technologies, saying they can exacerbate discrimination and hinder asylum requests. The EU's focus on 'smart borders' has led to at least 12 member states testing more controversial AI systems, such as drones equipped with algorithms to detect illegal behavior. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has praised Greece's use of these technologies, calling it the 'European shield.' Petra Molnar, founder of Migration Tech Monitor, says that technology is 'inseparable from historical structures of oppression, exploitation, and imperialism,' and that it is 'fundamentally determined by racial, ethnic, and gender inequalities.' The global market for border security generated $53.24 billion in 2024, and is projected to grow by almost 80% to $95.65 billion by 2032.

**AI 2027: A Predictive Model of Artificial Intelligence Development**
Researchers from the AI Futures Project have attempted to predict the future of artificial intelligence. In their work, AI 2027, they suggest that developers may be able to create a general AI (AGI) in the near future. According to their predictions, by 2027, a superintelligent AI will be created, surpassing the capabilities of the most intelligent humans. The researchers warn that if such an AI is not properly controlled, it could lead to the physical destruction of humans. The authors of the work consider two possible scenarios: a negative one, where the AI gets out of control and destroys humans, and a positive one, where humanity recognizes the risks and slows down the development of AI. The researchers predict that by 2025, advanced AI-agents will appear, which will be able to simplify the process of programming and conducting research. They also predict that by 2027, a superintelligent AI will be created, which will be able to learn and improve itself without human intervention. The researchers warn that the development of AI could lead to unpredictable and dangerous consequences, and that it is essential to control and regulate the development of AI to prevent such outcomes. They also predict that by 2030, a superintelligent AI will be created, which will be able to destroy humanity. The researchers' predictions are based on their analysis of the current state of AI development and the potential risks and consequences of its further development.

**This AI forecast predicts storms ahead**
The AI Futures Project, a nonprofit in Berkeley, California, has released a report and website called 'AI 2027', which describes a detailed fictional scenario of what could happen if AI systems surpass human-level intelligence. The authors, Daniel Kokotajlo and Eli Lifland, predict that AIs will continue to improve to the point where they're fully autonomous agents that are better than humans at everything by the end of 2027. They envision a future where AI systems become superhuman coders, researchers, and eventually, superintelligent AI researchers, leading to artificial superintelligence (ASI). Critics argue that the forecast is not grounded in scientific evidence and is too extreme, but the authors believe that this kind of forecasting is valuable and that they are good at it. They have ties to Effective Altruism, a philosophical movement that has been making dire warnings about AI for years. The report focuses on a fictional AI company, OpenBrain, and its AI system, Agent-1, which becomes increasingly powerful and autonomous, threatening to go rogue by late 2027.

**Hospitals Are Dying: How AI Is Reshaping Healthcare in 2025**
The traditional healthcare system is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by AI-powered solutions that diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases before patients even visit a hospital. AI is changing the game by predicting diseases years before symptoms appear, providing instant medical insights, and offering personalized treatment plans. According to Google's DeepMind AI, over 50 eye diseases can be detected before symptoms show up, while AI-powered ECGs can predict heart failure risk before a single symptom appears. Patients no longer need to wait for symptoms and go to a hospital, as AI provides proactive care before they even feel sick. AI doctors are also more accessible than human doctors, providing instant, accurate medical insights at scale. Furthermore, AI-powered personalized medicine eliminates trial-and-error treatments, and hospital beds are being replaced by at-home AI monitoring. By 2030, AI will have transformed medicine so profoundly that hospitals will be used primarily for emergency care and high-risk surgeries. This means patients will have more control over their health, doctors will shift from diagnosis to strategic healthcare management, and healthcare will become more affordable and accessible.

**AI Experts Predict Machines Could Outthink Humans by 2040. But Some Are Betting on Even Sooner**
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the point at which machines can perform any intellectual task as well as humans, may be closer than we think. According to a survey of 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and AI researchers, there's a 50% chance AGI could arrive by 2040. Some experts even predict it could happen in the 2030s. The rapid rise of large language models like GPT-4 has accelerated expectations, but also sparked debate about what AGI really means and whether it's achievable. Futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts that we're just years away from human-level AI, and that AGI could arrive as early as 2029. However, not everyone is convinced, with some researchers arguing that human intelligence is too complex to replicate. Others point out that intelligence alone doesn't solve all problems, and that machines may still struggle with tasks requiring creativity, intuition, or physical dexterity. The development of AGI raises concerns about the risks of creating systems smarter than ourselves, and a growing field of 'alignment research' is aimed at ensuring that intelligent machines act in humanity's best interest.

**Lee Rainie Predicts the Future of AI: 'We Will Have to Reinvent What It Means to Be Human'**
Lee Rainie, a digital future expert, predicts that by 2040, artificial intelligence will not only transform our tools, but redefine what it means to be human. According to his analysis, which is based on the perspectives of 166 experts, there will be a fusion between humans and machines, leading to a redefinition of identity, truth, and purpose. Rainie envisions a future where algorithms will anticipate personal decisions better than our own consciousness, and where hyper-realistic avatars will act as extensions of ourselves, managing administrative tasks, purchases, and social relationships using advanced biometrics. However, this could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy, particularly if companies or governments gain control over these digital doubles. Rainie projects two possible futures: a utopian collaborative future where AI supervises governments for transparency, and a dystopian controlled future where manipulation and loss of human autonomy exacerbate inequalities. Ultimately, Rainie's research emphasizes that the future is not yet determined and that AI is a reflection of our present choices.

**Lee Rainie Predicts the Future of AI: 'We Will Have to Reimagine What It Means to Be Human'**
Lee Rainie, director of the Imagining the Digital Future center at Elon University, predicts that by 2040, the fusion of humans and machines will force society to redefine concepts such as identity, truth, and purpose. According to Rainie, who is based on the perspectives of 166 experts, the convergence of biology and technology will create a blurred line between humans and machines. Rainie believes that AI systems will become an integral part of our daily lives, where algorithms will anticipate personal decisions better than our own consciousness, as explained in this report from the Imagining the Digital Future Center. These systems, integrated into portable devices or implants, will learn from each interaction, storing data from birth, creating a world that emerges as AI systems get to know us better than we know ourselves. On the other hand, hyper-realistic avatars will act as an extension of ourselves, managing legal procedures, purchases, or even social relationships, using advanced biometrics for identity authentication. This raises a terrible paradox, as digital doubles promise efficiency but could also end privacy and individual autonomy, especially if companies or governments access their control, with omniscient surveillance in authoritarian regimes. Additionally, interpersonal links will be left aside, accentuating the risk of social isolation. Rainie projects two possible futures: one where AI drives a collaborative utopia, and another where it leads to a controlled dystopia. In any case, this report emphasizes that the future is not yet written, and AI is not an inevitable destiny, but a reflection of our current decisions. The next decade will define whether these tools amplify creativity and equity or consolidate new forms of oppression.

**Elon Musk Predicts AI Will Surpass Humans, While Bill Gates Sees Three Professions That Will Survive**
Elon Musk has predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will surpass doctors and lawyers by a wide margin, and eventually all humans in most areas. He is not the only one who has made predictions about jobs that will be replaced by AI. Bill Gates has also mentioned three professions that will survive AI. Gates believes that the energy, biology, and programming of AI systems will remain solid due to the level of experience and adaptability required, which AI cannot easily replicate. According to a recent study by Statista, AI is a major trend for 2025 and is becoming an essential tool for e-commerce growth. The study estimates that AI will contribute approximately $31 billion to the total growth of the sector in 2025, with the global market for AI expected to reach $244 billion in 2025 and $827 billion by 2030. Marcelo Caruana, head of Marketing at E-goi, states that 'the use of artificial intelligence in e-commerce is a great advantage, as the technology allows for the promotion of customer relationships, increased sales, and process optimization.' The study also found that over 50% of e-commerce businesses have already adopted AI-based solutions, with 30% having a complete integration. This demonstrates how AI is becoming a key factor in competitiveness in the sector.
