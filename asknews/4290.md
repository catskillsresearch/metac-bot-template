**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Have You Seen An Aging and Wrinkled Model?**
The article discusses the inevitability of aging and its effects on the human body. It explains that aging is a natural process that occurs due to the shortening of telomeres, the accumulation of senescent cells, and the decline of NAD+ levels. The article also explores the concept of health span, which is the age at which a person is healthy and living a productive life. Scientists are working to slow down or reverse the aging process, and several experiments have shown promising results, such as increasing the lifespan of mice by 30% and improving their physical health. However, the article raises questions about the ethics of increasing human lifespan and whether it would lead to more suffering. The author concludes that aging is still necessary, but the suffering associated with it can be eliminated by managing it correctly and embracing the process of aging. This can be achieved by adopting a healthy lifestyle, finding purpose in life, and staying connected with the community.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**'Eczema treatment left me housebound for years - stopping it made it even worse' - The Mirror**
Karyn Flett, a 54-year-old mum from Scotland, says she has been suffering from eczema for 40 years due to long-term use of topical steroid creams. She claims that the creams have 'ruined' her life, causing her to experience excruciating pain, PTSD, and a loss of her beauty business and job. Flett says she has been bedbound for nearly a year due to topical steroid withdrawal (TSW), a condition where the skin becomes raw, oozing, and cracked after stopping the use of topical steroids. She is now taking a strong immunosuppressant to manage her symptoms, but is concerned that she will experience a relapse once she is tapered off the medication. Flett is calling for more research into TSW, which she believes is a common issue affecting many people. A new study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has found that dermatitis resulting from TSW is distinct from eczema and is caused by an excess of NAD+, a form of vitamin B3. Flett hopes that this study will bring change for those suffering from skin conditions.

**Best NAD Supplements To Support Longevity (2025) | mindbodygreen**
NAD+ is a coenzyme that supports cellular energy, DNA repair, and healthy aging. However, its levels naturally decline as we age. Supplements containing NAD+ precursors, like NMN and NR, have shown promise in boosting NAD+ levels, with emerging research linking them to improved metabolism, cognitive function, and mitochondrial health. The best NAD+ supplements are: Wonderfeel Youngr™ NMN, Life Extension NAD+ Cell Regenerator™ and Resveratrol Elite™, Qualia NAD+, Wonderfeel NMN Capsules™, and Thorne NiaCel® 400. These supplements have been clinically shown to boost NAD+ levels, with some studies suggesting a 67% increase. It's essential to note that the efficacy of NAD+ supplements depends on the precursor selected, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits of NAD+ supplements beyond trials on healthy individuals. Lifestyle habits like exercise and a nutrient-rich diet can also support longevity. 'NAD itself cannot be swallowed and expected to cross the gut into the blood and get into our cells,' explains Andrew Salzman, M.D. 'That's why we need precursors, like NMN and NR, which use nature's own transport system to get into our cells,' Salzman adds. 'Just to give NMN without protecting against oxidant stress would be only half the story,' Salzman says. 'Our focus at Wonderfeel is on getting mitochondria back to full health. By giving antioxidants, we nurture, we potentiate the efficacy, we augment the effect of NMN.'

**The Anti-Aging Revolution: Taking NAD+ Supplements Mainstream - The Frisky**
NAD+ supplements have been found to be a scientifically sound way to slow down or reverse the effects of aging. NAD+, or Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is a coenzyme that naturally occurs in the human body, playing an essential role in many key cellular functions. As we age, our body's levels of NAD+ naturally decrease, leading to decreased cell functions and making us look and feel older. However, with the help of dietary supplements, individuals can restore their NAD+ levels to a more normal threshold, helping them regain control of their aging process. Cata-kor Seuruk's company is leading the charge in transforming the supplement industry by committing to transparency and honesty in their production and marketing practices, making NAD+ supplements a trustworthy option for those looking to take back control of their aging process.
