**Xi Jinping could save America with a simple ad | Notice**
Matt Robison suggests that Xi Jinping could save America by announcing that China will be the first nation to win a human on Mars within the next ten years. This would spark a new space race and motivate the US to invest in space exploration, potentially leading to a boost in the US economy and a renewed sense of national pride. Robison argues that this kind of competition is exactly what America needs, and that China needs it too. He notes that two-thirds of Americans, including 80% of Republicans, already support the idea of maintaining a technological edge over China in artificial intelligence. Robison concludes that a simple announcement from Xi Jinping could be the kick that America needs to get back on track.

**China's Automotive Market: A War Without Rules**
The Chinese automotive market is becoming increasingly competitive, with a clear divide between companies producing smart EVs and others. The gap between electric and gasoline-powered cars is even larger. As a result, Chinese automakers are entering a period of brutal competition. To stay ahead, companies must offer more than just standard features and develop sophisticated autonomous driving software, such as large language models based on artificial intelligence. Chinese groups are doubling down on these advanced software systems for driver assistance, aiming to dominate the premium market segment, previously dominated by foreign traditional groups. For example, BYD sold 416,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter of 2025, a 39% increase from the previous year, while Tesla sold 337,000 vehicles worldwide in the same period, a significant decrease from the 390,000 expected by analysts and the 387,000 sold in the previous year. Given the internal competition in China, foreign brands will face the challenge of keeping pace with the local market. The share of foreign automakers in China has reached a historic low of 31% in the first two months of 2025, with a loss of one-third of the market since 2020. According to UBS, if this percentage were to drop to 20%, these same companies could find themselves with a surplus of 10 million vehicles and financial difficulties. 'It's a war without rules,' said an analyst, 'and only the strongest will survive.'

**China Accuses US of Violating Geneva Agreement**
China's Ministry of Commerce stated that the US's decision to impose export controls on artificial intelligence chips, ban the sale of software used in chip design to China, and cancel some Chinese students' visas, violates the agreement reached by the two countries' leaders during a phone call on January 17. The statement emphasized that these measures harm China's legitimate rights and interests. It also stated that the US is 'provoking new economic and trade frictions, exacerbating the uncertainty and instability in bilateral relations.' This comes after US President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs on trade partners, including China, on April 2. The trade dispute between the two countries escalated, with the US imposing a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and China imposing a 125% tariff on US goods. However, after negotiations, it was agreed that the US would reduce its tariff on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% and China would reduce its tariff on US goods from 125% to 10%, effective May 14. US President Donald Trump accused China of violating the majority of the agreement reached in Geneva, stating that he would discuss this with Chinese President Xi Jinping and hopes for a resolution.

**The Urgent Need for 'Special Measures' to Secure Future Energy: Strengthening Basic Research**
The recent development of China's 'DeepMind' technology has shocked the world and highlighted the need for a 'special measure' to secure future energy. The author, a non-expert in the field of artificial intelligence, was more shocked by China's rapid technological progress than the development of DeepMind itself. The author witnessed firsthand the massive investment made by the Chinese government in university research during their academic exchange visits to Chinese universities from 2009 to 2014. The prediction that China would surpass us in science and technology has come true earlier than expected. Why are we always surprised by new technologies and rush to follow them? The root cause is the government's lack of awareness of the importance of basic research. Advanced technologies are born from long-term basic research that discovers new phenomena and reveals their principles, which are then applied to technology development. The COVID-19 'messenger RNA' vaccine, gene editing technology, and cancer immunotherapy are all based on basic research such as bacterial or immune system research. This is the value and power of basic research. However, the Korean government has been following a 'catch-up strategy' of applying the results of advanced research from leading countries to achieve short-term results, rather than investing in basic research. The recent audit report by the National Audit Office, which diagnosed the structure of concentrating research and development (R&D) on basic research as a cause of poor performance, and the Ministry of Finance's view that 'why should we support researchers' curiosity with taxpayers' money' are just examples of underestimating basic research. As a result, we are still busy chasing after new technologies. Universities are the core research institutions where creative basic research is conducted, and they are also institutions that educate future talent. The rapid development of China's science and technology is driven by the rapid increase in university researchers and research funding. According to OECD data, China's university research funding reached $757 billion in 2023, and the number of full-time researchers increased to 730,000, a 75-fold increase from 2000. The recent growth rate is even more rapid. In contrast, Korea's research funding and researcher numbers have increased significantly since 2018, but still lag behind Japan's. However, according to the '2024 Science and Technology Indicators' report by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Korea ranked 9th and Japan ranked 13th in the top 10% of cited papers. This is a result of the efforts of Korean researchers. So, what policies should Korea pursue to become a leading country in science and technology? First, investment in artificial intelligence technology and securing a technological gap is important. At the same time, basic research support should be strengthened. High-quality AI data and advanced technologies require creative research to generate competitive content. The source of innovation that transcends all ages is 'excellent talent.' The government should improve the research environment of universities and actively support 'researcher-led creative basic research' to produce excellent future talent. The recent decision by the Basic Research Promotion Council to approve the 'Policy for Qualitative Improvement of Basic Research' is a welcome development, but considering the delay, it is necessary to expand the scope of support every year. The new government should establish a system for increasing research and development budgets and improving their efficiency, and immediately take special measures such as injecting supplementary budgets to allow basic researchers who have been deprived of research opportunities for two years to return to the research field. Securing 'sustainable future growth energy through creative basic research' is the core task that the new government must pursue.

**China rejects US accusations of violating trade agreement**
China 'firmly rejects' US accusations of violating a trade agreement to reduce tariffs between the two countries. The US is waiting for a dialogue between the presidents of the two countries to resolve commercial tensions. US President Trump accused China of not respecting the terms of the agreement reached in Geneva on May 12, but China rejected the version. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that Washington 'made false accusations and accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts.' The agreement allowed for the temporary suspension of commercial tensions, which had raised tariffs on American products to 125% and on Chinese products to 145%. After two days of meetings, the two powers agreed to temporarily reduce their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively. However, Trump accused China of 'totally violating' the agreement. The Chinese ministry stated that Washington 'introduced a series of discriminatory restrictive measures against China,' citing controls on the export of artificial intelligence semiconductors and the revocation of visas for Chinese students in the US. 'We ask the US to reach an agreement with China, correct their wrong actions, and maintain the joint consensus of the Geneva commercial negotiations,' added the ministry. According to the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, the problem may be due to China's delay in granting new export licenses for rare earths and other components necessary for semiconductors and cars. 'The fact that China is retaining some of the products it agreed to provide under our agreement may be due to a failure in the Chinese system or, perhaps, it is international. We will see what happens' after the meeting between Trump and Xi, added Bessent, referring to the rare earths issue.

**China's Integration of Artificial Intelligence and the Arts**
The University of Beijing has launched a project to integrate the academic strength and technological advantages of the humanities and social sciences with the management of information and artificial intelligence in the arts. The project, led by Professor Li Daoxun, aims to create a platform for the analysis and evaluation of knowledge graphs and semantic computing using big data and artificial intelligence. The platform, called CCKS, uses tools such as PyCinemetrics, TransNet V2, and OpenPose to analyze film data, including visual style, color palette, and dialogue. The project has already shown promising results in analyzing classic films and has the potential to be used in the creation of new content and the development of artificial intelligence. Li Daoxun believes that the integration of emerging technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence is necessary to re-examine and build a system of cinematic knowledge. Guo Fan, director of the film series 'The Wandering Earth', also believes that the application of artificial intelligence in film production is significant and has the potential to revolutionize the industry. The article also discusses the development of animation technology, from the early days of hand-drawn animation to the current era of intelligent films. Sun Lijun, vice-president of the Beijing Film Academy, has been a pioneer in the use of computer animation in China and has observed that the introduction of AI in film production has led to a shift from simulated reality to hyperreality and eventually to the 'anti-reality' desired by artists.

**China's AI Education Revolution: A Key to the System**
China is making significant strides in education, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI). According to Education Minister Huai Jinpeng, 'The AI is the key to the system.' The country aims to make AI a mandatory subject from the age of 6, with over 400 universities incorporating it into their curricula and partnering with tech companies. The initiative has three stages: interactive games and practical activities for primary school students, and more in-depth studies for older students. The goal is to prepare younger generations for the technological era. The new AI training plan will be part of a national intelligent education platform, which will provide quality resources and increase accessibility for students. Huai Jinpeng stated, 'The AI is the key to the system.' A White Paper on AI Education is set to be published, outlining the country's strategic plans for AI education. China aims to become a global leader in AI by 2030, as per its National AI Plan (2017).

**US soars ahead in VC funding for GenAI as China struggles - InfotechLead**
The United States has solidified its position as the global leader in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) innovation, with a surge in investments and deal volumes. According to GlobalData's Aurojyoti Bose, the US's mature VC ecosystem, risk-tolerant innovation culture, and conducive regulatory environment have enabled it to nurture high-growth startups and encourage experimentation in cutting-edge sectors. In contrast, China's GenAI growth has been hindered by a tightened regulatory landscape, cautious policy stance towards AI, and a relatively restrained funding environment. While China has made some progress, with 39 deals in 2024 and 14 deals so far in 2025, the numbers highlight a significant gap between the two countries. Analysts warn that China's inability to match the US's pace in the GenAI arms race may lead to sustained technological dominance for the US.

**Is China Building the Future of AI Governance Through Open-Source Modeling?**
China is rapidly advancing in artificial intelligence (AI) through open-source collaboration, led by tech giants such as Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and iFlytek. Models like Alibaba's Qwen 3 series and Baidu's ERNIE series are built on open frameworks that encourage developer contributions and integration across platforms. China's approach leverages state support and open-source infrastructure to accelerate collective progress, allowing these companies to build, iterate, and deploy foundation models at scale while fostering a uniquely domestic AI ecosystem. This progress signals that China is scaling its AI capabilities by bypassing Western supply chains and highlights Beijing's ambition to carve out a unique role in shaping the future of global AI governance. China's strategic shift toward open-source AI development resonates with its guerrilla economic strategy, which aims to find weaknesses in global supply chains, deepen ties with the Global South, and showcase domestic innovation as a better alternative to Western technology. President Xi Jinping stated that AI development 'should not be a game of rich countries,' and China has repeatedly raised the issue of inclusive AI governance at global platforms like the United Nations. China's growing emphasis on open-source AI has enabled it to scale alternatives that are less reliant on Western supply chains and licensing regimes, positioning it as a credible actor in promoting alternative norms and frameworks for global AI governance. However, questions remain about transparency, data integrity, and trust in these models, and the United States' reliance on closed-source AI models may limit its ability to lead global conversations on inclusive and collaborative AI development.

**ChatGPT, China, and the Global Battle for AI Dominance**
China's AI development has been rapidly advancing, with the country surpassing the United States in the sheer volume of AI research publications. Chinese researchers published over 155,000 AI papers in 2022, far more than the U.S. (81,000) or all EU countries combined (101,000). China now accounts for nearly 40% of global AI research publications. However, China's AI sector remains critically dependent on foreign technology in key domains, such as advanced semiconductor chips and equipment required to train and run cutting-edge AI models. The U.S. has increasingly turned to technological sanctions to slow China's progress by cutting off its access to the highest-end AI hardware. The U.S. has progressively tightened export controls to restrict China's access to semiconductors, AI software, and the equipment used to manufacture them. China's leaders view AI as vital to the nation's future and are investing heavily to become a global leader in the field. Grand national strategies back China's ambitions in AI, with the goal of becoming the world leader in AI by 2030. However, the social impacts of AI depend heavily on its application, and authoritarian implementations of AI, such as invasive mass surveillance, raise significant international concerns. The U.S. and other leading tech powers must work closely to develop standard rules and norms that restrict the hostile or dangerous use of advanced technologies, pushing for a governance regime that enshrines principles of human oversight, transparency, and accountability in the cyberspace.

**New AI tool speeds treatment for troubled newborns**
A new AI tool called NeoAI Precision was launched in a hospital in Guangzhou, China to help medical workers screen, diagnose and treat newborns with urgent problems. The AI model, developed by the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center and Digital Health China Technologies Co., uses clinical data from multiple neonatal intensive care units to rapidly assess an infant's condition and recommend timely interventions. According to Zhou Wenhao, president of the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, 'About 5.6 percent of infants are born with defects of varying severity, many of which are not immediately apparent.' The AI model aids in early detection by combining the results of genetics screening, lab tests, imaging and other information. It also identifies rare and complex diseases by drawing on multidisciplinary expertise and analyzing diverse data from NICUs. The model is accessible via mobile phones and computers and offers parents post-discharge education and guidance on infant care. It is expected to be rigorously tested in 50 to 60 hospitals.

**AI in Assisted Reproduction: A 7% Reduction in Conception Time**
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in assisted reproduction has revolutionized the selection of eggs, sperm, and embryos, allowing for a 7% reduction in the time needed to conceive a child, according to a study led by researchers at IVI Valencia. The study, presented at the 11th International Congress IVIRMA, found that applying AI to embryo selection also increases the pregnancy rate by 5% and up to 7% in multiple attempts. 'AI is a reality in assisted reproduction and is giving great results in research and clinical practice,' said Juan Antonio García Velasco, scientific director of the congress and IVIRMA. 'We are talking about distinguishing the spermatozoid with the highest capacity to fertilize the ovocyte and give rise to an embryo, as well as identifying the best quality eggs, which undoubtedly contribute positively to achieving better success rates, reducing time and increasing pregnancy rates.' The AI also shows promising uses in personalizing fertility treatments, providing women with information on the expected number of eggs and the best day to visit the clinic, reducing unnecessary visits. However, beyond AI, the IVIRMA Congress has also presented advances in genetics, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering. Dr. Antonio Capalbo, responsible for genomics at IVIRMA Global Research Alliance, presented a study suggesting that sequencing the complete genome of embryos before implantation could identify not only major chromosomal abnormalities but also subtle variations that may compromise their development and future severe diseases in offspring. 'With current genetic tests (such as trophoblast biopsies), approximately half of the embryos considered normal do not implant in the endometrium, and another 10% end in spontaneous abortion,' Capalbo explained. However, the specialist admitted that more studies are needed to evaluate the impact and how to manage the new genomic information obtained before applying complete genome sequencing of embryos in clinics.

**First Baby Born Using Fully Automated and Digitally Controlled ICSI System**
Conceivable Life Sciences, a biotechnology company, has announced the birth of the first baby conceived using their fully automated and digitally controlled IntraCytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) system. According to an article published in Reproductive Biomedicine Online, the system combines artificial intelligence and robotics to automate over 200 steps necessary for creating embryos for in vitro fertilization (IVF). The workstation automates each of the 23 steps of the standard ICSI procedure. Jacques Cohen, an embryologist at Conceivable, noted that the phases of ICSI can be controlled using artificial intelligence or a remote operator. In this case, the scientists used AI to position the sperm in the injection pipette and direct the microinjection inside the egg. 'The AI system selects the sperm autonomously and immobilizes its central part with precision using a laser ready for injection,' explained Gerardo Mendizabal-Ruiz, chief engineer of the company. The birth reported in the study occurred from a 40-year-old woman who was directed to the treatment with donor eggs at Hope IVF Mexico in Guadalajara, Mexico, after a previous IVF attempt failed, producing only one mature egg and no embryos. In the study cycle, five eggs were assigned to fertilization with automated ICSI and three as controls with standard manual ICSI. The automated system was installed on site, but later remote operators, at the clinic in Guadalajara and in New York, issued commands through a digital interface to perform each of the 23 microinjection steps for each egg, totaling 115 steps. Four of the five eggs injected into the automated system achieved normal fertilization, as did all three in the manual control group. A high-quality embryo that reached the blastocyst stage in culture was generated with the automated system under remote control from New York. When this blastocyst was transferred in a subsequent cycle, a pregnancy was initiated that progressed normally until the birth of a healthy male baby. The treatment was provided under the supervision of the review committee at Hope IVF, a fertility clinic in Guadalajara, as part of a pilot study on various automation processes in the fertility laboratory. As evidence of the interest in using AI in artificial reproduction, Conceivable collected $18 million in a funding round led by Artis Ventures with the participation of several new investors at the beginning of this year. 'It was a great day,' said the woman, 'and I'm grateful for this technology that has given me the opportunity to have a child.'

**He Jiankui's Return to Gene Editing: A Controversial Legacy**
He Jiankui, the Chinese scientist who shocked the world by claiming to have genetically edited three babies using the CRISPR technique to make them resistant to HIV, has returned to the spotlight. Accused of violating research norms, he plans to continue researching genetic diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Despite controversy and ethical concerns, Jiankui defends his legacy and his ambition to lead global gene editing. Jiankui's work could be considered a science fiction experiment. In October 2018, he claimed to have successfully 'genetically edited' three babies, twin sisters Lulu and Nana, and another child, to resist HIV using the CRISPR technique. However, since his announcement in 2018, this man, who was accused by the state news agency Xinhua of 'deliberately violating national research norms', has maintained a low profile until now. In recent interviews, he has said that he will continue his research, despite the lack of transparency in his work. Jiankui has stated that he plans to use discarded human embryos to comply with national and international norms, and that he does not intend to conduct experiments on babies with edited genomes, but rather to cure genetic diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, following his most well-known experiment, it was discovered that Jiankui had falsified documents related to the selection of couples for his CRISPR research. Jiankui has defended his legacy, saying that the results of the genetic sequence analysis of the children show that there were no modifications to the genes, except for medical reasons, demonstrating that gene editing was safe. He also stated that he is proud to have helped families who wanted healthy children. Despite the initial optimism, the supposed advancement of gene editing has been questioned by several international experts. Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute in London, said that it was 'too premature' to try to modify embryos to produce pregnancies. He Jiankui has also been accused of potentially leading to a world of 'designer babies', where parents could choose traits such as race or intelligence for their children. 'We need to find the balance', said Ma Yonghui, a bioethics researcher at Xiamen University. 'We must promote scientific progress and also ensure that this research is carried out in a responsible, ethical, and sustainable manner'. 'There is still a long way to go', he added in a conversation with The Washington Post. Jiankui has been vague about revealing details, and according to an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review, he plans to experiment only with mice, monkeys, and non-viable human embryos. He also stated that he would establish a non-profit laboratory in Beijing and was hired to direct a research institution in genetic medicine at Wuchang Technological University, but had no news about it. In the end, it is a habit of He Jiankui to argue in favor of his personal crusade. 'As humans, we are always conservative. We always worry about new things, and people take time to accept new technologies'. 'I want to be the leader of gene editing worldwide', he published on X in March. Finally, the scientist shared a reflection on the science dedicated to gene editing. 'I would say that in 50 years, in 2074, gene editing of embryos will be as common as in vitro fertilization (IVF) to prevent all genetic diseases we know today. So, the babies born at that time will be free of genetic diseases', he concluded to MIT Technology Review.

**New Hope: First Child Born Using Fully Automated AI-Supported IVF Technique**
A team of scientists has announced the birth of the first child using a fully automated artificial intelligence-supported in vitro fertilization (IVF) technique. This breakthrough represents a significant leap in assisted reproduction, where the research team from Conceivable Life Sciences, a company based in New York and Guadalajara, Mexico, successfully automated the microinjection process. Traditionally, microinjection was performed manually by an embryologist using a needle to inject a single sperm into a mature egg. However, with the new technology, artificial intelligence and advanced robots were used to automate all 23 stages of microinjection, eliminating the need for direct human intervention. The new system developed by the research team not only controls the microinjection process but also uses laser beams to accurately guide the selected sperm to the egg, surpassing human capabilities. Dr. Jack Cohen, one of the scientists involved in the experiment, described automation as a 'game-changer' that can increase the accuracy and efficiency of IVF procedures and ensure consistent results. The experiment was conducted on a woman in her 40s who had previously failed a previous attempt at artificial insemination. In this experiment, five eggs were fertilized using the automated system, compared to three eggs fertilized using the traditional method. The results were impressive, with four of the eggs that underwent automated fertilization developing normally, and one embryo formed through automated microinjection was selected from a distance of 2,300 miles. The embryo was then frozen and later transferred to the womb, resulting in the birth of a healthy and normal child. The scientists say that this experiment represents a beginning of a trial phase, but they expect future improvements to increase the speed of procedures, paving the way for increased application of this technology in the future.

**First Baby Born Using Fully Automated ICSI Procedure**
A biotechnology company, Conceivable Life Sciences, has developed a robotic system that can perform all 23 stages of the intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedure in an automated manner. This approach reduces the risk of human error in such procedures. The system uses artificial intelligence to select the healthiest sperm for fertilization based on their appearance, and then injects them into the egg in a laboratory setting. The company tested the system with a childless couple from Mexico, where the man had low sperm motility and the woman had problems producing eggs, and they used donor eggs. The system successfully fertilized four embryos, and one of them led to a healthy baby boy born at 38 weeks. The procedure took around 10 minutes, with the operator controlling it remotely from 3700 km away. The authors of the study note that this approach does not necessarily produce healthier embryos than traditional ICSI, and more research is needed to confirm the results.

**World's First Baby Born Using AI-Assisted IVF Technology**
The first baby in the world has been born using AI-assisted IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) technology. According to reports, the AI system has replaced the traditional manual process of Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) in IVF, where a sperm is directly injected into an egg. The new process uses AI or remote digital control to complete all 23 steps of the ICSI procedure without human intervention. In a fertility clinic in the US, AI technology was used to select the best embryo, and the AI-selected embryo was then implanted into a woman's uterus, resulting in a successful pregnancy and the birth of a healthy baby. AI has helped in selecting the right embryo, which is a challenging task for doctors. The AI algorithm analyzed microscopic images to select the best embryo, which is a difficult task for any doctor to do by eye. The AI technology has also improved the success rate of IVF by scoring the embryo's growth, cell division speed, and other biological signals. This has made the process easier and more efficient. Experts say that IVF is often a costly and exhausting process, but AI can help make it faster and more accurate, saving time and money.

In an experiment, the system was used to fertilize five out of eight donor eggs, resulting in four embryos. Two of the embryos, selected by the AI, were implanted and one led to a successful pregnancy and birth. However, as noted by Jacques Cohen, founder of the company, further research with a larger number of participants is needed to confirm the effectiveness of the method. This breakthrough has raised hopes for reducing the risk of human errors in IVF procedures.

**China Plans to Introduce Fertility Support Guidelines to Address Declining Birth Rates**
Chinese lawmakers plan to introduce proposals for fertility support guidelines, including promoting sexual and reproductive health education for youth, strengthening the protection of women's fertility, and implementing a six-month paternity leave policy for new fathers and subsidies for working mothers with young children. According to China Youth Daily, topics related to fertility have been 'two sessions' -style attention-grabbers, with such topics trending on China's social media platforms. Zhang Qi, deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC) and doctor at the first hospital of Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, plans to submit a proposal to curb the decline in birth rates. The trend of declining birth rates is partly due to declining fertility rates in women, mainly reflected in the persistently high infertility rate, said Zhang to the Global Times on Sunday, with approximately 240 million people of childbearing age nationwide with an infertility rate of around 15% or about 36-48 million people, who are struggling with infertility. Zhang suggested promoting sexual and reproductive health education for youth, along with government performance evaluations at all levels, while making sex and reproductive health education and marriage and relationship education compulsory courses. Zhang also proposed improving fertility assessment services for older people, identifying potential diseases that can affect fertility, and helping them achieve optimal health before pregnancy through education and lifestyle management. Additionally, Zhang suggested implementing fertility preservation measurements for female cancer patients, including egg, embryo, and ovarian tissue freezing, before undergoing radiation therapy or chemotherapy, as well as strengthening early prevention of cervical cancer, with vaccination included in public health services. Another NPC deputy, Zhang Qiang, suggested a comprehensive system to support fertility support, covering aspects from birth and childcare to education and housing, to address the hesitation of childbearing, which leads to a decrease in the birth rate. Zhang Qiang also proposed assisted reproductive technologies (such as embryo culture), non-invasive prenatal genetic tests, and labor analgesia in health insurance to reduce the financial burden on families and thus reduce the costs associated with childbirth. He demands the strict implementation of parental leave and paternity leave guidelines, with the 'paternity leave' system being piloted in some regions, where men can apply for up to six months of paternity leave to promote shared childcare responsibility, as the effort to address the challenge of a continuously declining birth rate, which is increasingly aging population, with the population of the population, which is currently available to the population, is currently available to the population.
