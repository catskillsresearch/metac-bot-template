**New Covid-19 Variant Detected in US and Asia, Raises Concerns About Transmissibility and Hospitalizations**
A new variant of Covid-19, identified as NB.1.8.1, has been detected in the US and Asia, raising concerns about its higher transmissibility and increased hospitalizations in China and Taiwan. Although its circulation in the US has not led to a significant increase in cases, its growing presence among international travelers is causing concern about a possible wider spread. The variant was detected in passengers from China, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, France, the Netherlands, and Spain between April 22 and May 12. Cases were identified in California, Washington, Virginia, and New York airports through the CDC's monitoring program in collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks. Experts in virology in China have warned that this new variant appears to have a greater ability to bind to human cells, explaining its higher transmissibility compared to previous variants. The FDA has taken note of this situation and officials from the CDC and FDA discussed the possible update of current vaccines, which are primarily directed against the JN.1 variant and its descendants. While in the US, the dominant variant remains LP.8.1, a descendant of JN.1, the appearance of NB.1.8.1 has been mentioned as a possible factor of concern in future vaccination strategies. 'We need to maintain active surveillance, especially at borders and entry points, and strengthen basic preventive measures such as mask-wearing in high-risk situations,' said experts. Although the situation is not yet critical in the US, the patterns observed in Asia suggest that the new variant could have a broader impact if not contained in time.'

**Covid LP.8.1: New Variant Raises Concerns at the World Health Organization**
The COVID-19 virus, which dominated the world in 2020 and 2021, has evolved into a new variant called LP.8.1, which has raised concerns at the World Health Organization (Oms). According to the Oms, the additional risk to public health represented by LP.8.1 is considered low globally. This is because most people have been vaccinated with cross-reactive vaccines that protect against both symptomatic and severe forms of the disease. The first case of this variant was detected in July 2024. The Oms is urging isolation and development of a specific vaccine for the 2025-2026 vaccination campaign.

**New COVID-19 Variant LP.8.1 Emerges, Causing Concern in Asia and Italy**
The COVID-19 pandemic is not over, as a new variant of the virus, LP.8.1, has emerged and is causing an increase in cases in Asia. According to infectious disease expert Matteo Bassetti, 'we are in a watchful waiting period with LP.8.1 and we will see what happens in the next few weeks.' In Italy, there have been 962 cases of COVID-19 infection in the past 30 days, with 17 deaths. The LP.8.1 variant was first detected in July 2024 and is a descendant of Omicron, specifically KP.1.1.3, a subvariant that caused large waves of COVID infections worldwide between the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated LP.8.1 as a variant under monitoring in January, due to its significant global growth and genetic mutations that may allow the virus to spread more easily and pose a greater risk to human health. The symptoms are similar to those experienced during previous COVID outbreaks, including high fever, sore throat, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, altered taste and smell, and nasal congestion. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has requested an update to COVID-19 vaccines to ensure broader coverage, as LP.8.1 appears to evade immunization.

**COVID shots should target newer strains of JN.1 variant in 2025-26...**
U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisers unanimously recommended that COVID-19 vaccines for the 2025-26 period should target newer strains of the JN.1 variant, specifically the LP.8.1 strain, which accounted for 70% of total cases in the United States over a two-week period. This recommendation aligns with the European Medicines Agency's panel and the World Health Organization, which has declared vaccines targeting the LP.8.1 strain as a 'suitable alternative' to the current ones. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the LP.8.1 strain is a subvariant of the previously recommended JN.1 strain.

**New COVID-19 Variant LP.8.1: Symptoms, Spread, and Prevention Measures**
A new COVID-19 variant, LP.8.1, has been identified and is spreading globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), LP.8.1 is a 'variant under monitoring' but not a 'variant of concern'. The symptoms of LP.8.1 include high fever, sore throat, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, runny nose, and diarrhea. The variant is highly contagious and can evade the immune system to some extent. To protect against LP.8.1, it is essential to adopt well-established prevention measures such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, washing hands, ventilating, rapid testing, isolation, and vaccination. The current COVID-19 vaccines offer significant protection against LP.8.1, but their effectiveness tends to decrease over time, making regular booster shots crucial, especially for high-risk individuals. Dr. Matteo Bassetti emphasized the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates, particularly in regions with low vaccination coverage, to prevent severe outbreaks. The global context and concerns about potential winter waves of COVID-19, as well as the influenza season and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are being closely monitored by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and the Ministry of Health.

**New Covid-19 Variant Identified in France for First Time**
A new variant of the Covid-19 virus, NB.1.8.1, has been identified in France for the first time, according to the Centre national de référence de Lyon. This variant is responsible for a surge in cases in China. 'There are a number of countries that have reported it. We found a few in France, not many, four sequences that were found, both in hospitals and in the city,' explains virologist Bruno Lina. The sub-lineage of the virus, never before identified in France before March, is causing widespread concern in China. Experts are closely monitoring this strain after a surge in cases, particularly in Hong Kong, where authorities report the highest rate of virus circulation in at least a year. According to CBS, in other Asian countries, including Taiwan, the strengthened epidemic has led to an increase in emergency room visits and a rise in deaths related to the epidemic. The virus has also been observed in other European countries since April, as explained by the ECDC, the European health authority, 'some sequences of NB.1.8.1 have been submitted by EU member states.' This is the case in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden. 'It is worth noting that the number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences is currently quite low. The variant is not yet classified as a variant under surveillance by the ECDC,' notes the health authority, who reports a 'low level of circulation in the EU in 2025.' However, this 'complex' virus is a source of concern. It presents, according to Chinese data, a 'capacity for immune evasion.' In other words, it can evade our acquired defenses during infection or vaccination. 'The Chinese seem to say that this variant would have a growth advantage (...) it enters cells faster and reproduces. Its specificities probably predict that this variant of the virus will become dominant in the future,' notes the virologist, who observes that the variant 'appears a little bit everywhere.' In France, the global context is one of notable virus circulation. According to the World Health Organization, 19% of tests for this virus were positive last week. However, these data should be nuanced, as the number of tests has decreased, and they are no longer covered by health insurance, except for vulnerable individuals.

**LP.8.1 Covid Variant: Experts Warn of High Immunoevasive Potential**
The LP.8.1 variant of the Sars Cov-2 virus, which emerged in July 2024 and is a descendant of the JN.1 family (responsible for numerous Covid waves between late 2023 and early 2024), is rapidly spreading across the globe. After affecting the United States, where it now accounts for approximately 42% of cases according to the CDC, it has become dominant in the UK (60%) and is causing a surge in infections in Singapore and Hong Kong. Experts, including virologist Matteo Bassetti and Fabrizio Pregliasco, director of the Galeazzi Institute in Milan, highlight the high immunoevasive potential of LP.8.1, meaning it can more easily evade antibodies developed after infection or vaccination. 'This variant has a high potential for immune evasion,' said Bassetti, 'and it's a concern for public health.'

**COVID Cases On Rise In Singapore: Is A New Variant Taking Over?**
COVID-19 cases are on the rise in Singapore, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning countries to stay alert. The surge is attributed to the LF.7 and NB.1.8 variants, which are spreading faster than previous strains. While not officially labeled as variants of concern, they are causing concern among health experts. The symptoms of these variants include persistent cough, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, conjunctivitis, and brain fog or confusion. Singapore's health ministry has recommended booster doses for certain groups, including people aged 60 and above, those with chronic health conditions, and healthcare workers. Experts are cautioning that the rapid transmission rate of these variants could lead to community outbreaks if not monitored. They are also warning that the JN.1 strain, which these variants descend from, was responsible for the last major global wave in 2024. India is advised to consider strengthening surveillance, reinforcing testing and tracing, boosting vaccination campaigns, tightening border controls, promoting public awareness, and preparing healthcare facilities to handle an uptick in cases.

**New Covid variant LP.8.1 warning signs and symptoms to look out for this spring**
The new Covid variant LP.8.1 now accounts for more than 30% of cases in the UK. LP.8.1 was first detected in July 2024 and originates from the Omicron variant. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the current Covid vaccines are still expected to offer protection from the variant. The symptoms of Covid remain the same, including a high temperature, new continuous cough, loss of sense of smell or taste, and others. The Covid spring booster programme is currently underway, with jabs being rolled out across the UK until June 17. To be eligible for the booster, individuals must be aged 75 or over, have a weakened immune system, or live in a care home for older adults. The booster provides protection against different Covid variants and helps reduce the risk of catching or spreading Covid for those who are at risk of becoming very unwell.

**Japon Baba Vanga's New Pandemic Prediction: 2030**
Tatsuki, a Japanese manga artist, predicted the global pandemic in 2020 in his book 'Gördüğüm kadarıyla gelecek' (As I Saw It). He wrote that a mysterious virus would emerge in 2020 and peak in April. Although he did not specify which April, his prediction was correct. The pandemic ravaged the world and the worst-case scenario emerged in 2021 with the Delta variant causing widespread deaths. As the virus subsided, the world was freed from lockdowns in 2022. However, Tatsuki's predictions for the upcoming years, particularly regarding COVID-19, have raised concerns again. According to Tatsuki, COVID-19 will return in 2030, as he wrote in his book that it would 'disappear but reappear about 10 years later.' Tatsuki had previously predicted the deaths of singer Freddie Mercury and Princess Diana, and scientists worldwide are warning of a potential new pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently reached an agreement on how to combat future pandemics and the mistakes made during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, H5N1 bird flu, measles, mpox, and Ebola are threatening various regions. However, Tatsuki's predictions follow a '15-year cycle' and do not necessarily occur simultaneously. This means that if nothing happens in 2030, the threat could be pushed forward to 2045. Tatsuki also predicts a massive tsunami in July 2025.

**A new Covid variant is on the rise. What to know about LP.8.1**
A new COVID variant, LP.8.1, is on the rise globally, making up at least three in five cases in the UK and close to one in five cases in Australia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), LP.8.1 has genetic changes that may allow the virus to spread more easily, but the symptoms of this variant do not appear to be more severe than other circulating strains. The WHO has evaluated the additional public health risk posed by LP.8.1 to be low, and it remains a variant under monitoring rather than a variant of interest or concern. Current COVID vaccines are still expected to offer good protection against symptomatic and severe disease with LP.8.1. However, due to its designation as a variant under monitoring, WHO member countries will continue to study the behavior of the LP.8.1 variant, including any potential capacity to evade immunity.

**COVID-19 Continues to Claim Lives Worldwide Despite Downgrade to 'International Public Health Emergency'**
Despite being downgraded to an 'International Public Health Emergency' in 2023, COVID-19 continues to claim lives worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global death toll has surpassed 7 million, with the US, Brazil, India, and Russia being the top countries affected. The pandemic, which was first reported in Wuhan, China in late 2019, has spread rapidly due to the lack of initial information and the virus's contagious nature. The WHO declared the outbreak a 'global pandemic' on March 11, 2020, and since then, over 777 million cases have been reported worldwide. The WHO has identified several variants of the virus, including the 'Alpha', 'Beta', 'Gamma', 'Delta', and 'Omicron' variants, which have been classified as 'Variants of Concern' (VOC). The development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, such as the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, have been crucial in the fight against the pandemic. However, the virus continues to mutate, and the WHO has reported 517 deaths and 3,073 deaths in the past week and February, respectively. As of now, over 94,000 people are still fighting COVID-19 worldwide, and the total number of cases has exceeded 777 million since the first reported case. 'We must continue to be vigilant and take all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus,' said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. 'The pandemic is not over yet, and we must work together to protect ourselves and our communities.'

**COVID-19 Still a Global Concern in 2025**
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a concern for global health authorities, with the disease still causing significant deaths worldwide. According to recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the official number of deaths has surpassed 7 million, although estimates suggest that the actual number may be higher due to underreporting. The virus continues to cause new cases and deaths, particularly in vulnerable populations where access to vaccination and medical care is limited. The WHO reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause a range of severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiovascular problems, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can lead to fatal thromboses. Additionally, the virus can trigger a 'cytokine storm', a severe immune response that can cause multi-organ failure. People with pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease, are at higher risk of developing critical illness. The virus's impact also extends to long-term sequelae, with studies showing that people infected can develop new health problems even years after the initial infection, increasing the risk of fatal complications. 'Yes, in 2025, COVID-19 still causes significant deaths in various parts of the world,' said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO expert. 'The persistence of the virus is related to its ability to mutate, which gives rise to new variants with higher transmissibility or immune evasion.' The WHO recommends regular updates to vaccines to cover circulating variants, and a new round of adapted vaccines was announced for the 2024-2025 winter season. In Brazil, the situation remains critical in some regions, with additional challenges related to health inequality. While countries with higher vaccination rates and better medical resources have lower mortality rates, the virus remains a threat, especially for the unvaccinated and immunocompromised.

**The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Year of Anniversaries and New Variants**
January 30 marked the anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the COVID-19 pandemic a global health emergency in 2020. The virus, which began spreading in China in 2019, has caused widespread illness and death worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the CDC website, COVID-19 is a result of two types of coronaviruses that infect humans, which have been prevalent in recent years. The WHO has been trying to determine the source of the virus and how it spreads among humans, but the results have been inconclusive. In 2021, the WHO and other organizations began to advocate for herd immunity as a strategy to control the spread of the virus, and several vaccines were developed to combat the virus. In 2022, the US FDA approved the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine against COVID-19. In 2023 and 2024, new variants of the virus emerged, but they were found to be less severe and less transmissible. According to the WHO, the number of new cases decreased by 4% in December 2023 and January 2024, while the number of deaths decreased by 26%. The virus has become less potent and is no longer a major public health concern.

**COVID-19 Pandemic: A Year of Decline and Weakening**
January 30 marked the anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the COVID-19 pandemic a global health emergency in 2020. The virus, which began spreading in China in 2019, has caused widespread illness and death worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 is a result of two types of coronaviruses that affect humans, which have been seen in recent years. These viruses have caused illness and raised concerns globally, especially since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China. The symptoms at the time included severe respiratory distress, fever, difficulty breathing, and coughing. The virus spread rapidly in China in 2019, and authorities believed it was transmitted from animals to humans. In 2020 and 2021, the WHO and other organizations attempted to identify the animal source of the virus and how it was transmitted to humans. However, the results in 2022 showed that it was difficult to determine the cause of the disease and its transmission among humans. This year, the COVID-19 pandemic reached its peak globally, spreading rapidly and causing widespread illness. In 2021, the concept of herd immunity was proposed as a strategy to control the pandemic, along with the use of vaccines and research for a vaccine that could prevent and stop the virus. The number of cases peaked in the third year, and the US FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. In 2022, the FDA approved the Spikevax vaccine, which was the most effective against COVID-19. Since the end of 2022, a series of COVID-19 variants have emerged, which, according to the WHO and CDC, and RT, have been a sign of the virus's decline and weakening. The Omicron variant, which is the most transmissible but has mild symptoms, has been the most prevalent. The WHO announced in December 2023 that this variant is of interest but has a low impact and does not pose a significant health risk, despite its rapid spread. In 2024 and 2025, the number of new cases increased by 4%, but the number of deaths decreased by 26%, making the virus weak and ineffective. The new variants are now spreading, but they have no significant impact.

**WHO Declares COVID-19 Outbreak as Public Health Emergency of International Concern Five Years Ago**
Five years ago, on January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. At the time, there were 7,766 confirmed cases in China and 170 deaths, but fewer than 100 cases and no deaths outside of China. The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom, stated, 'We have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen and witnessed an unprecedented outbreak (...) we must all act together now to limit the spread.' The WHO activated its emergency systems on January 1, 2020, and informed the world on January 4. The pandemic spread rapidly, with over 776.8 million confirmed cases and over 7 million deaths reported to the WHO by the end of 2024. In Brazil, there were over 39 million cases and over 714,000 deaths. The WHO has since revised the International Health Regulations and countries are discussing a new global agreement on pandemic cooperation, highlighting that the next pandemic is a matter of when, not if.
