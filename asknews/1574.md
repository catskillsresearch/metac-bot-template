**As upbeat Indian economy closes gap with Japan, Germany, the real test will be at the podium**
India's economy is expected to surpass Japan's and close the gap with Germany, becoming the third-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP. According to the IMF, India's nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by FY26, while Germany's is expected to be $4.74 trillion. India's growth is driven by domestic consumption, services, and digitization, with a robust current account buffer and a rising trade surplus. However, challenges such as job creation, fiscal slippage, and institutional bottlenecks loom large. Experts warn that India must invest in human capital, strengthen its fiscal fundamentals, and deepen financial inclusion to truly consolidate its position in the top three. If India can achieve an 8% nominal GDP growth rate and maintain a stable rupee, its economy could cross $6.8 trillion-$7 trillion by 2030, firmly establishing it as the world's third-largest economy.

**Despite GDP growth, India's per capita income abysmally low**
India's GDP has grown to $4.187 trillion, surpassing Japan's, and is expected to reach $5.584 billion by 2028, overtaking Germany. However, India's per capita GDP is abysmally low, equivalent to Japan's in the 1950s, and would take 22 years to reach their level. Experts say India needs to diversify its export basket and leverage global value chains to reach its $1 trillion merchandise exports goal by 2030. To boost growth, India can harness its global trade potential by increasing exports in textiles, apparel, and footwear sectors, as well as electronics and green technology products. Economists project India's economic growth to average around 6.5 percent over the next few years, making it likely to maintain its status as the fastest-growing major economy globally. However, Indian citizens are demanding reforms and policies that will boost GDP per capita by improving wages for India's working class. Four potential ways to boost GDP per capita include allowing farmers to sell their products to the highest bidder, spending money on building and repairing roads and bridges, urbanization, and increasing competitiveness in sectors such as electronics, chemicals, textiles, auto goods, and pharmaceuticals.

**India’s GDP victory over Japan is still a year away. Here's why**
India's GDP is expected to surpass Japan's in current dollars by March 2026, according to estimates. As of March 2025, India's GDP was $4.13 trillion, while Japan's was $4.38 trillion. Assuming a 10% annual growth rate for India and 3.4% for Japan, India's GDP is expected to reach $4.54 trillion by March 2026, surpassing Japan's estimated $4.53 trillion. However, changes in exchange rates can affect these calculations, and the actual date of surpassing may be delayed. Surjit S Bhalla, chairperson of the Technical Expert Group for the first official Household Income Survey for India, notes that the difference in GDP may not be significant and that what matters is equivalence in per capita GDP, which is still decades away. Bhalla also criticizes the decision-making bureaucracy for losing respect for data quality, citing the delayed release of bad quality household consumer expenditure data for 2017-18.
