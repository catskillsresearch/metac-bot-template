**10 Trends That Will Shape the Future of Food by 2050**
By 2050, the world's food system will be under pressure due to the need to reach net-zero emissions and a projected global population of over 10 billion people. To reduce food waste, companies will need to rethink the food chain. According to food futurists Morgaine Gaye and Joseph Poore, there will be 10 key trends in food production, consumption, and preparation. These include: 1) 'community meals' where food is shared and valued for its emotional and relational aspects; 2) the end of weekly grocery shopping, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and home delivery; 3) clothing that can grow food, such as shirts with built-in gardens; 4) urban agriculture, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and local food systems; 5) food that absorbs CO2, such as seaweed and shellfish; 6) AI-powered food planning to reduce waste and use 'imperfect' fruits and vegetables; 7) climate-resilient crops, such as quinoa and soy in northern Europe; 8) a return to ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion; 9) 'niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, becoming mainstream; 10) personalized nutrition, with AI-powered meal planning to prevent disease. According to Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Gaye added, 'in the future, we will see significant changes in our daily habits and food models.'

**The world's oceans are suffering from the heat of human pollution**
The world's oceans are suffering from the heat of human pollution, showing alarming signs of stress: heat waves, disappearance of marine life, rising sea levels, decrease in oxygen levels, and acidification caused by the absorption of excess carbon dioxide. These effects put not only the health of the ocean, but the entire planet, at risk. The oceans are absorbing more than 90% of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases, 'the oceans are warming up faster and faster', explains Angelique Melet, oceanographer at the European monitor Mercator Ocean. The IPCC panel of climate experts has said that the rate of ocean warming -- and therefore, its absorption of heat -- has doubled greatly since 1993. The average sea surface temperature reached new records in 2023 and 2024. Despite a brief respite in early 2025, temperatures remain at historically high levels, according to data from the Copernicus climate monitor of the European Union. The Mediterranean has set a new temperature record each of the last three years and is one of the most affected basins, along with the North Atlantic and the Arctic oceans, according to Thibault Guinaldo, of the French research center CEMS. Marine heat waves have doubled in frequency, last longer, are more intense, and affect a wider area, according to the IPCC's special report on the oceans. Warmer seas can make storms more violent, as they feed on heat and evaporated water. The warming of the water can be devastating for species, especially for corals and marine grasslands, which cannot migrate. In the case of corals, it is expected that between 70% and 90% will be lost this century if the world reaches a warming of 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels. Scientists expect that threshold -- the most ambitious goal of the Paris climate agreement -- to be exceeded by the early 2030s or even earlier. Imminent rise The expansion of a liquid or gas as it warms up occupies more space. In the case of the oceans, this thermal expansion is combined with the slow but irreversible melting of polar ice caps and mountain glaciers, causing sea levels to rise. The rate at which global sea levels are rising has doubled in three decades and, if current trends continue, will double again by 2100 to approximately one centimeter per year, according to recent research. Around 230 million people worldwide live less than a meter above sea level, vulnerable to growing threats of flooding and storms. 'Oceanic warming, like sea level rise, has become an unstoppable process', said Melet. 'But if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will reduce the rate and magnitude of damage, and gain time for adaptation'. More acidity, less oxygen The ocean not only stores heat, but has absorbed between 20% and 30% of all human carbon dioxide emissions since the 1980s, according to the IPCC, causing the waters to become more acidic. Acidification weakens corals and makes it difficult for shellfish, crustacean skeletons, and certain types of plankton to calcify. 'Another key indicator is the concentration of oxygen, which, of course, is important for marine life', said Melet. Oxygen loss is due to a complex set of causes, including those related to water warming. Less sea ice The combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice -- frozen ocean water floating on the surface -- fell to a historic low in mid-February. This becomes a vicious circle, as less sea ice allows more solar energy and heat to reach the water, leading to more ice melting. This feeds the phenomenon of 'polar amplification' that makes global warming faster and more intense at the poles, said Guinaldo.

**World Oceans Day 2025: Oceans bearing the brunt of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions**
The world's oceans are warming at an alarming rate, with sea surface temperatures reaching new records in 2023 and 2024. According to Angelique Melet, an oceanographer at the European Mercator Ocean monitor, 'oceans are warming faster and faster' due to the absorption of excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases. The rate of ocean warming has more than doubled since 1993, and marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency, become longer lasting and more intense, and affect a wider area. Warmer seas can make storms more violent, feeding them with heat and evaporated water, and can be devastating for species, especially corals and seagrass beds. Scientists expect that up to 90% of corals will be lost this century if the world reaches 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming compared to pre-industrial levels. The pace at which global oceans are rising has doubled in three decades and if current trends continue it will double again by 2100 to about one centimetre per year. 'Ocean warming, like sea-level rise, has become an inescapable process on the scale of our lives, but also over several centuries,' said Melet. 'But if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will reduce the rate and magnitude of the damage, and gain time for adaptation'.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**Key climate target of airline decarbonization 'in peril': IATA**
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that the airline industry's goal of decarbonizing by 2050 is 'in peril' due to climate-skeptic policies, including those of US President Donald Trump. Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's senior vice president for sustainability, stated that 'it does imperil success on the 2050 horizon' but 'will just slow progress.' The industry relies on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to achieve net-zero emissions, but SAF biofuels are three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel. Owens Thomsen estimated that $4.7 trillion in investment is needed to establish SAF sectors capable of meeting the needs of air transport by 2050, which she believes is 'entirely achievable.' She suggested that the money could be found by redirecting subsidies to oil producers, which amount to $1 trillion per year. IATA also expects global SAF production to double this year to 2.5 billion liters, but this represents only 0.7% of total aviation needs.

**IATA Expects Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production to Double in 2025**
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production to double to 2 million tons in 2025, representing 0.7% of the global airline fuel consumption. However, the association warned that this level of production is still too low to meet the industry's sustainability goals. IATA Director General Willie Walsh said that this small increase will add around $4.4 billion to the global airline fuel bill. He emphasized the need to accelerate the pace of progress in increasing production and improving efficiency to reduce costs. The airline industry has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, relying on the gradual transition to SAF, which is produced from waste oils and organic materials. However, the high cost and limited production of SAF have raised concerns among airlines. IATA reported that around $1.3 billion of airline funds are still frozen by governments until the end of April 2025, despite a 25% improvement compared to $1.7 billion frozen in October 2024. The association called on governments to remove all obstacles preventing airlines from converting their ticket sales and other revenue into SAF, in line with international agreements.

**Russia needs to double investments to keep oil output at 540 mln tons by 2050**
Russia needs to double its investments in the oil industry to maintain production at 540 million tons by 2050, according to Anton Rubtsov, head of the Oil and Gas Complex Department of the Energy Ministry. Rubtsov stated, 'According to our estimates, in order to maintain production at around 540 million tons of oil by 2050, we need to double investments.' He suggested that companies' income from oil sales and state investment could be potential sources of financing. Rubtsov emphasized, 'In order for businesses to have funds, the state needs to take less at the moment. I'm not saying that this will happen this year or next year. The basis is the tax system and its adaptation. This will be a strategically important decision. This is where investments come from,'

**Urbanization to Double by 2050: Opportunities and Challenges**
According to Nicolas Peltier-Thiberge, manager for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank's Global Practice for Transport, by 2050, nearly seven out of every 10 people will live in cities, as the world's urban population is expected to double. This rapid urbanization brings opportunities, such as increased access to jobs and essential services, but also disadvantages, including increased air pollution, which has negative effects on health. Peltier-Thiberge suggests that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are a viable alternative to reduce air pollution in cities. These vehicles, which use green hydrogen, can achieve zero emissions and offer several operational advantages, including longer driving ranges and higher payload capacity. They can be refueled in 5 to 15 minutes, and their hydrogen storage tanks are lighter than large battery packs, allowing for greater cargo capacity and reduced wear and tear.

**How do we meet exploding global energy demand?**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that global electricity demand will double to 52,000 TWh by 2050, driven by widespread electrification, AI and crypto booms, and data center proliferation. Meeting this demand requires expanding all clean and viable energy sources. Nuclear power, despite being stigmatized by high-profile accidents, has become one of the safest and cleanest energy options, providing 2,626 TWh annually, or 10% of global electricity. However, challenges remain, including the lack of a universally accepted solution for disposing of spent nuclear fuel and public perception issues. Renewables have been scaling up rapidly, but even heroic expansion scenarios are not enough to meet projected needs, with a collective output of 30,420 TWh by 2050, still 20,000 TWh short of what's needed. As IEA Director-General Fatih Birol said, 'Meeting this demand requires more than just choosing the 'best' source of energy -- it demands an unprecedented expansion of every clean and viable energy source we have.'

**OPEC Secretary-General: No Peak in Oil Demand Expected in Near Future**
The Secretary-General of OPEC, Haisam Al-Gais, stated in an exclusive interview with Trend that OPEC does not expect a peak in oil demand in the near future. He attributed this to demographic and economic trends, including a projected population of 9.7 billion by 2050, with two-thirds of the population living in cities, and a doubling of global economic output by 2050. Al-Gais noted that these processes will be accompanied by a significant increase in energy consumption and, consequently, oil demand. He predicted that global energy consumption will increase by 24% by 2050, with oil demand exceeding 120 million barrels per day. Al-Gais emphasized that the growth of one energy source often stimulates the growth of others, citing examples such as the use of petroleum-based materials in the production of wind turbines and solar panels. He also highlighted the importance of considering the role of oil and gas in the global energy mix, stating that they account for around 55% of the world's energy balance. Al-Gais stressed the need for inclusivity in discussions about the future of energy, saying that 'we must clearly understand that building a future with low emissions, alongside energy security and universal access to energy, implies multiple paths. This is not one path for all, whether it is a country or an industry.' He emphasized that OPEC advocates for a universal approach to energy solutions, recognizing that no single source of energy can meet the growing demand and needs of all. Al-Gais concluded by expressing OPEC's support for the approach of 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,' which is a key principle of the UN's Paris Agreement and the COP process.

**Turkmenistan's Gas Production Expected to Double by 2050**
The general secretary of the Forum of Gas Exporting Countries (FGEC), Mohammed Hamel, predicts that Turkmenistan's gas production will double by 2050. According to him, 'the world's natural gas consumption reached its maximum in 2024, accounting for 35% of the growth in primary energy supply. It is forecasted to grow annually by 2% in 2025-2026, and in the long term, demand is expected to increase by 32% by 2050, increasing the share of gas in the global energy balance from 23% to 26%.' He also noted that 'Asia-Pacific Region (APR) forms more than half of this growth in demand, and China and India are expected to become the two largest sources of global demand for natural gas.' China's gas consumption is expected to reach 660 billion cubic meters by 2050, making it the second-largest consumer after the US, while India's gas demand is expected to increase more than twofold, reaching 230 billion cubic meters by 2050. Currently, natural gas accounts for around 28% of Turkmenistan's energy balance, and it is expected to double by 2050. 'Turkmenistan is on the path to expanding gas production, and the development of Galkynysh with a growing network of pipelines will allow the country to double its current gas production, according to our forecasts, and may exceed 150 billion cubic meters by mid-century,' Hamel said. The country's growing energy infrastructure is strengthening its connection with key regional markets, supplying natural gas to China, Central Asia, the Middle East, and possibly Europe in the future, he added. 'Strategic initiatives, such as the expansion of the Central Asia-China pipeline with the planned D line, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline, and the proposed Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline, will further solidify Turkmenistan's role as a major natural gas supplier,' Hamel said.

**Solar Power doubling every 3 Years; 41% of world Electricity now Low-Carbon**
Solar power is experiencing exponential growth, doubling every three years, and has reached 2,000 terawatt hours, a milestone it reached faster than any energy-producing technology in human history. According to Ember, if all the solar energy generated in the world last year was dedicated to India, it would have been able to supply the country with all its electricity. Solar is reducing the use of coal and gas, particularly in China, where the growth in coal production and use would have been 50% higher in recent years if it had not been for the big build-out in solar power. Non-OECD countries, including China, accounted for 59% of new solar installations in 2024, with 39% of that in China alone. Solar is expected to account for 4,000 terawatt hours in 2028, 8,000 terawatt hours in 2031, 16,000 terawatt hours in 2034, 32,000 terawatt hours in 2037, and 64,000 terawatt hours in 2040, which is likely to be all the electricity used in the world at that time. However, this progression depends on current technology, and advancements in perovskite solar panels could make the process even quicker and more affordable.

**A New Era for Nuclear Energy: Global Capacity to Double by 2050**
The International Energy Agency (AIE) predicts that the global nuclear energy capacity will double to 870 GW by 2050, driven by increased investment, technological advancements, especially in small modular reactors (SMR), and supportive policies. The demand for electricity is growing, with a 4.3% increase in 2024, the highest growth rate in a decade. The AIE estimates that renewable energy and nuclear power will meet the entire global additional demand for electricity over the next three years. In Spain, the demand for electricity grew by 2% in 2024, but is still below pre-pandemic levels. The AIE's report, 'Camino hacia una nueva era de energía nuclear' (Path to a new era for nuclear energy), highlights the importance of nuclear energy in meeting the world's growing energy needs. Eren Çam, AIE's Manager of Projects for the Electric Market, stated, 'The report shows that nuclear energy will experience significant growth in the coming decades, driven by increased investment, technological advancements, and supportive policies.' The interest in nuclear energy is at its highest level since the 1970s oil crisis, with annual investment in nuclear energy increasing by almost 50% since 2020, exceeding $60 billion. The global nuclear power generation is expected to reach new heights in 2025, with 63 new reactors under construction, representing over 70 GW of capacity, the highest level since 1990.

**Major Companies Commit to Doubling Global Nuclear Power Generation by 2050**
A group of major companies, including Google, Amazon, Meta, and Dow, have signed a commitment to support increasing global nuclear power generation by at least twice by 2050. This is the first time that non-nuclear industry companies have publicly supported the widespread and coordinated expansion of nuclear power to meet the growing global energy demand. They also urge other energy users to support the goal of increasing nuclear power generation by at least twice by 2050. The collective call, led by the World Nuclear Association, brings together global companies that recognize the advantages of nuclear energy, such as its cleanliness, stability, and abundance. The companies acknowledge government support and advocate for equal financing opportunities for nuclear energy. Google's clean energy and carbon reduction technology manager Lucia Tian said, 'We are honored to sign this commitment to support increasing nuclear power generation by at least twice by 2050, and nuclear power will play a crucial role in building a reliable, safe, and sustainable energy future.' Amazon Web Services' American energy and water manager Brandon Oyer said, 'Accelerating nuclear development is crucial for strengthening national security, meeting future energy demands, and addressing climate change. Amazon supports the World Nuclear Association's commitment and is proud to have invested over $10 billion in nuclear projects and technologies in the past year, which is part of our broader 'climate commitment' to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.' Meta's global energy manager Urvi Parekh said, 'As the global economy expands, the demand for reliable, clean, and resilient energy supply is critical. Nuclear energy can meet this growing demand by providing continuous power. We are happy to partner with multiple organizations to participate in this 'doubling nuclear power generation' commitment and reaffirm our support for nuclear energy.' Dow's energy and climate business vice president Edward Stones said, 'Energy is the lifeblood of the global manufacturing industry, so investing and expanding clean, reliable, and cost-competitive nuclear energy applications is crucial for industrial development. Dow views nuclear energy, especially advanced small modular nuclear energy technology, as a secure, stable, and clean energy source for long-term competitiveness.' The World Nuclear Association's director general Sama Bilbao y Leon said, 'Today, the world's most influential companies have made a historic commitment to support increasing global nuclear power generation by at least twice by 2050, sending a clear message to governments to accelerate policy, financial, and regulatory changes to drive nuclear development. The global shift towards wider adoption of nuclear energy highlights that this is the only feasible way to provide abundant, stable, and clean energy to drive technological, multiple other industries, and overall economic growth and innovation.'

**Africa's Natural Gas Production to Double by 2050, Driving Energy Self-Sufficiency**
Africa is expected to become a key player in the natural gas sector, with predictions indicating an exceptional growth in demand by 2050. According to a report by the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), the continent will experience a 152% increase in consumption, reaching 415 billion cubic meters. This trend is driven by rapid urbanization and sustained economic growth, placing Africa at the heart of global energy issues. The production of natural gas in Africa is expected to more than double, from 260 billion cubic meters in 2021 to 585 billion in 2050, representing an average annual growth rate of 2.8%. As a result, Africa's share of global natural gas production will increase, from 6% to over 11%. This development not only reflects the continent's abundant resources but also its desire for energy self-sufficiency in the face of growing internal demand. To support this expansion, massive investments will be required, with the GECF estimating that nearly $9,700 billion will be needed globally by 2050, of which approximately $1,700 billion will be directed towards Africa. These funds will not only enable the exploration and extraction of gas resources but also the development of necessary infrastructure to transport and distribute gas across the continent. The rise of natural gas in Africa is accompanied by challenges, including the acceleration of decarbonization initiatives in other regions, which could influence markets and investments. However, Africa appears well-positioned to capitalize on its gas resources while meeting its growing energy needs.
