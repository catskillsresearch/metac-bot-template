**Renewable Energies Surpass 40% of Global Electricity Production in 2024**
In 2024, more than 40% of the world's electricity came from low-carbon sources, according to the annual report of the think-tank Ember. This is a remarkable milestone, as it is the first time that the 40% threshold has been exceeded globally. The growth of low-carbon energies is largely driven by the growth of solar energy, which increased by 29% in 2024 compared to 2023. Solar energy now accounts for approximately 7% of the world's electricity production, double what it was just two years ago in 2022. China's massive investments in solar energy have made it the largest producer of solar energy, accounting for 39% of global solar production. In India, solar energy has doubled in just one year. This decoupling of electricity demand and fossil fuel consumption is a significant development, as it means that countries like China and India are no longer relying on fossil fuels to meet increasing electricity demand. In 2024, renewable energies covered 81% of the increase in electricity demand in China, and a similar decoupling is occurring in India. By 2030, India could potentially meet all of its increasing electricity demand with low-carbon energies. This is a positive development, as electricity demand is expected to continue growing in the coming years due to economic development, new uses such as artificial intelligence, and the electrification of transportation. 'It's a good news, because we know that electricity demand will continue to grow in the coming years,' said an expert. The mix of energy sources should not be confused with the mix of electricity production, as the two are often confused. For example, France's electricity production is largely decarbonized due to its nuclear power plants, but the country still relies heavily on fossil fuels for heating and transportation. One way to reduce fossil fuel consumption is to electrify transportation and heating through electric vehicles and heat pumps. However, if the electricity is produced from fossil fuels, it is a step backward. It is therefore a positive development that the increase in demand is being met by renewable energies. In the United States, renewable energies generated more electricity than coal for the first time in 2024, with Texas being the leading state in renewable energy development. In Europe, solar energy also surpassed coal for the first time in 2024. China is also starting to export solar panels to Africa, which is essential, as there were almost as many solar panels in Belgium as on the entire African continent in 2024. It's not just solar energy. There's also hydroelectric energy, which accounts for 14% of the global electricity mix, and wind energy, which continues to grow and accounts for 8% of production, and of course nuclear energy, which is not considered a renewable energy but is a low-carbon energy. Nuclear energy accounts for 9% of the global electricity mix, but its share is decreasing. It means that if we want to cross the 50% threshold of decarbonized electricity this year, we will have to make a big effort and lower the prices of low-carbon energies. But the European example shows that it is possible: in the European Union, more than 70% of the electricity mix is decarbonized.

**Solar Power doubling every 3 Years; 41% of world Electricity now Low-Carbon**
Solar power is experiencing exponential growth, doubling every three years, and has reached 2,000 terawatt hours, a milestone it reached faster than any energy-producing technology in human history. According to Ember, if all the solar energy generated in the world last year was dedicated to India, it would have been able to supply the country with all its electricity. Solar is reducing the use of coal and gas, particularly in China, where the growth in coal production and use would have been 50% higher in recent years if it had not been for the big build-out in solar power. Non-OECD countries, including China, accounted for 59% of new solar installations in 2024, with 39% of that in China alone. Solar is expected to account for 4,000 terawatt hours in 2028, 8,000 terawatt hours in 2031, 16,000 terawatt hours in 2034, 32,000 terawatt hours in 2037, and 64,000 terawatt hours in 2040, which is likely to be all the electricity used in the world at that time. However, this progression depends on current technology, and advancements in perovskite solar panels could make the process even quicker and more affordable.

**Commentary: Nuclear and natural gas work long term, but we need solar for immediate needs**
The United States is expected to need 128 gigawatts of additional electricity capacity by 2029 to meet peak summer consumption, with data centers accounting for 90 gigawatts of this demand by 2030. To meet this demand without increasing electricity bills, the country needs abundant and stable power generation. While new gas-fired and nuclear power plants are not feasible in the next four years, low-cost and reliable utility-scale solar can help bridge the gap. In 2024, the US installed 32 gigawatts of utility-scale solar capacity, equivalent to 32 conventional nuclear reactors in 12 months. Solar is agile and decentralized, allowing it to be co-located at scale to power drivers of economic growth. NextEra, one of the country's largest power generation operators, advocates for pragmatism and recognizes the strengths of renewable generation, such as solar and battery storage. A commonsense electricity generation strategy should recognize the strengths and shortcomings of all generation technologies and their ability to compete and complement each other. Solar can bridge today's shortfall in electricity generation with an era of 'all-of-the-above' abundance in the next decade. American solar manufacturing is thriving, with companies producing solar technology manufactured with American-made materials. The factories will produce 14 gigawatts of American-made solar panels annually, supporting 30,000 jobs and $2.8 billion in payroll income.

**Solar and Wind Energy Surpass Coal in the US for the First Time**
According to a report by Ember, solar and wind energy in the US have surpassed coal for the first time in history, producing more electricity than coal in 2024. Coal as an energy source has fallen to a historic low, making up 15% of the country's energy, while solar and wind combined made up 17%. The US has seen a significant increase in solar energy, with 81% of added capacity coming from solar in 2024, and a record 31 GW of solar energy added to the grid. In contrast, wind energy showed a more modest growth, but still makes up around 10% of the US energy mix and is generally cheaper than coal or gas. The demand for electricity has started to grow again, increasing by 3% in 2024, and is expected to continue to rise due to the growth of energy-intensive data centers, cryptocurrency mining, and electric vehicles. As a result, gas-fired power generation increased by 3.3% in 2024. Experts predict that the US will need to add an additional 900 GW of renewable energy and storage by 2040, as well as 100 GW of new gas capacity, but this will not help address the climate crisis. Around 60% of the US energy mix still comes from fossil fuels, but the trend is rapidly changing, with coal having been surpassed by solar and wind combined in 2024.

**Solar and wind beat coal in the US for the first time**
For the first time in the US, wind and solar power have surpassed coal as the leading source of electricity, according to a report from energy think tank Ember. Solar power was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2024, accounting for 81% of added annual capacity, while wind generation grew more modestly but still made up about 10% of the US electricity mix. Despite the Trump administration's efforts to undermine clean energy, the gains made last year show that market forces could keep momentum going. As electricity demand rises in the US, there is growing interest in developing more sources of energy, including renewables, nuclear reactors, and gas plants. A report commissioned by trade groups says the nation's power grids need to grow significantly, with the US needing to install 900 gigawatts of renewable energy and batteries by 2040. 'Solar is winning,' said Ember chief analyst Dave Jones. 'It added more generation than gas in 2024 and batteries will ensure that solar can grow more cheaply and quickly than gas.'
