**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Elon Musk laid out plans for Mars. SpaceX production will outstrip Boeing and Airbus**
Elon Musk outlined his ambitious plans to make life multi-planetary by sending humans to Mars. He believes a civilization on Mars is crucial for the long-term survival of humanity and plans to expand beyond Mars to the asteroid belt and other star systems. To achieve this, Musk aims to produce 1,000 reusable Starships per year, surpassing the combined production of Boeing and Airbus. He wants to send missions to Mars every two years, starting with the next window in late 2026. Musk plans to fund the development through Starlink, his profitable space-based Wi-Fi service, which has over five million subscribers and represents 80% of SpaceX's $350 billion value. He estimates that one million tons of cargo will be shipped to Mars every launch window, equivalent to 4,500 Statues of Liberty every two years. Musk said, 'A civilization on Mars is going to be incredibly important for the long-term survival of civilization... Then we go beyond Mars, ultimately, to the move, maybe asteroid belt...and ultimately, to other star systems...making science fiction no longer fiction.'

**Russians Eager to Travel to Mars: 27% Want to Take the Leap**
According to a survey conducted by SuperJob for RIA Novosti among 1600 respondents, approximately one in four Russians (27%) are interested in traveling to Mars. The desire to travel to Mars is stronger among younger people. Despite this, 73% of respondents are not willing to trade Earth for Mars. Men are 1.5 times more likely to dream of flying to the Red Planet than women. In cities with a population of over a million, the most enthusiastic about traveling to Mars are residents of Ufa (38%), Yekaterinburg (37%), and Rostov-on-Don (33%). Residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg are less interested in traveling to Mars, with 25% and 26% respectively. As a reminder, Elon Musk recently announced a roadmap for Mars colonization and presented a new generation of the Starship rocket, which will travel to the Red Planet, first with robots and then with people, as Musk said, 'It's a big step for humanity.'

**Elon Musk say it's '50/50' he'll land on Mars next year and he needs to 'get lucky' - Daily Star**
Elon Musk says there is a '50/50 chance' of landing a spaceship on Mars next year, and he needs to 'get lucky'. Despite recent test flight failures, Musk remains optimistic about progress towards establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. He believes reusable rockets will enable more than a million people to live on Mars within 30 years. Musk hopes to send 20 ships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with the goal of building a self-sufficient city that could survive even if cut off from Earth. He is scouting possible sites for a Mars city, with Arcadia Planitia being the leading candidate. Musk aims to fly 100 ships to Mars between 2030 and 2031 and 500 more in 2033. He said, 'This is, like, an incredible thing to have - this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet and a new world.'

**Elon Musk's Plan to Colonize Mars: 2026 the Key Year**
Elon Musk has revealed his plan to colonize Mars, with the first unmanned flight of the Starship spacecraft to the planet expected to take place in late 2026. The mission will transport robots called Optimus, developed by Tesla, to the Martian surface. Musk aims to send the first human missions to Mars in the second or third landing, with the goal of establishing a permanent and self-sufficient human settlement on the planet. To achieve this, SpaceX estimates that it will need between 1,000 and 2,000 launches of the Starship every 26 months, coinciding with the optimal alignment between Earth and Mars. Musk believes that there is a 50% chance that Starship will be ready for the 2026 window. If not, the company will wait until 2028 for the next opportunity. Musk has been interested in colonizing Mars since the 1990s and has invested billions of dollars in developing space technology to make humanity a multi-planetary species.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Global Crises Hinder Efforts to Convince Millions to Quit Smoking**
According to a report presented to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the global crises have hindered efforts to convince millions to quit smoking. The report states that the delay has affected approximately 95 million additional tobacco consumers, who were supposed to stop smoking by 2025. Despite the success of governments in reducing the number of smokers, the failure to reduce the number by 30% means that 1.207 billion and 800,000 people are still smoking worldwide, instead of the target of 1.112 billion and 400,000, according to a Reuters report using smoking rates and population numbers from the report. As the report notes, 'this delay... has affected approximately 95 million additional tobacco consumers, who were supposed to stop smoking by 2025'.

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars: 5 to 500 Starships by 2033**
Elon Musk plans to send five Starships to Mars in 2026, followed by a drastic increase in the number of launches, with 20 ships in 2028, 100 in 2030, and 500 in 2033. According to Musk, this plan is a crucial step in colonizing Mars. As Musk said, 'It's a very ambitious plan, but I think it's necessary to make humanity a multi-planetary species.' However, some people are skeptical about the feasibility of this plan, questioning whether it's a point of inflection for humanity or just a sign of Musk's mental detachment.

**Elon Musk's Plan to Colonize Mars: A Roadmap to a Self-Sustaining Civilization**
Elon Musk presented a plan for colonizing Mars, which includes several key milestones. The first crewed mission to Mars is expected to take place in 2027-2028. In the following years, the number of spacecraft sent to Mars will increase, with 20 landing craft expected to arrive in 2028-2029, carrying a payload of 75 tons. By 2030-2031, the number of spacecraft will increase fivefold, with a payload of 150 tons per ship. This will enable the construction of housing, roads, and energy systems, as well as the extraction of Martian resources. The goal is to reach a payload of 300 tons per ship by 2033, with 500 landing craft. This will allow for the extraction and processing of Martian resources, as well as the establishment of a global communication network. As Musk said, 'The goal is to make Mars a self-sustaining civilization, with a population of millions.'

**Japan on the Brink of Demographic Crisis: 'Problema 2025'**
Japan is on the brink of a unprecedented demographic crisis. According to preliminary data from the Ministry of Health, only 721,000 babies were born in 2024, a record low since official records began. Meanwhile, the baby boomer generation born in 1949 is reaching old age, with an expected surge in over 75-year-olds in need of care. Experts have dubbed this convergence 'Problema 2025', a threat to the welfare system, which is already struggling. The consequences are felt most in large cities, where the pressure on healthcare and social costs risks becoming unsustainable. The causes of the birth rate decline are well-known: high school costs, lack of housing space, and difficulties in balancing work and family life. The government has introduced reforms, allowing flexible working hours and offering subsidies to families. However, many scholars, including Shintaro Yamaguchi of the University of Tokyo, believe that economic measures alone are not enough. A cultural shift, particularly in the sharing of family roles, is necessary. Without greater male involvement in childcare, Japan may lose 30% of its population by 2070, exacerbating economic and social imbalances. As Yamaguchi said, 'It is necessary to change the culture, especially in the sharing of family roles.'

**Baba Vanga Prediction 2025:  A Joyful event awaits the world in just three years, people will travel to..., discover a new source of...**
Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian prophet known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has made several predictions for the years 2025 to 5079. According to her, in 2025, a major conflict in Europe will impact the continent's population, and a worldwide economic disaster will occur. In 2028, humans will begin to explore Venus as a potential energy resource, and by 2028, hunger will be eradicated from the world. Other predictions include the spread of communism across multiple nations by 2076, the establishment of contact with extraterrestrial life by 2130, and a widespread drought impacting large parts of the planet by 2170. Vanga also predicted that Earth will engage in a war with a Martian civilization by 3005, and humans will be forced to leave Earth as it becomes uninhabitable by 3797. According to Vanga, the world will come to an end by 5079.

**'This Will Not Happen, People': Elon Musk's Daughter Calls Mars Colonization Plans a 'Marketing Scheme'**
Vivian Wilson, the trans woman and daughter of Elon Musk, called her father's plans to colonize Mars 'a marketing scheme' in a live interview with Hasan Piker. 'This will not happen, people,' she said. 'It's a marketing scheme that everyone somehow fell for, despite Google search results debunking it.' Musk has often spoken about his ambitious plans to colonize the Red Planet by 2050, envisioning a city with a population of one million people on its surface. Recently, Musk confirmed plans to launch the Starship spacecraft to Mars by the end of next year, with a robot named Optimus on board, developed by Tesla. If these landings are successful, human landings may begin as early as 2029, although a more likely date is 2031.

**Musk Predicts 1 Million People on Mars in 20 Years, Establishing a Self-Sufficient City**
Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has predicted that humans will establish a self-sufficient city on Mars within 20 years, with a population of 1 million people. He also revealed that 2029 will be a historic moment when humans first set foot on Mars. According to Deutsche Welle, Musk stated on X platform that SpaceX plans to execute a landing mission in 2026, aiming to send Tesla's humanoid robot 'Optimus' to Mars using the 'Starship' rocket. If the mission is successful, he estimates that humans will complete their first Mars landing in 2029, but the most likely implementation time is 2031. Musk emphasized the importance of establishing a self-sufficient Martian city for the continuation of human civilization, saying, 'Even if Earth faces a disaster, Martian residents can survive independently.' He added, 'We need to build a self-sufficient city on Mars as soon as possible, which is the key threshold to ensure the survival of civilization. Even if Earth's supply ships stop flying or a major disaster occurs, the Martian civilization can continue.' Musk also mentioned that building a self-sufficient Martian city requires rebuilding all industrial foundations on Earth, and the primary task in the harsh Martian environment is to build a living module similar to a glass dome to provide a suitable space for human habitation. The 'Starship' rocket, developed by SpaceX, is considered the core of Musk's Mars plan. This reusable heavy-lift rocket will not only support NASA's 'Artemis' program to help humans return to the Moon but also undertake the mission of humans setting foot on Mars.

**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**
British paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species. 'If we make a concerted effort to expand into the Universe, we could 'live -- potentially -- for millions of years,' he says. However, he warns that if we don't take action, 'there might be no one left on the Earth for you to wave back to.'

**Multiple Apocalyptic Predictions for the End of the World**
According to various predictions, the end of the world is approaching. A solar flare is expected to hit the Earth in 2025, causing a 'total blackout' and internet shutdown worldwide. However, some scientists disagree, citing that the most active phase of the solar cycle will occur in late 2023 to early 2024. Bulgarian mystic Vanga predicted that a conflict in Europe in 2025 will have a devastating impact on the continent's population, followed by the exploration of Venus for energy sources in 2028. By 2033, the polar ice caps will melt, causing a significant rise in sea levels, and by 2076, communism will spread across the planet. Vanga also predicted that humans will make contact with aliens in 2130, followed by a global drought that will affect most countries. The final stage of the apocalypse is expected to occur in 3005, with a war against a Martian civilization, and by 3797, the last humans will leave the planet due to its uninhabitability. Additionally, an Austrian scientist, Heinz von Förster, predicted that the world will end on November 13, 2026, due to overpopulation, and the French Institute of Demographic Research predicts that the world's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, leading to a shortage of natural resources, food, and water. Finally, there are concerns about potential asteroid collisions, including one in 2028 and another in 2029, which could have catastrophic consequences.

**Belgian Population Projections: 8 Million Flemings in 2070**
According to the new population projections by the Belgian Planning Bureau and Statbel, the population of Flanders is expected to grow from 6.8 million in 2024 to 8 million in 2070. The total population of Belgium is projected to reach 12.9 million by 2070, while the population of Wallonia and Brussels is expected to remain relatively stable. The growth in population is mainly due to the international migration balance, which is expected to remain stable at around 30,000 people per year until 2070. By the late 2030s, the natural balance (births minus deaths) is expected to become negative, with the number of births decreasing to 1.6 per woman by 2035, down from 1.9 in the late 2000s and 1.5 in the last year. 'The international migration balance will be the main driver of population growth until the end of the 2030s,' said the Planning Bureau. 'After that, it will be the only growth factor.'

**Belgian Population Expected to Reach 12.9 Million by 2070**
The Belgian population is expected to grow by an average of 30,000 people per year until 2070, reaching 12.9 million inhabitants. This growth is mainly driven by the international migration balance. According to the Planbureau, the international migration balance will remain relatively stable at around 30,000 people per year between now and 2070, a lower level than in recent years. The working-age population is expected to remain relatively stable until 2070, while the number of elderly people is expected to increase. This means that the elderly population is growing faster than the working-age population. Additionally, the difference in life expectancy between men and women is expected to decrease.
