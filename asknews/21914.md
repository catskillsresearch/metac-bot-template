**As upbeat Indian economy closes gap with Japan, Germany, the real test will be at the podium**
India's economy is expected to surpass Japan's and close the gap with Germany, becoming the third-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP. According to the IMF, India's nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by FY26, while Germany's is expected to be $4.74 trillion. India's growth is driven by domestic consumption, services, and digitization, with a robust current account buffer and a rising trade surplus. However, challenges such as job creation, fiscal slippage, and institutional bottlenecks loom large. Experts warn that India must invest in human capital, strengthen its fiscal fundamentals, and deepen financial inclusion to truly consolidate its position in the top three. If India can achieve an 8% nominal GDP growth rate and maintain a stable rupee, its economy could cross $6.8 trillion-$7 trillion by 2030, firmly establishing it as the world's third-largest economy.

**OAO 'Zhuravliное': A Leader in Milk Production and Quality of Life**
The collective of OAO 'Zhuravliное' is known far beyond the Pruzhansky district due to its achievements. The company has made a bet on the progress of production and the quality of life of villagers. Despite the prolonged and capricious spring, they are counting on a generous harvest. The director of the company, Alexander Pishch, a member of the Council of the Republic of the National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus, said, 'Our main directions in production are crop production and animal husbandry. We are improving technologies, working profitably, and making a bet on high-quality products that are in demand by consumers. The main goal is the further growth of production volumes, the development of the economy, and as a result, the improvement of the quality of life of people.' Due to its achievements, OAO 'Zhuravliное' is known far beyond the Pruzhansky district. For many years, it has been the absolute leader in the country in terms of total milk production. In 2024, the collective retained its strong positions. The company produced over 59.5 thousand tons of the main profitable product, adding 7.7% to the previous year. In January-April 2025, the dynamics in the industry were maintained. Milk production increased by 5.6% to 20,849 tons. Only grade 'extra' milk is sent for processing, with a quality of 92.8%. The company's profitability exceeded 60% over four months. The collective of the MTK 'Klепачи', led by Olga Sevostyanchik, has been achieving the highest results in recent years. In 2024, the average milk yield per cow here reached 10,635 kg, exceeding the previous level by more than a ton. In general, over two seasons, they added 2,830 kg. 'We are confident that this is not the limit,' says Olga Sevostyanchik. 'There are such heifers that give 40-50 kg of milk per day. Our record holders can even give up to 70 kg.' A balanced diet, breeding work, modern technologies, and the efforts of people are bearing fruit. The company has a sufficient amount of modern equipment to timely conduct the entire cycle of agricultural work. There are 82 tractors, including 21 energy-intensive ones, and 54 cargo trucks in the park. The company is preparing the equipment for the upcoming harvest. The company's goal is to further improve the quality of life of its employees and the villagers. They are working to increase the production volumes and develop the economy. The company is participating in international specialized exhibitions, such as the International Specialized Exhibition 'Belagro', where they exchange experience, take on new technologies, and get familiar with new equipment. This is the key to future progress. The company is confident that with its efforts, they will be able to achieve their goals and improve the quality of life of the villagers.

**Tinubu's reforms spur historic surge in capital market indices - Stockbroker**
According to Mr. David Adonri, Vice Chairman of Highcap Securities Ltd., the capital market in Nigeria has experienced a historic surge in the past two years due to micro-economic reforms of President Bola Tinubu. The total market capitalisation has doubled from N52.215 trillion in May 2023 to N119.58 trillion as of May 23, 2025. Adonri attributed this growth to the recapitalisation of the banking sector and the signing into law of the Investment and Securities Act 2024. He commended the President's economic policies, saying that if funds raised through the capital market were strategically deployed to critical sectors of the economy, Nigeria can exceed the one trillion dollar GDP target by 2030. However, he noted that the momentum was yet to fully gather pace, with the highest quarterly GDP growth under this administration being 3.84 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, which many analysts believe was largely inflation-driven and did not translate into real growth.

**Chief Economic Adviser Nageswaran to brief Parliament panel on economic growth roadmap on Friday - The Statesman**
Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran will brief the Parliament Standing Committee on Finance on the 'Roadmap for Indian economic growth in light of global economic and geopolitical circumstances' on Friday. The committee, headed by Lok Sabha member Bhartruhari Mahtab, is reviewing the roadmap due to uncertainties in India's export growth and the need to understand strategies for domestic growth. India recently overtook Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy, with a GDP of USD 4.187 trillion and a per capita GDP of USD 2,934. The International Monetary Fund has projected India to become the fourth-largest economy in 2025, and the World Bank and other international development organisations have also projected high GDP growth trends in the coming years, with some expecting growth to exceed 6.5 per cent. According to the National Statistics Office, India's GDP growth for the fourth quarter of financial year 2024-25 stood at 7.4 per cent, while for the full financial year 2024-25, the real GDP growth stood at 6.5 per cent.

**World Economic Forum Warns of Global Economic Fragility**
The World Economic Forum's 'Chief Economists Outlook' report highlights growing concerns about the fragility of the global economy. Based on a survey conducted between April 3 and 17, 2025, the report collects the perspectives of chief economists from the public and private sectors. Experts warn that the state of the global economy will significantly deteriorate, mainly due to abrupt changes in US commercial policy. The US has imposed historic tariff increases, including a 10% general tariff and up to 145% on Chinese products. China has retaliated with export restrictions on strategic minerals. Although a 90-day pause in the tariff escalation was agreed upon, experts believe that uncertainty persists. The report states that US commercial policy decisions are perceived as a long-term structural change, not a temporary disruption. 79% of surveyed economists share this view. The risks are not limited to the US. In Europe, a weak growth persists, but signs of recovery are seen, driven by more expansive fiscal policies, particularly in Germany. In China, the 5% growth target is met with skepticism, with the IMF reducing its projections to 4% due to internal and external factors affecting demand and the dynamism of the real estate sector. In Latin America, the situation is equally challenging, with a 2% growth expectation for 2025, down from 2.4% in the previous year. The report highlights the growing fragmentation of the global economy, with 98% of economists expecting it to accelerate in the remainder of the year. 94% anticipate that economic nationalism will increasingly influence policy decisions. The uncertainty has led to a paralysis in business decision-making, with 87% of experts believing that companies are delaying strategic investments, reorganizing supply chains, and diversifying operations to reduce risks. The uncertainty has become a structural feature of the global economy, with over 80% of surveyed economists rating it as 'very high' and only a slight majority expecting it to decrease in the next year. The areas most affected will be trade, GDP growth, and foreign direct investment. In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a double-edged factor. While 45% expect it to be disruptive in 2025, 81% believe it can contribute between 1 and 10 percentage points to global growth in the next decade. However, its impact on employment is uncertain, with 47% anticipating net job losses and only 19% expecting net gains. The most promising areas are automation of tasks and acceleration of innovation. The report concludes that AI can become the main driver of economic innovation if it is properly channeled, but also warns of associated risks, such as market concentration, unemployment, increased inequality, and disinformation. Governments and companies must prepare to integrate AI into their operations, with 89% of economists believing it is essential to invest in AI infrastructure and 75% seeing a need for public investment in training and labor retraining. Businesses should prioritize redesigning processes, improving data infrastructure, and strengthening cybersecurity.

**India’s GDP victory over Japan is still a year away. Here's why**
India's GDP is expected to surpass Japan's in current dollars by March 2026, according to estimates. India's GDP in current prices for January-March 2025 quarter was Rs 88.17 trillion, or annualised Rs 352.7 trillion. Assuming a 10% annual growth rate, India's GDP is expected to reach $4.54 trillion by March 2026. Japan's GDP, on the other hand, is estimated to be $4.38 trillion in March 2025, with a nominal growth rate of 3.4% per year. However, changes in exchange rates can affect these estimates, and the conclusion may be delayed beyond March 2026. Surjit S Bhalla, chairperson of the Technical Expert Group for the first official Household Income Survey for India, notes that what matters is equivalence in per capita GDP, and India is still decades away from achieving this, whether measured in current $ or PPP $ or constant dollars. Bhalla also criticizes the decision-making bureaucracy for losing respect for data quality, citing the example of the bad quality household consumer expenditure data for 2017-18, which has still not been released.

**Spain's Tourism Sector Could Exceed €260 Billion by 2025, According to WTTC**
According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Spain's tourism sector is expected to exceed €260 billion by 2025, with a year-on-year increase of 4.7%. The sector is projected to account for 3.2 million jobs in Spain, equivalent to 14.4% of total employment. International tourism spending is expected to reach €113.2 billion, with a year-on-year growth of 5.7%, while domestic spending could reach €84.9 billion, 2.4% more than the previous year. Julia Simpson, President and CEO of WTTC, said, 'A look back to 2024 shows that the Spanish tourism sector experienced its best year since 2019, with a contribution to GDP of €248.7 billion, or 15.6% of the economy.' The WTTC also projects that by 2035, the tourism sector could contribute €315.7 billion to the GDP, representing more than 17% of the Spanish economy, as well as 4 million jobs. In the European Union, the travel and tourism sector contributed almost €1.8 trillion to the region's GDP in 2024, or more than 10% of its economy. By 2025, the WTTC forecasts that the regional sector will reach almost €1.9 trillion, representing 10.5% of the EU economy.

**Charted: Falling GDP Growth Forecasts for 2025**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded its global real GDP growth forecast from 3.3% in January 2025 to 2.8% in April 2025 due to rising trade uncertainty and economic slowdowns. The IMF has also revised 2026 projections downward, with global real GDP growth now projected at 3% next year, down from 3.3% in January. The U.S. economy is expected to grow just 1.7% in 2026, with the impact of tariffs and trade wars continuously affecting growth over the next year. Major economies such as the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have seen significant downgrades in their GDP growth forecasts, while Russia is the only country on the list with an upward revision.

**IMF: Tariffs to Drive Global Public Debt to Exceed COVID-19 Peak by 2030**
According to the latest 'Fiscal Monitor Report' by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the economic pressure brought by the US's significant increase in tariffs will drive global public debt to exceed the peak level during the COVID-19 pandemic by 2030. The report predicts that the global public debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 95.1% this year, and to 99.6% by 2030, surpassing the 98.9% peak in 2020. The report attributes the worsening outlook and increased risks to US tariffs, retaliatory measures by other countries, and extremely high policy uncertainty. In extreme cases, the ratio could rise to over 117% by 2027, the highest since World War II. The report also notes that higher defense spending, increased social support needs, and potentially higher debt costs due to inflation are adding to government budget pressures. The report forecasts a global government deficit of 5.1% of GDP this year, up 0.1 percentage points from last year, and higher than the 3.7% in 2022 and 9.5% in 2020 during the pandemic. As IMF's report stated, 'The global economy is facing a perfect storm of challenges, including high inflation, rising interest rates, and a surge in government debt.'

**Peak Globalisation? | Electronics Weekly**
Global trade growth stagnated due to the financial crisis, US-China trade tensions, and the Covid-19 pandemic. However, world trade bounced back with the global trade-to-GDP ratio peaking at 62.8 percent in 2022. According to the World Bank, the ratio dropped to 58.5 percent in 2023. The re-emergence of nationalism and protectionism may have seen the peak of globalisation, as President Trump's trade war 2.0 threatens to upend the low-tariff era.

**Global Public Debt to Reach 95% of GDP by 2025, Warns IMF**
The global public debt is expected to continue growing, according to the Fiscal Monitor report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on April 23. The report states that the public debt will reach 95% of the world's GDP by 2025, and could even surpass 100% by 2030. The IMF has also lowered its forecast for global economic growth to 2.8% in 2025, down from 3.3% in January, due to the trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump. This will lead to lower government revenues and increased pressure on countries with high debt levels to either balance their budgets or increase spending. The report warns that the public debt could reach 117% of GDP by 2027, the highest level since World War II. The IMF attributes the growth of public debt to the dynamics in the US and China. The report also notes that the US is expected to see a slow decline in its budget deficit over the next two years, but its public debt will continue to rise, reaching 122.5% of GDP in 2025 and over 128% in 2030. 'The trade war is causing significant economic difficulties and will lead to increased requests for public support for affected sectors,' said the report. 'In a highly unfavorable scenario, the public debt could surge even further,' it added.

**IMF predicts global public debt to reach 95.1% of GDP in 2025**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that global public debt will increase by 2.8 percentage points this year, reaching 95.1% of the world's GDP, and warns that it could increase even more due to the uncertainty introduced by the commercial war initiated by the US, according to the latest Fiscal Monitor published by the organization. The increase, which almost triples the increase in debt recorded between 2023 and 2024 (1 point), occurs in a context of economic growth slowdown due to the tariff conflict, in which, in addition to increasing the yields of debt of weighty economies or worsening the risk premiums of emerging ones, a greater expenditure on defense is expected, especially in Europe, and a reduction in foreign aid. The report, released this Wednesday in the framework of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings, points out that the risks had already grown compared to its previous Fiscal Monitor, published in October last year. In the worst-case scenario, global public debt could exceed 117% of GDP in 2027, the highest level since World War II. After the tariff escalation initiated in 2025, a scenario could be drawn that is even worse if fiscal revenues and economic performance decrease significantly compared to current forecasts 'due to the increase in tariffs and the weakening of growth prospects'. The analysis concludes that most countries will need to bet on a complicated balance: advocating for a gradual fiscal adjustment with 'credible medium-term deadlines' to reduce their liabilities, and at the same time raising additional firewalls in the face of the current uncertainty. The fiscal deficit also increases According to the report, this year the global fiscal deficit will also grow by a tenth from 2024, to reach 5.1% of the world's GDP, although the IMF predicts a decline over the next exercises. Like debt, last year the deficit advanced a tenth compared to 2023 and stood at 5% of GDP, reflecting the persistent consequences of the pandemic and showing a prominent volume of emerging and low-income countries that are over-indebted or at risk of being so. The increase in the deficit for this group was 3 tenths last year (compared to only one tenth in the case of advanced economies), while their public debt increased together by 2.1 points to reach 69.5% of GDP. After three consecutive years of reductions, the main economies also increased their debt in 2024. Among the main drivers, countries such as France, Brazil (whose volumes increased respectively by more than three points), China (more than six points), the UK or the US (almost a point in both cases) stand out. The report notes that the deficit and liabilities of the two main economies in the world 'continue to have a critical impact on global fiscal developments'. In the case of the US, it is expected to reduce its deficit by 8 tenths in 2025 compared to last year, to 6.5% of its GDP, and to continue this trend in the next years, but the IMF admits that its projections are 'very uncertain' due to variables such as tariffs or the possibility that Congress manages to extend and re-draw this year the law of fiscal cuts that Trump himself promoted in 2018, in his first term. The IMF considers that China's plans for fiscal expansion this year are 'a positive step' and also praises the reforms to increase the retirement age, although the path of high levels of deficit that it predicts (an 8.6% of GDP this year and always above 8% until 2030) project that its debt will reach 116% of GDP within five years. Also in this case, the calculations are very uncertain mainly due to how the commercial conflict that Beijing maintains with Washington develops.

**Recession Odds Upped By IMF To 40%, But Polymarket Traders See Less Likelihood As Stocks, Bitcoin Rally**
Despite the International Monetary Fund (IMF) increasing the odds of a U.S. recession in 2025 to 40%, Polymarket traders have lowered the likelihood of a recession to 53% from 35% a month ago. This decrease in probability coincides with a rally in the stock market and cryptocurrencies, following U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's hint at a potential de-escalation in trade hostilities with China. The IMF attributed the recession forecast to President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which they believe will lead to a 1.8% U.S. GDP growth rate in 2025, a 0.9 percentage point cut from their previous forecast. Meanwhile, $3.189 million has been bet on the outcome, with the market resolving to 'Yes' if the National Bureau of Economic Research declares a recession before January 1, 2026, or if the seasonally adjusted annualized percent change in quarterly U.S. real GDP is negative for two consecutive quarters.

**Wanna Bet on a Recession This Year? You Can Do Exactly That**
Following President Donald Trump's announcement of new global tariffs, economists have revised their forecasts for U.S. GDP growth, while increasing their predictions for a recession. Prediction markets, such as Polymarket and Kalshi, have seen a rise in the odds of a recession, with Polymarket's odds increasing from 30% to 56% and Kalshi's odds at 60%. This means that if you bet $1 on a recession and are correct, you would win $1.75 on Polymarket and $2 on Kalshi, while a correct bet on no recession would win $2.27 on Polymarket and $3 on Kalshi.

**US Debt Burden May Exceed World War II Levels, Warns Congressional Budget Office**
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has warned that the US debt burden may exceed the peak levels of World War II in the coming years. According to the CBO's projections, the US debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 107% in 2029, surpassing the historical maximum of the 1940s. By 2055, this ratio may reach 156%. The CBO's predictions were made just days after Moody's rating agency expressed concern about the sustainability of the US fiscal situation. Moody's warned that trade tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump may hinder efforts to control the federal budget deficit by increasing interest rates. 'Increasing debt will slow economic growth, increase interest payments to foreign holders of US debt, and create significant risks to fiscal and economic prospects. It will also limit lawmakers' ability to make policy decisions,' the CBO said. Despite a significant increase in debt burden, growth is expected to be less rapid than previously thought, due to the CBO's assumptions of lower interest rates, lower Medicare spending, and higher revenues. The Trump administration aims to find ways to implement its pre-election promise of significant tax cuts for businesses and households. President Trump has tasked tech billionaire Elon Musk with finding $2 trillion to reduce federal spending by mid-2026. Trump also considers reducing the corporate tax rate on domestic activity from 21% to 15%. However, the CBO does not take into account the impact of tax incentives that may become permanent. According to the CBO, this would increase the US debt-to-GDP ratio by 47 percentage points by 2054. The Trump administration believes that revenue from large tariffs can compensate for the potential loss of trillions of dollars from reducing income and corporate taxes. However, economists at the Peterson Institute in Washington question the claim that tariffs can compensate for the loss of income tax revenue. Since the pandemic, the US federal government has faced a budget deficit every year. Last year, spending exceeded revenue by 6.4% of GDP. The CBO predicts that the deficit will likely remain high and reach 7.3% by 2055, slightly lower than expected in March 2024. According to projections, long-term growth in the US will be slightly lower than previously expected, due to reduced immigration, which will lead to a decrease in the US population in 2033.

**Inflation Bets Soar As 10-Year Breakeven Rate Hits 16-Month Peak - iShares TIPS Bond ETF (ARCA:TIP), US Treasury 10 Year Note ETF (NASDAQ:UTEN)**
Market sentiment suggests that inflation will worsen, with the 10-year breakeven inflation rate reaching a 16-month peak of 2.45%. This implies that investors predict annual inflation to average 2.45% over the next decade. The shift in market sentiment is influenced by trade policy uncertainty and is already affecting Federal Reserve rate expectations and bond market positioning. According to Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, rising tariffs on imported goods would contribute to higher consumer prices. 'While the exact timing and size of higher tariffs is anyone's guess, Comerica's forecast assumes that tariffs do increase on American purchases of foreign goods this year,' Adams said. Market-implied odds indicate a 58% chance that the annual Consumer Price Index will hit at least 4% in one or more months this year. For January 2025 alone, it's more likely than not that the CPI inflation exceeds 2.9%.
