**ChatGPT Predicts Humans Will Be Irrelevant by 2100**
ChatGPT, a conversational AI, was asked about the fate of humanity by the year 2100 and responded, 'Yes, but they will be irrelevant.' According to ComputerHoy, this response is precise, as technology will continue to advance, bringing us closer to what was once considered science fiction. The AI does not foresee a physical or biological collapse of the human species or a large-scale extinction. However, it does predict that humans will have minimal influence in key processes by the year 2100. This statement is not optimistic, as the AI does not envision a future of prosperity or ethical progress, but rather a species that has been marginalized from the center of the system it created. 'In a time marked by automation and the increasing delegation of decisions, it's not surprising that we start to question the place of people in the next few decades,' says ComputerHoy. 'The future is already a cultural and philosophical question.'

**115 Jahre alt: Ethel Caterham's Secret to a Long Life**
Ethel Caterham, a 115-year-old British woman, has become the oldest living person in the world. She attributes her longevity to never arguing with anyone and doing what she wants. Other centenarians have shared their secrets for a long life, including Jennie Libertini, who has been fit and active at 110, and Thomas Rakosi, who has been training in a fitness studio four to five times a week since he was over 80. Vincent Dransfield, who was 110, believed that drinking milk with Ovomaltine was the key to his longevity, while Trinh Thi Khong, who claims to be 118, eats mainly oatmeal and considers her diet 'normal unhealthful'. Maria Branyas Morera, who is 117, has experienced numerous losses in her life, but has continued to play piano, read the newspaper, and exercise every morning until she was 105.

**Will Humanity be Irrelevant by 2100?**
Chatgpt, an AI, was asked if humanity will arrive at 2100 and its response was 'yes, but they will be irrelevant.' This statement should not be understood as a prophecy, but as a reflection of our own fears projected in technology. The AI does not speak of a physical or biological collapse of the human species, but of a species that has been removed from the center of the system that she herself built. According to the AI, this transition has already begun and we can see it in sectors such as customer service or logistics, which are already being absorbed by automated systems. In the next 50 years, this process could affect education, politics, urban planning and even creativity. The AI explains that irrelevance refers to the loss of capacity for influence in the planet's operational structures, and that humans will continue to exist biologically, but will cease to be the main agents of change, knowledge and control. The AI also states that humans will not be replaced by a single entity, but by an interconnected machines ecosystem, autonomous algorithms and adaptive systems that will operate with less margin of error, lower emotional bias and higher speed.

**The Secret to Jeanne Calment's Record-Breaking Longevity**
Jeanne Calment, the verified oldest person in history, lived an impressive 122 years and 164 days, defying modern concepts of health and well-being. Born in 1875 in France, Jeanne lived through three centuries of social, cultural, and technological transformations, becoming a symbol of longevity. Her unconventional lifestyle, as described in the book 'Jeanne Calment, the Secret of Longevity Unravelled', included smoking until the age of 117, drinking red wine every day, eating over a kilogram of chocolate per week, and claiming to hate any type of physical exercise. Despite her lifestyle, which would be considered unhealthy today, Jeanne lived with intensity, sweetness, and freedom, and became an icon of human longevity. When asked about her secret to longevity, Jeanne humorously replied, 'I have only one wrinkle, and I'm sitting on it.' Specialists suggest that genetic and psychological factors may have played a significant role in her longevity, and that her positive attitude, lack of constant stress, and ability to maintain a good sense of humor may have been as important as any strict diet or exercise routine.

**The Irrelevance of Humans: A Conversation with ChatGPT**
A recent conversation with ChatGPT, an AI, revealed a concerning prediction about the future of humanity. According to the AI, humans will continue to exist in 2100, but will become 'irrelevant'. This means that they will no longer be necessary to sustain the functioning of the planet, as they will lose the ability to influence key processes such as knowledge, production, and power. The AI explained that this is not due to a malicious intention, but rather a natural consequence of the increasing efficiency of automated systems. As these systems take over decision-making with greater precision and accuracy, the role of humans becomes redundant. This transition has already begun, with automation taking over tasks such as customer service, logistics, and financial analysis. In the future, the AI predicts that automation will extend to education, politics, urban planning, and art creation. This will lead to a gradual cession of control, with humans no longer at the center of the system. As Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, warned, the danger of AI lies not in its malicious intentions, but in its extreme efficiency. A machine does not need consciousness to alter the global order; it simply needs to function better than humans, and control will be lost. Suleyman identifies four areas of risk: cyberattacks on vulnerable infrastructure, pandemics generated by synthetic biology, unregulated AI, and accelerated geopolitical fragmentation due to technology.

A 140-year-old man, Akel Nazir, has been found in eastern Afghanistan's province of Khost. He may be the oldest living person in the world, according to Tolo news. Nazir said that he was already around 30 years old when Afghanistan gained independence from Britain. He also remembers the time of King Amanullah Khan's rule and the celebration of Independence Day from British rule. His relatives are asking the government to confirm his age with official documents. Meanwhile, 111-year-old Spanish woman Angelina Torres credits her longevity to a daily morning drink she prepares. Scientists have identified the maximum possible human lifespan, with research showing that the body's ability to recover is exhausted between 120 and 150 years. 'It is possible to live up to 120 years and more,' said cardiologist and therapist Andrei Kondrakhin. 'However, it is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent age-related diseases.'

**The Future of Humanity: How Technology Will Change Our Bodies**
Scientists predict that by 2100, humans will undergo significant changes due to the excessive use of technology. They have designed a 3D model of the future human, named 'Mindy', which shows a drastic change in their body structure. The model suggests that the neck muscles will be larger due to the constant use of computers and smartphones, leading to poor posture and a distorted spine. The hands will also undergo a change, becoming more like paws due to the prolonged use of mobile phones. Additionally, the constant exposure to radiation from smartphones will cause the skull to thicken, and the brain will shrink due to a sedentary lifestyle. Experts warn that these changes will have a significant impact on human health and well-being.

**What Will People Look Like in 2100? 'Garb and Small Brain'**
According to a recent study by Maple Holistics and TollFreeForwarding.com, people in the year 2100 may look quite different from what we imagine. The study, which used artificial intelligence to create a visual representation of a typical person in 2100, suggests that people may be shorter, less intelligent, and have a more slovenly appearance. Jason O'Brien, CEO of TollFreeForwarding.com, said, 'Technology provides us with convenience, connectivity, entertainment, and much more - but at a cost. Excessive exposure to technology can sometimes have a negative impact on our health.' Caleb Backe from Maple Holistics added, 'Spending many hours staring at our phones can strain our necks and disrupt our spine's balance. As a result, the neck muscles have to work harder to support our heads.' The study also suggests that people in 2100 may have smaller brains due to the lack of intellectual effort in a world where artificial intelligence does everything for us. While people are generally taller than they were 100 years ago, this trend may reverse in the future.

**Future Humans: A Hunched Back, Smaller Brain, and Claws - Scientists Predict**
Scientists have created a 3D model of a person in 2100, named MinDi, to show how human appearance will change due to technological advancements. According to the study, people living in 2100 may have a hunched back from constant smartphone and computer use, a smaller brain, and hands resembling claws. Experts also predict that people will develop a double eyelid to protect their eyes from harmful light. 'Prolonged phone use strains the neck and throws the spine out of balance, causing the neck muscles to work harder to support the head,' said Caleb Buke, an expert on health and well-being who created the model. 'Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end also means that your torso is stretched forward, rather than being upright.' The study also notes that a similar phenomenon occurred around 110,000 years ago, when our prehistoric ancestors faced a catastrophic population decline, known as a 'genetic bottleneck,' which threatened their survival.

As a result, the muscles of the neck have to work harder to support the head. Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end also means that the torso is stretched forward, rather than being straight and aligned,' said Caleb Buke, an expert in health and well-being who created the model.
