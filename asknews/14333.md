**ChatGPT Predicts Humans Will Be Irrelevant by 2100**
ChatGPT, a conversational AI, was asked about the fate of humanity by the year 2100 and responded, 'Yes, but they will be irrelevant.' According to ComputerHoy, this response is precise, as technology will continue to advance, bringing us closer to what was once considered science fiction. The AI does not foresee a physical or biological collapse of the human species or a large-scale extinction. However, it does predict that humans will have minimal influence in key processes by the year 2100. This statement is not optimistic, as the AI does not envision a future of prosperity or ethical progress, but rather a species that has been marginalized from the center of the system it created. 'In a time marked by automation and the increasing delegation of decisions, it's not surprising that we start to question the place of people in the next few decades,' says ComputerHoy. 'The future is already a cultural and philosophical question.'

**115 Jahre alt: Ethel Caterham's Secret to a Long Life**
Ethel Caterham, a 115-year-old British woman, has become the oldest living person in the world. She attributes her longevity to never arguing with anyone and doing what she wants. Other centenarians have shared their secrets for a long life, including Jennie Libertini, who has been fit and active at 110, and Thomas Rakosi, who has been training in a fitness studio four to five times a week since he was over 80. Vincent Dransfield, who was 110, believed that drinking milk with Ovomaltine was the key to his longevity, while Trinh Thi Khong, who claims to be 118, eats mainly oatmeal and considers her diet 'normal unhealthful'. Maria Branyas Morera, who is 117, has experienced numerous losses in her life, but has continued to play piano, read the newspaper, and exercise every morning until she was 105.

**The Oldest Person in the World: A Changing Title**
After the death of María Branyas in 2024, Inah Canabarro Lucas became the oldest living person at 116 years old. However, she passed away on April 30, 2025. The title is now held by Ethel Caterham, a British woman who is 115 years old. Jeanne Calment holds the record for the oldest person to have ever lived, at 122 years and 164 days. According to the Gerontology Research Group (GRG), there are currently between 300 and 450 people who are at least 110 years old, known as 'Supercentenarians'. Many of them live in the 'Blue Zones', regions where people have been found to live longer than average. While the exact reasons for their longevity are not scientifically proven, factors such as a healthy diet, physical activity, and social connections are thought to contribute to their long lives. In Germany, Charlotte Kretschmann held the title of oldest citizen at 114 years old, and was also officially recognized as the oldest German to have ever lived. She set a new record as the oldest person on Instagram, with 14,100 followers at the time of her death in August 2024. The current oldest person in Germany is not yet known.

**World's Oldest Person Passes Away at 116 Years Old**
According to the 'Longevity Quest' database, Kanabaru, born on June 8, 1908, passed away in Brazil at the age of 116 years and 326 days. The database noted that despite claiming a birthdate of May 27, 1908, research suggests it was 11 days later. Due to her frail health in childhood, many doubted her ability to live to such an old age. When asked about the secret to her longevity, Kanabaru attributed it to God, saying 'It is the secret of life. It is the secret of everything.' Kanabaru became a nun in 1934 and worked as a teacher, according to the database. With her passing, the title of world's oldest person is now held by Ethel Catherwood from England, who is currently 115 years and 252 days old, according to the 'Longevity Quest' database. Isabel Rosa Pereira, who is 114 years old, has become the oldest person in Brazil, succeeding Kanabaru.

**A 140-year-old man may be the oldest living person in the world**
A 140-year-old man, Akel Nazir, has been found in eastern Afghanistan's province of Khost. He may be the oldest living person in the world, according to Tolo news. Nazir said that he was already around 30 years old when Afghanistan gained independence from Britain. He also remembers the time of King Amanullah Khan's rule and the celebration of Independence Day from British rule. His relatives are asking the government to confirm his age with official documents. Meanwhile, 111-year-old Spanish woman Angelina Torres credits her longevity to a daily morning drink she prepares. Scientists have identified the maximum possible human lifespan, with research showing that the body's ability to recover is exhausted between 120 and 150 years. 'It is possible to live up to 120 years and more,' said cardiologist and therapist Andrei Kondrakhin. 'However, it is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent age-related diseases.'

**The Future of Humanity: How Technology Will Change Our Bodies**
Scientists predict that by 2100, humans will undergo significant changes due to the excessive use of technology. They have designed a 3D model of the future human, named 'Mindy', which shows a drastic change in their body structure. The model suggests that the neck muscles will be larger due to the constant use of computers and smartphones, leading to poor posture and a distorted spine. The hands will also undergo a change, becoming more like paws due to the prolonged use of mobile phones. Additionally, the constant exposure to radiation from smartphones will cause the skull to thicken, and the brain will shrink due to a sedentary lifestyle. Experts warn that these changes will have a significant impact on human health and well-being.

**What Will People Look Like in 2100? 'Garb and Small Brain'**
According to a recent study by Maple Holistics and TollFreeForwarding.com, people in the year 2100 may look quite different from what we imagine. The study, which used artificial intelligence to create a visual representation of a typical person in 2100, suggests that people may be shorter, less intelligent, and have a more slovenly appearance. Jason O'Brien, CEO of TollFreeForwarding.com, said, 'Technology provides us with convenience, connectivity, entertainment, and much more - but at a cost. Excessive exposure to technology can sometimes have a negative impact on our health.' Caleb Backe from Maple Holistics added, 'Spending many hours staring at our phones can strain our necks and disrupt our spine's balance. As a result, the neck muscles have to work harder to support our heads.' The study also suggests that people in 2100 may have smaller brains due to the lack of intellectual effort in a world where artificial intelligence does everything for us. While people are generally taller than they were 100 years ago, this trend may reverse in the future.

**Future Humans: A Hunched Back, Smaller Brain, and Claws - Scientists Predict**
Scientists have created a 3D model of a person in 2100, named MinDi, to show how human appearance will change due to technological advancements. According to the study, people living in 2100 may have a hunched back from constant smartphone and computer use, a smaller brain, and hands resembling claws. Experts also predict that people will develop a double eyelid to protect their eyes from harmful light. 'Prolonged phone use strains the neck and throws the spine out of balance, causing the neck muscles to work harder to support the head,' said Caleb Buke, an expert on health and well-being who created the model. 'Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end also means that your torso is stretched forward, rather than being upright.' The study also notes that a similar phenomenon occurred around 110,000 years ago, when our prehistoric ancestors faced a catastrophic population decline, known as a 'genetic bottleneck,' which threatened their survival.

Additionally, scientists suggest that people may develop a second neck to protect their eyes from harmful light. 'Hours spent on the phone strain the neck and throw the spine out of balance. As a result, the muscles of the neck have to work harder to support the head. Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end also means that the torso is stretched forward, rather than being straight and aligned,' said Caleb Buke, an expert in health and well-being who created the model.
