**US-China Tariff Reduction Sparks Sharp Increase in New York Stock Exchange**
The three major indices of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ended the day in a sharp upward trend on May 12, 2025. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow Jones) rose 2.81% from the previous trading day, while the S&P 500 index, which is dominated by large-cap stocks, rose 3.26%, and the Nasdaq index, which is dominated by tech stocks, rose 4.35%. The sharp increase is attributed to the US-China tariff reduction. 'It was a great day,' said investors, as the market responded positively to the news. The market's reaction is a welcome relief for those who have been waiting for a rebound. 'The market is showing signs of recovery,' said analysts, as the indices continue to rise. However, it is too early to say whether this trend will continue. 'We need to see more data before we can make any conclusions,' said experts. The market's reaction is a positive sign for the economy, but it is still too early to say whether it will have a lasting impact. 'We need to be cautious and see how the market reacts in the coming days,' said investors. The market's reaction is a reminder that the economy is still fragile and that we need to be careful not to get too optimistic. 'We need to be prepared for any eventuality,' said experts.

**S&P 500 Earnings Revision Signals Steep Cut to 2026 Outlook | Investing.com ZA**
S&P Global has revised its earnings estimates for the S&P 500 index downward, slashing estimates from $292/share in 2026 to $274/share. This revision is a significant departure from the long-term growth trend of earnings, which has historically correlated closely with GDP growth. The current linear growth trend for S&P 500 earnings is around $220/share in 2026, but earnings growth tends to revert to the long-term trend. Analysts' forecasts have consistently been overly optimistic, leading to mean-reverting events like the current revision. Valuations remain an issue, with the 'P' rising as the 'E' declines, increasing the valuation risk for investors. The market will face headwinds in 2025, and investors should remain cautious with risk-taking.

**Goldman Sachs Warns of Market Risks Despite Strong Earnings Seas**
Despite a strong first-quarter earnings season and positive trade negotiation signals, Goldman Sachs' Chief Strategist David Kostin warns of potential market risks. While S&P 500 companies saw a 12% year-over-year earnings growth, Goldman Sachs economists predict GDP growth will slow down, maintaining a forecast of only a 3% increase in S&P 500 earnings per share by 2025. Major tech stocks, including Apple, Microsoft, and Google, remain the core engine of earnings growth, but their concentration of market power poses a risk. Goldman has raised the S&P 500's 12-month target to 6200 points, indicating a potential 9% rise, but short-term returns are expected to remain flat due to concerns about growth and high risk premiums.

**The Dollar's Lost Exclusivity: A Shift in Market Sentiment**
The recent 90-day tariff delay by the US has led to a 14% increase in the S&P 500 index. This has shifted the strategy from 'sell America' to 'buy American'. The USD index has seen its best daily gain since the November elections due to the reduction of import tariffs for China from 145% to 30%. According to Bloomberg, the updated tariffs will slow down the US GDP by 1.5% and increase the personal consumption expenditure index by 0.9% over the next one to two years. The author believes that while the dollar has lost its exclusivity, the potential for a EURUSD correction is limited. The upcoming inflation data will be crucial in determining the future of the greenback's correlation with the S&P 500. If inflation accelerates, it could be bad news for the S&P 500, but good news for the dollar. The author suggests that a test of support at 1.1065 will be crucial for EURUSD, and a success in this test will allow for the accumulation of shorts, while a failure will lead to a reversal and the opening of long positions.

**Wall Street: analysts reduce estimates for S&P 500 earnings**
Analysts have reduced their estimates for the S&P 500's earnings per share (Eps) in the second quarter of 2025 by 2.4%, according to FacSet. This is a significant downward revision, indicating increased short-term pessimism on Wall Street. While the Eps is still expected to rise by 5.7%, the reduction in estimates is higher than the average contraction over the past 10 years (1.6%) and the past 20 years (1.9%). Analysts have also reduced their expectations for the entire 2025, with the Eps of the S&P 500 decreasing from $274.12 to $265.68. The energy sector has seen the largest downward revision, with a 14.8% decrease in estimates, due to the decline in oil prices. The industrial and discretionary consumption sectors have also seen significant downward revisions, with contractions of 4.7% and 4% respectively, due to the weak economic prospects following the trade war. Other sectors, such as healthcare (-2.8%), finance (-2.6%), real estate (-0.4%), and communication services (-0.2%), have also seen downward revisions. In contrast, the information technology sector has seen a slight upward revision (+0.2%) and the utility sector has seen a moderate upward revision (+0.8%). The blended Eps growth rate for the first quarter is 13.4%, which would be the second consecutive quarter of double-digit Eps growth and the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year Eps growth.

**Goldman Sachs Raises S&P 500 Target Stock Price Amid Easing US-China Trade Tensions**
Goldman Sachs Group has raised its target stock price for the S&P 500 index, citing the easing of US-China trade tensions and the resurgence of 'buy America' trades. Strategists at Goldman Sachs, led by David Costin, expect the S&P 500 to reach 6,500 in the next 12 months, up from their previous forecast of 6,200. This represents a 11% increase from the current level. The move comes after the US and China agreed to reduce their tariffs for a certain period, leading to a rally in US stocks on May 12. However, Goldman Sachs remains cautious, noting that the market's optimism about economic growth is already high and that there is uncertainty about the degree of slowdown in the economy and corporate earnings. As a result, the strategists predict that there will be a limit to the upward movement of stock prices over the next few months. 'The market's view on economic growth is already quite optimistic, and there is uncertainty about the degree of slowdown in the economy and corporate earnings,' said the strategists in a report. 'Therefore, we expect a limit to the upward movement of stock prices over the next few months.' Goldman Sachs had previously lowered its S&P 500 forecast twice in March due to concerns about rising recession risks and trade uncertainty. However, the recent agreement has alleviated these concerns, particularly for large-cap tech stocks, while there is still variability in overall earnings expectations. Goldman Sachs notes that while growth expectations are improving, the 2025 tariff rate is expected to be significantly higher than in 2024, putting pressure on profit margins. However, the firm believes that companies can maintain profit margins even in a cost-inflation scenario, and recommends focusing on stocks with strong pricing power.

**Will 2025 Be The Year Of Diversification In Equities?**
As U.S. equities reach record highs, investors are looking to diversify their portfolios to manage risk. The weight of U.S. equities as a percentage of global equity has increased to nearly 67% by the end of 2024, with the top five names in the S&P 500 (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) making up nearly 29% of the index. To proactively manage concentration risk, investors can consider alternative asset classes like commodities and cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index has shown its ability to reduce risk during market selloffs, and sector performance has been mixed since the presidential election. International equity markets, such as Japanese equities, are gaining attention, and commodity markets could continue to be active in 2025 due to geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures. The adoption of commodity futures and cryptocurrency investment vehicles is expected to rise as regulatory frameworks and infrastructure improve.

**S&P 500 Expectations Under Pressure**
The expectations for the S&P 500 index in 2025 are still high, despite the economic challenges facing the US. The index is expected to stabilize at around 20% growth, but some analysts predict a recession. The tariffs imposed by Trump have increased the uncertainty in the market, and the expectations for corporate earnings have been revised downward. The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 has increased to 19, which is higher than the historical average. The Goldman Sachs model predicts that a 5% increase in tariffs will lead to a 1-2% decline in the S&P 500's earnings per share. The uncertainty surrounding the US economy and the impact of Trump's policies on the market has led to a decrease in investor confidence. The US is no longer the 'cleanest dirty shirt' as it was in the past, but it remains the most expensive destination for investors. The S&P 500 may end the year at around 4,000 points, not 5,000 points as predicted by some analysts.

**Goldman Sachs Lowers S&P 500 Projections Amid Tariff Policy and Weaker Growth Outlook**
Goldman Sachs has reduced its projections for the S&P 500, citing President Donald Trump's tariff policy, a weaker growth outlook, and higher inflation than expected in the US. The bank now expects the index to close the year around 5,700 points, down from its previous forecast of 6,200 points. Analysts led by David Kostin have lowered their estimate for the S&P 500's return in 3 and 12 months to a decline of 5% and an increase of 6%, respectively. The expected earnings per share of the S&P 500 was adjusted from a 7% increase to a 3% increase in 2025 and from a 7% increase to a 6% increase in 2026.

**S&P 500 Expected to Rise 10% in 2025**
Investors are expecting a 10% increase in the S&P 500 index by the end of 2025, according to a survey by Reuters. The index has only risen 0.9% so far this year after falling 3% from its recent historical high. Experts believe that a bullish trend could continue throughout 2025 due to the robust growth of corporate profits and the potential economic boost from Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial, said, 'The economy is growing, inflation is stable and much lower than it was six months or a year ago, and corporate profits are increasing.' However, he also warned about the potential impact of Trump's protectionist policies, saying, 'What could derail some of that is tariffs. That's the biggest known unknown for markets and investors.' Despite this, Kristina Hooper of Invesco believes that tariffs will be 'less important than what's happening fundamentally,' such as corporate profits. Analysts expect a 11.1% growth in S&P 500 profits in 2025, compared to 11.7% in 2024.

**US Stocks Face Risks and Challenges as Market Enters a Crossroads**
US stocks have lagged behind their global peers in 2025, despite a 20% increase in 2024. Investors are concerned that Trump's protectionist policies and proposals to impose tariffs on imports, affecting key sectors such as cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, could fuel inflation and negatively impact the economic landscape. Additionally, growing concerns about the overvaluation of tech giants like Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft have complicated the market for investors. While some giants like Meta and Nvidia continue to advance, the contribution of the 'Magnificent Seven' to earnings growth has slowed since the end of 2023. According to Chronert, who accurately predicted an optimistic forecast last year, the momentum must now come from other companies within the S&P 500 index. Although there are signs that the rally could extend to other large-cap companies, this phenomenon has been limited to a few large companies so far. With a year-end target of 6,500 points for the S&P 500 index, implying a 6% growth from the recent close, Chronert believes that the market may face more challenges than expected if political risks and valuations of tech giants continue to weigh on global performance. Furthermore, a growing concern has emerged: the increasing number of unprofitable companies. Data from Finomial, a fintech company, reveals that 12% of large-cap companies and 32% of small-cap companies are unprofitable, despite the US economy being in its 16th year of expansion. This trend shows a growing internal fragility in a market that, despite high superficial returns, is beginning to show signs of wear and tear.

**The S&P 500 Soared in January. History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next. | The Motley Fool**
The S&P 500 index advanced 2.7% in January, despite rising bond yields and a decline in the technology sector. Historically, January gains have led to above-average returns for the full year. In the past three decades, the S&P 500 has moved higher in January 17 times, and the index has returned an average of 16% during years in which it increased in January. The Federal Reserve estimates economic growth will decelerate to 2.1% by the fourth quarter of 2025, and policymakers anticipate inflation will increase to 2.4%. However, the Federal Open Market Committee expects two quarter-point rate cuts this year, which could be a headwind for the stock market. Consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts call for S&P 500 companies to report faster earnings growth in 2025. The median year-end target for the S&P 500 is about 6,600 in 2025, but if earnings increase more slowly than anticipated, the index could finish the year much lower. The S&P 500 currently trades at 22 times forward earnings, a premium to the five-year average. According to FactSet Research, the index's forward PE multiple has only hit 22 during two periods in the last four decades: the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and the Covid-19 pandemic in the early 2020s. 'The S&P 500 has typically followed January gains with above-average returns for the full year. That pattern may repeat itself in 2025. But investors should be cautious in the current environment. Valuations are elevated, so any bad news could derail the stock market,' said the article. 'Fortunately, if the S&P 500 does suffer a correction or bear market this year, the drawdown would undoubtedly be a buying opportunity. Every pullback in history has been temporary, and the S&P 500 has always recouped its losses. There is no reason to expect a different outcome the next time the stock market declines.'

**The S&P 500 Soared in January. History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.**
The S&P 500 index advanced 2.7% in January, and history suggests that this momentum will continue throughout 2025. In the past three decades, the S&P 500 has moved higher in January 17 times, and this early momentum often carried into future months of the year. The index returned an average of 16% during years in which it increased in January, compared to an average of 3% during years in which it declined. The Federal Reserve estimates economic growth will decelerate to 2.1% by the fourth quarter of 2025, and policymakers anticipate inflation will increase to 2.4%. However, consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts call for S&P 500 companies to report faster earnings growth in 2025. The median year-end target for the S&P 500 is about 6,600 in 2025, but if earnings increase more slowly than anticipated, the index could finish the year much lower. Valuations are elevated, so any bad news could derail the stock market. Nevertheless, every stock market decline in history has been a temporary problem, and the S&P 500 has always recouped its losses.

**Can the US Stock Market Maintain Its Growth Pace in 2025?**
The S&P 500 index in the US may see a growth of 6-13% in 2025, following a 25% increase in 2024. According to experts interviewed by 'Vedomosti', this growth will be influenced by measures taken by new US President Donald Trump to deregulate business, reduce taxes, and stimulate production. Additionally, the growth of American stocks will be supported by a gradual decrease in inflation, high GDP growth forecasts, and expectations of resolving key global conflicts.
