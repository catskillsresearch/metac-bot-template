**Paraná's Population Expected to Reach 94% Urban by 2050**
According to a study by the Instituto Paranaense de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (Ipardes), the population of the urban areas of Paraná is expected to reach 94% by 2050, with an increase of 986,284 people in the next 25 years. The study also projects that the population living in rural areas will decrease from 11.1% to 6% in 2050. The urbanization rate in Paraná has been increasing steadily, from 58.6% in 1980 to 89% in 2022, and is expected to reach 94% by 2050. The study also highlights that 147 municipalities will have a population of 94% or more living in urban areas. The superintendente estadual do IBGE no Paraná, Elias Guilherme Ricardo, noted that the urbanization process in Paraná is accelerating, and that the state is already the fifth in Brazil with the highest population living in urban areas. 'We have identified this trend in all states and in the country as a whole, comparing also with other countries, since it has to do with similar studies on population projections,' he said. 'Paraná is not alone, but it comes in a very accelerated rhythm of urban growth, also due to the development policies and improvement of the infrastructure of the cities.'

**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**Russians Eager to Travel to Mars: 27% Want to Take the Leap**
According to a survey conducted by SuperJob for RIA Novosti among 1600 respondents, approximately one in four Russians (27%) are interested in traveling to Mars. The desire to travel to Mars is stronger among younger people. Despite this, 73% of respondents are not willing to trade Earth for Mars. Men are 1.5 times more likely to dream of flying to the Red Planet than women. In cities with a population of over a million, the most enthusiastic about traveling to Mars are residents of Ufa (38%), Yekaterinburg (37%), and Rostov-on-Don (33%). Residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg are less interested in traveling to Mars, with 25% and 26% respectively. As a reminder, Elon Musk recently announced a roadmap for Mars colonization and presented a new generation of the Starship rocket, which will travel to the Red Planet, first with robots and then with people, as Musk said, 'It's a big step for humanity.'

**Elon Musk say it's '50/50' he'll land on Mars next year and he needs to 'get lucky' - Daily Star**
Elon Musk says there is a '50/50 chance' of landing a spaceship on Mars next year, and he needs to 'get lucky'. Despite recent test flight failures, Musk remains optimistic about progress towards establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. He believes reusable rockets will enable more than a million people to live on Mars within 30 years. Musk hopes to send 20 ships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with the goal of building a self-sufficient city that could survive even if cut off from Earth. He is scouting possible sites for a Mars city, with Arcadia Planitia being the leading candidate. Musk aims to fly 100 ships to Mars between 2030 and 2031 and 500 more in 2033. He said, 'This is, like, an incredible thing to have - this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet and a new world.'

**Catalonia's Future: Preparing for a Population of 10 Million**
The Catalan government believes that the region will reach 10 million inhabitants in the near future and is preparing for the challenges that come with it. The current population of 8 million is expected to grow due to immigration, with the government projecting that the population will reach 10 million by 2052. However, some experts argue that this growth is not sustainable and that the region's infrastructure and services are not equipped to handle it. The government is planning to update the 1995 Plan Territorial General de Catalunya to address the needs of the growing population, including housing, transportation, and education. The plan aims to ensure that the region's resources are used efficiently and that the population has access to the services they need. Some experts, such as sociologist Mariña Couceiro, argue that immigration has been the driving force behind Catalonia's economic growth and that it is essential for the region's prosperity. Others, like Jaume Grau of Ecologistas en Acción, are concerned about the environmental impact of the growing population and the need for sustainable development. The government is aware of the challenges ahead and is working to address them, but the debate is ongoing and there are differing opinions on how to manage the region's growth.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars: 5 to 500 Starships by 2033**
Elon Musk plans to send five Starships to Mars in 2026, followed by a drastic increase in the number of launches, with 20 ships in 2028, 100 in 2030, and 500 in 2033. According to Musk, this plan is a crucial step in colonizing Mars. As Musk said, 'It's a very ambitious plan, but I think it's necessary to make humanity a multi-planetary species.' However, some people are skeptical about the feasibility of this plan, questioning whether it's a point of inflection for humanity or just a sign of Musk's mental detachment.

**Future on Mars: A Children's Book Explores the Possibility of Human Settlement**
A team of authors, led by the Catalan astrophysicist Guillem Anglada-Escudé, have written a children's book that explores the possibility of humans living on Mars. The book, 'Zukunft auf dem Mars' (Future on Mars), aims to bridge the gap between science and fiction and change our perspective on the Red Planet. Elon Musk has stated that he believes humans can become a 'multiplanetary species' that can live on multiple planets, and he plans to establish a self-sustaining civilization on Mars by 2050 through his company SpaceX. However, it is unclear whether it is realistic for parts of the Earth's population to live on Mars in the long term. The book delves into the challenges of space travel and the difficulties of living on Mars, including the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere and the dangers of cosmic radiation. As Elon Musk said, 'It is a multiplanetary species that we will become.'

**Elon Musk Aims to Colonize Mars, Claims it Will be Part of the United States**
Elon Musk has announced plans to establish a human settlement on Mars, which he claims will be part of the United States. However, this initiative contradicts the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which states that 'outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or any other means.' Musk's plan aims to establish a permanent human presence on Mars by 2054, with a projected population of over 1 million people. The plan includes the creation of an autonomous infrastructure, with the launch of the Starship rocket in 2026, which will be used for transportation to the red planet. A robotic mission to Mars is planned for 2028, followed by a human mission in 2030. Between 2035 and 2050, SpaceX plans to develop permanent settlements on Mars, including greenhouses for food production and industrial plants for resource extraction. Despite the harsh Martian environment, SpaceX is advancing various initiatives to facilitate human colonization, including the development of habitable modules, space suits, and medical studies on human reproduction in an extraterrestrial environment. As Musk said, 'I will die in the United States. I won't go anywhere. I could go to Mars, but it will be part of the United States.'

'This will not happen, people,' she said. 'It's a marketing scheme that everyone somehow fell for, despite Google search results debunking it.' Musk has often spoken about his ambitious plans to colonize the Red Planet by 2050, envisioning a city with a population of one million people on its surface. Recently, Musk confirmed plans to launch the Starship spacecraft to Mars by the end of next year, with a robot named Optimus on board, developed by Tesla. If these landings are successful, human landings may begin as early as 2029, although a more likely date is 2031.

**Musk Predicts 1 Million People on Mars in 20 Years, Establishing a Self-Sufficient City**
Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has predicted that humans will establish a self-sufficient city on Mars within 20 years, with a population of 1 million people. He also revealed that 2029 will be a historic moment when humans first set foot on Mars. According to Deutsche Welle, Musk stated on X platform that SpaceX plans to execute a landing mission in 2026, aiming to send Tesla's humanoid robot 'Optimus' to Mars using the 'Starship' rocket. If the mission is successful, he estimates that humans will complete their first Mars landing in 2029, but the most likely implementation time is 2031. Musk emphasized the importance of establishing a self-sufficient Martian city for the continuation of human civilization, saying, 'Even if Earth faces a disaster, Martian residents can survive independently.' He added, 'We need to build a self-sufficient city on Mars as soon as possible, which is the key threshold to ensure the survival of civilization. Even if Earth's supply ships stop flying or a major disaster occurs, the Martian civilization can continue.' Musk also mentioned that building a self-sufficient Martian city requires rebuilding all industrial foundations on Earth, and the primary task in the harsh Martian environment is to build a living module similar to a glass dome to provide a suitable space for human habitation. The 'Starship' rocket, developed by SpaceX, is considered the core of Musk's Mars plan. This reusable heavy-lift rocket will not only support NASA's 'Artemis' program to help humans return to the Moon but also undertake the mission of humans setting foot on Mars.

**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**
British paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species. 'If we make a concerted effort to expand into the Universe, we could 'live -- potentially -- for millions of years,' he says. However, he warns that if we don't take action, 'there might be no one left on the Earth for you to wave back to.'

**Multiple Apocalyptic Predictions for the End of the World**
According to various predictions, the end of the world is approaching. A solar flare is expected to hit the Earth in 2025, causing a 'total blackout' and internet shutdown worldwide. However, some scientists disagree, citing that the most active phase of the solar cycle will occur in late 2023 to early 2024. Bulgarian mystic Vanga predicted that a conflict in Europe in 2025 will have a devastating impact on the continent's population, followed by the exploration of Venus for energy sources in 2028. By 2033, the polar ice caps will melt, causing a significant rise in sea levels, and by 2076, communism will spread across the planet. Vanga also predicted that humans will make contact with aliens in 2130, followed by a global drought that will affect most countries. The final stage of the apocalypse is expected to occur in 3005, with a war against a Martian civilization, and by 3797, the last humans will leave the planet due to its uninhabitability. Additionally, an Austrian scientist, Heinz von Förster, predicted that the world will end on November 13, 2026, due to overpopulation, and the French Institute of Demographic Research predicts that the world's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, leading to a shortage of natural resources, food, and water. Finally, there are concerns about potential asteroid collisions, including one in 2028 and another in 2029, which could have catastrophic consequences.

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Establish a Sustainable City on Mars**
Elon Musk plans to establish a sustainable city on Mars, not just for humans, but for the survival of the human species in case of a catastrophe or disaster. SpaceX is working on building a reusable rocket, the Starship, which will be used to transport humans to Mars. Musk estimates that the first colonies will be established on Mars within 20 years, and that it will take 1,000 Starship rockets and 20 years of continuous missions to transport humans to the planet. The city on Mars is expected to have a population of one million people and will be self-sustaining. Musk believes that it is essential for humanity to become a multi-planetary species to ensure its survival. He also mentions that other planets, such as Venus, the Moon, and the gas giants, are not suitable for human habitation due to their extreme conditions. Mars, on the other hand, has a relatively stable environment and is considered an ideal candidate for human settlement. Musk predicts that the city on Mars could be established as early as 2050, with the first launch window opening in 2028. He also mentions that the Starship rocket has already completed three orbital test flights and is expected to achieve a 90% success rate in recovering the first stage of the rocket using the Mechazilla tower.
