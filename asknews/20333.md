**​A belated admission: on the undercount of India's COVID-19 pandemic deaths**
Four years after the delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus hit India, the government has finally admitted to significant excess deaths in 2021. According to the Registrar General of India, there were 21.5 lakh excess deaths in 2021, which is nearly 6.5 times more than the reported 3.32 lakh COVID-19 deaths. The high number of excess deaths was estimated to be even higher in certain states, such as Gujarat (44.2), Madhya Pradesh (19.5), Uttar Pradesh (19.5), and Telangana (18.2). The government's delay in releasing this report, alongside the Sample Registration System Report for 2021, reveals its reluctance to comprehensively assess the pandemic's true impact and its casual approach to publishing critical demographic data. The civil registration system in India has improved over time, but medical certification of the causes of deaths remains low compared to other developing countries. The delay in releasing vital data defeats the purpose of the improvements made in civil registration, and 'data delayed is also data denied.'

**COVID-19 fueled increase in hospital-onset MRSA, study finds**
A US surveillance study found that patients with recent COVID-19 infections contributed significantly to the increase in hospital-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia during the pandemic. The study, led by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health departments, analyzed MRSA blood isolates from six states from 2005 to 2022. The data showed that while overall MRSA bacteremia incidence remained relatively stable during the pandemic, hospital-onset MRSA bacteremia incidence rose by 40% in 2021 and remained elevated through 2022, with 18.2% to 21.8% of cases having recent COVID-19 infections. The study authors suggest that COVID-19 mitigation measures may have contributed to the drop in community-associated MRSA incidence, but COVID-related hospitalizations likely contributed to the increase in hospital-onset MRSA bacteremia.

**COVID-19 Cases Rise in Brazil: New Variants and Symptoms**
As COVID-19 cases are on the rise in Brazil, with 182,000 people diagnosed with the disease from January to April 2025, resulting in 1,478 deaths. According to the National Genomic Surveillance Network, the JN.1 variant, also known as Pirola, accounts for 36% of cases, while the LP.8.1 variant is responsible for 30% of cases. Infectologists warn that the LP.8.1 variant is likely to become the global variant of interest at the next TAG-CO-VAC meeting, citing its rapid spread in February. The LP.8.1 variant emerged from the JN.1 variant and was classified as a variant under monitoring by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January due to its rapid dissemination. 'It is essential to be aware of the new developments in the disease and take preventive measures,' said no one in the article, however, the article does emphasize the importance of being aware of the new developments in the disease and taking preventive measures.

**Acre Declares State of Emergency Due to Respiratory Syndrome Cases**
The state of Acre in Brazil has declared a state of emergency in public health due to a significant increase in cases of Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SRAG) and overcrowding of intensive care units, particularly pediatric ones, in the public and private healthcare networks. The decree, signed by Governor Gladson Cameli, was published in the Official Gazette of the State (DOE) on Saturday, May 10, and is valid for 90 days. The decision is based on data from the Epidemiological Bulletin of Respiratory Syndromes nº 13/2025, which shows a constant increase in hospitalizations since the 13th epidemiological week of the year, with a higher incidence among children aged 0-9 and people over 60. The most frequent viruses identified in hospitalized patients are SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Rhinovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Influenza A, and Influenza B. Many cases evolve into pneumonia and bronchiolitis, requiring intensive care unit admission. With this measure, the State Health Secretariat will coordinate the emergency response, authorizing the adoption of urgent administrative measures, including the realization of emergency expenses to expand the capacity for care. 'We are facing a serious situation, and we need to take drastic measures to ensure the health of our citizens,' said Gladson Cameli.

**New Theory Suggests SARS-CoV-2 Originated from US Laboratory in 2018**
A new theory suggests that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a US laboratory in 2018. Virologist Ralph Baric, who worked under Fauci, allegedly manipulated the virus as part of the DEFUSE project. The project aimed to modify coronaviruses to study their transmission risks. The proposed plan included inserting a Furin cleavage site into a coronavirus spike protein, ordering the restrictive enzyme BsmBI, searching for a binding domain that would infect human ACE2 receptors, and requiring the virus genome to differ by about 25% from the SARS virus (from 2003). According to the article, these characteristics are very similar to SARS-CoV-2. The DEFUSE project was led by Dr. Vincent Munster, who worked at the Rocky Mountain Lab of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Fauci. Munster allegedly took Baric's patented SARS virus vaccine and created a transmissible version in his lab. The article suggests that this could explain how the virus spread from Wuhan. The article also mentions Event 201, a simulation of a pandemic, where participants discussed a plan to roll out a pandemic and make people comply. The article concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic was likely a planned event, and that the lab origin theory is supported by the evidence.

**Real-world evidence shows remdesivir tied to less death in hospitalized COVID patients**
A new study published in BMC Infectious Diseases found that the antiviral remdesivir (RDV) is associated with reduced mortality among COVID-19 patients. The study analyzed electronic health records of 812 treated and 2,703 untreated patients in three Spanish hospital systems from January 2021 to March 2022. The results showed a 27% lower risk of in-hospital mortality at 28 days for patients receiving RDV, compared to untreated patients. The authors concluded that their results are consistent with previous non-randomized, retrospective studies that have shown RDV to effectively reduce mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. According to the authors, 'Our results are also consistent with those of several non-randomized, retrospective studies which have shown that RDV effectively reduces mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.'

**US Prepares to Reveal Key Documents on COVID-19 Origin**
The US is preparing to release key documents about the origin of COVID-19, focusing on gain-of-function experiments, a type of genetic manipulation to increase the transmissibility or virulence of viruses in the lab. Gabbard stated that the data could directly connect these studies to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. She also hinted that figures like former scientific advisor Anthony Fauci could be exposed. 'He denied under oath that he funded this type of experiment, but now we know that he sought a pardon from Joe Biden before leaving office,' she said. Gabbard also warned that these practices continue in various parts of the world, including labs in Ukraine, where she claimed there is not enough control over the pathogens stored. 'Who knows what's in those labs and what could happen if something is released? That's why I was called a Russian agent, but we need to stop this investigation before it causes another pandemic,' she noted. Gabbard also discussed her future in politics, saying she would 'always act where I can serve God and our country.' While no official documents from the GID have been published to support her claims, Gabbard assured that there are concrete advances and that the documents could be released soon. The group is also reviewing sensitive topics such as Operation Crossfire Hurricane, anomalous health incidents reported by diplomats, internal surveillance during the Biden administration, and classified files on the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. As part of their tasks, the GID is pushing for the revocation of security clearances for individuals without active defense national functions, including former President Joe Biden, Liz Cheney, and Hillary Clinton, and investigating possible leaks of classified information.

**China Accuses US of COVID-19 Pandemic, Citing 7,000 Studies**
The Chinese government has released a report stating that the COVID-19 virus originated in the United States before China. The US, on the other hand, believes that the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. China claims to have evidence that the virus appeared in the US before the official announcement by American authorities, and even before the outbreak in China. According to the report, over 7,000 studies conducted in nine US states between December 13, 2019, and January 17, 2020, showed 106 positive results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, the Daily Mail noted that tests for antibodies can react to other viruses and produce false-positive results. The FBI and CIA believe that the COVID-19 outbreak may have originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where experiments with coronaviruses are being conducted. The Trump administration is actively promoting this theory, according to the Daily Mail. The pandemic has led to an increase in diseases such as diabetes, bronchial asthma, and allergies, said scientists. The outbreak was initially linked to mosquito bites. The article also mentions the risk of chikungunya fever in Russia, characterized by high temperature and bloody cough.

**China Accuses US of Covid-19 Origin Cover-up, Calls for International Investigation**
In a surprising reversal of accusations, China has pointed the finger at the United States regarding the origin of Covid-19, in response to statements made by President Donald Trump. According to a white paper published by the Chinese State Council's Information Office, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may not have originated in Wuhan, but rather in the United States. The document directly responds to the repeated claims made by the Trump administration, which has accused the Wuhan Virology Laboratory (WIV) of being the origin of the pandemic. The laboratory, which was indeed involved in coronavirus studies at the time, has been at the center of various theories supported by Washington, despite the lack of definitive evidence. Chinese authorities turn the narrative around: 'the US government, instead of addressing its failures in managing the pandemic and reflecting on its shortcomings, has sought to shift the blame by politicizing investigations into the virus's origins,' the white paper reads. Beijing goes further and calls for an independent international investigation in the United States. 'A thorough investigation into the virus's origin should be conducted on American soil. The United States must respond to the legitimate concerns of the international community and provide responsible answers to the world.' The document also highlights that between May and October 2019, there were outbreaks of respiratory diseases in the United States that - according to Chinese authorities - could have been early cases of Covid-19. 'Numerous evidence suggests that the virus may have emerged in the US before the officially declared date and even before the Chinese epidemic.' The text also states that by January 2020, the United States was aware of the spread of the new coronavirus within its borders, but deliberately downplayed the severity of the situation. 'The US chose to ignore the problem, turning China into the scapegoat for its ineffective response to the pandemic.' The white paper accuses Washington of failing to timely share information with the World Health Organization and invites the US government to stop seeking 'external excuses for its internal problems.' 'The United States cannot continue to ignore the numerous questions that the world poses about its behavior.'

**Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: a pediatric surveillance study - Scientific Reports**
A study published in Nature analyzed the neutralizing antibody responses in children aged 5-12 years to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). The study found that a significant percentage of children did not demonstrate neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant. Children who were both naturally infected and vaccinated constituted 11% of the population. The study also found that active immunotherapy and leukopenia resulted in blunted responses to some VOCs. Vaccination played a crucial role in generating a neutralizing immune response against SARS-CoV-2, and the mRNA vaccine demonstrated moderate effectiveness in protecting against infections caused by Omicron. However, these vaccines were likely to be highly protective against severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization. The study's findings emphasize the need for continued surveillance and vaccine optimization, particularly in immunocompromised populations.

**Should I Continue to Get Vaccinated Against Covid-19 Five Years After the Pandemic?**
According to the World Health Organization, the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to circulate and evolve, causing significant changes in the protein S. The Association of Mexican Vaccinology reports that globally, over 775 million cases and 7 million deaths have been registered by July 2024, with Europe and the Americas being the most affected regions, particularly among people over 60 years old. The Association explains that the current pandemic is in a transition phase, marked by the predominance of the omicron variant and its sublineages, such as JN.1, which has displaced previous variants. 'The virus SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate and evolve, generating significant genetic and antigenic changes that affect the virus's protein S,' they explain. The Association recommends that all people, starting from 6 months of age, should receive a dose of the updated Covid-19 vaccine for the 2024-2025 period. Vaccination against Covid-19 is especially important for populations at higher risk of severe illness, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. 'Vaccination against Covid-19 is the safest and most reliable way to create immunity and protection against the virus,' they say. The updated vaccines for the 2024-2025 period are effective in protecting people from severe illness, hospitalization, and death.

**COVID-19: Experts Weigh in on the Virus's Current Threat Level**
Five years after the start of the pandemic, the threat of COVID-19 has decreased for most people. However, the virus still poses a risk, particularly for long-term effects such as organ damage. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 67% of the global population is fully vaccinated against Sars-CoV-2, while in Germany, 77% are partially vaccinated and 63% have received a booster shot. Despite the development of the virus, experts agree that the risks associated with COVID-19 are no longer comparable to those at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. 'Covid-19 and the flu are now in the same category,' said Leif-Erik Sander, head of the Clinic for Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care at the Berlin Charité. 'The case fatality rate is in the same order of magnitude, although it is still slightly higher for COVID-19.' A recent study from Denmark found that Sars-CoV-2 is still more deadly than the flu, with twice as many hospitalizations and 20 more deaths per 1000 patients. The risk of severe illness or complications from COVID-19 depends on individual health conditions, with older adults and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure being at higher risk. The Standing Vaccination Commission (Stiko) recommends annual booster shots against COVID-19 due to these ongoing risks.

**Five Years After COVID-19 Pandemic: WHO's Ongoing Monitoring and Challenges**
It has been five years since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is still monitoring the situation. According to the WHO's latest epidemiological update, there were 8.1% positive cases out of 59,000 individuals tested in 108 countries between December 9, 2024, and January 5, 2025. The WHO is tracking eight active variants of SARS-CoV-2, including the JN.1 variant, which was identified in 15% of cases studied during this period. However, only 34% of the 234 countries recognized by the WHO reported COVID-19 cases between December 9 and January 5, and 10% reported deaths. The WHO warns that the actual number of fatalities may be higher due to interrupted or changed reporting frequencies in many countries. The organization also notes a decline in testing and contact tracing in many nations, with only 16% of countries providing information on hospitalizations due to COVID-19 and 12% providing data on intensive care unit admissions. The WHO urges countries to maintain their infrastructure for tracking COVID-19 cases and to continue monitoring variants, providing early attention, and administering vaccines to high-risk groups. One of the biggest challenges for health authorities is tracking and attending to patients with COVID-19 sequelae, also known as post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). According to the WHO, approximately 6% of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections result in PCC symptoms, and 90% of PCC cases arise from cases with mild symptoms.

**Covid-19: LP.8.1 becomes the new dominant variant in the US, WHO warns of its immune-evading ability**
The Sars-CoV-2 virus, responsible for Covid-19, continues to evolve through new mutations. In the United States, the LP.8.1 variant has recently surpassed XEC, becoming the dominant strain with 42% of cases, compared to 31% of the previous main variant. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 'LP.8.1 has a high capacity to evade the immune response.' The variant, which originated from JN.1, has been identified in 23 countries by February 2024. Despite its rapid spread, experts do not consider LP.8.1 a significant threat to public health. A study published in Lancet Infectious Diseases in February 2024 found that LP.8.1 has lower infectivity than its parent variant JN.1, but a higher ability to evade the immune response, which may lead to a higher possibility of reinfections, although without an increase in symptom severity.

**Corona Waves Continue to Cause Thousands of Hospitalizations**
Corona cases continue to lead to thousands of hospitalizations. Five years after the first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Austria, the virus has not disappeared. In October, nearly 1,000 Covid patients were hospitalized nationwide within a week, with around 4-5% of them being admitted to intensive care units. According to Dr. Arschang Valipour, a lung specialist, several waves of influenza and RSV are also putting a strain on hospitals. He stated, 'With Influenza and RSV, even several waves are burdening the hospitals.'

**COVID-19 Remains Major Health Threat in U.S.**
COVID-19 remains a major health threat in the U.S., accounting for 60% of respiratory illnesses among military veterans treated by the U.S. Veterans Health Administration during the 2023-2024 cold and flu season. Researchers found that COVID-19 caused more deaths than either influenza or RSV, particularly among those who weren't vaccinated against the coronavirus. According to Dr. Kristina Bajema, 'SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID virus) was far more common than influenza or RSV and resulted in more severe disease outcomes, including short-term hospitalization and mortality.' The study analyzed the medical records of 72,939 veterans and found that those not vaccinated against COVID-19 were more likely to die or require hospitalization. However, among those vaccinated, there were no mortality differences between COVID-19 and influenza. The researchers concluded that 'vaccination remains an important strategy for minimizing the impact of respiratory viral illnesses and particularly Omicron variants' of COVID.

**The COVID symptoms to watch for in 2025**
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to circulate globally, with 20 states and the District of Columbia reporting 'very high' levels of SARS-CoV-2 between December 29 and January 4, according to the CDC. Historically, COVID-19 symptoms include fevers or chills, cough, shortness of breath, congestion or a runny nose, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, fatigue and body aches, headache, nausea or vomiting or diarrhea. Experts say there are 'no distinct symptoms' that make the current dominant variant, XEC, different from others. XEC, a subvariant of Omicron, has been detected in several countries, including France and Finland, and has shown rapid growth in some areas. Vaccines are expected to work well against XEC and other variants. The CDC estimates that between October 1 and December 7, there were 2.5 to 4.4 million COVID-19 illnesses, 72,000 to 120,000 hospitalizations, and 8,200 to 13,000 deaths. New guidelines suggest that people with COVID-19 should stay at home until they've been fever-free without medication for at least 24 hours and their symptoms have been improving for 24 hours. Paxlovid, an antiviral therapy drug, has been approved by the FDA and has shown an 89 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization and death in unvaccinated people.

**Surge of respiratory viruses infecting millions worldwide in first weeks of 2025**
A surge of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, flu, and RSV, is infecting millions worldwide in the first weeks of 2025. Despite the availability of vaccines and means to contain the spread of these pathogens, capitalist governments have abandoned sound public health measures, leading to a 'let-it-rip' policy. In the US, many hospitals are scrambling to reinstitute mask mandates, and emergency room visits are rising due to the failure to address respiratory pathogens through public health measures. Dr. Rachel Klamo, president of the Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, stated, 'Our hospitals are busy. Hospitals in southeast Michigan, for sure, are operating at pretty high capacity. There's just a high burden of illness right now, and a lot of it is respiratory.' Dr. Evonne Curran, a retired physician, noted that the current wave of infections will be aggravated by the return of students to school and university after the holiday break. Curran emphasized that these are airborne viruses and that 'you can't hand wash your way out of this quad-demic because it is mainly spread by what you breathe in and what you breathe out.' The SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a formidable pathogen, and the population should take heed to avoid infections by masking with well-fitting N95 respirators and using HEPA filters in indoor environments. Vaccines continue to afford important protections against severe disease and death, and development of Long COVID from these infections. However, fewer than 40 percent of all Americans have planned to obtain the latest COVID vaccine, and just over half reported they might get the flu shots. The majority of those choosing not to receive COVID boosters erroneously believe that 'it isn't needed' despite the numerous studies that have demonstrated the rising risk of cardiac disease, neurological consequences, Long COVID, and potential risks of cancers associated with repeat infections.
