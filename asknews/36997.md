**Jared Kaplan to Discuss Anthropic's Rapid Progress in AI at TechCrunch Conference**
Jared Kaplan, the guest of honor at TechCrunch's AI conference, will discuss the latest developments in artificial intelligence, particularly the rapid progress made by Anthropic, a company that has been making waves in the AI industry. The company has recently launched its intelligent model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which it describes as 'the smartest model it has ever had', thanks to its 'hybrid reasoning' technology that combines fast responses to simple questions with deep processing of complex questions. Anthropic has been making significant strides in the AI industry, with a series of updates in recent months, including the integration of Claude with Google Workspace and the development of an independent AI-powered search feature. The company is also reportedly working on a voice assistant to compete with similar offerings from companies like OpenAI and Google. Anthropic's rapid growth has not gone unnoticed by investors, with the company announcing a new funding deal in March 2025 that raised its market value to $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion just a year ago, according to TechCrunch sources.

**Perplexity AI Closes in on $500 Million Deal Amid Intensifying Competition in AI Search Engine Sector**
Perplexity AI, a company developing an AI-powered search engine, is close to finalizing a $500 million deal at a valuation of $14 billion. The leading investor is expected to be Accel, a venture capital firm from Palo Alto. This amount is at the lower end of the previously announced plans, which aimed to raise between $500 million and $1 billion at a valuation of $18 billion. The correction is likely due to the intensifying competition in the AI search engine sector. Perplexity AI's growth is impressive, with its valuation increasing from $3 billion in June 2024 to $9 billion in December. The surge is attributed to the boom in generative AI, which started after the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2022. Despite pressure from Google and Microsoft, which support OpenAI, Perplexity AI shows stable performance, with its annual recurring revenue (ARR) approaching $100 million. The company's key hope is the upcoming web browser Comet, which integrates AI and is expected to strengthen its position in the market. However, competitors are not standing still. In March 2025, Anthropic launched a search engine based on its chatbot Claude, providing real-time results. OpenAI added a web search feature to ChatGPT in the fall of 2024, and Google introduced AI Overviews in its search engine, although the latter project faced criticism due to errors. These steps create additional risks for Perplexity AI, despite its ambitious plans. The company's success now depends on two factors: the timely release of the Comet browser and its ability to adapt to the dynamic generative AI market. If the deal with Accel is closed, the received funds may accelerate development, but Perplexity AI will need to prove that its technology can compete with the solutions of the giants. The final decision on investments is expected in the coming weeks.

**OpenAI and Microsoft Discuss Partnership Changes**
OpenAI and Microsoft are in talks about a potential partnership change. A contract revision, which would be crucial for changes at the start-up, is being discussed. The contract, which expires in 2030, determines Microsoft's access to OpenAI's models and revenue share. According to the Financial Times, the talks focus on the number of shares Microsoft will receive in OpenAI in exchange for its over $13 billion investment. Microsoft is reportedly willing to give up part of its stake in OpenAI's commercial arm in exchange for access to new technology developed after 2030. Critics argue that this business model, also used by competitors like Anthropic and xAI, would allow OpenAI to continue offering shares to investors, making a future IPO possible, as stated by the Financial Times.

**Anthropic and Databricks Announce $100 Million Partnership for Corporate AI Agents**
Anthropic and Databricks have announced a five-year partnership worth $100 million to develop corporate AI agents. The partnership aims to provide tools for creating custom AI agents and strengthen the companies' positions in the face of growing competition from Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. According to the agreement, Anthropic and Databricks plan to jointly earn $100 million through cross-selling their products. Commercial teams will promote each other's technologies, but the financial details are not disclosed. The partnership focuses on AI agents - systems that can autonomously perform tasks that traditionally require human involvement. Despite the hype around the technology, its practical value for business remains uncertain due to reliability issues. As explained by Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi, the key challenge is to increase the accuracy of agents to 95%, comparable to human results. Currently, even leading models often make mistakes in 30-50% of cases, limiting their application in the corporate environment. The integration of Anthropic's Claude AI model with the Databricks platform will allow companies to create agents based on their own data stored in the system. This, according to Ghodsi, will simplify the adoption of AI for clients already using Databricks, such as Block, where thousands of employees use Claude through the platform for coding optimization and other tasks. Both companies are actively raising capital: Databricks raised $10 billion in a recent round with a valuation of $62 billion, while Anthropic completed funding at $3.5 billion with a valuation of $61.5 billion. The partnership also strengthens Databricks' position in the corporate segment after the acquisition of MosaicML for $1.3 billion in 2023. As noted by Kate Jensen, Anthropic's sales director, integration with Databricks will provide access to 10,000 platform customers, which is important for the relatively young company, half of whose commercial team focuses on large business. The corporate AI agent market remains a fiercely competitive arena, with OpenAI and Google offering similar tools, as well as Salesforce and Amazon. However, Databricks and Anthropic's focus on a 'hybrid' approach - combining an analytical platform with specialized models - may become their advantage. Databricks does not rule out an IPO as early as 2025, adding strategic importance to current initiatives. The success of the partnership will depend on the companies' ability to bridge the gap between technology demonstrations and their real-world application in business processes. If Anthropic and Databricks can confirm the announced reliability metrics, they will not only strengthen their positions but also set new standards for the industry.

**Anthropic's New 'Hybrid AI' Model Claude to Compete with OpenAI's GPT-5**
Anthropic, a leading AI company, is set to release a new 'hybrid AI' model, Claude, which will compete with OpenAI's GPT-5. The new model will allow developers to control the amount of computational resources used by the model, making it more efficient and cost-effective. According to insiders, the model has made significant progress in programming tasks, surpassing OpenAI's o3-mini high in some benchmark tests. However, the pricing of the new model remains uncertain, and some experts question whether Anthropic's strategy of offering a 'sliding scale' of computational resources will be enough to compete with OpenAI's low-cost models. Anthropic's CEO has stated that the company aims to reach $345 billion in revenue by 2027, with a significant portion coming from its API business. The company has also announced plans to reduce its cash burn to $3 billion in 2025, from $5.6 billion in 2023.

**Anthropic Plans to Enhance Claude with Two-Way Voice Mode and Personalization**
Anthropic, a leading AI startup, is continually enhancing its AI chatbot Claude. According to Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, Claude has received a warm market response in the past few months. In the coming months, the company plans to release a more intelligent AI model, which will include a two-way voice mode, allowing users to speak to Claude and receive responses. This two-way voice model aims to provide a seamless interaction experience, similar to ChatGPT's advanced voice mode. Additionally, Anthropic plans to strengthen Claude's memory function, enabling it to provide personalized experiences. With improved memory, Claude can remember user interactions, such as their interests in sports or knitting, and use this information in future conversations. This will allow Claude to generate personalized interactions over time. Anthropic has gained significant attention as a rival to OpenAI, with its large language model Claude. In 2024, Anthropic released a feature to develop automated agents for enterprise processes, ahead of OpenAI. Claude has received investments from Amazon and Google, totaling $137 billion. Google has agreed to invest an additional $1 billion in Anthropic, on top of its existing 10% stake.

**Anthropic Plans to Enhance Claude with Two-Way Voice and Memory Features**
Anthropic, a company founded by former OpenAI researcher Dario Amodei, is working on a voice assistant for two-way communication and plans to release improved AI models in the coming months, according to Amodei in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. The company will also implement a memory function to allow the chatbot to remember conversations and personalize responses. Amodei did not disclose exact timelines. Additionally, the company plans to introduce internet access in Claude 'relatively soon', but prioritizes other features over image and video generation. In 2024, the company's revenue grew tenfold, but Amodei did not provide specific figures. Due to the surge in demand, Anthropic is facing a shortage of computational resources, and by 2026, the company may use over 1 million chips for AI training. The company is currently in talks to raise $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, as reported by WSJ on January 7, 2025.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicts that artificial intelligence (AI) will surpass human intelligence by 2027. Despite struggling to meet the growing demand for its generative AI chatbot, Claude, Amodei assured users that the situation will improve, leading to reduced rate limits for the chatbot. He also expressed optimism that Anthropic could have more than a million chips supporting its AI technology by 2026. Amodei warned about the need to be aware of the possible negative consequences of this rapid progress in AI, saying, 'The positive consequences are going to be great, the negative consequences we also will have to watch out for.' This prediction aligns with the views of other tech leaders, including Elon Musk, who had earlier forecasted that AI could outsmart humans by 2025 and surpass humanity's collective intelligence by 2029.
