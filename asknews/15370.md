**Harvard tops the world rankings, but the US is struggling**
For the 14th consecutive year, Harvard is the best university in the world according to the Cwur ranking. It is followed by two other private American universities, MIT and Stanford. Cambridge and Oxford in the UK, respectively in 4th and 5th place, are the public institutions with the highest score in the world. Despite winning eight of the top ten positions, the US is struggling to maintain its dominance globally. In the Global 2000 ranking, only 40 American universities have improved their position compared to 2024, with 15 maintaining their position and 264 falling in the ranking. The best public American university is Berkeley, ranked 12th in the world, one place behind Caltech. The US is the second country with the most representatives in the Global 2000 ranking with 319 institutions, ten fewer than last year. Canada has 38 institutions in the ranking, led by the University of Toronto at 23rd place. Nadim Mahassen, president of World University Rankings, comments: 'Although the US still boasts the best universities in the world, the decline of the vast majority of its higher education institutions should concern US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and the entire Trump administration. At a time when Chinese universities are reaping the fruits of years of generous financial support from their government, American institutions are struggling with federal funding cuts and controversies over academic freedom and free speech. With the US surpassed by China as the country with the most representatives in the ranking, its reputation in the global higher education sector is seriously threatened.' Mahassen warns: 'The strong decline of American universities is parallel to that of universities in Japan, France, and Germany, while British and Russian universities have had slightly better results. With the extraordinary rise of Chinese institutions, Western universities cannot afford to stand by and sleep on their laurels.'

**China dominates US in global university rankings**
China has surpassed the United States in the latest Global 2000 university rankings by the Center for World University Rankings, marking a historic shift in higher education dominance. Chinese institutions now account for 17 percent of the list, up from 324 last year to 346 this year, while the number of ranked US universities dropped from 329 to 319. According to Nadim Mahassen, president of the Center for World University Rankings, China's success is attributed to enhanced research performance and sustained government investment in higher education. Mahassen said, 'At a time when Chinese universities are reaping the rewards of years of generous financial support from their government, American institutions are grappling with slashed federal funding and disputes over academic freedom and free speech.' The sharp decline of US universities parallels that of institutions in Japan, France, and Germany, while UK and Russian universities have fared only slightly better. Mahassen emphasized that the extraordinary rise of Chinese institutions means that universities in the Western world cannot afford to stand still and rest on their laurels.

**Academic Freedom and Democracy(2025)**
The Japanese government's plan to transform the Science Council of Japan into a special incorporated administrative agency has raised concerns about government intervention in academic freedom. Minister of State for Special Missions Manabu Sakai stated that members who express 'particular ideological or partisan views' can be removed, which would violate freedom of expression and suppress academic freedom. The move is seen as a means of deflecting criticism for the government's handling of the Science Council's nominees in 2020. The article argues that government interference in academic freedom is a threat to democracy and that academic freedom is essential to the maintenance of democracy. It also discusses the tension between democracy and liberalism, and the importance of institutionalizing liberalism through constitutionalism and republicanism. The article concludes that academic freedom is not a privilege of researchers, but the intellectual foundation of civil society, and that its defense is essential to counter the rise of anti-intellectualism and the erosion of reflective thinking.

**Trump's War on Critical Thinking: A Threat to the Future of Universities**
US President Donald Trump has launched a brutal attack on critical thinking, free science, and cognitive emancipation spaces in US universities. This is not an exaggeration, but a total semiotic war against organized social intelligence. Trump has ordered the cancellation of all federal contracts with Harvard University, prohibited international student enrollment, and revoked visas for participating in peaceful pro-Palestinian protests. Trump is not acting alone or improvising, but as an operator of a caste of sense owners: oil magnates, arms manufacturers, and media owners who see the university as a strategic enemy, a risk to the semiotic order that reproduces obedience. Trump has accused universities of being centers of 'Marxist indoctrination' or 'radical liberal indoctrination', attacking especially social sciences, humanities, and departments of racial or gender studies. Trump has intensified his attack on US universities since his return to the presidency in 2025, with measures affecting academic autonomy, student diversity, and freedom of expression. He ordered the massive withdrawal of federal funds from Harvard, revoked the certification of Harvard's Student and Visitor Exchange Program, and appointed Linda McMahon as Secretary of Education to close the Department of Education and return educational authority to states and local communities. These recent actions by the Trump administration represent a significant challenge to higher education in the US, affecting diversity, academic freedom, and the international position of its universities. We must build a new international of critical thinking, liberate universities, decolonize knowledge, and refound the dialogue between science, consciousness, and the people. We cannot allow humanity to be left without its factories of the future.

**Why Universities are Increasing Passing Scores, Explained by the Ministry of Education**
The Ministry of Education explained why universities are increasing the passing scores. According to Sayaat Nurbek, the Minister of Education, the passing score of 75 points for pedagogical specialties has been in place for several years and will not be revised upwards. 'We won't raise it now because the shortage of teachers is still quite large,' he explained. However, he noted that universities are free to set their own passing scores, taking into account their capabilities and infrastructure. '135 points - this is a separate case for universities that are experiencing a significant infrastructure deficit and artificially inflate the passing score to filter out a large number of people. Within the framework of academic freedom, each university has the right to set its own passing scores in accordance with its possibilities and infrastructure,' Nurbek said.

**Why academic freedom matters**
Academic freedom is the right to freedom of teaching, research, and discussion without institutional censorship. The UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel defines academic freedom as the right to express opinions about the institution or system in which they work, freedom from institutional censorship, and freedom to participate in professional or representative academic bodies. However, academic freedom is increasingly under threat in many countries, including the U.S. and India. The Academic Freedom Index (AFI) 2025 report ranks the U.S. 85th and India 156th out of 179 countries. Critics argue that the Trump administration pressured institutions of higher education to align with its policies, and the government ordered Harvard University to reduce student and faculty influence in university governance. Harvard refused to comply, stating that no government should dictate what private universities can teach or pursue. In contrast, Ashoka University in India distanced itself from Professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad after his arrest for social media posts regarding Operation Sindoor. The university's administration failed to show courage in defending academic freedom. Academic freedom matters because it forms the foundation of vibrant academic institutions and a progressive society, empowers faculty and students to question and debate ideas without fear, and upholds democratic values and fosters open dialogue.

**Academic freedom is vital to ensure America's democracy | Opinion**
The United States ranks below 80 countries in the 2024 Academic Freedom Index, scoring 0.68 out of 1.00. Over 600 university presidents have released a statement defending academic freedom against government overreach. Academic freedom is defined as the freedom of teachers and researchers to investigate, discuss, teach, and publish without interference. The authors, Jessica Frazier, Dina Lundy, and Ryan Trimm, argue that academic freedom is vital to ensure America's democracy and that its erosion will lead to a decline in global leadership in research and innovation. They cite the example of the University of Rhode Island, where they strive to build an inclusive academic community that empowers everyone with the knowledge and skills to participate fully in society. The authors conclude that academic freedom fuels empowerment, fosters innovation, encourages critical thinking, and supports bold new ideas, and that it is essential for the future of higher education and democracy itself. As Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said, 'Progress thrives on freedom, openness and collaboration.'

**Editorial: Our varsity wasteland**
India's higher education system is in a state of decline, according to the 2025 Academic Freedom Index (AFI) by the V-Dem Institute, which ranks India 156th out of 179 countries. This is a significant drop from 120th in 2024. The AFI score has fallen from 0.58 in 2015 to 0.22 in 2025, indicating a comprehensive decline in institutional autonomy, freedom to research, campus integrity, and academic exchange. The number of Indian students studying abroad has increased from 3 lakh in 2015 to 1.3 million in 2025, while the quality of Indian universities has deteriorated. The article blames the three ethnonationalist regimes elected since 2014 for the decline, citing the Union government's control over university appointments, curricula, and research agendas, as well as the persecution of scholars on Indian campuses. According to NCRB reports, there has been a 45% increase in police complaints against students, and 28 academics are currently facing sedition/UAPA charges. As per a TISS survey, 67% of social science academics report self-censorship on caste/religion topics. The article concludes that Indian students are living in dread of being served a 'get out' notice anytime, forced to return to the 'wasteland' of India's higher education. 'The decline in AFI ranking also correlates with scholar persecution on Indian campuses,' the article states. 'There's good reason to pin the responsibility for this on the three ethnonationalist regimes we have elected since 2014,' it adds. 'The Union government has torn university autonomy to shreds by taking control of appointments, curricula, and research agendas,' the article says. 'Some 80% of central university vice-chancellors now have RSS/BJP affiliations,' it notes. 'In 2023, UGC effectively muzzled freedom of research by prohibiting PhD scholarships for students researching 'politically sensitive' topics such as Kashmir, caste, and Hindutva; instead, it encouraged scholars to concentrate on 'Indian knowledge systems', the article states.

**The Truth About US Education: Separating Fact from Fiction**
US Education Secretary Linda McMahon claims that reducing the size of the Education Department will help 'raise student scores'. However, experts say that the US is not at the bottom of international education rankings. According to Nat Malkus, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, 'the US does not figure at the bottom of the rankings'. The OECD's PISA test places US 15-year-old students above the average in reading and close to the average in math comprehension. Two other international tests, PIRLS and TIMSS, also place the US in the middle of the pack. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) shows a decline in results since 2019, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts also worry about the impact of screens and social media on reading levels. While the situation is not as 'catastrophic' as claimed by conservative commentators, 76% of 4th-grade students and 61% of 8th-grade students met or exceeded the expected math level in 2024, according to NAEP results. In reading, 60% and 67% of 4th and 8th-grade students respectively were above the minimum level. Donald Trump claims that the US is 'number one in cost per head' due to bureaucracy in Washington, but experts say that the US spends more per student than any other country and is ranked 5th in the OECD's spending per student ranking in 2019 and 6th in 2021. The federal government's share of education funding is only 13%.

**Morocco's Academic Freedom Index Score: A Mixed Picture**
Morocco scored 0.53 points out of a possible 10 in the latest edition of the Academic Freedom Index (AFI) published by the University of Friedrich Alexander and the Videm Institute at the University of Gothenburg. The index, which covers over 170 countries worldwide, measures the actual freedom of academics and university professors based on five indicators: freedom in research and teaching, academic exchange and publication, institutional autonomy, academic integrity, and freedom of academic and cultural expression. Morocco scored 2.39 points in the research and teaching indicator, 2.56 points in the academic exchange indicator, 2.17 points in the institutional autonomy indicator, and 2.32 points in the freedom of academic expression indicator. In the Middle East and North Africa region, Morocco ranked third, behind Israel with 0.84 points and Tunisia with 0.30 points. The report noted that eight countries included in the index have seen significant increases in academic freedom since 2014, including Bahrain, Montenegro, and Uzbekistan. However, more than 30 countries have seen declines in academic freedom over the past decade, including democracies such as Finland, the United States, and Portugal. The report stated that 'these examples show that academic freedom can be under pressure even in democracies, although it is better protected in democracies than in authoritarian regimes.' It also noted that 'academic freedom is at risk when anti-pluralist parties come to power,' citing the cases of Argentina, Poland, and the United States, where anti-pluralist parties have undermined academic freedom once in power. The report concluded that 'politicians who are hostile to pluralism in these three cases worked, once they took power, to undermine institutional autonomy and freedom of teaching, and to reduce or attack research that contradicts the government's national vision.' Morocco's score has remained relatively stable over the past decade, but the report notes that 'academic freedom is at risk when anti-pluralist parties come to power,' and that 'the presence of these parties in the opposition cannot be a primary explanation for the decline in academic freedom; rather, it is when these organizations enter government that freedom is at risk.'

**Academic Freedom Index: 'serious concern' for US universities**
New research from the Academic Freedom Index indicates that countries with anti-pluralist parties in power have lower levels of academic freedom. The report, which combines data from the AFI and the Anti-Pluralism Index, found that high levels of academic freedom often go hand-in-hand with the absence of strong anti-pluralism in the party system. However, when anti-pluralist parties are in power, they may enact laws and regulations that restrict free science and university autonomy. The report highlights the recent US presidential election as an example of the impact of anti-pluralism on academic freedom, saying American universities have come under unprecedented pressure since the start of Donald Trump's second presidential term. Angelo Vito Panaro, a researcher working on the Academic Freedom Index, recommends that universities and academics can best defend academic freedom by appealing to the judiciary and independent judicial institutions, and by mobilising alongside other social and political actors. The index identifies 34 cases of declining academic freedom, including some 'newly registered decliners', and eight countries that experienced higher levels of academic freedom in 2024 than in 2014.

**Turkey Ranks Among Worst in Academic Freedoms**
Turkey is among the top 10 countries where academic freedoms have deteriorated the most, according to the 'Academic Freedoms Report 2023-2024' by the Science Academy. The country ranks at the bottom 10% in the 'European Higher Education Area', along with Belarus, Azerbaijan, and Russia. Only Syria has a worse score among neighboring countries. The report highlights that the current state of academic freedom in Turkey is under great pressure. Despite this, the report praises the resistance of Boğaziçi University professors, who have been fighting for four years to maintain academic quality and protect the university as a space for free thought and discussion. The report states, 'Despite these negative developments, the resistance of Boğaziçi University professors, who have been fighting for four years to maintain academic quality and protect the university as a space for free thought and discussion, is an example that will be followed by the whole world.' The report also criticizes the Turkish government's approach to academic quality and merit, saying, 'The understanding that quality is not the only measure, but rather quantity, is evident in the fact that the number of universities has increased from 76 to 208 in a quarter of a century, the number of faculty members has increased from 700,000 to 1.85 million, and the number of students has increased from 1.6 million to 8 million. This is seen as a success, but it is actually a sign that the increase in faculty members has not been parallel to the increase in quality.' The report also notes that Turkey has a low score in academic autonomy, with a score of 46 out of 100, and that the country is not part of any of the four different systems in Europe. The report concludes, 'Turkey is the only country in Europe that has a presidentially appointed rector, and this has a direct impact on institutional autonomy and all other forms of independence.'

**Turkey Ranks Among Worst in Academic Freedom Decline**
The Science Academy has published the 2023/2024 Academic Freedom Report, which states that Turkey has the worst decline in academic freedom among the top 10 countries in the 2023 Academic Freedom Index, with a score of 0.09. The report highlights the increasing interference with academics' freedom of expression, which is being evaluated as part of democratic regression. The report notes that the number of universities has increased from 78 to 208, the number of faculty members from 700,000 to 1.85 million, and the number of students from 1.6 million to 8 million, which the government is presenting as a 'success'. However, the report argues that the significant increase in personnel does not necessarily mean that the quality of the academic staff has improved. The report also mentions that the rector appointments are still being made despite the Constitutional Court's decision to annul the law that allows the President to appoint rectors, which will come into effect on June 4, 2025. As the report states, 'The court has not imposed any qualitative limits on the legislature. Therefore, the possibility and risk of the legislature making the same arrangement through a law still exist.'

**Editorials | Falling behind on educational freedom**
California ranks 33rd among the 50 states in educational freedom, scoring 29.66 out of 100, according to the 2025 Index of Economic Freedom of the American Legislative Exchange Council. The state performed well in homeschooling, earning a 'B' grade, but struggled in charter schools, virtual schooling, and open enrollment, receiving 'C' or 'D' grades. Jonathan Williams, co-author of the index and ALEC's executive vice president of policy, attributed the poor performance to restrictions on charter authorizations and inequitable funding for charters. He also noted that California's failure to expand virtual schooling programs and its restrictive open enrollment policies are major issues. Williams emphasized that the state's problem is its continued empowerment of teachers unions over students, citing the state's poor performance in the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, where only 33% of 4th graders scored at or above 'proficient' in math.
