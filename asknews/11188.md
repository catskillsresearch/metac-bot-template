**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Professions at Risk: Experts Warn of AI's Impact on the Job Market**
Experts have identified professions that may disappear due to AI, including telemarketing and call center operators. According to Professor Alexander Safonov, AI has already surpassed human intelligence in solving many tasks. However, some experts believe that AI will create new job opportunities, with the World Economic Forum predicting that 170 million new jobs will emerge by 2030, while 92 million jobs may disappear. Safonov notes that the development and application of AI technologies are still costly, and in the short term, the risks of mass layoffs and job losses due to AI are low. He also emphasizes that live labor is currently cheaper than AI. Safonov predicts that AI will have the following impact on the Russian job market: chatbots will reduce the need for call center workers, sales managers, product consultants, and other roles. AI may become an additional tool for improving the quality and productivity of work in healthcare, but it will not solve the problem of staff shortages, especially in junior and middle management positions. AI will not be able to replace teachers and educators, where personal communication and trust are crucial. In science, AI will become an additional participant in research teams, but creative functions will remain with humans. Safonov notes that AI is not a threat to manual laborers, builders, and other workers. Fariyda Mirzabalaeva, a professor at the Russian University of People's Friendship, believes that AI will help high-skilled professionals, but will replace middle-level IT specialists, accountants, marketing specialists, media professionals, taxi drivers, warehouse workers, collectors, molders, locomotive drivers, and conveyor workers. Creative professions, such as copywriters, journalists, designers, and illustrators, are also vulnerable to AI. Mirzabalaeva notes that professions that are less susceptible to AI include doctors, scientists, military personnel, judges, and artists. She also emphasizes that AI will increase the demand for specialists in the field of AI and that the need for retraining and continuous education will grow.

**FonARCom Brings AI Debate to Festival del Lavoro**
The 16th edition of the Festival del Lavoro in Genoa hosted a debate on the ethics of artificial intelligence, organized by FonARCom. The discussion, moderated by Michele Damiani, featured experts such as Andrea Cafà, Fabrizio Di Modica, and Roberto Marseglia, who highlighted the risks and opportunities associated with AI in the workplace. The AI Act, a European regulation, was a central topic, introducing obligations, sanctions, and training for workers using or developing AI systems. The panel emphasized the need for employee training, developing new skills, and safely managing the digital transition. According to the European Commission, by 2030, over 50% of professions will require advanced digital skills. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will create around 170 million new jobs by 2030, but also eliminate around 92 million. A Gallup survey found a 7% increase in workers concerned about technological obsolescence over four years.

**AI Drives Demand for Computing Power: McKinsey Estimates 6.7 Trillion Dollars by 2030**
According to McKinsey, the global demand for data center capacity is expected to almost triple by 2030, reaching 6.7 trillion dollars. 70% of this demand will be attributed to AI, while the remaining 30% will be for traditional IT applications. McKinsey presents three scenarios for the evolution of computing power demand by 2030: Scenario accelerated: 205 GW of additional AI capacity between 2025 and 2030, with a total of 7.9 trillion dollars in capital investments. Scenario intermediate (based on the report): 125 GW additional in the same period, for 5.2 trillion dollars. Scenario contained: 78 GW additional by 2030, with a total demand of 3.7 trillion dollars. The predictions take into account two main uncertainties: AI use cases. The value of AI lies in its application level—i.e., the ability of companies to transform it into concrete impacts on business. If companies fail to generate real value, the demand for computing power may be lower than expected. On the other hand, transformative applications could fuel a higher demand than current predictions, with a reduction in training costs of around 18 times and inference costs of around 36 times compared to GPT-4. 15% of investments (800 billion) will be allocated to builders, for land, materials, and site development. An additional 25% (1.3 trillion) will be allocated to operators. Despite the expected demands, the analysis highlights that current investment levels remain below demand. In dozens of interviews with CEOs, it emerged that many leaders hesitate to invest maximally in computing capacity due to limited visibility on demand evolution, uncertainty on AI adoption rate, and long project implementation times. To guide strategic decisions and investments, companies can be classified into five main archetypes, each with a specific role in the AI infrastructure ecosystem: Builder: real estate developers, design firms, and construction companies involved in expanding data center capacity. Energizer: utilities, energy providers, cooling system and electrical equipment manufacturers, and telecommunications operators. Technology Developers and Designers: semiconductor companies and IT suppliers that produce chips and computational hardware. Operators: hyperscalers, colocation providers, GPU-as-a-service platforms, and companies that optimize their computational resources. AI Architect: AI model developers, foundation model providers, and companies that build proprietary AI capabilities.

**Anyone can use AI chatbots to 'vibe code.' Could that put programmers out of a job?**
Chloe Samaha and her partner at BOND used AI chatbots to 'vibe code' and create a working version of their online productivity manager and website in just a few hours. This highlights advances in AI that are opening up possibilities for creators and shaking up the world of software engineering. According to Blomfield, AI coding will radically change the software industry, with AI coders, project managers, and designers becoming common. However, some experts, like Adam Resnick, believe that while AI can automate simple tasks, it still requires human curation and expertise, giving developers a 'runway' ahead of them. 'It's probably like 30,000 lines of code. That would have taken me, I don't know, maybe a year to build,' said Blomfield, who expects AI coding to make coders and software engineers obsolete. 'The question is, from my perspective, not so much: Is the job going to go away? But: How is the job going to evolve?' he said.

**AI to Displace 300 Million Jobs, Warn Experts**
According to a Goldman Sachs forecast, approximately 300 million people will lose their jobs due to artificial intelligence. The report states that 25% of the global workforce will be automated. However, experts note that AI poses the least threat to labor-intensive professions such as construction, installation, and customer service. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicts that AI will increase America's competitiveness. By 2040, AI is likely to automate or transform 50-60% of jobs, and complete dominance (80% and above) may be possible by 2050 if continuous innovations are made. Experts believe that some jobs will cease to exist due to AI development. Those who work with data entry, planning, and customer service will be affected, as they are already being replaced by AI tools such as chatbots and robotic process automation. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, noted that his company is optimizing back-office functions using AI, reducing costs. These roles, requiring repetitive data processing, will become obsolete in the near future as AI accuracy improves. AI can already perform accounting, financial modeling, and basic data analysis, processing numbers and generating reports faster than humans. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, predicts that by 2030, 20% of analytical roles in the banking sector will be at risk. Additionally, AI-powered tools such as Harvey and CoCounsel can automate tasks such as legal research, contract drafting, and document analysis with 90% accuracy. Ray Dalio, macro investor and founder of Bridgewater, warned that AI can analyze vast datasets, threatening roles related to research in academia and consulting. The report also suggests that 30% of media jobs may be automated by 2035, with AI-generated content dominating advertising. However, human creativity in storytelling and high art will persist longer, delaying complete automation. The World Economic Forum report notes that by 2040, 40% of programming tasks can be automated, although complex innovations such as breakthrough research and development will remain under human control. AI may also impact the medical field, with 25% of administrative tasks potentially disappearing by 2035, but patient care requiring human trust. In education, only 10% of tasks will be automated by 2040.

**From Lines to Logic: How AI Is Revolutionizing Coding in 2025**
In 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing coding by turning endless lines of code into elegant logic, making coding faster, smarter, and more enjoyable. AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Codeium are not just autocomplete bots, but think and can complete tasks such as building a REST API in Rust or refactoring a legacy mess in seconds. According to a 2025 dev poll, 72% of coders using AI finish projects 40% faster. AI is also tearing down barriers, allowing non-coders to build apps with plain English prompts and juniors to ship features that would take years to master. As one developer's cousin, Mia, said, 'It's like the computer's my hype squad.' AI is making coding more accessible and enjoyable, and four key shifts are lighting up dev screens in 2025: forgetting syntax, unlocking deeper insights, automating repetitive tasks, and making coding more collaborative.

**Microsoft's Kevin Scott Predicts 95% of Code Will Be Generated by AI by 2030**
Microsoft's technical director, Kevin Scott, believes that by 2030, 95% of the code will be generated by artificial intelligence. However, he emphasized that humans will still play a crucial role in software development, although their functions will change significantly. Scott stated that authorship will still remain with humans, but they will move to a new 'level of abstraction', from managing code with programming languages to managing with prompts. Scott thinks that AI will not replace developers, but will transform their work processes. Instead of writing code manually, programmers will give AI instructions and hints, freeing them to focus on higher-level tasks such as system design, problem-solving, and strategic thinking. However, Scott acknowledged that current AI systems are far from perfect and struggle with 'remembering' user preferences. In contrast, IBM's CEO, Arvind Krishna, is more conservative in his assessment, believing that AI will only automate 20-30% of coding tasks. 'If you can produce 30% more code with the same number of people, will there be more or fewer programs?' he asked, implying that increased efficiency will lead to growth in the industry rather than job losses. Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, made a more ambitious prediction, stating that AI could generate up to 90% of code in the next six months. However, all experts agree that programmers will need to seriously rethink their approach to work in the near future.

**Microsoft CTO predicts AI will generate 95 percent of code by 2030**
Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott predicts that 95 percent of programming code will be AI-generated by 2030, but emphasizes that human involvement in software engineering will still be necessary. Scott believes AI will change the workflow of developers, allowing them to focus on higher-level tasks like design and problem-solving, while AI handles repetitive tasks. However, current AI systems have limitations, particularly in retaining memory, but Scott predicts that future AI tools will offer more personalized and context-aware assistance. Other industry leaders, such as IBM CEO Arvind Krishna and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, have more measured outlooks, predicting that AI will enhance productivity rather than replace programmers outright. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has a more aggressive timeline, predicting that AI could generate up to 90 percent of code within six months.

**AI is eroding code quality states new in-depth report**
A new report from GitClear suggests that AI coding assistants are eroding code quality by increasing duplicated and copy/pasted code and decreasing refactoring. The researchers analyzed 211 million lines of code and found that the number of code blocks with 5 or more duplicated lines increased by 8 times in 2024. They also noted a 39.9 percent decrease in the number of moved lines, which is evidence of refactoring. According to GitClear, AI assistants make it easy to insert new blocks of code, but less likely to propose reusing similar functions elsewhere in the code. In contrast, Google's 2024 DORA report claimed that increased AI adoption improved code quality by 3.4 percent, but also identified a 7.2 percent reduction in delivery stability. The DORA researchers suggest that AI allows developers to deliver more code more quickly, but also leads to more changes that are slower and more prone to creating instability.

**Data Centres Can Cut Energy Use By Up To 30% With Just About 30 Lines of Code, Research Shows**
Researchers from the University of Waterloo have found that data centres can reduce their energy usage by up to 30% by altering around 30 lines of code in the Linux kernel's network stack. The breakthrough comes from interrupt request suspension, a technique that optimises CPU power efficiency by reducing unnecessary interruptions during high-traffic conditions. According to Professor Martin Karsten, 'We didn't add anything, we just rearranged what is done when, which leads to a much better usage of the data centre's CPU caches.' Data centres will be responsible for up to 4% of global power demand by 2030, driven by AI. However, data center operators and businesses are not prioritizing sustainability, with many relaxing their sustainability goals to allow for AI expansions.
