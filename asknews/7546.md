**Euskadi registers 22,368 deaths in 2024, a 0.3% decrease from the previous year**
According to the Eustat Institute, the Basque Country (Euskadi) registered 22,368 deaths in 2024, a 0.3% decrease from the previous year, with 9,464 more deaths than births. COVID-19 was the cause of 246 deaths, a 31.28% decrease from 2023. The main causes of death were tumors (1,512 deaths) and cardiovascular diseases (1,446 deaths), accounting for 53.6% of all deaths. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the number of deaths in Euskadi decreased by 3.3% compared to the same quarter in 2023, with 5,512 deaths. The main causes of death in this quarter were also tumors and cardiovascular diseases. 'The data shows a decrease in deaths due to COVID-19, which is a positive trend,' said the Eustat Institute. 'However, the number of deaths due to tumors and cardiovascular diseases remains a concern.'

**Undercounting of Covid deaths: Over 43K more people died in 2021 compared to in Haryana2020 - The Tribune**
The Medical Certification of Cause of Death (MCCD) report for 2021 revealed a significant increase in registered deaths in Haryana, with a 20.3% rise compared to the previous year. This jump is attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, with 11,799 reported deaths in 2021, a 900% increase from 2020. However, the report also noted that only 25.3% of all registered deaths were medically certified in 2021. Health economist Aswini Nanda explained that the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of respiratory infections, leading to many COVID-19 deaths being misclassified as respiratory infections, which rose by 92.6% in 2021. 'Not all deaths are medically certified in India,' Nanda said, 'and it appears that many Covid deaths have been classified as deaths due to respiratory infections.'

**'India saw 9.3% excess deaths during first 2 Covid years': Government sources | India News - The Times of India**
According to government sources, India recorded 9.3% 'excess deaths' in 2020-21, the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic. Excess deaths refer to additional deaths from any cause observed during these years, over and above the expected fatalities in the absence of the pandemic. The US reported 17.6% more deaths than expected, while Italy and the UK reported 11.8% excess deaths, and Russia reported 29.9% such deaths. In contrast, India's excess mortality was lower than that of other high- and middle-income countries, with Mexico reporting 43.6% excess mortality and Brazil reporting 12.6% excess mortality. Government sources clarified that excess deaths in these years are not equal to deaths caused due to Covid-19, but rather include reported Covid deaths, unreported Covid-19 deaths, deaths due to all other causes, and possible indirect effects of Covid-19. Officials from the health ministry stated that the number of deaths documented in the Civil Registration System has been increasing over time, even in the years preceding the Covid-19 outbreak. Based on preliminary analyses of CRS data, the expected number of deaths in 2020 and 2021 would be 81,31,869 and 86,54,185, respectively, but the observed deaths were 81,15,882 and 1,02,24,506, resulting in a total excess deaths of 15,54,334, which translates into about 9.3% higher than the expected deaths.

**COVID-19 becomes 4th leading cause of death in the US, mortality rate declines**
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in the US in 2022, with a decline in mortality rate. In 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death among people over 15 and the leading cause of death among 45-54 year olds. However, in 2022, it caused approximately 187,000 deaths, representing about 6% of total deaths. This is a significant decrease from the approximately 700,000 deaths caused by COVID-19 between 2020 and 2021. As Dr. Lalaina Andriamparany notes, 'the Covid has become a common cold' in the US, with the country treating it like influenza. This shift in approach is also being adopted by Japan, which is treating COVID-19 as a seasonal illness. The CDC's report highlights the decline in mortality rate and the decrease in COVID-19-related deaths, indicating a positive trend in the US.

**​A belated admission: on the undercount of India's COVID-19 pandemic deaths**
Four years after the delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus hit India, the government has finally admitted to significant excess deaths in 2021. According to the Registrar General of India, there were 21.5 lakh excess deaths in 2021, which is nearly 6.5 times more than the reported 3.32 lakh COVID-19 deaths. The high number of excess deaths was estimated to be even higher in certain states, such as Gujarat (44.2), Madhya Pradesh (19.5), Uttar Pradesh (19.5), and Telangana (18.2). The government's delay in releasing this report, alongside the Sample Registration System Report for 2021, reveals its reluctance to comprehensively assess the pandemic's true impact and its casual approach to publishing critical demographic data. The civil registration system in India has improved over time, but medical certification of the causes of deaths remains low compared to other developing countries. The delay in releasing vital data defeats the purpose of the improvements made in civil registration, and 'data delayed is also data denied.'

**India saw lower excess mortality in 2020-21 than western countries - The Tribune**
According to official sources, India's excess mortality rate in 2020-21 was lower than several Western countries, standing at 9.3 percent. The sources clarified that not all excess deaths can be attributed to Covid-19, as the number of deaths documented in the Civil Registration System (CRS) had been increasing over time, even before the Covid-19 outbreak. The Sample Registration Survey (SRS) did not mention the crucial 'expected deaths' section in its report, making it difficult to calculate the percentage of excess deaths. Officials explained that the excess mortality could include unreported Covid-19 deaths, as well as deaths due to other causes and possible indirect effects of Covid-19. The annual increase in deaths registered in the CRS could be attributed to several reasons, including a larger population cohort, maturing reporting processes, and increased awareness about the need for registration. An official stated, 'Our teams conducted preliminary analyses of the CRS data to assess cumulative excess deaths in the years 2020 and 2021. Based on the three-year annual rate of increase of 6.42 percent, the expected number of deaths would be 81,31,869 and 86,54,185 in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The observed deaths were 81,15,882 in 2020 and 10,224,506 in 2021. Excess deaths -- defined as observed deaths minus expected deaths -- were 15,987 and 15,70,321.' This translates to 1,249 excess deaths per one million population.

**US Sees First Time in Five Years: More Deaths from Flu than COVID-19**
For the first time in five years, more people in the US have died from the flu than from COVID-19. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current flu season has surpassed COVID-19 as the more deadly virus. Experts attribute this to the acquired immunity and vaccination of the population. 'We need to change our perception that respiratory viruses only cause serious illnesses in the elderly, as we saw with COVID-19. The flu affects even the youngest,' said Peter Chin-Hong, a specialist in infectious diseases and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. The current flu season is dominated by the H1N1 and H3N2 strains, with the latter causing more severe illnesses. Since the widespread spread of the COVID-19 virus in 2020, nearly 42 times more people have died from it in the US than from the flu, according to the CDC. However, preliminary data from the CDC shows that the dynamics of diseases are changing in 2025. From October 2024, at least 29 million people in the US have been infected with the flu, 370,000 have been hospitalized, and 16,000 have died. Experts attribute this to the presence of immunity from both vaccination and previous illness, as well as the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, which now causes less severe complications.

**China finally reveals how Covid-19 started - and it's all America's fault**
Chinese authorities have released an official paper suggesting that COVID-19 originated in the US, claiming it took around 7 million lives globally, including approximately 1.2 million Americans. The report comes amidst heightened tensions between the two superpowers, following a trade war that saw tariffs skyrocket to about 125%. Chinese officials stated, 'A thorough and in-depth investigation into the origins of the virus should be conducted in the United States.' They accused the US government of 'shamelessly politicising SARS-CoV-2 origins tracing' and trying to shift the blame. The US is urged to 'give a responsible answer to the world' and respond to the international community's concerns.

**Diabetes deaths fall to lowest levels in years, in early CDC figures**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. The death rate from diabetes peaked in 2021 at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people, but has decreased to 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people in the third quarter of 2024. Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, stated, 'Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death.' Experts caution that analyzing long-term trends in diabetes deaths is complex due to changes in the definition of the disease and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.

**Five Years of COVID-19: A Pandemic that Changed the World**
It has been five years since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the world was facing a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated on March 11, 2020, 'The WHO has been evaluating this outbreak throughout the day and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. Therefore, we have evaluated that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.' The pandemic, which emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, quickly spread across borders and rapidly spread around the world. According to the WHO, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 777 million infections and more than 7 million deaths worldwide. However, experts estimate that the actual number of deaths could be as high as 15 million. In the United States, the number of deaths from COVID-19 exceeded 1.17 million in 2023, the highest number of deaths of any country. Despite having a large population, the US had a high death rate per million inhabitants, with 3,502 deaths per million, compared to 378 in India and 4 in China.

**How many Americans have died of COVID-19?**
Five years after President Donald Trump declared a national state of emergency over the COVID-19 outbreak, researchers have made progress in estimating the pandemic's toll. Initial projections were alarming, with some models predicting 2.2 million American deaths. However, more recent studies suggest that the actual number of deaths is lower. A February 2024 article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences calculated excess deaths between March 2020 and August 2022, concluding that around 1.2 million Americans had died of COVID-19. Another study calculated excess pandemic mortality in the United States for 2020 and 2021 at 920,731. Considering these calculations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's current count of 1,225,281 American deaths from COVID-19 and related causes may be conservative. Researchers have also made progress in understanding the infection fatality rate for COVID-19, with estimates ranging from 0.12-0.2 percent to 0.64 percent. The upshot is that COVID-19 has either been the underlying cause of or contributed to the deaths of some 1.3 million Americans since Trump's COVID-19 national emergency declaration.

**5 Years Since the COVID-19 Pandemic: Hospitalizations and Deaths Continue to Decline**
It has been five years since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), millions of Americans have been hospitalized and over 1.2 million people have died since then. Additionally, millions of adults and children are still experiencing the effects of their illness and have been diagnosed with long COVID. In the last 28 days, approximately 3,800 Americans were hospitalized due to COVID-19, with only 1.3% of hospital beds and ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients. The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was 1.4 per 100,000 people during the week ending March 1, with the peak for the 2024-25 season being 4.2 per 100,000 people during the week ending January 4. Since the pandemic began, over 1.22 million Americans have died from COVID-19 as of March 6, 2025, with 274 deaths reported during the week ending March 1. The age-adjusted mortality rate is currently 0.1 per 100,000 people, which has remained relatively consistent since the spring of 2024 and is among the lowest rates recorded since the pandemic. Studies have suggested that COVID-19 vaccines, combined with mitigation measures, have helped save hundreds of thousands of lives in the United States. Long COVID is a condition that occurs when someone infected with COVID-19 is within three months of their initial diagnosis and lasts at least two months.

In the United States, nearly 1.2 million people have died from the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Former Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak announced the state's closure due to the pandemic, stating, 'We don't have time to waste. At this time, we must act aggressively and decisively to protect ourselves, our families, and our community.' The pandemic has had a significant impact on the world, with many workers losing their jobs and schools shifting to remote learning.

**Five Years Since the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Look Back at the Devastating Consequences**
It has been five years since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020. The world has had to learn how to cope with the worst health emergency in the past 100 years. The numbers of deaths, infections, and vaccines administered are staggering, as well as the data that points to the coronavirus as the cause of the largest economic recession since the Great Depression. Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director for the management of epidemic and pandemic threats at the WHO, notes, 'Many people want to forget what happened, there is a desire to pretend it didn't happen, but the virus is still with us, circulating and evolving. To act as if nothing happened is a lack of respect for those who died, probably around 20 million people.' According to official data, over 7 million people have died from COVID-19 worldwide (7,083,769 in the WHO's January 5, 2025 report), although the UN estimates a much higher number: at least 20 million. The majority of deaths occurred in 2020 and 2021, totaling 5.49 million, although the WHO estimates global excess mortality for that period at 14.91 million. The peak weekly deaths occurred in January 2021, with around 99,000 deaths per week worldwide. The WHO estimates that 6% of symptomatic COVID cases became persistent COVID, describing a situation where symptoms persist for weeks or months after the initial infection or reappear after a time without them. The tourism sector was one of the most affected, with 2020 being its worst year: losses of 1.07 billion euros (1.3 billion dollars) and 1 billion fewer international arrivals, according to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). The number of tourists fell by 74% in 2020 compared to the previous year. Europe saw a 70% decrease, the Middle East and Africa a 75% decrease, the Americas a 69% decrease, and Asia and the Pacific a 84% decrease. Spain returned to 1995 values, with a 69% decrease. In 2022, international tourism only reached 63% of pre-pandemic levels, in 2023 it approached 90%, and in 2024 it recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

**Five Years of COVID-19: Who is Still Dying from the Virus?**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the mortality rate for COVID-19 has significantly decreased compared to the early stages of the pandemic. The WHO reports that today, about one in 25 hospital patients with COVID-19 dies, whereas in June 2021, it was one in four. Globally, there have been over seven million reported deaths related to the coronavirus, with 600-1,300 reported deaths per week since the start of 2025. The majority of these deaths are occurring in the US, where the CDC reports that 1,000 people died per week from COVID-19 in early January. However, it is worth noting that the reporting and tracking of COVID-19 cases and deaths are no longer as comprehensive as they were during the pandemic's peak.

The pandemic has caused over 7 million deaths worldwide, according to the WHO's January 5, 2025 report. The United Nations estimates that the actual number of deaths is at least 20 million. The majority of deaths occurred in 2020 and 2021, with a total of 5.49 million. The WHO estimates the global excess mortality for that period to be 14.91 million. The peak weekly deaths occurred in January 2021, with around 99,000 deaths per week worldwide. The year 2021 was the deadliest, with 3.52 million fatalities. The 65+ age group was the most affected, accounting for 54-85% of total deaths until April 2022 and 88% since then. Only 0.2% of COVID-19 deaths were under 15 years old. The number of confirmed cases is estimated to be 777.3 million, with 2022 being the year with the most cases: 445 million. The number of people hospitalized due to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic is 28.1 million. The maximum hospitalizations were reached in early 2021, with 526,000 people entering the hospital weekly worldwide. The peak ICU admissions were reached in June 2021, with 245 people entering the ICU per 1,000 hospitalizations. By November 2024, the number had decreased to 41 admissions per 1,000 hospitalizations. It took less than a year to develop vaccines against the coronavirus, a process that usually takes four to seven years. Between 2020 and the end of 2023, 13.64 billion vaccines were administered worldwide. The 67% of the population had received a primary series of vaccinations, and 32% had received at least one booster dose. In low-income countries, only 5% of the population received booster doses, compared to 49% in high-income countries. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first to be synthesized, and it began to be administered in the UK on December 8, followed by the US on December 14, and then in the EU and other countries. The sales of masks and respirators worldwide reached a value of $379 billion in 2020, up from $12 billion in 2019. In 2021, the value of sales decreased by half due to increased supply. In the early stages of the pandemic, the world used 129 billion masks and 65 billion gloves per month, according to data from the American Chemical Society. The lockdown and suspension of economic activity led to the largest recession since the Great Depression of 1929, with a 3.3% decline in global economic output in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The decline had a significant impact on the EU, where GDP contracted by 6.4% in 2020, and in Latin America, by 7%. In the US, the decline was 3.5%, and in Japan, 4.8%. The tourism sector was one of the most affected, with 2020 being the worst year in its history, with losses of $1.07 trillion (1.3 trillion dollars) and 1 billion fewer international arrivals, according to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). The number of tourists fell by 74% in 2020 compared to the previous year. Europe received 70% fewer tourists, the Middle East and Africa 75%, the Americas 69%, and Asia and the Pacific 84% fewer. Spain returned to 1995 values, with a 69% decline.

**US Sees First Time in Five Years: More Deaths from Flu than COVID-19**
For the first time in five years, more people in the US have died from the flu than from COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 'This winter, the flu has surpassed COVID-19 as the more deadly virus in the US, for the first time in five years,' the CDC statement reads. The most common strains this season are H1N1 and H3N2, with the latter causing more severe illnesses. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, nearly 42 times more people have died from COVID-19 than from the flu. However, new CDC data shows that this year's situation has changed. According to the CDC, over 29 million people in the US have contracted the flu since last fall, with 370,000 hospitalized and 16,000 deaths. Meanwhile, COVID-19 mortality rates have decreased. Experts attribute this to people's immunity from vaccination or previous illness, as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutation, which now causes less severe complications, the CDC notes. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, believes that the rise in flu mortality is due to low vaccination rates and delayed treatment.

**US Sees First Time in Five Years: More Flu Deaths than COVID-19**
For the first time in five years, more people in the US have died from the flu than from COVID-19, according to preliminary data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, nearly 42 times more people have died from COVID-19 than from the flu. However, this year, with over 29 million people infected with the flu since October 2024, 370,000 hospitalized, and 16,000 deaths, the situation may be changing. The CDC notes that the dominant flu strains this year are H1N1 and H3N2, with the latter causing more severe illness. Experts attribute the decline in COVID-19 deaths to the presence of immunity from vaccination and treatment, as well as the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which now causes less severe complications. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist, notes that the increased number of flu deaths is due to inadequate vaccination and delayed treatment. The Russian Rospotrebnadzor has also reported that the epidemiological situation in Moscow is in line with the season, warning that the flu poses a particular risk to the elderly, whose weakened immunity increases the risk of complications and exacerbations of existing diseases.

**COVID-19 becomes 4th leading cause of death in the US, mortality rate declines**
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in the US in 2022, with a decline in mortality rate. In 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death among people over 15 and the leading cause of death among 45-54 year olds. However, in 2022, it caused approximately 187,000 deaths, representing about 6% of total deaths. This is a significant decrease from the approximately 700,000 deaths caused by COVID-19 between 2020 and 2021. As Dr. Lalaina Andriamparany notes, 'the Covid has become a common cold' in the US, with the country treating it like influenza. This shift in approach is also being adopted by Japan, which is treating COVID-19 as a seasonal illness. The CDC's report highlights the decline in mortality rate and the decrease in COVID-19-related deaths, indicating a positive trend in the US.
