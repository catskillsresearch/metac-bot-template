**Daily on Energy, presented by CRES Forum: Legislative text - Washington Examiner**
The House Ways and Means Republicans have released a reconciliation text that aims to cut clean energy tax credits established by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. The proposal would terminate the $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicles, commercial clean vehicle tax credits, and the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit. The bill would also phase out the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits and the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is set to mark up its portion of the budget reconciliation package, which would cancel up to $6.5 billion in unspent funding from the IRA. The Department of Energy is also moving forward with the president's deregulatory agenda by walking back 47 different climate and energy-related regulations. Oil prices surged after the US and China announced a temporary trade agreement to lower tariffs. Chinese battery company CATL plans to raise at least $4 billion to expand overseas. The European Union is asking the Czech Republic to delay signing a nuclear contract with South Korea amid an investigation into foreign subsidies.

**House GOP unveils bill text for slashing Biden energy tax credits**
The House GOP has unveiled a bill that would terminate and modify clean energy and manufacturing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed by Democrats in 2022. The bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, terminate the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit, and block wind energy from the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax. The legislation also subjects the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits to a phase-out period and restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) criticized the bill, saying it would 'jack up prices on American families,' 'kill jobs,' and 'create chaos in the business community.'

**Trump Must Bury Biden's Subsidies for Russian and Chinese Minerals**
The US is heavily reliant on mineral imports from China, which is using its control of supply chains to exert leverage. To break China's hold, the US needs to increase the competitiveness of its mining industry and strengthen incentives for domestic production. However, Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, has failed to achieve its goal due to loopholes that allow foreign-mined minerals to be processed in the US and receive tax credits. This hands subsidies to refiners who import minerals from China and Russia while denying access to US-based mining operations. The author argues that Congress should fix 45X to support American production at every level of the supply chain, close loopholes, and expand eligibility to include domestic mining operations. This would strengthen US competitiveness, take on China, and keep American tax policy focused on supporting domestic investment, jobs, and national security.

**Senator Warnock against proposed clean energy repeals**
Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock is warning that repealing Clean Energy tax credits could lead to the loss of nearly 42,000 jobs in the state. According to Warnock, this includes 7,400 jobs in coastal Georgia. He stated, 'It's a job killer. It's pure and simple.' Warnock is calling out his Republican colleagues in Congress, who are looking to repeal these tax credits, saying, 'Georgia Republicans have a choice to make. These credits have benefited their districts more than blue districts.' Republican Congressman Buddy Carter responded, saying the tax credits are 'inflationary and reckless,' and that he will continue to support policies that bring jobs and growth to the state.

**US House Republicans Propose Massive Rollback of Climate and Energy Policies**
US House Representatives have proposed a massive rollback of climate and energy policies in the budget draft, aiming to repeal tax credits for clean energy, drastically cut funding for electric vehicles and renewable energy, and recover additional climate-related funds. The Republican plan aims to push through a multi-trillion-dollar budget that aligns with President Donald Trump's agenda. The Energy and Commerce Committee presented a proposal that would bring in $6.5 billion by repealing climate-related parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. The Financial Committee, on the other hand, suggested abolishing or letting expire several lucrative tax credits from President Joe Biden's central climate law. According to the proposal, the tax credit for consumers when buying electric vehicles would expire at the end of this year, not in the next decade. Various central tax credits for clean energy would expire by 2031, and a large tax credit for hydrogen production would be ended prematurely. Trump had promised during the election campaign to end state support for electric vehicles and roll back Biden's comprehensive measures against global warming, arguing that these measures were unnecessary and harmed automakers, oil and gas companies, and mining companies. Trump hopes that his first budget after taking office again will fulfill his promises and drastically reduce the federal bureaucracy. The Energy Committee's plan also includes repealing important environmental regulations from the Biden administration, including a regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that would reduce emissions for cars and light trucks starting from model year 2027. The proposal also includes measures to speed up the approval for the export of liquefied natural gas and over $1.5 billion for the Energy Department to refill the strategic oil reserve. 'This law would recover funds that were intended for green misinvestments through 'environmental and climate justice block grants' and other expenditure mechanisms of the EPA and the Energy Department,' wrote Energy Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie in a guest article in the Wall Street Journal, announcing the proposal on Sunday. The law also includes the elimination of the remaining, unused funds from the $27 billion fund to reduce greenhouse gases - a central goal of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who claimed in court proceedings that the money was being used fraudulently. Unspent funds from nine funding programs of the Inflation Reduction Act for renewable energy and electrification, such as guarantees for energy loans to indigenous communities and the financing of transmission lines, as well as unused funds from the Energy Department's credit office would also be recovered. Unused funds from the Inflation Reduction Act for methane reduction in oil and gas facilities, greenhouse gas reporting, reducing air pollutants in ports, production facilities and schools, and funds that should enable low-income communities to access clean energy would also be repealed. 'Your proposal destroys investments that lower energy costs, drive a boom in domestic industry, and bring essential health services to communities that need them most,' criticized Lena Moffitt, Executive Director of the environmental organization Evergreen Action. The proposed cuts by the Financial Committee also include a quick expiration of the 'technology-neutral' 45Y tax credits for wind, solar, and other clean energy sources. These credits had no expiration date and would now end in 2031. Also, the transferability, a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allowed developers to sell their tax credits and use the funds to finance the construction of their projects, would be abolished according to the proposal.

**In Defense of the Consumer: A Call for Action**
Many people are struggling with the rising cost of living, including increased energy prices. According to the Federal Government, prices of goods and services will increase by 5.4% this year, while inflation will remain at least 3%. Energy prices are expected to rise by 7%. For Latinos, the situation is even more concerning, as a study by the University of Indiana found that two out of five Latinos have struggled to pay their electricity bills, and 18% have had their electricity disconnected at least once. However, solutions and benefits exist to help make life and finances brighter. Unfortunately, the administration is trying to end funding for the Home Appliance and Home Efficiency Rebate Project, but funds seem to be flowing again, benefiting low-income families. In Congress, important tax credits, such as the Home Energy Efficiency Improvement Credit (25C), are also under threat. These initiatives are part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which dedicates billions to help consumers save money on their energy bills. Despite political attacks on this law, there is growing Republican support to preserve tax credits in the manufacturing sector, which is creating good jobs for making batteries and electric vehicles. These savings initiatives should not be politicized because they benefit everyone in a non-partisan way. The 50 states, excluding South Dakota, have received approval to launch these rebate programs. Twelve states, including several with high Latino populations, have already launched their rebate programs, and 15 others have been granted funds after the November elections. These programs are extremely popular, with over 3.4 million families benefiting from the IRA in 2023, receiving $8.4 billion in tax credits to electrify and make their homes more efficient. Additionally, they promoted the creation of 142,000 jobs in the clean energy economy. In summary, rebate programs achieve: Reducing energy inflation costs. Creating local jobs. Boosting the manufacturing sector. And strengthening the national electrical grid and energy security. Consumers face significant inflationary pressure, labor market uncertainty, and the rigors of the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act and its historic aid and benefits approved by Congress constitute a well-deserved relief, especially for low- and moderate-income families.

**Trump's Zollpoker: Uncertainty Continues to Plague Clean-Tech Sector**
The recent announcements by the Trump administration have caused significant uncertainty in the global markets, with the US stock market losing over 10% in just two days. This has also affected the Clean-Tech sector, with additional uncertainty caused by the new administration's unclear stance on continuing the incentives from the 'Inflation Reduction Act' (IRA). The IRA, signed into law by Biden in 2023, provides financial incentives to accelerate the transition to a carbon-free economy and combat climate change. Originally, this package was expected to boost the growth of renewable energy. However, the Trump administration's policies, including tariffs of up to 200% on solar panels and modules from China and 271.45% on Vietnamese components, have led to the creation of jobs in the solar industry, particularly in Republican states. First Solar, the largest producer of solar modules in the US, has been able to maintain its value due to its domestic supply chain. Experts from Erste Asset Management believe that the Inflation Reduction Act will not be completely repealed, as it enjoys broad support among Republicans. However, the uncertainty will persist until the trade war ends, which is not yet in sight, and this will continue to harm the US industry.

**House Energy and Commerce releases reconciliation bill**
The House Energy and Commerce Committee has released its section of the Republicans' reconciliation bill, which aims to cut spending and mandates from the Democrats' 2022 climate law. The legislation includes plans to repeal unobligated dollars from EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and scrap Biden-era vehicle-emissions rules. According to Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), the bill would 'reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, returning $6.5 billion in unspent funds.' The committee plans to begin marking up the legislation on Tuesday afternoon, but it's unclear when lawmakers will advance it. The bill also includes a new fee on natural gas export project permitting, with the Secretary of Energy deeming the application 'in the public interest' upon receipt and collection of the fee.

**Energy & Sustainability Washington Update -- May 2025**
The Trump administration has made significant changes to federal energy and environmental policy, including a dramatic reduction in the federal workforce, with over 260,000 employees either dismissed, retired, or voluntarily separated. The administration has also taken steps to reshape the federal permitting landscape, including the use of emergency authorities to accelerate approvals and the addition of high-profile mining projects to the national permitting dashboard. Meanwhile, Congress has continued deliberations around potential reconciliation bills to preserve the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax rates that expire this year. Key to this will be the fate of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, such as the 45E Investment Tax Credit (ITC), the 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC), 45V Hydrogen Credit and the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit. Despite ideological divisions, bipartisan efforts have emerged to preserve incentives critical to domestic industry and job creation. Staff cuts have also been made at key energy agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Department of the Interior (DOI). The administration has framed these changes as necessary efficiency measures, although clean energy advocates, industry coalitions, and public sector stakeholders have raised concerns about diminished institutional capacity and potential delays in project execution.

**Q&A: Top energy Republican talks reconciliation, IRA repeals**
Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas) announced that Republicans will take a 'surgical' approach to repealing parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, focusing on incentives that distort energy markets in favor of weather-dependent generation sources. However, Pfluger stated that Republicans will also provide significant government incentives and regulatory rollbacks for 'reliable' energy sources like oil, gas, and nuclear. As chair of the Republican Study Committee, Pfluger's voice holds significant weight in reconciliation discussions. According to Pfluger, 'Republicans will not be scared to adjust energy markets' to favor GOP-favored energy sources.

**Four Paths for Inflation Reduction Act Reforms**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has introduced new tax breaks, but many of these subsidies are more expensive than initially forecasted. Policymakers are considering repealing these subsidies to extend expiring tax cuts. However, full repeal may be difficult due to support from some Republican lawmakers. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the likely approach to IRA reform as 'somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.' The IRA's green credits are projected to cost $1.16 trillion from 2025 to 2034, but repealing all green energy tax credits could raise $851 billion over the same period. A more targeted approach would be to eliminate specific provisions, such as the EV tax credits, which have numerous problems, including high inframarginal payments. Repealing the tax credits for electric vehicles, refueling property, and clean fuel production, as well as the tax credits aimed at the residential sector, could raise $295 billion. Alternatively, gutting the 'Everything Bagel' approach by repealing many of the add-on subsidies attached to the clean energy provisions and leaving the core credits in place could be a more feasible option. This could involve setting up a replacement PTC with a flat rate of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, adjusted for inflation annually. This option could raise $207 billion. A more aggressive option, featuring repeal of most of the credits in the IRA, could raise $746 billion.

**Strange bedfellows unite to kill carbon capture credit**
Reps. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) have introduced legislation to repeal the 45Q tax credit, which incentivizes energy companies to capture and store carbon dioxide. Perry, a climate change skeptic, called the credit 'wasteful' and said it 'subsidizes technologies that serve no purpose beyond distorting energy markets.'

**Treasury Issues Final Regulations on Technology Neutral Clean Energy Projects**
The US Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have issued final regulations for technology-neutral tax credits for clean energy projects under Sections 45Y and 48E of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The regulations provide additional rules and guidelines for calculating a facility's greenhouse gas emissions rate and boundaries for performing lifecycle analysis. The technology-neutral production tax credit (45Y PTC) and technology-neutral investment tax credit (48E ITC) will replace many existing credits under Sections 45 and 48, and are available for facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024. The regulations also clarify the definition of 'alternative fate' and prohibit the use of book-and-claim accounting systems to establish or claim the energy attributes of fuels and feedstocks. Additionally, the regulations provide guidance on the One-Megawatt Exception, incremental cost, ownership, hydrogen energy storage property, and the 80/20 and Incremental Production Rules.

**Tech-Neutral Credits Final Regulations Released for Clean Electricity Production**
The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service have released final regulations for the Tech-Neutral Credits, a new tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The credits include the clean electricity production credit under Section 45Y (Section 45Y PTC) and the clean electricity investment credit under Section 48E (Section 48E ITC). The Section 45Y PTC is available for qualified facilities that generate electricity with a greenhouse gas emissions rate not greater than zero and are placed in service after 2024. The Section 48E ITC is available for qualified investments in qualified facilities that generate electricity with a greenhouse gas emissions rate not greater than zero and are placed in service after 2024, or energy storage technology. The Tech-Neutral Credits are subject to special phaseout rules, which begin on the later of 2032 or the calendar year in which the IRS determines that the annual GHG emissions from U.S. electricity production are 25% or less of the 2022 levels. The final regulations provide standards for an eligible metering device and definitions for related and unrelated persons. Taxpayers must own at least a fractional interest in an entire unit of a qualified facility or energy storage technology to claim the Tech-Neutral Credits. The regulations also provide rules for incremental production, the 80/20 Rule, and qualified interconnection property. Co-located qualified facilities are eligible to claim the Tech-Neutral Credits, provided the cost basis for the shared property is properly allocated in proportion to each taxpayer's ownership interest.

**Proposed bill would repeal 45Z clean fuel production tax credit**
Representative Beth Van Duyne has introduced a bill to repeal the Section 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The credit supports the production of low-carbon transportation fuels, but critics argue that the initial guidance released by the Treasury Department falls short of expectations. The guidance has been met with mixed reactions from industry groups, with some praising the inclusion of climate-smart agriculture practices and others criticizing the lack of clarity on key details. The American Carbon Alliance and National Farmers Union have expressed disappointment with the guidance, while the American Soybean Association and National Oilseed Processors Association have welcomed the Treasury's notice of intent to propose regulation. The industry is urging the Treasury Department to finalize and publish guidance for the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Credit as soon as possible, citing the need for policy certainty and the potential for significant headwinds and business risks if the guidance is not published promptly.

**US state attorneys general urge Congress to keep IRA clean energy credits**
A coalition of 17 US state attorneys general has sent a letter to Congress urging them to retain investments under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Since the IRA's passage in 2022, businesses have invested nearly $500 billion in low-carbon energy and domestic manufacturing, with private investment exceeding public spending five- to six-fold. The coalition is concerned that repealing certain tax credits, such as the Section 45X credit for advanced manufacturing, the Section 48C credit for investments in advanced energy, and the Section 48E clean electricity investment credit, could stymie important projects and leave gaps where jobs and revenue streams were expected. The letter highlights several large projects already benefiting US communities, including a $150 million investment by Siemens in a power transformer factory in North Carolina, which will create over 550 jobs, and a $1.6 billion investment by Our Next Energy in an electric vehicle battery gigafactory in Michigan, which will employ over 2,000 people by 2027. 'Our nation is strengthening domestic energy security, reducing energy costs, diversifying our domestic energy resources, rebuilding our domestic manufacturing economy, bolstering and modernizing critical infrastructure, and creating well-paying jobs while simultaneously reducing harmful pollution,' the letter said.
