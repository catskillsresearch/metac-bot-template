**Boluarte's US Trip: A Question of Official Invitation or Personal Gesture?**
Peruvian President Dina Boluarte has turned a comment made by J.D. Vance, a US politician, into a reason for a new trip to the US. Vance told Boluarte, 'When are you going to visit the US?', which some saw as a kind invitation, while others believed it was an official invitation. The Peruvian government has tried to use this comment as a reason to convince Congress to approve a new presidential trip, but it seems like a 'wanderlust' or a strong desire to travel. Boluarte announced that she was invited to the US before even making a formal request to Congress for authorization. This move has sparked controversy, especially considering the current tensions between the government and Congress, as well as the recent vote of confidence and the appointment of a censured prime minister as the Peruvian representative to the UN. The official invitation was not made in writing, as is customary, but rather as a comment made by Vance in a meeting at the Vatican. 'It's a bit of a tango between the Congress and Boluarte, and also between the officialdom and the opposition,' said Chancellor Elmer Schialer. The situation is still unclear, and it remains to be seen whether Boluarte will actually receive an official invitation or if this is just a personal invitation.

**Vice President JD Vance Just Delivered Incredible News to Bitcoin Investors | The Motley Fool**
Vice President JD Vance recently gave a keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, where he reiterated the pro-crypto regulatory approach of the Trump administration. Vance emphasized that the White House is thinking about Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset and is working on new legislation for dollar-pegged stablecoins and a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto. He also stated that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be codified in law, making it more difficult for future administrations to reverse existing policies. Vance's comments are seen as a positive sign for Bitcoin investors, who can expect more innovation, economic growth, and wealth as a result of the White House's support. However, some have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Vance's own holdings of Bitcoin and the involvement of other Trump family members in Bitcoin ventures. Despite this, the White House's support for Bitcoin is seen as a major boost for the cryptocurrency, making it more likely to achieve mainstream adoption.

**Pete Buttigieg Leads Democratic Poll for 2028 Presidential Election, JD Vance Tops Republican List**
A recent poll by AtlasIntel shows that Pete Buttigieg, the former US Transportation Secretary, is the most popular choice among Democrats for the 2028 presidential election, with 31.5% of the vote. JD Vance, the current US Vice President, is the most popular choice among Republicans, with 37.3% of the vote. The poll also found that 50.9% of respondents would vote for a Democratic candidate in a mid-term election, while 41.7% would vote for a Republican candidate. Kamala Harris, the current US Vice President, saw a decline in her popularity, with 16.6% of the vote, possibly due to the recent controversy surrounding Joe Biden's health. Pete Buttigieg has not ruled out a potential presidential run, and some speculate that he may be preparing for another bid. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has not commented on speculation that she may run for president in 2028, but some believe she could be a potential candidate for the Senate.

**US Vice President Says Bitcoin Is a Better Store of Value - The Market Periodical**
US Vice President JD Vance has highlighted Bitcoin as a means of payment and store of value, describing it as a digital asset capable of functioning similarly to traditional forms of payment like dollar bills and gold. He emphasized that Bitcoin allows individuals to buy and sell goods securely, with less risk of fraud compared to physical currency. Vance also recognized the risks tied to emerging technologies, but contrasted this with the Trump administration's regulatory approach, which favors innovation over strict market restrictions. Analyst Mister Crypto has identified recurring patterns in Bitcoin's price history, suggesting a potential breakout in 2025, with a price target of up to $910,000. This analysis provides context for Vance's comments on Bitcoin's evolving role and the administration's crypto-friendly policies.

**The Trump Crisis: It Will All Finish in 3.6 Years – Comfort and Common Sense in Simple Statistic - Asian Wealth Management and Asian Private Banking**
The author suggests that countries and companies should ignore US President Trump's economic policies and wait out the remaining 3.6 years of his presidency. The author argues that Trump's policies are unpredictable and will likely change after he leaves office. They provide several statistics and legal arguments to support their claim that Trump will not be able to serve a third term, including the possibility of a constitutional amendment to limit presidential terms. The author also discusses the potential for a 'House of Cards' scenario, where Trump tries to become president again by having his VP, J.D. Vance, resign and then Trump assumes the presidency. However, they argue that this scenario is unlikely due to the 22nd Amendment, which limits a president to two terms. The author concludes that waiting out Trump's presidency is the best course of action, as it will likely cost less than changing the global trading system to accommodate his policies.

**US Vice President JD Vance's 7 Key Messages on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency**
US Vice President JD Vance spoke at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, delivering a significant speech to Bitcoin investors. Vance emphasized that Bitcoin has already improved the well-being of millions of American citizens and that he believes around 50 million Americans own Bitcoin, which will soon reach 100 million. He described cryptocurrency as a 'insurance against inflation' and stated that it has benefited many people who do not have access to traditional banking. Vance also highlighted the potential of blockchain technology in various fields, from supply chain management to healthcare. He emphasized that cryptocurrency is a safeguard against bad policy decisions in Washington, inflation, and the increasingly exclusionary private sector. Vance also mentioned that cryptocurrency is a safeguard against the 'elites who seize new technologies to control them.' He assured that Bitcoin will never become a control mechanism and that the audience will prevent this from happening. Vance stated that there is now a true friend and supporter of cryptocurrency in the White House, referring to the Biden administration's past hostility towards cryptocurrency. He emphasized that the Biden administration's approach to cryptocurrency is unacceptable and that they will continue to remove officials like Gary Gensler who are hostile to cryptocurrency. Vance also stated that stablecoins are not a threat, but rather a catalyst to increase the power of the dollar. He expressed his desire to make Bitcoin a part of the main economy and to create a transparent and innovative regulatory framework for digital assets. Vance encouraged the cryptocurrency community to be active in politics, saying 'If you don't participate in politics, they will ignore this sector.' He also mentioned that Bitcoin will be a strategic asset for the US in the next decade, and that the US should be more supportive of it, especially since China, their main competitor, is opposed to it. Finally, Vance warned the audience not to ignore the developments in artificial intelligence, which could positively or negatively affect Bitcoin, and expressed his desire for the US to be a leader in this area.

**Trump Says He Doesn’t View J.D. Vance As His ‘Successor’**
President Donald Trump stated that it's too early to decide whether Vice President JD Vance is his 'successor' ahead of the 2028 election. Trump described Vance as 'competent' but declined to endorse him, saying 'it's too early.'

Vance, 40, is the second-youngest vice president in U.S. history and has been a loyal supporter of Trump's populist views. Trump selected Vance as his running mate in July 2024 at the urging of his son, Donald Trump Jr.

**Donald Trump Leaves JD Vance Embarrassed When Asked If He'll Endorse Him In 2028 Elections**
When asked by Fox News' Bret Baier if he would endorse JD Vance in the 2028 presidential elections, Donald Trump replied, 'No.' Trump acknowledged Vance's capabilities but stated that it's 'too early' to make a decision. Vance, who is serving as the 50th Vice President of the United States, shares Trump's ideology and has been working with him since his second term as POTUS began in January 2025. Trump hinted that he and Vance make a great team, but his comments about Vance's political future seem to have left him embarrassed. Some people believe that Trump 'dodged the question' because he has no intention of leaving office, as he has expressed his desire to run for a third term. However, the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits a president from being elected more than twice. Efforts are being made to change the law, but a proposed resolution would also prevent other living presidents from being elected again.
