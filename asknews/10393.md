**If Third World War breaks out, which countries will choose Russia, India and China will choose...**
The world has seen several deadly conflicts in recent times, including the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Gaza conflict, and the India-Pakistan tensions. Media reports have speculated that a world war may follow if these conflicts do not end in the years to come. If a war-like scenario arises, possible blocks may form, with countries aligning with Russia, India, and China. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas to accept the Gaza ceasefire deal proposed by US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, 'or be destroyed.' The proposal includes the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 bodies in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza. Ukraine launched Operation Spider Web against Russia, carrying out massive drone attacks targeting several airfields deep across the Russian territories. This military action came against the backdrop of scheduled peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul.

**Four Prophets Predict Start of Third World War by End of 2025**
Four renowned prophets have predicted the start of the Third World War by the end of 2025. According to New York Post, Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian seer Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicholas Ouley have independently predicted a massive conflict that could change the course of human history. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has predicted the 9/11 attacks, the death of Princess Diana, and recent earthquakes caused by climate change. She also predicted the start of war in Europe this year, which she sees as the beginning of 'humanity's downfall' and a global catastrophe for the planet's population. Nostradamus, in his 'Prophecies' of 1555, also made ominous predictions, including the rise of Adolf Hitler and the COVID-19 pandemic. This time, he warns that the UK will be drawn into brutal wars. He wrote: 'When those in European lands see England establish its throne behind, its flanks will be beset by brutal wars. The kingdom will be marked by wars so brutal that enemies from within and without will rise up.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian seer, also warns of an inevitable global conflict. According to his prophecy, the Third World War will be especially dangerous due to the use of new technologies, cyber weapons, and machines. He says: 'This is not just a war of people, but a war of machines, and what will happen next? The worst is yet to come.' Nicholas Ouley, a 38-year-old London hypnotherapist, adds that the war may start as early as mid-2025. He attributes this to 'a lack of compassion in the world', which provokes terrible acts of violence and hatred in the name of religion and nationalism. According to his prophecy, humanity will face unprecedented brutality and senselessness. All these terrifying predictions coincide with the current tense geopolitical situation. In late May 2025, Pakistan and India exchanged rocket attacks on military targets, leading to US calls for negotiations to stop the escalation of the conflict. Although the parties agreed to a ceasefire, it was violated within hours in the Kashmir region. Meanwhile, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has claimed the lives of at least seven people in recent weeks due to massive rocket and drone attacks on Kiev and other regions. These events demonstrate the high level of tension and seriousness of the situation. Experts in the field of technology also warn of the danger posed by uncontrolled development of artificial intelligence, comparing it to nuclear weapons in terms of potential threat. This idea resonates with Atos Salome's warning about the 'machine war' of the future.

**'Proud of stopping nuclear war'**
US President Donald Trump has stated that he is 'proud of stopping potentially a nuclear war' between India and Pakistan through trade, rather than through 'bullets'. Trump claimed that he told India and Pakistan that the US would stop trade with the two nations if they didn't stop the conflict. However, India has rejected this claim, stating that the issue of trade did not come up in talks between Indian and American leaders during the military clashes with Pakistan. Trump also announced that he is doubling the tariff on steel imports to 50% to protect the US steel industry, and that aluminum tariffs will also be doubled to 50%. Additionally, an appeals court has refused to freeze a California judge's order halting the Trump administration's plan to downsize the federal workforce.

**Trump reiterates he prevented Indo-Pak n-war**
US President Donald Trump has stated that the 'deal' he is most proud of is preventing a potential nuclear war between India and Pakistan through trade, rather than through conflict. Trump claimed that he told India and Pakistan that the US would stop trade with the two nations if they didn't stop the conflict. However, India has rejected this claim, stating that trade was not discussed during talks between Indian and American leaders during the military clashes with Pakistan. Trump said, 'I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that we're dealing with India, we're dealing with Pakistan and we were able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade as opposed through bullets.'

**Trump at it again, says US averted India-Pak 'N-war' - The Tribune**
Former US President Donald Trump claimed that he prevented a 'nuclear war' between India and Pakistan by threatening to stop trade with the two nations. Trump said, 'I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that we're dealing with India, we're dealing with Pakistan and we were able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade as opposed to bullets.' However, both India and Pakistan have denied the claims, with Pakistan's Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza stating, 'Nothing happened this time... But you can't rule out any strategic miscalculation at any time.' India has also refuted the US claims, saying that the issue of trade did not come up in talks between Indian and American leaders during the military clashes with Pakistan.

**India readies to face 2040 naval threat, as Pak-China-Turkey axis emerges  - The Sunday Guardian Live**
India is facing a growing maritime challenge from a coordinated China-Turkiye-Pakistan naval build-up by 2040. The three nations are not part of any formal alliance, but their hidden coordination and converging maritime postures suggest the emergence of a strategic triangle. China is expected to operate six aircraft carriers, 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines, and a surface fleet of over 150 warships by 2040. Turkiye is modernizing its navy with aircraft carriers, destroyers, and stealth submarines, while Pakistan is expected to field eight Hangor-class submarines and four Type 054A/P guided missile frigates. The combined strength of these three navies will outmatch India's projected naval capabilities by 2040, forcing the Indian Navy to split its forces across three distinct theatres. India must rapidly evolve its naval force structure to counter this challenge, including deploying three aircraft carriers, 200 warships, and 500 naval aircraft, and ensuring its submarine fleet is fully operational and technologically current.

**India Confirms Loss of Fighter Jets in Clashes with Pakistan, Denies Nuclear War**
India has confirmed for the first time that it lost an unspecified number of fighter jets during the clashes with Pakistan in May, but denied that the conflict came close to nuclear war. According to Indian Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Anil Chauhan, 'What matters is not the fall of the aircraft itself, but the reason for its fall.' He rejected Pakistan's claims that it shot down six Indian fighter jets as 'completely false', and refused to disclose the number of aircraft lost by India. Chauhan emphasized that what matters is the reason for the fall, and the mistakes made, not the numbers. He explained that India changed its tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of the conflict with Pakistan in early May, and gained a significant advantage before announcing a ceasefire with Pakistan after three days. Chauhan stated that most of the strikes were highly accurate, and that there was a large space before crossing the nuclear threshold, and many signals before that, and nothing of that kind happened. He declined to comment on a question about a statement by US President Donald Trump, who said that his country helped prevent a nuclear war, describing it as 'exaggerated', and emphasized that there is still a lot of room between traditional operations and the nuclear threshold, and that communication channels with Pakistan were always open to control the situation, and there are 'many secondary channels' that can be used to resolve conflicts without resorting to nuclear weapons.'

**Four Days in May: The India-Pakistan Crisis of 2025 • Stimson Center**
A four-day conflict between India and Pakistan occurred from May 7-10, 2025, following a terrorist attack on April 22. India launched punitive strikes on Pakistan on May 7, which led to a series of military exchanges between the two countries. Both sides claimed victory, but the conflict resulted in significant human losses and damage to military equipment. The crisis involved the use of several new weapons systems, including cruise missiles, drones, and short-range ballistic missiles. India demonstrated its ability to deliver precise standoff attacks across large swaths of Pakistan, while Pakistan's air defenses were able to intercept some Indian strikes. The conflict also saw the first instance of drone warfare in the India-Pakistan rivalry, with both sides employing drones with the intent of causing damage on the other. The crisis was costly in terms of human lives and military equipment, and it is likely to have a lasting impact on the bilateral relationship between India and Pakistan. The United States played a significant role in crisis management, and the conflict highlights the need for greater transparency and cooperation between nations in the face of emerging technologies and complex security challenges.

**The Three-Day War: What Was It?**
The three-day war between India and Pakistan in May 2024 was a volatile conflict that highlighted the ongoing tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations. The conflict began on May 7 when India launched Operation Sindoor, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan, in response to attacks by militants in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan responded with its own operation, Bunyān al-Marsūs, but the two sides agreed to a ceasefire on May 10. Despite the ceasefire, gunfire exchanges continued, and both sides used drones and counter-drone systems. Analysts suggest that Pakistan made better use of these systems, which were likely acquired from China and Turkey. The conflict cost both sides $1 billion per hour, or $20 billion per day, and prolonged hostilities were likely not in India's plans, given its ambitions to be seen as the world's fastest-growing major economy. The underlying volatility remains, and further clashes are likely due to the unresolved dispute over Kashmir and external interests, notably China's. 'Reliable defensive coverage is India's hallmark', said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but some military analysts argue that Pakistan's simpler, cost-effective weapons performed better.

**India's Stance in a Potential Third World War**
The world is witnessing increased tensions between various countries, with Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine, the escalating tensions between Turkey and Israel in the Middle East, and the deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan. The growing tensions between powerful nations are raising concerns about the possibility of a third world war. If such a scenario were to unfold, it is likely that the world would be divided into two camps: one led by the US, Europe, and NATO countries, and the other comprising Russia, China, North Korea, and Arab nations. India, which has traditionally followed a policy of non-alignment, would likely remain neutral and focus on protecting its own borders. According to Indian officials, the country's goal is to maintain its independence and avoid getting entangled in global conflicts. 'India's policy has always been to maintain good relations with all countries and avoid taking sides in international conflicts,' said an official. 'We will continue to follow this policy and ensure that our country remains safe and secure.'

**India will not tolerate future terrorism or nuclear threats: Modi**
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to respond strongly to any future 'terrorist attack' and warned that New Delhi would not tolerate 'nuclear blackmail' in the event of further conflict with Pakistan. Modi stated, 'If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given.' He also emphasized that 'India will strike with precision and decisiveness against the terrorist groups thriving under the cover of nuclear blackmail.' US President Donald Trump said that US intervention had prevented a 'bad nuclear war' and 'stopped a nuclear conflict... millions of people could have been killed.' The conflict began after an April 22 attack on tourists in Indian Illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) which killed 26 civilians. India accused Pakistan of backing the attack, but Islamabad denied involvement. The conflict has resulted in at least 60 deaths on both sides. Modi stated, 'If Pakistan wants to survive, it will have to destroy its terror infrastructure.' He also emphasized that 'terror and talks cannot go together... terror and trade cannot go together... water and blood cannot flow together.'

**Experts Believe Large-Scale War Between India and Pakistan Was Averted**
Experts believe that a large-scale war between India and Pakistan was averted, and they can now 'breathe a sigh of relief'. Despite a tense weekend, with drone attacks on Indian Kashmir, the situation has calmed down, and there are hopes for a peaceful resolution. Kenneth Bo Nielsen, a professor of social anthropology at the University of Oslo, says, 'We can breathe a sigh of relief. The chances of de-escalation are good, and I'm quite optimistic.' Arild Engelsen Ruud, a professor of South Asia studies at the University of Oslo, agrees, saying, 'The ceasefire will hold, as both sides have control over their actions. Neither India nor Pakistan has anything to gain from a violent conflict.' The experts attribute the quick resolution to US involvement, and they believe that both countries have had a change of heart, realizing that a war would be disastrous. 'Both sides have had two thoughts in their heads at the same time,' says Nielsen. 'They didn't want to give up when the conflict escalated, but they were also looking for an exit.' The conflict has been described as 'dangerous' and 'far-reaching', with both countries possessing nuclear weapons. The current situation is a result of a drone attack on Hindu tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir in April, which led to a series of retaliatory attacks by India. 'Maybe India has set a new standard for how to respond,' says Nielsen. 'It was very direct and resolute, like a message saying that's how we'll do it in the future too.'

**USA moves bomber planes to Indian Ocean, warning Iran of potential war**
The United States has moved bomber planes and a carrier to the Indian Ocean, sending a clear signal to Iran: if the two countries do not come to an agreement on the nuclear issue, it could lead to war. However, the fact that talks are ongoing is positive, according to expert Alexander Atarodi: 'Given that they are talking, we should give diplomacy a chance.' US President Donald Trump is in dire need of a foreign policy success, and the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas have not been as swift as he claimed during the election campaign. Now, he is focusing on Iran, which he wants to sign a nuclear energy agreement with. The pressure on Iran is already high before the negotiations have even begun. In the week, Donald Trump described military actions against the country as an absolute possibility if the talks, which are set to begin in Muscat, Oman, on Saturday, do not go in the direction the US wants. The bomber planes that have been moved to the military base Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean, along with hundreds of thousands of US soldiers in the region, is a clear signal to Iran before the talks. 'It's very unusual for the US to do this, but it's a sign that they want to put pressure on Iran, that 'we want this agreement with you', says Alexander Atarodi. There is reason to be concerned about a large-scale war, but perhaps a bit less now that diplomatic contacts are actually taking place, according to Atarodi. 'That the US has opened up for diplomatic talks with Iran is surprising. Perhaps the risks are reduced, at least for now, that we will end up in war.' However, Donald Trump's patience is very low and the future is uncertain, he emphasizes. 'It can happen that nothing substantial is achieved during the initial talks. Then his patience will run out and he will want results immediately, and then something else can happen.' Iran wants very clear guarantees that an agreement, if it is reached, will hold. Trust in the US is low and the country also hopes that sanctions that have been imposed on Iran and have devastated the economy and financial system will be lifted. Since Iran has been weakened significantly during the Gaza war, there is currently a willingness from both sides to discuss with each other, despite their hatred for each other, says Alexander Atarodi. 'This is very complex issues, we don't know what will happen, but there are some external factors that make them come a bit closer to each other.'

**Astrologer Predicts Start of Third World War in August 2025**
Kushal Kumar, a renowned Indian astrologer, has predicted a high likelihood of a global armed conflict in the near future. According to his forecast, based on the analysis of planetary aspects, the period until the end of 2025 will be extremely tense. Kumar is particularly concerned about the beginning of August 2025, predicting that an event on August 4 or 5 could trigger the Third World War. He links the possible crisis to key planetary transitions that, in his opinion, foretell sharp changes on the international scene, including political and military upheavals. Kumar, known for his accurate predictions of natural disasters and economic crises, emphasizes that his predictions are not a fatal verdict, but rather a call to vigilance and preparation.

However, another medium, Adelina BlackMoon, has predicted a global awakening after 2035. Meanwhile, Russian astrologer Tatyana Borsh has predicted the end of the world in 2060, but her prediction is not final and requires further verification.

**India Supports Peace in Ukraine, Says Modi**
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that India is on the side of peace in the war between Russia and Ukraine and supports US President Donald Trump's initiatives to end the conflict. Modi made the statement during a meeting with Trump at the White House on February 13. 'The world thought that India was somehow a neutral country in this whole process. But that's not true. India has a side, and that side is peace,' Modi said. Modi emphasized the importance of 'dialogue, diplomacy, and peaceful resolution' of the conflict in Ukraine. He also mentioned that he had previously discussed this with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'I told him that it's not the era of war, and I'm firmly convinced that problems are not solved on the battlefield. Both sides will have to sit down for negotiations,' Modi said. The leaders also discussed economic cooperation, with Trump announcing a 'record business' and large deals, including India's plans to buy 'a lot' of American oil and gas. The US is India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding $118 billion in 2023-2024. Modi had previously met with Putin on July 8 and October 22, 2024, and referred to him as a 'friend.' Modi visited Ukraine on August 23, 2024, his first visit to the country since its independence in 1991. He met with President Zelensky and emphasized the need for negotiations with Russia to end the war.
