**21 Suspects Face Prison for Phishing and Money Laundering Operation**
The Hal-Vilvorde prosecutor's office has requested prison sentences of 12 months to 5 years for 21 individuals involved in a large-scale phishing and money laundering operation. The suspects allegedly purchased gift cards from bol.com using stolen Luxembourgish bank accounts and then used them to make online purchases. The investigation began in late 2022 when the federal police in Hal-Vilvorde discovered suspicious transactions in several Delhaize stores in Flanders and Wallonia. 'Young buyers, recruited through social media platforms like Snapchat, made purchases in the store,' explained the prosecutor. 'They bought tobacco products and especially bol.com gift cards, which were paid for using Payconiq, but not by the young suspects. Instead, they took a photo of the QR code with their smartphone and sent it to their handler, who then made the payments from stolen Luxembourgish bank accounts.' The gift cards were then used to make purchases on bol.com. 'The young suspects, mainly from Brussels, bought items for themselves, but a large part of the purchases went to their handlers. We were able to identify one of them, a man from Leeuwarden in the Netherlands.' In June 2023, the federal police arrested 15 people suspected of being part of the criminal organization, and the prosecutor eventually pursued 21, mostly young people who made the purchases in the stores. Prison sentences of 12 months to two years have been requested for these suspects, and five years for the Dutchman from Leeuwarden.

**University Employee and Student Sentenced in Bribery Scandal**
A former employee of the University of Duisburg-Essen and a former student were sentenced to prison terms in a bribery scandal that rocked the university. The Essen State Court found the 42-year-old defendant guilty of bribery and sentenced him to 3 years and 9 months in prison, while the 39-year-old co-defendant was sentenced to 3 years in prison. According to the court's statement, the defendants admitted to changing the grades of at least 35 students in exchange for bribes between 2017 and 2021. The bribes totaled over 90,000 euros, with students paying up to 900 euros to have their failing grades changed to passing. Those who wanted higher grades were charged an additional 50 euros per 0.3 point increase. The court ruled that the bribery was made possible by the university's former employee's direct and unchecked access to student grades. The court also stated that the former employee worked with the co-defendant, who used their student connections to collect bribes and submit grade requests. Friederike Sommer, the judge of the Essen State Court 1st Criminal Chamber, said, 'The actions of the defendants undermined the public's trust in the state-controlled examination system.' A wide-ranging investigation was launched after the scandal broke, and the university employee was fired in the summer of 2023. The students involved in the bribery scheme were also prosecuted and received fines and suspended prison sentences. Some of their exam results and diplomas were also revoked. The defendants were convicted of bribery and receiving bribes, but their sentences are still pending appeal.

**50-year-old man sentenced to two years for abusing 80-year-old mother and attempting to extort money**
A 50-year-old man from Caerano San Marco was sentenced to two years and two months in prison for physically and emotionally abusing his 80-year-old mother and attempting to extort money from her to buy drugs. According to the prosecution, the man, who was defended by lawyer Andrea Zambon, had a history of violent behavior, using threats and intimidation to get his mother to give him money for drugs. In one instance, he even threatened to kill her with a kitchen knife if she didn't comply. The man's behavior was so egregious that his mother finally reported him to the authorities. The most shocking incident occurred on the night before Christmas in 2023, when the man forced his 18-year-old niece to withdraw money from several ATMs, threatening to harm their grandmother if she didn't comply. The niece was eventually able to take 50 euros from a bank and return home, where the man and his accomplices told her not to say anything to anyone. 'It was a great day' is not a phrase that would be used to describe this situation, as the man's actions were truly despicable.

**Samara Region Court Sentences 12 Members of Narcotics Distribution Group**
A Samara region court has sentenced 12 members of a criminal group involved in the distribution of narcotics. 11 of the defendants are foreign nationals. According to the prosecution, the group was formed in September 2021 with the goal of making a profit from selling narcotics in the Samara region, Moscow, and the Moscow region. 'The group members had assigned roles, with some controlling the amount of narcotics sold, sending packages through a transportation company, while others stored the packaged goods in hiding places and provided their coordinates to the group leaders for further sale through an online store,' said the Samara region prosecutor's office. The group's organizer opened bank accounts in their own name and in the names of third parties, which received payments from buyers. The funds were used to organize the group's activities and transferred abroad. 'The total income exceeded 20 million rubles,' added the prosecutor's office. The group's activities were disrupted by law enforcement in August 2022. Over 3.7 kg of narcotics were seized. The defendants were found guilty of the following articles: Art. 210 of the Criminal Code (creation of a criminal group and participation in it) Art. 30, part 3, Art. 228.1 of the Criminal Code (attempted sale of narcotics) Art. 228.1 of the Criminal Code (sale of narcotics) The court sentenced the defendants to prison terms ranging from 10 years and 6 months to 18 years, with some to be served in general and strict-regime colonies.

**Binance Seeks Dismissal of FTX’s $1.76B Clawback Suit, Calling It ‘Legally Deficient’ - Decrypt**
Binance has asked a Delaware bankruptcy judge to dismiss FTX's $1.76 billion clawback lawsuit, calling it 'legally deficient' and unsupported by facts. Binance claims that FTX's downfall was the result of massive fraud orchestrated by its own leadership, not Binance's actions. The exchange also argues that the court lacks jurisdiction over its foreign entities and that its 2022 tweets were neither false nor misleading. Binance says that FTX is attempting to 'shift the blame' for its collapse away from founder Sam Bankman-Fried and onto his competitors. 'Plaintiffs are pretending that FTX did not collapse as the result of one of the most massive corporate frauds in history,' the filing said, noting that Bankman-Fried is now serving a 25-year prison sentence for defrauding customers, investors, and lenders.

**Two Bank Employees Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison for Embezzlement**
A court in Giza issued a verdict in a case involving two bank employees accused of embezzling approximately 6 million Egyptian pounds from a client through forgery and tampering with official documents. The first defendant, a financial expert at a government bank in the Fayoum governorate, allegedly embezzled around 5.9 million pounds between 2019 and 2022 by manipulating loan applications for clients of good faith. He would submit false data in loan requests, registering amounts higher than what was actually requested from clients, and then taking the difference for his personal account. The investigation also found that he embezzled 156,000 pounds by issuing lower amounts in cashier's checks to several clients who signed the checks without knowing the actual value. The forgery also involved tampering with 60 bank checks issued in the name of 42 suppliers for the benefit of 60 clients. The defendant forged signatures and seals of some suppliers and clients, or obtained their signatures and fingerprints without their knowledge, and then withheld the value of these checks for himself, embezzling more than 5.5 million pounds. He also embezzled an additional 189,000 pounds, representing the value of installments paid by eight clients, which he received without depositing them into the bank. The court found that the financial crimes were linked to forgery of official documents related to his workplace, including 44 loan requests, 60 financing agreements, 30 field visit reports, and several letters and forms addressed to the customer service section to issue checks. The defendant forged these documents by placing forged signatures, fingerprints, and seals of clients, and also created documents containing false events as if they were true. Based on the evidence, the court sentenced the two defendants, 'Mahmoud M' and 'Adel M', to 5 years in prison with hard labor, and ordered them to return the embezzled amount of 5,862,911 pounds, and to pay the same amount as a fine.

**FTX's Bankman-Fried Moved to Low-Security Prison, Home to Infamous Criminals**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, has been moved to the low-security Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island after an unauthorized interview and a reported strategy to appeal to right-wing figures for a potential pardon. Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence for his role in the collapse of FTX, one of the largest frauds in cryptocurrency history. He was convicted in November 2023 and sentenced in March 2024. Bankman-Fried's plan to rebuild his image includes appearing on Tucker Carlson's show and positioning himself as a Republican opposing the 'woke agenda.' Legal experts suggest that this newfound right-wing messaging could be a calculated attempt to secure a pardon from President Trump. Meanwhile, other former FTX executives have faced varying legal outcomes, with FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former engineering director Nishad Singh receiving credit for time served and avoiding prison time due to their cooperation with the investigation.

**Former crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried transferred out of New York prison**
Former crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried has been transferred out of a detention center in Brooklyn, New York, to Oklahoma, a transfer point, on his way to another federal lockup to continue serving his 25-year sentence for orchestrating one of the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history. According to sources, the transfer has more to do with him filing his appeal rather than punishment for conducting an unauthorized videoconference interview with Tucker Carlson. Bankman-Fried had requested to remain at MDC while he appeals his conviction, but the Bureau of Prisons wants him to serve his sentence at a federal prison rather than MDC. In November 2022, Bankman-Fried's global cryptocurrency exchange called FTX imploded, resulting in an $8 billion loss for its customers. He was convicted of seven counts of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering in 2023.

Bankman-Fried appeared in a video call with Carlson from Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, where he has been held for 18 months, in an apparent long-shot campaign to receive a presidential pardon for his 25-year sentence. According to a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons, 'this particular interview was not approved.' Bankman-Fried has been trying to plead his case since FTX collapsed in 2022, and has devised a 19-point plan to revive his public image, including going on Tucker Carlson's show and coming out as a Republican. He has maintained his innocence and filed an appeal, arguing that the judge who oversaw the case was biased.

Convicted crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers on his FTX exchange, maintains his innocence from behind bars. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, Bankman-Fried described the Metropolitan Detention Center as 'sort of dystopian' but said he is keeping busy by reading novels, playing chess, and working on his legal case. He also spoke about his interactions with fellow detainee Sean 'Diddy' Combs, describing him as 'kind.' Bankman-Fried explained that he donated to Democratic politicians in the past, but shifted to giving to Republicans privately in 2022, which he believes may have contributed to the party's lack of support for him. He criticized the Biden administration's heavy-handed crypto regulations and expressed hope that the industry would be in better hands under a Trump administration.

He was found guilty of multiple charges of fraud and conspiracy in March 2024 and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Bankman-Fried's parents have reportedly been meeting with lawyers in President Donald Trump's orbit to secure a presidential pardon. He also criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during his trial, calling it 'something out of a nightmare' due to difficulties for crypto companies to register.

Bankman-Fried, who has not checked his email for 'hundred' days, stated that firing people is 'one of the hardest things to do in the world' and that it is usually not the employee's fault when they get fired. He emphasized that the onus should be on the employer, not the employees, when it comes to layoffs, citing internal politics and ineffective management as common reasons for staff cuts.

**Sam Bankman-Fried's Parents Seek Presidential Pardon for Son**
The parents of Sam Bankman-Fried, the creator of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, are reportedly exploring the possibility of a presidential pardon for their son, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 2024 for fraud and conspiracy. According to a Bloomberg report, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried are strengthening ties with people close to President Donald Trump, including lawyers, in an attempt to secure a presidential pardon for their son's financial crimes. However, unlike Ross Ulbricht, the creator of Silk Road, who received a presidential pardon, Bankman-Fried does not have widespread public support, as he argues that his sentence is too harsh, especially since most FTX clients have recovered their financial losses. Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, who are both professors at Stanford Law School and were part of FTX's inner circle, even guaranteed their residence as bail to have Sam Bankman-Fried released during the trial, which ultimately led to his imprisonment. Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven charges of fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy and was sentenced to 25 years in prison on March 28, 2024, after being accused of diverting over $8 billion in client funds from FTX to finance various ventures, including moonshot investments and sponsorships with famous athletes like Tom Brady.

**Sam Bankman-Fried's Parents Seek Donald Trump's Pardon**
Sam Bankman-Fried's parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are trying to convince Donald Trump to pardon their son, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for orchestrating one of the largest cryptocurrency scams in history. According to Bloomberg, they have reached out to some of Trump's close associates to secure their son's release. Trump has a history of pardoning individuals involved in high-profile cases, including Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road marketplace, who was imprisoned for 10 years. However, it is unclear whether Trump will show similar clemency to Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of 7 charges in November 2023, including deceiving investors and embezzling client funds to cover losses at his trading firm Alameda Research. The collapse of FTX in November 2022 resulted in the loss of over $8.7 billion in client and business cryptocurrencies. Bankman-Fried is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, and has appealed his sentence. As Trump said, 'It was a great day' when he pardoned the January 6th Capitol assault participants, but it remains to be seen if he will show similar mercy to Bankman-Fried.

**Bankman-Fried's Parents Seek Pardon from Trump**
The parents of Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of FTX, are seeking a pardon from Donald Trump for their son. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 2024 for massive fraud. According to Bloomberg, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, both professors at Stanford Law School, have met with people close to Trump's inner circle in recent weeks to request clemency for their son. However, it is unclear if they have had direct contact with the White House. The parents of Bankman-Fried are avoiding comments, and one of their lawyers did not respond to a request for a statement. They are seeking a pardon for their son, similar to the one Trump granted to Ross Ulbricht, but unlike Ulbricht, Sam Bankman-Fried does not have widespread public support. FTX collapsed in November 2022 after diverting funds from its clients to Alameda Research, a firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. Alameda used that money to make risky bets in the market, many of which failed. Bankman-Fried responded to questions from jail, stating that he never believed he was acting illegally and that he feels tormented by the lost money. With the start of a new presidential period in the US, many inmates are seeking to take advantage of possible changes in the wind to request clemency. Jeffrey Grant, who heads a law firm advising white-collar crime defendants, noted that they have recently received over 100 inquiries about pardons. 'We have received messages from people in prison, from recently sentenced individuals who have not yet entered prison, and from people who have already been accused,' Grant said. Unlike his first term, when most of his pardons were granted at the end of his term, Trump surprised many by exercising his power of clemency at an early stage of his second government. Several bitcoiners celebrated, as one of his main campaign promises was the release of Ross Ulbricht. Ulbricht himself recently thanked the president on the social media platform X, highlighting that he is a man of his word, as reported by CriptoNoticias at the time.

**Sam Bankman-Fried's parents explore seeking Trump pardon for fallen 'crypto king'**
The parents of Sam Bankman-Fried, the former FTX co-founder, are exploring ways to secure a pardon for their son from US President Donald Trump. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud in 2024. According to a person familiar with the matter, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried have met with lawyers and others in Trump's orbit to discuss clemency for their son. Bankman-Fried's lawyer did not comment, and the White House declined to comment. The president's use of his pardon power has encouraged a rush among white-collar defendants, including Ryan Salame, a former FTX executive, who is also seeking a pardon. Jeffrey Grant, a lawyer who specializes in white-collar defense, said he has received over 100 inquiries about pardons, with many people seeking to know 'somebody who knows somebody.' Federal prisoners can apply for clemency through a Justice Department office, but Trump has made decisions based on less formal appeals. Sam Mangel, a white-collar prison consultant, said he was working on several clemency requests and had been given guidance from contacts within Trump's circle. 'I was told not to bring any sex crimes, true crimes of violence or illegal immigration cases,' Mangel said. Bankman-Fried and Trump may share a sense of injustice, as both have accused US District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of being unfair to them.
