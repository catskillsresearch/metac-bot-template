**Trump's 'Great and Beautiful' Law: A Battle for Medicaid and the US Budget**
US President Donald Trump is pushing lawmakers to quickly pass his 'great and beautiful' law, which includes extending massive tax credits from his first term, set to expire at the end of the year. However, to compensate for the costly measure, Republicans plan to make significant cuts in public spending. The first target is Medicaid, a public health insurance program for low-income Americans. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has unveiled its portion of the measures, aiming to achieve $880 billion in federal spending reductions over the next decade. Most of these savings come from reducing the scope of Medicaid and eliminating incentives for renewable energy adopted under Joe Biden. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these measures would reduce the number of people with health insurance by at least 8.6 million by 2034. The Democratic counterpart to Brett Guthrie, the committee's Republican chairman, denounced the cuts as 'catastrophic' and warned that millions of Americans would lose their health coverage, hospitals would close, and seniors would not have access to necessary care. Another committee is set to discuss reductions in food aid for the poorest Americans, which could reach several hundred billion dollars. If adopted by committees in the coming days, the text could head to the House floor in the coming weeks, before being examined by the Senate. However, if the bill faces opposition from Democrats, the divisions within the Republican camp may also derail it. Moderates fear that significant cuts to Medicaid could pose an electoral risk before the mid-term elections in November 2026. Some conservatives, on the other hand, think the cuts do not go far enough, and threaten not to vote for the text unless their demands are met. One of them, Texas Representative Chip Roy, said he hopes Republican leaders will develop a backup plan, as he will not vote for the current bill as is.

**Extend Trump's tax cuts, pay for it by repealing Biden's climate handouts**
President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is set to expire at the end of the year, and Democrats are pushing for a $4.5 trillion tax increase. Republicans, who were elected with a mandate to end the 'lunacy of Bidenomics' and make America competitive again, must extend and expand the Trump tax cuts while preventing any tax hikes. Trump recently warned Republicans that a tax increase would ruin their chances of success in 2026. If the tax cuts expire, an automatic $4.5 trillion tax hike will land on working families, with the average taxpayer facing a 22 percent tax hike. Republicans must use the budget framework to extend and expand the Trump tax cuts through a final Reconciliation bill. This is the test of whether they intend to do anything with the mandate they were given. By extending the tax cuts, Republicans can prevent higher taxes on 40 million families and 26 million small businesses, and promote a stronger economy and more opportunity.

**Holland & Knight Defense Situation Report: April 2025**
The US Congress is working on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), with the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) and Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) expected to mark up the bill in late spring or early summer. The FY 2026 NDAA will include provisions for defense spending, including a topline funding request of $1.01 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOD request is for $892.6 billion plus $119.3 billion, which would be added to the overall FY 2026 funding should congressional Republicans pass a reconciliation bill. The HASC has released a reconciliation bill with 11 primary funding objectives, including improving capacity across the maritime industrial base and integrated air and missile defense. The bill was approved by a bipartisan vote of 35-21. The DOD has also announced several initiatives, including the Software Fast Track (SWFT) Initiative, which aims to reform the way the DOD acquires, tests, and authorizes secure software. Additionally, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Army to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy, including streamlining force structure, eliminating wasteful spending, and reforming the acquisition process. President Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at acquisition reform, including 'Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base,' which directs the defense secretary to provide a plan for accomplishing this goal by giving a 'first preference' for acquisition of commercial solutions and a 'general preference' for use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA).

**US Treasury Secretary Warns Congress of Potential Debt Default in August**
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Congress that if no action is taken, the US government may be unable to pay its debt as early as August. Bessent urged Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling before July 15. In a letter to House Speaker Johnson, Bessent stated that after evaluating the April tax situation, the Treasury Department believes that it is likely to exhaust all means and cash by August to prevent the US government from defaulting on its debt. 'Given that Congress will be in recess during the summer, I urge Congress to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling before the recess begins on July 15 to ensure the US fulfills its responsibility to pay its debts.' Bessent emphasized that any default on US debt would have a significant impact on the US financial system, as well as harm US national security and international leadership. The US Congress is currently discussing President Trump's tax cut and spending reduction plan, which is expected to be a critical period in the coming weeks, and is closely related to the X date. The US Treasury Department currently has a debt of over $36 trillion, exceeding the debt ceiling. In 2023, Congress passed a law temporarily allowing the government to disregard the debt ceiling until January 1 of this year. Since then, the Treasury Department has begun using extraordinary measures to prevent Washington from defaulting on its debt. The US Congressional Budget Office had previously stated in March that the X date may occur as early as August. At a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee on the Trump administration's budget proposal, Bessent said that Congress will eventually raise or suspend the debt ceiling again, and the Trump administration will not use any 'stopgap measures' to avoid the debt ceiling issue.

**Trump proposes major Medicare drug plan changes**
President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. The order would implement a 'most favored nation' policy, tying the prices of certain Medicare-covered drugs to those paid by other developed countries. This move could offer meaningful relief from high out-of-pocket drug costs for the 53 million people enrolled in Medicare Part D. According to a 2024 RAND Corporation report, U.S. prescription drug prices in 2022 were nearly three times higher than those in 33 other developed countries. Diane Daniels, founder of Medicare Nation, says, 'People may have forgotten that President Trump initiated the 'American Patients First' blueprint in May of 2018, which aimed to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs for Americans.' The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has already allowed HHS to negotiate with drug manufacturers, and Medicare has negotiated lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. Starting in January 2026, 10 Medicare Part D negotiated prescription medications are set to offer beneficiaries a 38%-79% discount on these medications. The IRA also introduced a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs beginning in 2025. Tom Clark, a Social Security and Medicare consultant, says, 'Beginning this year, persons with Medicare Part D plans have a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for covered medications.' The potential implementation of the 'most favored nation' approach could have far-reaching implications for Medicare beneficiaries, but the pharmaceutical industry has historically opposed such pricing reforms. 'Trump's executive order will expand access to lower cost drugs imported from outside of the country, which has predominantly been a ball of red tape,' said Daniels. 'How the executive order will work alongside current tariffs is another issue.'

**Sheinbaum Defends T-MEC Amid Trump's Commercial War**
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that her government will defend the North American Trade Agreement (T-MEC) with the US and Canada, amidst a commercial war launched by US President Donald Trump. The trade agreement, which has been in place since 1994 and was renewed as T-MEC in 2020, is crucial for Mexico's economy, which sends over 80% of its exports to the US, totaling $531 billion in 2024. 'We will defend the T-MEC because it has been beneficial for the three countries. If President Trump makes a different proposal, we will be prepared for any circumstance, but obviously we want the T-MEC to remain in place,' Sheinbaum said. She highlighted that the T-MEC is set to be reviewed every six years, with the first review scheduled for July 2026. Sheinbaum also noted that Trump stated in comments made on Tuesday that the current agreement 'is much better' than the old NAFTA. 'In his statement (Trump) says, 'it will be reviewed in 2026' and we will see what happens. So far, we have no other signal that the T-MEC is going to disappear,' Sheinbaum said. She added that despite Trump's tariff offensive since taking office, the benefits of the trade agreement remain in place for most of Mexico's exported goods. 'The T-MEC has remained in place in many areas, with the exception of some issues in the automotive and steel and aluminum sectors, which we are working on,' Sheinbaum argued. In 2023, Mexico surpassed China to become the US's largest trading partner, a position that could be consolidated amidst the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has kept the threat of new tariffs against Mexico and Canada, accusing them of not doing enough to combat fentanyl trafficking and irregular migration at the border.

**US House Republicans to End Electric Vehicle Tax Credit a Year Early**
The US House of Representatives' Republican majority has decided to end the electric vehicle tax credit, which is based on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a year earlier than planned. According to the Wall Street Journal, the House Ways and Means Committee included a provision in the tax bill to repeal the IRA's electric vehicle tax credit (30D) by 2027. The original deadline for the tax credit was December 31, 2022, but it was moved up to December 31, 2026. However, for electric vehicles purchased in 2026, the tax credit will be eliminated if the manufacturer has sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles in the US between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025. The IRA allows taxpayers who purchase electric vehicles assembled in North America and meet certain battery and mineral requirements to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500. However, as President Trump is negative towards electric vehicles and needs to raise funds for his tax cuts, the Republican Party is expected to eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit, along with other clean energy initiatives from the previous Biden administration. The Republican bill also includes a provision to eliminate the '45W tax credit' for commercial electric vehicles after December 31, 2025. The '45W tax credit' is an exception that allows commercial electric vehicles, such as leased or rented vehicles, to claim the tax credit even if they do not meet the origin requirements. This exception was introduced to accommodate the requests of the Korean government and industry, but some Republicans have criticized it as a 'loophole' that goes against the intent of the law. The tax credit for used electric vehicle buyers will also be eliminated.

**Trump Says He Won't Remove Fed Chair Powell, Says Good Parts Of Economy Are His Doing**
US President Donald Trump stated that he will not remove Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Board chairman before his term ends in 2026, describing Powell as 'a total stiff' and calling for the Fed to lower interest rates. Trump attributed a first-quarter contraction in the US economy to former President Joe Biden's policies and claimed that his own moves to upend the global trading system with higher tariffs would eventually make Americans rich. Trump also sent mixed messages on the economy, dismissing concerns about a first-quarter decline in GDP and arguing that his predecessor was to blame for any economic weakness. Trump's whipsaw moves on tariffs have sparked the most volatile weeks on Wall Street since the early part of the COVID pandemic five years ago. Trump said, 'It partially is right now. And I really mean this. I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because he's done a terrible job.' He also declined to rule out making some of the tariffs permanent, saying, 'No, I wouldn't do that because if somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?'

**Trump: 'I Don't Know' if I Should Respect the US Constitution**
Donald Trump stated in a television interview that he is unsure if he should respect the United States Constitution, the country's founding legal document. 'I don't know', he replied when asked by NBC News' 'Meet the Press with Kristen Welker' if he believes he should respect the supreme law of the land. Trump also stated that he does not seek a third term as president, saying 'I'm not looking for a third term'. Additionally, he declared that he will not remove Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chairman before the end of his term in May 2026, calling Powell 'completely rigid' and repeating his calls for the Fed to lower interest rates. Trump stated that Powell is not a fan of his, but expects the Fed to lower interest rates at some point. 'Well, they should lower them. And at some point they will. They don't want to because they're not a fan of mine', he said, claiming that he does not like Powell because he finds him to be 'totally rigid and unable'. When asked if he would remove Powell before the end of his term, Trump firmly denied it, saying 'No, no, no... why should I? I can replace that person soon enough'. The US president also intends to extend the deadline for TikTok if no agreement is reached. In the NBC News interview, Trump refused to rule out the possibility of making some tariffs permanent, saying 'No, I wouldn't do that, because if someone thought they would be taken off the table, why would they build in the United States? ' He also acknowledged being 'very tough on China', effectively halting trade between the two major world economies, but stated that China now wants to reach an agreement. 'We just stopped cold', he said. 'This means we won't lose $1 trillion... because we're not doing business with them right now. And they want to reach an agreement. They really do. We'll see how it goes, but it has to be a fair agreement'.

**Trump's Plan to Use the Insurrection Act to Crack Down on Immigration**
Donald Trump has begun to outline new strategies to address what he considers a crisis on the US-Mexico border since his return to the White House. One possibility is to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807, a historic law that would give the president the power to deploy military troops in emergency internal situations. This power could allow him to take more drastic measures against illegal immigration, a move that many see as a radical step in his immigration policy. According to Laura Dickinson, a constitutional law expert, the use of this law would be a unprecedented gesture and could generate additional tensions between the executive branch and the military. Trump has already signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, declaring a national emergency on the border and requesting a 90-day report from the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, to evaluate the migration situation and recommend whether to invoke the Insurrection Act.

**On April 20th, 2025, the United States will Cross the Point of No Return.**
The author warns that on April 20th, 2025, the United States may initiate its final steps into authoritarian rule. Donald Trump's advisory committee is expected to release its findings on whether he should invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military domestically and impose martial law. The author believes that Trump will stop at nothing to achieve this goal, and that an executive order declaring the Insurrection Act will be issued on or after April 20th. The author outlines a roadmap for overthrowing a democratic government, which includes restricting freedoms, imposing martial law, and dismantling the administrative state. The author urges readers to be aware of this potential takeover and to take action to stop it before it's too late. They propose exposing the plot, rejecting it, and making it clear to every American what is happening. If the Insurrection Act is enacted, the author believes that resistance will become nearly impossible within 48 to 72 hours. They plan to outline peaceful and strategic ways to resist in their next post.

**What is the Insurrection Act, and will Donald Trump invoke it? He may make a decision this Sunday; here's what Americans need to watch out for**
President Donald Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act, a centuries-old law that would allow active-duty military troops to arrest migrants and support law enforcement inside the U.S. However, top officials at the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, are not recommending Trump take that step. According to a DHS source, the current low levels of migrant crossings, with fewer than 300 people crossing the southern border illegally each day, do not require military involvement. Trump signed an executive order in January 2025 calling the situation at the southern border a national emergency, and Hegseth and Noem have 90 days to assess the border and recommend whether the Insurrection Act should be used. The deadline is this Sunday, April 21. Despite growing frustration within Trump's inner circle about the pace of interior arrests of undocumented immigrants, it appears unlikely that Trump will immediately invoke the Insurrection Act based on current border conditions and the recommendation from his top defense and homeland security chiefs.

**A Conspiracy Theory That Is Being Pushed By The Left Claims That Something Really Big Is Going To Happen On April 20th**
A conspiracy theory spreading on social media claims that President Trump will declare martial law in the United States on April 20th. According to the theory, a report submitted to President Trump on that date will recommend invoking the Insurrection Act to deal with the border crisis, allowing U.S. troops to secure the border. However, many leftists believe that President Trump will also use U.S. troops to round up political activists and send them to prisons in El Salvador. This theory is based on an article published by the San Francisco Chronicle, which highlighted the fact that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security will submit a report to President Trump recommending whether to invoke the Insurrection Act. The report is due within 90 days, sparking concerns about unchecked presidential power under President Trump.

**Donald Trump May Impose Martial Law-Type Order On April 20. What We Know**
Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 20, which allowed for the possible deployment of the military on US soil within 90 days. The order stated that the Secretary of Defence and the Secretary of Homeland Security would submit a joint report to the President about the conditions at the southern border and any recommendations for additional actions, including invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807. The Insurrection Act authorizes the President to deploy the military to enforce law and order, but it is different from martial law, which gives complete control to a military general. Legal experts have argued that the Insurrection Act is archaic and needs reform, as it is dangerously vague and ripe for abuse. With less than a week to go before the 90-day period ends, some believe that President Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy the military on April 20. However, the Secretary of Defence and the Secretary of Homeland Security have yet to submit their final report to the President, and it is unclear what will happen on April 20.

**Will Trump announce martial law in US on April 20 after invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807? What we know**
There are widespread rumors that President Donald Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 and impose martial law on April 20. This stems from an Executive Order signed on January 20, which hinted at the possibility of invoking the act within 90 days. The Insurrection Act gives the President authority to deploy the military and the National Guard to quell unruly demonstrations or civil unrest. However, it is different from martial law, which would transfer full control of government functions to a military leader. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security are expected to submit a report to the President on April 20, which may include recommendations on invoking the Insurrection Act. Some experts caution against panic, noting that the report's delay has fueled speculation, but no concrete evidence supports the claims of martial law. 'Because of the gravity and emergency of this present danger and imminent threat, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to take all appropriate action to assist the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining full operational control of the southern border,' the executive order states.

**Investigating rumor Trump will declare martial law on April 20 after invoking Insurrection Act of 1807**
A rumor has been circulating online that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 on or just after April 20, 2025, which would allegedly lead to a declaration of martial law. However, according to the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the White House, there is no evidence to support this claim. Aletheisthenes, the author of a series of articles predicting this event, stated that Trump has a history of testing the limits of his power and that his 'guardrails' from his first administration are gone. However, Joseph Nunn, counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, reported that the Insurrection Act does not authorize martial law and that the president has no authority to declare it. Trump has previously considered declaring martial law, but it was met with skepticism and denial. As of April 9, 2025, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act and declare martial law on April 20.

**Fact Check: Donald Trump Did NOT Publicly Declare He Would Implement Martial Law on April 20, 2025 | Lead Stories**
A claim that U.S. President Donald Trump publicly declared he would implement martial law on April 20, 2025, is false. As of April 9, 2025, Trump had not made any such declaration or order. The rumor stemmed from an executive order related to the possible invocation of the Insurrection Act of 1807 to address the national emergency at the southern border. Trump ordered two cabinet secretaries to report back to him on the conditions at the border and advise him on whether to invoke the Insurrection Act within 90 days. This led to speculation that April 20 might be the date for the invocation, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Trump would implement martial law on that date. According to Trump, the southern border is overrun by cartels, gangs, and other threats, and he has repeatedly considered invoking the Insurrection Act to address the issue. However, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that he would implement martial law on April 20, 2025.

**David Arbeitman: It's time to imagine the unimaginable**
Many Americans, including Republicans, are opposed to President Donald Trump's executive orders, which have led to the firing of tens of thousands of federal workers. This has resulted in longer wait times and worse service in various agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the IRS. Cutting Medicaid would leave low-income Americans without health insurance, and Trump's tariffs have caused the stock market to plummet, affecting two-thirds of Americans with investments. Elon Musk has suggested cutting Social Security and Medicare to fund tax breaks for billionaires. Trump's disregard for the separation of powers and his statement that 'things will be fixed' after the 2024 election have raised concerns that he may cancel the elections altogether, declaring a national emergency under the Insurrection Act. As one expert noted, 'it's time to imagine the unimaginable' and consider the possibility that Trump may not hold elections in 2026.
