**Madrid's Housing Market: A Desolate Future Ahead?**
Pau Antó, a well-known real estate investor and financial commentator, has made a dire prediction about the future of the Madrid housing market. According to Antó, by 2050, a standard 80-square-meter apartment in Madrid could cost as much as €2 million, making it unaffordable for most of the population. Antó attributes this potential increase to the current rate of price growth, limited housing supply, and increasing demand in major urban centers like Madrid. He also notes that historically, the real estate market tends to appreciate significantly over time, especially in cities that are economic, tourist, and cultural hubs. Antó warns that this scenario could have severe consequences for younger generations, making it difficult for them to access affordable housing and potentially leading to internal migration and increased demand in surrounding areas. However, Antó also offers some recommendations for preparing for this scenario, such as making early and diversified investments in real estate, particularly in areas with high growth potential.

**Young People Disengage from Housing Market Amid Rising Prices**
Young people are disengaging from the housing market due to rising prices and a lack of affordable options. According to Fotocasa Research, only 30% of people aged 18-24 took some action in the housing market in February 2025, five points less than a year ago. The report attributes this decline to the impact of high prices and the lack of affordable options. The 'ineffective demand' - people who have searched for housing without closing a deal - has decreased from 22% to 15% in the same age group. This decline is not due to a loss of interest, but rather a growing perception that the market is out of their reach. Meanwhile, adults aged 25-34 have increased their participation in the market, with a total participation of 47%, three points more than the previous year. The 35-44 age group has also increased, from 31% to 34%. The intermediate age group, including those seeking to emancipate definitively, improve their current home, or seek a second residence, is the main driver of the current market, both in sales and rentals. 'After the last macroeconomic, social, and legislative changes in Spain, the purchase of housing has consolidated as the true protagonist of the real estate market,' says María Matos, director of studies and spokesperson for Fotocasa. 'The rental market, increasingly reduced and with maximum prices, suffers significant wear and tear, which favors and reinforces the interest of citizens in sales.'

**Madrid's Housing Market Sees Significant Increase in Protected Housing Units**
The Madrid regional government updated the maximum price per square meter for building and renting protected housing in February 2024 after 15 years without change. The government argued that the previous prices had become outdated due to factors such as inflation, material shortages, and increased construction costs, which discouraged promotion in the region amidst a unprecedented housing crisis. Two years after the update, the Ministry of Housing has reported a positive impact on the residential market. According to Housing Minister Jorge Rodrigo, the number of protected housing units available has increased by seven times in the first year of the new prices, and this trend continued in the first quarter of 2025. Rodrigo stated, 'In 2024, 12,648 house requests for qualification were granted, while in 2023, that number was 1,854.' He also added, 'By April, 2,442 requests had been received, a 50% increase from the 1,661 received in the same period of the previous year.' Rodrigo described the price update as 'a brave measure' that has generated more housing supply, particularly public housing. He noted that in 2023, Madrid was the region that built the most public housing in Spain, accounting for 53% of all public housing built in the country.

**Madrid Increases Protected Housing Offer by Seven Times**
The Madrid regional government has increased the offer of protected housing in the region by seven times, thanks to the update of the sale and rental prices of properties, according to the regional Minister of Housing, Transport and Infrastructure, Jorge Rodrigo. In 2024, 12,648 house requests for qualification were granted, a 6.8 times increase from the 1,854 of 2023. This trend continues in the first quarter of this year, with 2,442 requests received by April, a 50% increase from the 1,661 of the same period last year. The regional government updated the maximum sale and rental prices of protected properties in 2024, which has led to an increase in the offer. 'Thanks to that measure, which was a brave one, where we updated the prices that had not been updated since 2008 and were outdated, due to the increase in construction materials of over 30%, we have favored the increase in the offer,' Rodrigo said. This has allowed Madrid to be the region that 'has built the most public housing in all of Spain', with 53% of the public housing built in Spain, according to data from the Housing and Land Observatory published by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Agenda. 'These are the right policies in this case of the regional government. I think we are on the right path by flexibilizing the land, flexibilizing urban planning, generating land for the construction of both free and private housing with the goal of lowering prices,' Rodrigo defended. The Plan Vive initiative, aimed at increasing the offer of affordable rentals, aggregates one of every three apartments built. To date, the regional government has delivered 3,823 homes in eight of the 21 municipalities where it is building.

**Rental Prices in Spain Rise by 13.85% in April**
The rental price of housing in Spain increased by 13.85% in April compared to the same month last year, reaching an average monthly price of 13.15 euros per square meter, according to the latest data from the monthly report of pisos.com. Ferran Font, director of Studies at the real estate portal, stated that 'few rentals are affordable for tenants, with their monthly rent exceeding a reasonable percentage of their income.' Font also warned that 'the escalation of rents continues unchecked, while more and more tenants are being left out of the market.' The regions with the highest rental prices in April 2025 were Madrid (20.08 euros per square meter), the Balearic Islands (18.20 euros), and Catalonia (15.65 euros). The cheapest regions were La Rioja (5.13 euros), Castile and León (5.66 euros), and Extremadura (5.79 euros).

**Affordable Housing in Madrid: A Sevenfold Increase in Construction**
The offer of affordable housing in the Madrid region has increased significantly due to the update of the modules that set the price of sale and rent of these properties. This measure, which took over ten years to arrive, has had an effect by unlocking the construction of thousands of homes. Specifically, production multiplied by almost seven times in 2024, reaching 12,648 homes, compared to 1,854 units in 2023. According to Jorge Rodrigo, the regional minister of Housing, Transport and Infrastructure, 'only until April, 2,442 requests have been received, a figure that improves by around 50% the 1,661 of the same period of the previous year' and exceeds all those of 2023. Rodrigo has pointed out that 'it was evident that we needed to adjust the increase in construction costs to the restrictions established for this type of buildings, as this has facilitated the creation of new urbanizations, especially in areas where land is available.' The Community of Madrid is currently leading the construction of protected homes in Spain, according to data from the Housing and Land Observatory, and the Plan Vive initiative, aimed at increasing the offer of affordable rental housing, aggregates one in every three homes built. To date, the regional government has delivered 3,823 homes in eight of the 21 municipalities where it is building. Recently, the tender for 3,404 homes included in the Plan Vive Solution Young has been initiated, aimed at facilitating the emancipation of minors under 35 years old.

**The struggle to find a rental home becomes more intense: the number of applicants increases by 20% to 35 per property**
The competition for renting a home is becoming increasingly fierce, with a 20% increase in the number of applicants per property, reaching a median of 35 contacts before giving up, according to a study by Idealista. Francisco Iñareta, spokesperson for Idealista, warns that 'the situation is becoming more and more desperate, and the levels of competition are rising very dangerously. It's alarming that the Government is still committed to maintaining these harmful policies that have led us to this situation.' The number of families applying for each ad has increased in most Spanish capitals over the past 12 months, with the largest increase in Barcelona (48%), followed by Sevilla (41%), Bilbao (37%), Palma (34%), San Sebastián (31%), and Madrid (1%). The volume of interested families in Valencia and Alicante remains unchanged, while Málaga (-12%) is part of the small group of 5 capitals where this figure has decreased. The demand for housing is having a different impact on each city, with Barcelona being the largest market where competition for housing is highest, with 61 families per ad, followed by Palma (57), Madrid (42), Bilbao (37), San Sebastián (37), and Sevilla (35).

**Rental Prices in Spain Rise by 13.85% in April**

**La Clota: The Barcelona Neighborhood Where Rent Prices Have Skyrocketed**
La Clota, a neighborhood in Barcelona, has seen the largest increase in rent over the past 12 months, with prices rising by 45.1%. Residents who have lived there for decades are being priced out, with many forced to look for housing outside of the district. 'They're pushing us out of the neighborhood. They raise the prices, renovate the apartments, and then people with salaries we can't afford move in,' says Jordi, a resident of over 20 years. This is not an isolated case, with other neighborhoods such as Provençals del Poblenou and la Font de la Guatlla also experiencing aggressive rent increases of 38% and 41.1%, respectively. The pattern is the same: quick renovations, skyrocketing rents, and neighbors who cannot afford the new cost of living. 'They paint it white, change the floor, and raise the rent by 500 euros, that's it,' say some affected tenants. Barcelona has seen one of the largest increases in rent in Spain so far in 2025, and La Clota is the most extreme example. Despite the city council's announcement of measures such as rent caps, subsidies for young people, and new social rental housing, the feeling on the street is one of powerlessness and lack of real solutions. The Horta-Guinardó district is currently receiving the most requests for housing changes due to economic reasons, according to municipal data. Local associations warn that if action is not taken soon, entire neighborhoods could lose their identity in less than a decade. The rise in rent in neighborhoods like La Clota not only affects the wallet, but also breaks communities, empties schools, and closes neighborhood shops. The real estate speculation does not understand history or neighborhood fabric. And Barcelona, a city that boasts diversity and mix, is at risk of becoming a vacant showcase, only habitable for those who can afford it. 'Guaranteeing access to housing is protecting those who make the city. Because without them, without the old neighbors, Barcelona loses its soul.'

**Salaries and Housing Prices: A Study Reveals the Disconnect**
According to a study by InfoJobs and Fotocasa, the increase in salaries and the price of housing do not go hand in hand. In 2024, the price per square meter increased by 8.4% and salaries offered rose by 3.1%. Over the past three years, salaries have risen by 7.4% and housing prices by 25.3%. Mónica Pérez, director of Communication and Studies at InfoJobs, states, 'In the last three years, the average evolution of salaries offered in InfoJobs has shown a trend of increase. However, in 2022 and 2023, this rise was not enough to compensate for the effect of inflation, which, in the case of housing, is exacerbated by the shortage of supply.' María Matos, director of Studies and Spokesperson for Fotocasa, adds, 'The housing market is experiencing a boom in demand to buy, which, in the face of scarce supply, drives prices up. This is a very difficult situation to reverse, which is why accessibility to housing will continue to worsen and exacerbate social inequalities.'

**Expert Predicts 2025 Will Be Worst Year for Spanish Housing Market**
According to a report by Fotocasa, the first quarter of 2025 has seen record highs in the Spanish housing market. The price of second-hand homes has increased by 4.5% in the past three months, the highest quarterly increase in the past 10 years. Sergio Gutiérrez, a real estate expert, predicts that 2025 will be the worst year for the sector, citing the lack of supply and the resulting difficulties for real estate companies to find properties. He notes that it will become increasingly difficult for homeowners to sell their properties, making it easier for small real estate companies and independent agents to offer a more personalized service and sell properties at the highest possible price. Gutiérrez also predicts that housing prices will continue to rise, with the current price per square meter being 2,489 euros, a 10% increase from the previous year. The autonomous community with the highest quarterly increase is the Balearic Islands, with a 8.1% increase, followed by Madrid and Murcia with a 6.3% increase.

**Housing Prices Expected to Rise by 10% in 2025, Rental Market to Decline**
According to the latest report by Unión de Créditos Inmobiliarios (UCI) and Spanish International Realty Alliance (SIRA), housing prices are expected to increase by 10% in sales and 8.6% in rentals in 2025. The number of property transactions is expected to grow by 4.61% to around 750,000 operations. However, the report notes that the growth rate will vary by region, with the Region of Murcia and the Community of Valencia expected to see the largest increases. On the other hand, the regions of Extremadura, Aragón, and Castilla y León are expected to see more moderate price increases. The rental market is expected to experience a decline of 7.3% in the number of operations due to a lack of available housing. As a result, prices are expected to continue to rise, with an estimated increase of 8.61% nationwide. The report also highlights the main structural challenges facing the sector in 2025, including a lack of housing supply, security concerns for property owners, and the need to promote affordable housing in areas of high demand. José Manuel Fernández, subdirector general of UCI, emphasized the importance of collaboration between the public and private sectors to implement effective solutions that increase housing supply without discouraging investment. 'The policies adopted in the coming months will play a decisive role in the evolution of the market and accessibility to housing,' he added.

**CaixaBank Research predicts continued growth in peripheral housing demand**
CaixaBank Research predicts that the demand for peripheral housing will continue to grow due to the high prices of housing in major cities. The number of transactions increased by 10% in 2024 to 642,000 homes. The majority of transactions were for free housing, with only 7.4% being protected housing. The price of housing increased by 10.4% in 2024, with the highest growth rates in the Balearic Islands and Madrid. The trend of 'oil stain' is particularly noticeable in Barcelona and Madrid, where prices are increasing in surrounding areas. The percentage of households living in rental housing increased to 20.4% in 2024, with a significant increase in foreign households. CaixaBank Research predicts that the number of transactions will remain high in 2025 and 2026, with around 650,000 transactions expected in 2025 and 620,000 in 2026. 'The strong growth in the final quarter of last year suggests that demand for housing will remain very high in 2025', conclude the authors. 'The lack of affordable housing in rental is one of the main problems of the current market, as shown by the fact that in the last year until 3Q 2024 only 10,850 protected homes were completed, 52% of them in rental regime', warn. 'Spain is positioning itself as one of the most attractive destinations for international investment in commercial real estate among the main European economies, thanks to its solid macroeconomic fundamentals, especially in the residential, hotel and logistics segments', says CaixaBank Research. 'The 'oil stain' phenomenon is particularly noticeable in Madrid and Barcelona, where prices are increasing in surrounding areas.'

**Housing prices in Spain to rise above 10% in over 60% of municipalities in 2025**
According to CaixaBank Research, the price of housing in Spain will continue to rise, with over 60% of municipalities with more than 25,000 inhabitants expected to see a price increase above 10% in 2025. The 'oil stain' effect, where demand for housing shifts to more affordable areas, is becoming more pronounced, particularly in large cities like Madrid and Barcelona. In Barcelona, the price of housing increased by 10.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024, while in the surrounding municipalities, prices rose by 6.4% to 8.1%. CaixaBank's models predict that these peripheral areas will continue to experience higher price growth. The bank also notes that the reactivation of prices due to the shift in European monetary policy is contributing to the acceleration of housing prices, especially in markets with a strong imbalance between supply and demand. However, Spain's housing prices are still 7.1% below their nominal peak and 23.1% below their real peak, according to the INE index.

**Spanish Housing Prices Expected to Rise by 3.6% in 2025**
According to the Sociedad de Tasación's Report on Trends in the Real Estate Sector, the price of both new and used housing in Spain is expected to rise by 3.6% in 2025, reaching an average of 1,918 euros per square meter. Madrid has the highest price per square meter at 3,000 euros, while provinces such as Cádiz, Valencia, Tenerife, Baleares, and Málaga have seen the largest increase in housing values, reaching 5%. Pau Antó, a real estate expert, has described the situation as 'preocupante' (concerning), citing inflation as a major factor in exacerbating the problem for both buyers and renters, and driving up prices. Antó believes that the scarcity of housing in large cities is responsible for the high rents in the current market, and that limiting prices is not the solution, as it encourages the underground economy and creates legal insecurity for property owners, making them hesitant to put their properties on the market, he says.
