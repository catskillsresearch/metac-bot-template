**Lawsuit advances over psilocybin access for disabled Oregonians**
A U.S. District Judge has ruled that licensed psilocybin providers can proceed with their lawsuit against the Oregon Health Authority, seeking to provide home-based services to people with disabilities or a terminal illness. The state had argued that allowing such services would violate federal law, but the judge disagreed, stating that the issue is about physical access, not the use or distribution of a controlled substance. The providers want the state to comply with the federal Americans With Disabilities Act, which would allow their disabled clients to have the same physical access to psilocybin services as nondisabled people. Judge Mustafa T. Kasubhai wrote that altering the state law may be necessary to bring it into compliance with the disabilities act. Kathryn L. Tucker, a lawyer for the providers, said, 'We are hoping to move forward quickly now and bring relief to homebound Oregonians who could benefit from psilocybin services.'

**PSI Marsala Calls for 'Yes' Vote on June 8 and 9 Referendums**
The PSI Marsala section is calling for a 'yes' vote on June 8 and 9, 2025, on five referendary questions: stopping illegitimate layoffs, increasing protections for workers in small businesses, reducing precarious work, and strengthening workplace safety. The fifth question aims to reduce the residency requirement for Italian citizenship from 10 to 5 years. PSI notes that the right-wing government is 'tacitly ignoring' these issues and 'maintaining workers in a state of precariousness and insecurity.' The party urges citizens to 'go to the polls in large numbers and vote 'yes' on all five questions, calling it a 'battle for civilization' that can be won by uniting forces across ideological boundaries.

**UK to Ban Disposable Vapes in 2025**
The UK will ban the sale and supply of disposable vapes from June 1, 2025, in an effort to reduce youth access to vaping and the waste generated by these devices. According to official data, vaping in England grew by over 400% between 2012 and 2023. Although the long-term health effects of vaping are unknown, the UK government has acknowledged the addictive effects of nicotine. The ban aims to also reduce waste, as an estimated 5 million disposable vapes are discarded weekly in the UK. Over 40 countries currently prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes, with five banning disposable ones and seven banning flavored ones. The World Health Organization notes that e-cigarette accessories are still unregulated. France and Belgium have already banned disposable vapes, with France following suit in February 2025 and Belgium since January 1, 2025. Germany and Spain are also preparing similar measures. As a precursor, Spain has imposed an indirect tax on the purchase of e-cigarette liquid since April 1. Most European countries, however, limit vaping restrictions to public places. Norway has banned the importation and sale of e-cigarettes and nicotine refills until July 1, 2025. The Netherlands only allows the sale of tobacco-flavored liquids. Cambodia and Singapore have banned the possession, use, and sale of e-cigarettes since 2014 and 2018, respectively. Thailand has prohibited e-cigarettes since 2014, with penalties including fines and imprisonment. India has banned the production, importation, sale, and advertising of all e-cigarettes, including disposables, since 2019. China, which produces approximately 90% of the world's vapes, has banned the sale of e-cigarettes with flavors other than tobacco since 2022. Hong Kong will ban the possession and use of e-cigarettes in public by mid-2026, although importation, manufacturing, and sale are prohibited since April 2022. Argentina, Brazil, Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela have banned the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. Mexico has banned e-cigarettes since January 18, 2025, with a constitutional reform regulating their production, distribution, and acquisition. In the US, laws vary by state, but e-cigarettes are generally classified as either 'derived from tobacco' or 'therapeutic products.' Qatar, Jordan, Kuwait, and Lebanon have formally banned the importation and use of e-cigarettes. New Zealand has announced the ban on single-use e-cigarettes, along with restrictions on the proximity of vape shops to schools and the regulation of available flavors. Australia has made e-cigarettes available only in pharmacies since July 1, 2024, as part of a reform to combat smoking that includes penalties of up to seven years in prison and multimillion-dollar fines.

**Czech Republic Lawmakers Pass Bill To Legalize Marijuana Home Cultivation And Allow Psilocybin For Medical Use**
Lawmakers in the Czech Republic have passed a bill to legalize the home cultivation of marijuana and allow the medical use of psilocybin. The proposal, which was approved by 142 out of 159 members of the Chamber of Deputies, would also decriminalize the possession of up to 100 grams of marijuana at home or 25 grams in public. Zdenka Němečková Crkvenjaš, a Chamber of Deputies member, said that the bill would 'end pointless prosecution against seniors who grow cannabis for medicinal purposes.' The changes are part of a package of amendments to the Czechia's criminal code that supporters say will reduce spending on low-priority offenses, lower the number of people behind bars and reduce recidivism. The bill now proceeds to the Senate, where it will need to be approved before it can go to the president's desk.

**Ohio's revenue and pitfalls provide insight amid Pennsylvania's marijuana legalization battle**
Ohio's recreational marijuana law, passed in November 2023, is being reevaluated by lawmakers just 10 months after its implementation. The law, which allows for the growth of 12 marijuana plants in a home and a 10% tax on marijuana purchases, has been criticized for its lack of consumer protection and its 'entrapment program' for users. According to Tim Johnson, a consultant who has testified in the Ohio Statehouse, the law has created an 'ultra-low' level of metabolized marijuana in state law, making it difficult for employers to determine intoxication levels. Johnson said that this has led to a high number of positive drug tests among prospective employees. In contrast, Tom Haren, an attorney who advocated for the ballot measure, views the Ohio program as a success and says it has helped to build on the existing medical marijuana infrastructure. The Ohio law has also been criticized for the increase in accidental poisonings reported to Ohio Poison Centers, with nearly 500 children under 6 years old seen in emergency rooms after ingesting a THC-based product in 2024. Pennsylvania lawmakers are taking note of Ohio's experience and are considering their own marijuana legalization bill, which was passed by the House but voted down by a Senate committee. 'Pennsylvania is late to the game, but can learn from the mistakes elsewhere,' said Democratic Rep. Rick Krajewski of Philadelphia. 'We should run away from this as fast as we can, for our kids' sake,' said Aaron Baer, president of the Center for Christian Virtue. 'It goes contrary to everything else we say we care about,' he added.

**Acid test: Why we used Lotto lady as guinea pig in psychedelic therapy trial**
New Zealand has undergone a shift in its perception of psychedelic drugs, from prohibition to research and potential therapeutic use. A documentary, Mind Menders, explores this change, featuring interviews with participants in LSD and psilocybin trials, including Sonia Gray, a Lotto lady who underwent LSD microdosing for depression. The documentary also examines the use of ketamine as a treatment for depression and the potential of psychedelics to help ease anxiety in people nearing the end of their lives. Dr Suresh Muthukumaraswamy, a leading figure in psychedelic research in New Zealand, notes that modern brain imaging techniques have shown that psychedelics do not cause brain damage, but rather stimulate the growth of new neural connections. A 2023 University of Otago study ranked classic psychedelics as having low harm, and a 2025 study highlighted the importance of intent in determining the outcome of psychedelic use. The Ministry of Health has approved an application to administer psilocybin outside of a trial, marking a significant step towards the potential therapeutic use of psychedelics.

**Maine Committee Advances Bill to Decriminalize Personal Possession of Psilocybin**
The Maine House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee has voted to advance House Bill 1034, which would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of psilocybin for adults 21 and older. The bill, introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, removes criminal penalties for possessing up to one gram of psilocybin or one ounce of psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Supporters of the bill point to research suggesting psilocybin may have mental health benefits, particularly in treating depression and PTSD. This move reflects a national trend of easing restrictions on psychedelics, with Oregon and Colorado already implementing broader psilocybin reform and several cities adopting decriminalization policies.

**Connecticut Psilocybin Decrim Bill Advances to Senate**
Connecticut's House Bill 7065 has advanced to the Senate, aiming to decriminalize the possession of up to 0.5 ounces of psilocybin. Under the proposed changes, possession of this amount would be downgraded from a Class A misdemeanor to a civil infraction, punishable with a fine of $150 for first-time charges and a maximum fine of $500 for subsequent charges. The bill would also prevent minors from being found guilty in juvenile court for first- or second-time charges. This move follows New Mexico's decriminalization of psilocybin in April, and comes as other states, such as Massachusetts, Maine, Oregon, and Colorado, consider similar measures. As one might say, 'it's a good trade'.

**Connecticut House Passes Bill to Decriminalize Psilocybin**
The Connecticut House has passed a bill to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms, voting 74 to 65 to reduce penalties for possessing less than a half ounce of the substance from up to a year in prison to a $150 fine. Supporters argue that psilocybin can help with PTSD and addiction, while opponents warn that it could lead to easier access for kids and compare it to the state's path toward legal marijuana. The bill now heads to the Senate. As Rep. [no name mentioned] said, 'This is a step in the right direction for those who are suffering from PTSD and addiction.' However, others are concerned that it could lead to a slippery slope, as one opponent stated, 'We don't want to make it easier for kids to get their hands on this substance.'

**Psilocybin Use Soars in the US Since Legalization**
Since 2019, the number of people in the US using psilocybin has increased sharply, particularly among young adults and older adults. This rise in use has led to a parallel increase in psilocybin exposure-related calls to poison-control centers. According to Joshua Black, PhD, co-lead author and senior scientist at Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety, 'Public views on psilocybin are shifting. However, that means we also need to make sure people understand the risks, know how to use it safely if they choose to, and that healthcare systems are prepared.' The study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, found that between 2019 and 2023, the rate of psilocybin-related calls to poison centers rose 201% in adults, 317% in adolescents aged 12-17 years, and 723% in children aged 11 years or younger. The researchers called for education and enforcement of dose limits in states that have legalized psilocybin use and in those contemplating similar legislation. 'Improved tracking tools and education are critical as more states consider regulating or legalizing psilocybin,' Black said.

**Study: Psilocybin use surges across all age groups since 2019**
A new study led by researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety found that psilocybin use has increased significantly nationwide since 2019, with the largest rise in young adults and older adults. According to the study, lifetime use among adults rose from 10% in 2019 (about 25 million people) to 12.1% in 2023 (over 31 million people). Karilynn Rockhill, PhD, co-lead author of the study, said, 'This seems to line up with when some U.S. states began to decriminalize or legalize it.' The study also found that psilocybin-related poison center calls rose dramatically, with 201% increase in adults, 317% in teens, and 723% in children between 2019 and 2023. Joshua Black, PhD, co-lead author, said, 'Public views on psilocybin are shifting. However, that means we also need to make sure people understand the risks, know how to use it safely if they choose to and that health care systems are prepared.' The study utilized data from five major national surveys from 2014-2023 and revealed a gap in how well current medical coding systems track psilocybin-related problems in emergency departments.

**New Mexico Becomes Third State in the U.S. to Legalize Access to Psilocybin | Foley & Lardner LLP**
New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed into law SB-219, the Medical Psilocybin Act, making New Mexico the third state to create a legal pathway for patients to access psilocybin. The Act had bipartisan support and passed with a vote of 56-8 in the House and 33-4 in the Senate. The Program must be implemented by December 31, 2027, and will allow licensed health care providers to offer medical psilocybin services to their patients. According to the authors, this could have a profound effect on patients who are suffering and getting little alleviation with their current treatment options. The authors recommend health care providers keep a watchful eye on New Mexico as other states may soon enact similar medical psilocybin programs.

**Connecticut Committee Takes Up Bill To Decriminalize Psilocybin**
The Joint Judiciary Committee in Connecticut has taken up a bill to decriminalize psilocybin for adults. The proposal would make possession of up to one-half an ounce of psilocybin punishable by a $150 fine, without the threat of jail time. Chandra Campanelli, a registered nurse with experience facilitating psilocybin therapy, testified that people are already using psilocybin in both controlled and uncontrolled settings, and that it carries 'very, very low harm.' Jess Zaccagnino, policy counsel of ACLU Connecticut, backed the reform, stating that prohibition is a 'proven failure' and that there are better ways to control drug use, such as harm reduction. However, a self-described cannabis advocate opposed the psilocybin policy change, arguing that Connecticut should focus on preventing the continued arrest of cannabis users before considering psychedelics reform.

**New Connecticut Bill Would Decriminalize Psilocybin**
A new bill, House Bill 7065, introduced in the Connecticut General Assembly by the Joint Committee on Judiciary, aims to decriminalize possession of small amounts of psilocybin, the psychoactive compound found in magic mushrooms. The bill would remove criminal penalties for individuals found in possession of less than half an ounce of psilocybin, with first-time offenders facing a $150 fine and repeat offenders facing fines ranging from $200 to $500. The bill also revises statutes related to drug paraphernalia, ensuring that possession of items used to consume psilocybin would no longer carry criminal penalties. If enacted, the bill would take effect on October 1, 2025. This is not the first attempt to decriminalize psilocybin in Connecticut, as a separate bill, House Bill 6380, was filed last month by State Rep. Joshua Elliott (D).
