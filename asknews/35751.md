**Brazilian Government Intensifies Efforts to Regulate Social Media, Censorship Concerns Rise**
The Brazilian government, led by President Lula, is intensifying efforts to regulate social media in the country, which critics say could lead to stricter censorship in the 2026 elections. The government is drafting a law that would give the National Authority for Data Protection (ANPD) the power to monitor and remove online content. Meanwhile, the Attorney General's Office has requested that the Supreme Federal Court (STF) accelerate the trial of the 987th Theme, which deals with the responsibility of digital platforms. Senator Eduardo Girão considers these actions an attempt to censor conservative voices and control online discourse. The STF will resume the trial on June 4, which could radically change the freedom of expression on social media. If the Article 19 of the Internet Civil Code is overturned, platforms may be forced to remove posts without a court decision. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA have removed the routine recommendation for COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The decision is based on current data showing low risk of severe cases in these groups and a lack of robust evidence to justify regular boosters. Vaccines are still recommended for the elderly, people with comorbidities, and high-risk groups. President Lula stated, 'Deus deixou o sertão sem água porque sabia que eu seria presidente e traria água para cá' during the inauguration of the Apodi Ramal, part of the São Francisco River transposition. He also announced measures such as electricity bill exemption for low-income families, credit programs for residential renovations, and subsidies for gas stoves. The president of the Senate, Davi Alcolumbre, made an ultimatum to the government, considering the increase in the Financial Operations Tax (IOF) without congressional consultation an attempt to 'usurp' legislative prerogative. The IOF increase, announced to raise R$ 61 billion in 2025 and 2026, has faced strong resistance in Congress, with at least 20 proposals to suspend the decree presented by parliamentarians.

**Can Democratic Attorneys General Save the Environment from Trump 2.0? (Part 1)**
State attorneys general will play a crucial role in preventing the Trump administration from rolling back US energy and environmental policy. In the 2026 midterm elections, 30 state AG offices will be up for election. It is essential to elect AG candidates who understand and support efforts to combat climate change. The fate of federal energy and environmental policy will be decided in the courts, as the Trump administration will not stop its assault on the Biden and Obama climate legacies unless ordered to by the courts. State AGs have significant power, as demonstrated by their successful lawsuits against cigarette companies in the 1990s. Trump is aware of this power, as seen in the Department of Justice's attempt to preempt state lawsuits against oil companies. 'The only way more Democratic senators and representatives can stop the president from doing much of what he has set out to do by executive fiat is to have veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate.'

**Eduardo Bolsonaro Expected to Remain in US and Run 2026 Campaign Remotely**
Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian congressman, is expected to remain in the United States and run his 2026 election campaign remotely, according to his allies. This decision comes after the Supreme Court opened an investigation into alleged crimes committed by Eduardo while working with the Trump administration against Brazilian authorities. Eduardo's allies see this as a political persecution, justifying his stay abroad. According to the Câmara's rules, Eduardo has the right to a 122-day leave of absence, but it is not renewable, and he can accumulate unjustified absences until he loses his mandate, a decision that belongs to the Câmara's president, Hugo Motta. Eduardo has signaled that he will only return to Brazil when he feels safe. The investigation by the Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR) suggests that Eduardo acted to have the US government impose sanctions on members of the STF, PGR, and Polícia Federal. The petition for the investigation cites crimes such as coercion in the course of the process, obstruction of investigation, and attempt to abolish the democratic state of law. As reported by Folha de S.Paulo, Eduardo's allies are discussing the possibility of him running a remote campaign for the Senate in 2026, similar to the example of YouTuber Luis Miranda, who was elected as a federal deputy while living in Miami. Another alternative is the candidacy of Eduardo's brother, Carlos Bolsonaro, for the Senate in São Paulo.

**Ohio Supreme Court justice confirms unprecedented move to challenge colleague's seat**
Ohio Supreme Court Justice Pat Fischer has confirmed that he will run against fellow Justice Jennifer Brunner in the 2026 election. Fischer, a Republican, stated, 'I'm running to earn the support of the Ohio Republican Party State Central Committee and Republicans across Ohio, and I'm going to beat the sole remaining statewide Democrat on Election Day in 2026.' This move is unprecedented, as no Ohio Supreme Court justice has previously run for another court seat during the middle of their term. Brunner, a Democrat, has been the only member of her party holding a statewide office in Ohio. The election will likely be a contentious one, with Fischer portraying himself as a 'reliable Christian Conservative voice' and Brunner stating that the differences between them will be 'stark and obvious'.

**Key Dates in Peru's 2026 General Elections: A Shift in the Electoral Landscape**
The first key date is August 2nd, which marks the deadline for registering electoral alliances or coalitions. Although political organizations can register their alliances beforehand, many have yet to take decisive steps, which could result in the loss of registration for several parties due to the high electoral barrier for both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. According to a simulation by Tuesta, 'no more than five or six parties would have entered each parliament with these rules. There is nothing to indicate that in 2026 this will be higher, especially considering the high number of parties, even with the formation of alliances,' he said in an interview with RPP. Another important date is October 14th, when the electoral roll will be closed, a crucial situation for voters to make relevant changes, such as updating their residence. This is especially relevant for those who reside in different places than those listed on their National Identity Document (DNI), which could affect their participation in the elections and lead to possible fines for absenteeism. 'There are many Peruvians who, for example, live in Lima, but their DNI is in another region of the country and then they have to face the problem of having to travel to vote or simply, not being able to do so, absent themselves and assume the penalty,' he asserted. Other important dates include December 7th, where delegates will select official candidates for the general elections; December 23rd, the deadline for candidate registration; and March 13th, where the period of objections and appeals will conclude. The new electoral regulations could drastically change the country's political landscape. These regulations, designed to establish stricter representation thresholds, could significantly limit the number of parties in Congress. Under the new rules, parties must obtain at least 5% of the votes in the Chamber of Deputies elections and elect a minimum of seven deputies. For the Senate, at least three senators are required. These measures aim to reduce the number of small parties, but could also concentrate power in a select group of larger parties.

**Rep. Bill Huizenga considering launching U.S. Senate campaign this summer**
U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Republican from Holland, is considering running for the U.S. Senate in 2026 and could announce his campaign as soon as this summer. Huizenga said, 'I want to make sure we win,' and believes he has a good chance of winning the Senate seat. He is currently in a potential GOP primary race with former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who has received the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. However, Huizenga is confident that he can win the primary and the general election, saying, 'Are we going to run the same play and expect a different result?' The U.S. Senate seat is open in 2026 after U.S. Sen. Gary Peters decided not to seek another term. Democrats are also vying for the seat, with U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens being one of four candidates seeking their party's nomination.

**Lula Government and STF Plan to Escalate Censorship Efforts Ahead of 2026 Elections**
The Lula government and the Supreme Court (STF) are planning to escalate their efforts to control social media and limit freedom of expression in Brazil, increasing the risk of severe censorship in the 2026 elections. The government is preparing a bill that would give the National Authority for Data Protection (ANPD) the power to regulate and remove content on the internet. Meanwhile, the Attorney General's Office (AGU) has sent two requests to the STF related to the regulation of social media, including a request to expedite a judgment on the matter. The STF has indicated that it will consider the issue in the coming week. The government has also asked China to send a 'trusted person' to help regulate social media. The alignment between the Executive and Judicial branches, ahead of the 2026 elections, indicates a risk of a more severe wave of censorship than in recent years, with potential impact on public debate, freedom of opinion, and the election itself. 'The government is clearly preparing the ground for 2026,' says lawyer Gabriel Avelar. 'We are facing an obsession of the regime - the Lula government and some STF ministers - to censor Brazilians. It's the only way they have to contain the growing sentiment of conservative Brazilians, who are realizing that we don't have democracy or respect for public money,' says Senator Eduardo Girão (Novo-CE). The authorities have been trying to soften the censorship by downplaying the emphasis on 'disinformation' and focusing on more consensual topics. However, critics argue that the government's efforts are aimed at controlling the narrative on social media and limiting freedom of expression. 'This is a text absolutely devoid of constitutional legitimacy,' says Avelar. 'If tomorrow I have a government program that says: 'we have to exterminate a certain layer of the population,' I can't express myself against it because I'm hindering the effectiveness of the program? It's obvious that it's an extreme example, but it serves to illustrate the absurdity.' The government's efforts to regulate social media have been met with criticism from experts and lawmakers, who argue that they are aimed at limiting freedom of expression and controlling the narrative on social media. 'The Brazil is on the brink of censorship on social media,' says lawyer André Marsiglia. 'We will soon see the regulation project written by the government. We should expect a way to deliver the power of censorship to the Executive - with the blessing of the STF,' he added. 'And there's a detail that's even more serious: this project only makes sense (for the government) if they believe they will continue in power. Why would they give the 'censorship baton' to the opponent next year?'

**US Midterm Elections: A New and Challenging Landscape**
The United States is heading towards a midterm election in the fall of 2026, which will be the second for President Donald Trump and the third for the billionaire Republican. Despite his declining popularity and 'achievements' that have not pleased voters, President Joe Biden is still considered a strong contender. Biden managed to prevent a 'tsunami' of Republican votes in the 2022 midterm elections, and limited the Democratic Party's losses. Trump, who lost the 2020 presidential election, has become a key player in the subsequent midterm elections. This time, the election will include the contest for all 453 seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the 100 seats in the Senate. Observers believe that Trump, with his return to the presidency this year, has created a new and challenging electoral landscape. Trump's supporters are optimistic about his chances, citing his ability to expand the Republican Party's base and attract new voters, including minorities and moderate-income individuals. However, the Democratic Party is also making gains, particularly among young voters and those who are dissatisfied with the current administration. The election is expected to be highly competitive, with both parties facing significant challenges. The Republican Party is trying to maintain its control of the House of Representatives, while the Democratic Party is seeking to regain its majority. The election will also be influenced by the ongoing controversy surrounding Trump's presidency, including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his relationship with foreign leaders. The outcome of the election will have significant implications for the country's politics and policies.

**CCJ Delays Vote on New Electoral Code for Third Time**
The Comissão de Constituição e Justiça (CCJ) of the Brazilian Senate has postponed the analysis of the Projeto de Lei Complementar (PLP) nº 112/2021, which institutes the new Código Eleitoral, for the third time. The postponement was due to a collective request for a review by the senators. The new Código Eleitoral aims to consolidate all electoral and party legislation in a single law, currently dispersed in various norms. The relator, senador Marcelo Castro (MDB-PI), has presented a new report with changes to the project, including a two-year quarantine period for magistrates and public security professionals. Castro hopes to finalize the text in both houses by October, so that the rules can be valid for the 2026 elections. The main change in the new report is the reduction of the quarantine period for judges, members of the Public Ministry, and public security professionals from four years to two years. Castro argued, 'We believe that, in this way, we will meet, in part, the demand of those who have been positioning themselves against the four-year quarantine.' The new Código Eleitoral also proposes 20% of the seats in both houses for women, aiming to achieve parity of gender in the National Congress over time. The measure is seen as more effective than the minimum number of female candidates, as some parties use non-competitive 'laranja' candidates to meet the required number of female candidates. The text also includes the previsibility of free public transportation on election day, with extended working hours on weekdays. Currently, this topic is not regulated by law, but was determined by the Electoral Justice in 2022. Castro justified, 'Although the reduction of abstention depends primarily on the increase in geographical proximity between the voter and the respective voting location, we understand that the measure can contribute to a higher turnout at the polls.' The project also changes the deadline for inelegibility cases to a maximum of eight years, considering the time elapsed between the publication of the decision and its effective judgment. The code fixes April 2 as the general deadline for desincompatibilization of public agents who want to run in the elections that year, reducing the current deadline of six months exactly.

**Hugo Motta Asks STF to Limit New Electoral Rule to 2026 Elections**
Hugo Motta has requested the Supreme Federal Court (STF) to only apply the new rule on electoral leftovers for the 2026 elections, in response to the court's decision to apply the rule for the 2022 elections. This measure could modify the current composition of the Chamber with the possible exchange of seven parliamentarians. Motta's request contrasts with the position of the President of the Federal Senate, Davi Alcolumbre, who supports the immediate application of the new rules. Alcolumbre believes that the STF's decision can benefit parliamentarians and political allies in the state of Amapá. This divergence between the presidents of the two houses of the National Congress highlights the complexity and political implications of the issue, showing how changes in electoral rules can have significant effects on the national political landscape.

**Democrats challenge Wisconsin congressional map, eyeing 2026 midterm elections**
Democrats have filed a lawsuit with the Wisconsin Supreme Court to invalidate the state's congressional map, arguing it is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that unfairly advantages Republicans. The lawsuit, filed by the Elias Law Group, claims the map is 'antithetical to virtually every principle necessary to sustain a representative democracy.' Democrats would need to flip only three seats in the 2026 midterm elections to retake the House majority. The lawsuit comes after a liberal majority on the state Supreme Court threw out Republican-leaning legislative maps in 2023, leading to a new set of maps that helped Democrats flip 14 seats statewide in 2024. 'Wisconsin voters deserve congressional districts that ensure all voices and viewpoints are fairly represented,' said Abha Khanna, partner at the Elias Law Group. 'Unfortunately, Wisconsin's current congressional map has unfairly rewarded Republicans with a significant electoral advantage and will continue to do so for the remainder of the decade.'

**Head-on | Why Trump could face whitewash in next year's midterm elections**
United States President Donald Trump's global trade war and his administration's policies could lead to a loss of Republican control in the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2026 midterm elections, severely eroding Trump's policymaking authority. The recent election in Wisconsin, where a liberal Democrat won a seat on the state Supreme Court by a 56-44% margin, indicates a shift in public opinion against Trump. Business leaders, including Elon Musk, who donated $20 million to fund the Republican candidate's campaign, have become polarizing figures, and Trump's trade war has divided public opinion. Retaliatory tariffs by China and the European Union will fuel food inflation and drive up prices of imports. Sentiment against Trump-Musk is turning not only on the ground but also in America's boardrooms, with business leaders warning of a backlash. The full economic consequences of Trump's global tariff war will be felt during the 2026 midterm elections, and if Trump loses control of the House of Representatives, his agenda will be crippled.

**U.S. House Democrats celebrate Wisconsin win, predict Iowa will oust Miller-Meeks in 2026**
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is celebrating the Democratic win in Wisconsin's Supreme Court special election and predicting that U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa) will lose her seat in 2026. Jeffries pointed to a 2020 special election in Iowa where a Democrat won a state Senate district that Trump had won by 21 points, as evidence that Miller-Meeks is vulnerable. Miller-Meeks is planning to run for a third term, but Davenport Republican David Pautsch is considering challenging her in the primary. There are currently no announced Democratic candidates for the race.

**Wisconsin, Florida elections get spin treatment as Dems, GOP look ahead to 2026 midterms**
In the first statewide election since President Donald Trump's return to power, liberal-leaning Judge Susan Crawford won a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat by a margin of roughly ten percentage points, preserving the liberal majority on the court. The contest was seen as a referendum on Trump's moves and billionaire Elon Musk's influence, with Crawford saying, 'I never could have imagined that I'd be taking on the richest man in the world, for justice in Wisconsin. And we won.' Meanwhile, Republicans held control of two vacant congressional seats in Florida, giving the GOP a little breathing room in the House of Representatives. Democrats are celebrating their 'overperformance' in Florida, but the results will likely give them a jolt and validate their efforts to target Musk. Musk dished out roughly $20 million in the Wisconsin race through aligned groups in support of Schimel. 'The people of Wisconsin squarely rejected the influence of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and billionaire special interests,' Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin claimed. However, Democrats have a serious brand issue right now, with the party's favorable rating at all-time lows in national polls.

**2025 special election results in Wisconsin and Florida**
Three special elections are taking place in Wisconsin and Florida, which could give voters a sense of the political direction in the US. In Florida, the 6th Congressional District was won by Fine, and the 1st Congressional District is expected to be won by Patronis, despite strong Democratic turnout and fundraising efforts by Valimont. In Wisconsin, a state Supreme Court race between Susan Crawford and Brad Schimel could have far-reaching consequences, including potentially impacting which party controls Congress in 2026. According to Elon Musk, 'What's happening on Tuesday is a vote for which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives.'

**GOP Will Lose House If Crawford Wins WI Supreme Court Race**
If Susan Crawford wins the Wisconsin Supreme Court race on April 1, Republicans are likely to lose two congressional seats in Wisconsin before the 2026 midterms, risking President Donald Trump's mandate and the America First agenda. According to an email from liberal donor advisors, Crawford's victory 'could also result in Democrats' winning 'half the seats needed to win control of the House in 2026.' As conservative opponent Brad Schimel noted, 'we have to take her word that the group didn't discuss anything about congressional maps with Crawford, because, apparently, no recording of the Zoom meeting exists.' The new maps from the liberal court could turn Wisconsin's 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts into noncompetitive, safe Democrat districts, giving Democrats a near-automatic one-seat majority before the 2026 elections. As state Senator Van Wanggaard described it, 'Republicans were not stuck between a rock and hard place. It was a matter of choosing to be stabbed, shot, poisoned or led to the guillotine. We chose to be stabbed, so we can live to fight another day.'

**Kansas House endorses plan to elect Supreme Court justices, placing question on August 2026 ballot**
The Kansas House has endorsed a plan to rewrite the state constitution and allow voters to elect Kansas Supreme Court justices. The resolution, which will be placed on the August 2026 ballot, was passed by an 84-40 margin, meeting the minimum two-thirds threshold needed for passage. Supporters of the change argue that it will empower voters, while opponents claim that it will inject politics into the court system and lead to a more politicized court. Rep. Lindsay Vaughn, D-Overland Park, said, 'This is about injecting politics into our court system.' Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, responded, 'We all know elections are not for sale,' and pointed out that voters can evaluate the merit of candidates. The current system for selecting Kansas Supreme Court justices emerged from a 1950s political scandal and has been criticized for being 'rigged' and favoring lawyers. Rep. Bob Lewis, a Republican attorney, said, 'I think it's a rigged system, quite frankly, and it needs to be changed.'

**Meeks: Dems Realize We Have to Be Unified to 'Win in the Courts' and in 2026**
Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) stated on CNN News Central that Democrats have realized the importance of unity in order to win in the courts and in the 2026 elections. Meeks said, 'We're in a fight, and we are winning in the courts.' He emphasized that Democrats are focused on winning in the long run, and that their strategy includes going to the courts. Meeks cited an example of Democrats' commitment to voting, saying, 'All of the House Democrats showed up, except for one member who just had a baby, and she came to the floor. Another one that was on with an I.V., came to the floor to vote.'

**Exclusive — Eyes on Wisconsin: State Supreme Court Race That Could Bring Trump’s Agenda to a Screeching Halt**
Wisconsin is set to hold a state Supreme Court election on April 1, which could have significant implications for the nation. The election is seen as a chance for Democrats to push policy and redraw legislative maps that could ultimately lose Republicans two U.S. House seats and help them close in on the Republican's slim majority. Wisconsin GOP Chairman Brian Schimming said, 'To say that what happens in Wisconsin will not stay in Wisconsin is putting it really mildly.' The fight is between former conservative Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel and Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, who previously represented left-wing groups like Planned Parenthood. Schimming said, 'This is the last chance we have until 2028 to take a majority.' Democrats' view of the race as a pathway to power in D.C. is not mere speculation and has been touted openly. An email invitation obtained by Breitbart News to a briefing on Jan.13 with Democrat donors, Crawford, and Wisconsin Democrat Chairman Ben Wikler has a subject line that reads: 'Chance to put two more House seats in play for 2026.' Schimel said, 'They got caught saying the quiet thing out loud, and they revealed what they’re up to. This is, as it was in 2023, a power play to attract enormous amounts of money from partisan donors and turn that into results on the court.' The election could also result in Democrats being able to win two additional US House seats, half the seats needed to win control of the House in 2026.
