**Studies Show That Quality Sleep Can Extend Your Life By 5 Years. This Is How You Can Get Better Sleep**
A study presented at the 2023 American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session found that getting good sleep can add years to your life. The study, which analyzed data from 172,321 participants, estimated that 7.9% of the risk of dying for any reason was due to suboptimal sleep patterns. Those who had all five low-risk sleep factors were 30% less likely to die for any reason, 21% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease, and 40% less likely to die of causes other than heart disease or cancer. Experts recommend creating a consistent sleep schedule, getting adequate duration of sleep (7 or more hours per night), and avoiding sleep disturbances or disorders. Dr. Angela Holliday-Bell notes that 'people differ in their chronotypes or preferential timing of bed and wake time, but what is most important is keeping the time consistent.' Dr. Yu-Ming Ni adds that 'a good sleep pattern is as much continuous sleep as possible.' Dr. David Kuhlmann recommends limiting exposure to bright lights and electronic devices 30 minutes before bedtime and creating a relaxing sleep environment. 'If you are unable to fall asleep after 30 minutes, get up and take a warm shower or bath,' he suggests. 'Now we know that, if done right, better sleep can extend your life by at least five years,' says Dr. Ni.

**Three Habits for a Longer and Healthier Life, According to AI**
According to recent scientific studies, three habits can help individuals live longer and healthier lives. These habits not only promote longevity but also improve quality of life in old age. Regular physical exercise is essential for a long and healthy life. A study by cardiologist Eric Topol found that all 'super seniors' (adults over 80 years old) had one thing in common: regular exercise, especially strength training. This type of activity improves bone density, mental acuity, and reduces the risk of falls. A study published in PubMed in 2023 also found that people who followed physical activity guidelines (150-300 minutes of moderate activity per week or 75-150 minutes of vigorous activity) had a significant reduction in mortality and a longer life expectancy. Adopting a Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and olive oil, is associated with increased longevity. A study led by cardiologist Samia Mora, published in the JAMA Network Open in 2024, followed over 25,000 women for 25 years and found that those who strictly followed this diet had a 23% lower risk of death. Research from Stanford University also revealed that healthy fatty acids found in the Mediterranean diet, such as oleic acid, can protect cell membranes from oxidative damage, contributing to longer life. Maintaining strong and meaningful social relationships is crucial for a long and healthy life. A meta-analysis by the Centre for Healthy Ageing (CHeBA) at UNSW Sydney, published in 2023, found that older adults with good social connections had a lower risk of cognitive decline, dementia, and death. A study based on MIDUS data also found that positive relationships with others predicted lower incidence of functional limitations and longer life, regardless of other social support factors.

**Scientists Reveal the Secrets to Living Beyond 100 Years**
Researchers from the University of Westminster in the UK have revealed the key factors for living beyond 100 years. According to the scientists, even 75 minutes of brisk walking per week can add two years to one's life. They emphasize that a sedentary lifestyle is the main enemy of longevity, recommending standing up every 30 minutes and dedicating 30 minutes a day to moderate physical activity. They also note that those who reached 70 years without chronic diseases preferred vegetables, fruits, nuts, and whole grain products, but stress that it's essential to maintain a balance and not exclude meat completely. Irregular sleep increases the risk of early death by 50%, with the optimal duration being 7-9 hours, although individual needs may vary. Working night shifts is particularly detrimental. 'Childhood trauma and chronic stress accelerate aging at the cellular level. Yoga, social activity, and strong relationships with loved ones help maintain psychological resilience. Elderly people who communicate with friends daily live, on average, five years longer.' The researchers also highlight that genetics account for only 20-40% of lifespan, and that even ideal genetics and healthy habits do not guarantee a 115-year lifespan, but significantly increase the chances of remaining active and healthy in old age, as said, 'even ideal genetics and healthy habits do not guarantee 115 years of life. But they significantly increase the chances of staying active and healthy in old age'.

**Eliminating Cardiovascular Risk Factors at 50 Can Increase Life Expectancy by Over a Decade**
A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, conducted by the Global Cardiovascular Risk Consortium, shows that eliminating five major cardiovascular risk factors at the age of 50 can increase life expectancy by over a decade. The study analyzed data from over 2 million participants in 39 countries and found that women who do not have any of these risk factors develop cardiovascular disease 13.3 years later and die 14.5 years later than those who have all five. Men who do not have these risk factors live 10 years longer and die 11.8 years later. According to cardiologist Fabiana Rached, 'The difference of more than 10 years in life expectancy and years free of cardiovascular disease between those who have and those who do not have the five main risk factors at 50 is striking and shows clearly how these factors impact cardiovascular health in the long term and in death.' Rached emphasizes the importance of controlling these risk factors from a young age, as the risk of cardiovascular disease increases naturally with age. She also notes that even those with a high genetic risk can minimize their risk of cardiovascular problems by adopting a healthy lifestyle from a young age. Additionally, Rached points out that it's never too late to make lifestyle changes, as even interventions made between 55 and 60 years old can still bring significant gains in years of life without cardiovascular disease and premature death.

**Losing just 6 kg in your 40s could lower your risk of disease and add years to your life: Study**
A Finnish study of over 23,000 people tracked for up to 35 years found that adults who lost weight naturally in their 40s without surgery or medication lived longer and enjoyed better health than those who stayed overweight. Even small amounts of weight loss, such as 6.5% of body weight (about 13 pounds for someone weighing 200 pounds), had a positive impact. The study found that those who lost weight had a 48% lower risk of chronic diseases and a 19% lower risk of death in the following decades. Lead author Dr. Timo Strandberg noted that the benefits of midlife weight loss may take decades to show, and that maintaining weight loss over time is tough, but the study offers hope for millions of overweight people in their 40s. 'It's never too late to make a change,' the study suggests, and even modest, steady weight loss can bring lasting health benefits, adding years and vitality to life.

**Scientists Find Way to Extend Life and Delay Aging by 26-35% in Mice**
Scientists have found a way to extend life and delay aging by combining two drugs, which not only prolonged the life of mice by 26-35%, but also significantly improved its quality. According to Science Alert, the study showed that animals remained active for longer, with lower levels of chronic inflammation and delayed cancer development. The team from the Max Planck Institute (Germany) used rapamycin (immunosuppressant) and trametinib (anticancer drug). Individually, each of them had already demonstrated an effect of slowing down aging, but in combination, their impact was synergistic. Researchers tested the drugs separately and together. Rapamycin increased lifespan by 17-18%, trametinib by 7-16%. Combined use prolonged life by 26-35%. The animals remained active for longer, with less inflammation and later cancer development. Researchers note that these results do not mean that similar treatment will extend human life to 130 years. However, the drugs may become the basis for future therapy that will help people age slower and maintain quality of life. 'We do not expect the same increase in human life as was demonstrated in mice, but we hope that the drugs will help people stay healthy in old age. Further research on humans in the coming years will help us determine how these drugs can be beneficial for people and who they can be beneficial for,' said co-author of the study Linda Partidge.

**Identifying a Key Life Stage for Achieving Longevity with Physical and Mental Well-being**
A recent study found that the period between 36 and 46 years old is a crucial stage for defining health in the following decades. Researchers identified three fundamental routines that can significantly improve the chances of achieving a healthy long life. The accumulation of multiple risk behaviors, such as smoking, excessive drinking, and physical inactivity, was associated with lower well-being and mental health. Preventing these behaviors in early adulthood and middle age is essential to avoid their accumulation and the resulting risks to the body. 'Our findings highlight the importance of addressing health-risk behaviors, such as smoking, excessive drinking, and physical inactivity, as soon as possible to prevent the damage they cause from accumulating over the years and culminating in poor mental and physical health in later life,' said the study's lead author, Tiia Kek√§l√§inen, a health scientist specializing in aging at the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ and a researcher at the University of Applied Sciences of Laurea. A separate study found that each cigarette smoked reduces life expectancy by an average of 20 minutes: 17 minutes for men and 22 minutes for women, offering a precise estimate. This data almost doubles the previous estimate published in 2000 by the BMJ, which calculated a reduction of 11 minutes per cigarette. The study's results are released in a context where, for example, stroke has stopped being a concern exclusive to people over 60 years old. Now, it affects more and more young adults and women worldwide. Recent data show that two important studies highlight this trend, adding scientific evidence on the growing number of cases and mortality associated with this condition.

**Type 2 Diabetes Remission: A Revolutionary Perspective**
Type 2 diabetes is no longer a life sentence. A revolutionary perspective has overturned decades of medical convictions that considered the disease as progressive and irreversible. Nutrition plays a central role in this shift: the traditional Mediterranean low-calorie diet can have positive effects on remission, offering a sustainable alternative to more restrictive regimens. According to Dr. Domenico Tric√≤, 'remission of type 2 diabetes is now a concrete possibility, clinically relevant, and - in selected contexts - easily achievable.' The definition of remission, now clarified by an intersocietal consensus, indicates 'a return to glycemic values below the diagnostic range for diabetes in the absence of pharmacological therapy for at least 3 months.' Although spontaneous remission remains rare (less than 2% of the general population), targeted interventions can significantly increase these probabilities, especially in patients with recent diagnosis. The secret to remission lies in weight loss. All effective therapeutic approaches share this common denominator, supported by unequivocal scientific evidence: every percentage point of weight lost increases the probability of remission by 3%. This data transforms weight loss from a simple recommendation to a precise and measurable therapeutic strategy. The three main strategies for achieving remission are lifestyle modification, selective pharmacotherapy, and metabolic surgery. The first represents the most accessible and sustainable approach, while the other options are reserved for specific cases. The flexibility of the nutritional approach is fundamental: as Tric√≤ points out, 'it is not necessary to adhere entirely to the liquid diet, dubbed 'soup and shake' by the English who first experimented with it: even partial substitution of meals or a traditional low-calorie Mediterranean diet can have positive effects.' The DiRECT study has represented a turning point in the management of type 2 diabetes. Conducted on patients with recent diabetes and excess weight, it has demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple but revolutionary protocol: a low-calorie diet with liquid meal substitutes of 800 calories per day for three months, followed by gradual reintroduction of foods. The results were very encouraging: 45% of remissions at one year and 13% of remissions maintained at five years. The simplicity of the intervention has surprised even the researchers: it was managed by general practitioners, nurses, and dietitians after just eight hours of training. This model has inspired the NHS Path to Remission Programme in the UK, which has achieved 27% of remissions even in non-selected participants, often supported only through apps or telemedicine. 'The benefits of diabetes remission go beyond clinical satisfaction. As research shows, the advantages are numerous: 50% reduction in pharmaceutical expenditure, prevention of micro and macrovascular complications, and an increase in life expectancy up to six years. The initial investment in the program is largely offset by savings on medications, visits, hospitalizations, and management of complications,' explains Tric√≤. Now, according to experts from the SID - Italian Society of Diabetology - who recently met at their national congress in Riccione, this model is ready to be expanded and introduced into our NHS. 'A progressive system for type 2 diabetes remission, inspired by the English experience, with three levels of treatment: lifestyle intervention managed by non-medical personnel, pharmacological therapy for cases of relapse, and metabolic surgery only for selected cases. The goal is to create 'Remission Clinics' managed mainly by nurses, dietitians, and psychologists, with remote support and simple but effective interventions.' It is essential to remember that 'remission does not mean cure, but a slowing of the pathological process, which makes a constant follow-up essential. However, at diagnosis, remission should be proposed to all patients as a motivating goal, transforming the approach to diabetes from chronic management to a possibility of therapeutic freedom' concludes Tric√≤.

**Italian Study Warns of Severe Obesity in Children and Adolescents**
More than 100,000 children and adolescents under the age of 17 in Italy suffer from severe and early-onset obesity, a condition that can lead to a reduction in life expectancy of over 15 years compared to their peers. According to the Italian Society of Pediatrics, this is accompanied by serious risks that can occur very early, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver, as well as anxiety, social isolation, and low self-esteem. Dr. Claudio Maffeis, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Verona, warns that 'to avoid a surplus of weight becoming a chronic disease, we must recognize and treat this condition promptly, which is often underestimated.' Intensive lifestyle programs have been shown to reduce body fat in over 50% of children between the ages of 6 and 9, but have almost no effect on adolescents, with only 2% of boys between the ages of 14 and 16 responding positively. Dr. Rino Agostiniani, president of the Italian Society of Pediatrics, emphasizes that 'early intervention can change the trajectory of health.' Medications, such as GLP1 agonists, are available for adolescents over 12 years old, but should only be prescribed in specialized centers. These medications help regulate hunger and satiety and have been shown to be effective in reducing weight and cardiovascular metabolic risk factors.

**4 Habits to Help You Live to 100**
According to research, people who engage in a significant amount of physical activity daily tend to live longer and healthier lives. A study found that transitioning from no physical activity to walking for 75 minutes a week increased life expectancy by two years. A recent study of 100,000 people over 30 years found that those who remained healthy until age 70 (without chronic diseases) typically ate more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, and less processed meat, sugary foods, and fried foods. The timing and quantity of food consumption also play a role in aging. Research on calorie restriction and intermittent fasting in animals has shown that both can increase life expectancy. Regular and good sleep is crucial for health and longevity. A study of 500,000 Britons found that irregular sleep patterns were associated with a 50% increased risk of early death. Night shift workers had a higher risk of stroke, and nurses who worked night shifts for decades had lower health and a higher risk of early death after retirement compared to those who did not work night shifts. Early life stressors (such as losing a parent, neglect, or abuse) can negatively impact health in later life by increasing inflammation, which may increase the risk of health decline and early death in old age. On the other hand, older adults who show increased psychological flexibility towards stress are less likely to die from any cause.

**Do Diets Really Prolong Life? Scientists' Answer is Surprising**
American scientists from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging have found that strict calorie restriction does not always lead to a longer and healthier life. A study published in the journal Current Biology used 50,000 fruit flies and found mixed results. While the average lifespan of the flies increased, 13% died earlier despite increased activity, 5% lived longer but with reduced health, and 32% showed no changes. This suggests that calorie restriction does not have a universal effect as previously thought. According to the researchers, genetics play a key role: some individuals may benefit from diets, while others may accelerate the development of age-related diseases. Biomarkers linked to food response may help determine individual reactions. As a reminder, a 101-year-old dietitian shared her 7 rules for a long and healthy life.

**Obesity Reduces Life Expectancy by 5 to 20 Years, Says Dr. Manuel de la Pe√±a**
According to Dr. Manuel de la Pe√±a, a renowned cardiologist, obesity is reducing people's life expectancy by 5 to 20 years. He notes that obesity is associated with 200 diseases, including cardiovascular conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease, which increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes by up to 70% and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 8 times. De la Pe√±a emphasizes that the distribution of body fat, particularly visceral fat, is a key factor in these conditions. He recommends a Mediterranean diet, caloric restriction, and intermittent fasting to extend life expectancy. He also suggests that diets should include high-quality foods, replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats, and eliminate ultra-processed foods. De la Pe√±a has identified innovative treatments, such as tirzepatida, which inhibits GLP-1 and GIP receptors, addressing the underlying mechanisms of appetite and satiety, and has shown to be effective in reducing body weight by up to 25% in certain individuals. Additionally, these medications have beneficial effects on blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, and insulin levels.

**Caloric Restriction and Healthy Aging: Dr. Rafael de Cabo's Expert Insights**
Dr. Rafael de Cabo, a renowned expert in healthy aging, presented a conference on 'Fasting and Diet for Healthy Longevity' at the Real Academia de Medicina y Cirug√≠a de Sevilla (Ramse). De Cabo, who has spent 25 years researching the effects of caloric restriction, emphasized the correlation between caloric restriction and a lower presence of chronic diseases. He noted that while caloric restriction has been shown to have a beneficial effect on most chronic diseases, the exact mechanisms behind this effect are still unknown. De Cabo also highlighted the importance of other factors, such as the duration and timing of fasting, in addition to the amount of food consumed. The conference discussed the implications of these findings for the development of new interventions to prevent and treat chronic conditions in older adults. According to Dr. Carlos A. Infantes, president of the Ramse, 'it is an honor to have Dr. de Cabo, a leading figure in the field of research, with us. His visit represents a milestone for our institution, reinforcing our commitment to enriching the dialogue and promoting collaboration among professionals.'

**Unlocking the Secrets of Nutrition and Exercise to Delay Aging**
Dr. James White, an assistant professor of medicine at Duke University, has revealed his daily routine for healthy eating and exercise, which combines balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, and stress management, based on his research on the effects of caloric restriction on delaying aging. According to White, a mild level of stress, induced by caloric restriction, can activate cellular defense mechanisms, leading to improved bodily functions with age, as supported by recent studies on both animals and humans. White believes that caloric restriction causes a mild level of stress in the body, which prompts cells to activate defense mechanisms that clean the DNA from signs of aging, and this interaction may contribute to improved cellular functions with age, as per his studies. In a study on mice, those who consumed 30-40% fewer calories lived 40% longer, but he noted that these results cannot be directly applied to humans, but rather serve as a basis for future research. White also participated in a human study lasting two years on 220 people who were not obese, reduced their daily caloric intake by 100-200 calories, and the result was an improvement in cardiovascular indicators and metabolic function, as well as a slowdown in biological aging, according to changes in white blood cells and genes. Although there is no conclusive evidence that caloric restriction extends lifespan, the initial results are encouraging, according to White. White does not follow a strict caloric restriction program, but rather focuses on maintaining a 'healthy weight' by avoiding overeating and emphasizing balance, and he suggests that older adults should prioritize maintaining muscle mass rather than reducing excessive weight. He cited a study published in the Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal in 2019, which showed that reducing caloric intake by 11.9% for two years improved blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and reduced the risk of heart disease. In his weekly workouts (5-6 days), White focuses on combining cardio and weightlifting, with each session lasting 45-60 minutes, to maintain muscle mass and endurance. He emphasizes that three sessions per week may be highly effective, as a review published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine in 2023, which included data from over 30 million people, showed that just 11 minutes of daily physical activity can lower the risk of death from chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. White uses apps to track calories and focuses on consuming light proteins like salmon, vegetables, and healthy fats, while reducing carbohydrates, especially processed ones, as they are easy to overconsume. He noted that the 'Mediterranean diet' system, which is similar to this dietary pattern, was chosen as the best healthy diet for the eighth year in a row according to the US News & World Report ranking. White does not overlook the importance of sleep as part of the equation for living a long life, as he prioritizes sleeping for 8 hours a day and considers sleep to be one of the best ways to cope with daily stress. He says, 'Stress is inevitable, but sleep is a great way to rebalance, and dealing with sleep and stress is a continuous work that we must always be aware of.'

**Reducing Daily Caloric Intake by 12% Can Slow Down Human Aging, Study Finds**
A recent study found that reducing daily caloric intake by 12% can slow down human aging by 2-3%. However, Dr. Wang Siheng, a rehabilitation medicine specialist, notes that the side effects of low-calorie diets include hunger, fatigue, muscle and bone loss, decreased reproductive function, and weakened immune systems. He suggests that even if aging can be slowed down, people may not be willing to stick to a low-calorie diet in the long term. Dr. Wang Siheng states, 'Heat restriction has been proven to extend the lifespan of bacteria, fruit flies, worms, mice, and monkeys, making it a widely discussed topic. However, due to the long lifespan of humans and the difficulty in controlling the caloric intake of participants, there has been a lack of evidence showing that heat restriction can also extend human lifespan.' He adds, 'A study published in the journal Nature Aging found that reducing caloric intake can slow down human aging. The study involved 220 adults who were divided into two groups: a heat restriction group and a non-heat restriction group. The heat restriction group was asked to consume less than 25% of their daily caloric needs, but the participants were unable to comply, reducing their caloric intake by an average of only 12%. Nevertheless, the study found that the heat restriction group's aging rate was slowed down by 2-3%.' Dr. Wang Siheng concludes, 'Although the heat restriction group's reduction in caloric intake was not as significant as expected, most participants in the study showed improvements in blood pressure, blood sugar, and inflammation levels, indicating that even a small reduction in caloric intake can have health benefits. However, individuals with a normal weight do not need to restrict their caloric intake.'

**Farelerde Denendi! Kalori ve Stres Kƒ±sƒ±tlamasƒ± √ñmr√º Uzatƒ±yor**
Researchers at the Jackson Laboratory in the US conducted a study on 960 mice to understand the effects of calorie restriction and stress on longevity. The mice were divided into five groups and fed different diets, with some groups receiving only 60% or 80% of their normal daily calorie intake, while others were subjected to intermittent fasting. The results, published in Nature, showed that the mice that received 60% of their normal calorie intake lived an average of 34 months, while those that fasted intermittently lived an average of 28 months. The mice that received 80% of their normal calorie intake lived an average of 30 months. The researchers found that low-calorie diets extended the lifespan of the mice, regardless of their body fat percentage and blood glucose levels. However, the study also found that the mice that lost the most weight lived the shortest lives, and that those that lost weight had lower energy levels, weakened immune systems, and reduced reproductive capabilities. According to Prof. Gary Churchill, the study's lead researcher, 'Our study highlights the importance of resilience.' He added, 'The most resilient animals were those that maintained their weight despite stress and calorie restriction, and they were also the ones that lived the longest.' However, the study's results are not yet clear on whether they can be applied to humans, and the researchers note that the lifespan of the mice that received calorie restriction varied from a few months to 4.5 years, suggesting that genetic factors may play a more significant role in longevity than dietary habits.

**Restricting Calorie Intake May Increase Lifespan, Study Finds**
A recent study published in Nature magazine has found that restricting calorie intake can increase lifespan in mice. The study, conducted by researchers at the Jackson Laboratory in the US, involved 960 mice that were divided into five groups and fed different diets. The first group was allowed to eat as much as they wanted, while the other groups were restricted to 60% or 80% of their normal calorie intake, or were subjected to intermittent fasting. The results showed that the mice that were restricted to 60% of their normal calorie intake lived an average of 34 months, while the mice that were allowed to eat as much as they wanted lived an average of 25 months. The researchers found that the mice that lived the longest were those that were restricted to 60% of their normal calorie intake, and that they tended to lose less weight than the other groups. According to Prof. Gary Churchill, the study suggests that 'the key to longevity is not just about diet, but also about being resilient to stress and calorie restriction.' However, the study's findings are not yet clear on whether they can be applied to humans, and the researchers note that the results may be influenced by genetic factors.

**Can Restricting Caloric Intake Help People Live Longer?**
Restricting daily caloric intake may help people live longer and healthier lives. This idea has been around for almost a century, and recent studies have shown promising results. According to Dr. Jacques Proust, a specialist in aging biology, 'the first studies on animals date back to the 1930s.' The CALERIE study, which lasted two years, showed that reducing caloric intake by 14% led to positive effects on metabolic health and certain markers associated with aging. Another study found that a 25% reduction in daily caloric intake for two years slowed down aging by 2-3%. However, these results must be taken with caution, as the studies were conducted on a controlled diet and not on a free-choice diet. Dr. Proust advises that people in good health do not need to restrict their caloric intake to increase their longevity, but rather focus on a balanced and varied diet. He also notes that the benefits of caloric restriction on longevity are still unclear and need to be further researched.
