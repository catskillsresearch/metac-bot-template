**Russia Proposes 'Complete Withdrawal' of Ukrainian Troops Before Ceasefire**
Russia has proposed a 'complete withdrawal' of Ukrainian troops from the partially occupied regions of Donetsk and Lugansk (east) and Zaporijia and Kherson (south) before a '30-day ceasefire' can be implemented. The document, which outlines Russia's demands for the end of the conflict, also requires the 'international legal recognition' of those regions and Crimea, annexed in 2014, as Russian territory. Additionally, it demands the lifting of economic sanctions against Moscow and Ukraine's renunciation of claims for reparations to Russia for the February 2022 invasion. The document also includes the neutrality of Ukraine and its refusal to join military alliances, which interferes with Kiev's plans to join NATO. The document was published by the state agencies Tass and Ria Novosti after the meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul. The Russian delegation proposed a ceasefire of two to three days in certain sectors of the front line 'so that the commanders can collect the bodies of fallen soldiers.' The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, announced that both sides agreed to create permanent medical commissions to exchange lists of soldiers who have been severely injured. Medinsky also stated that Russia will study a list of 339 Ukrainian children deported by Moscow, which was handed over by the Ukrainian delegation to facilitate their return. 'Russia will study all cases on the Ukrainian list, without exception,' Medinsky said, adding that 'there is not a single kidnapped child, there are children who were saved and removed from combat zones.'

**Russia Demands Ukraine Withdraw Troops Before Complete Ceasefire**
Russia has requested that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the four oblasts (administrative regions) that Moscow claims as annexed before any complete ceasefire, according to a Russian memorandum transmitted to Kiev on Monday (2) and published by Russian news agencies. The document, delivered to Ukraine during negotiations in Istanbul, demands the 'total withdrawal' of Ukrainian troops from the partially occupied oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, as well as Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south, before the 'implementation of a 30-day ceasefire'. The memorandum, which also outlines Russia's demands for the end of the conflict in Ukraine, calls for the 'international legal recognition' of these oblasts and the Crimean Peninsula, annexed in 2014, as Russian territories. It also demands the lifting of economic sanctions and that Ukraine renounce its demand for Russian reparations, which launched an offensive against its neighbor in February 2022. The document mentions Ukraine's 'neutrality' and requests that it abandon its aspiration to join NATO, while limiting the size of the Ukrainian army. It also calls for an end to Western arms deliveries to Kiev and the end of intelligence sharing, as well as a ban on the deployment of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Furthermore, the document requests that Ukraine release 'political prisoners, both military and civilian, and commit to respecting the rights, freedoms, and interests of Russian speakers' in its territory. Echoing Moscow's declared desire to 'denazify' its neighbor, the document foresees the dissolution of 'Ukrainian nationalist groups' within the Armed Forces. These demands have been rejected by Ukraine on several occasions in the past.

**Ukraine and Russia Negotiations End Without Significant Progress**
The second round of direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia ended without significant progress, on Monday (2), in Istanbul. The new meeting was overshadowed by a surprise attack by Kiev against Russian military targets, in which more than 40 combat aircraft stationed in air bases were destroyed with drones in Russian territory. According to Reuters, the new meeting between Russian and Ukrainian representatives to discuss a ceasefire in the war lasted about an hour and resulted in some agreements. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced after the end of the meeting that there will be a new prisoner exchange between the warring parties, similar to the one agreed upon in the first round of negotiations in May, also in Istanbul, which involved the release of 1,000 detainees from each side. 'The negotiations in Istanbul were concluded and I am waiting for the complete report from the Minister (of Defense, Rustem) Umerov. They (Russians and Ukrainians) exchanged documents through the Turkish side, and we are preparing a new release of prisoners of war,' said Zelensky in Vilnius, at the end of a summit of countries from the North and East flanks of NATO to which he had been invited. Zelensky emphasized again that the Putin regime must suffer 'more severe' sanctions to accept the end of the invasion started in 2022. According to Zelensky, additional punitive measures more severe against Russian energy exports, and particularly against Moscow's oil sales, may lead to more progress towards a negotiated end to the war. 'We need to work on joint sanctions at the G7 level,' highlighted Zelensky, who mentioned explicitly the importance of the United States - which have not approved new punitive measures against Russia since the presidency of Donald Trump - being among those who sanction the Kremlin. During his speech, Zelensky announced, without giving details, that the NATO countries represented at the meeting committed to sending new packages of military aid and continuing to finance the production of arms in Ukraine.

**NATO Warns of Possible Russian Attack by 2029**
NATO's member countries should prepare for a possible Russian attack within the next four years, according to Germany's defense chief, General Carsten Breuer. He told the BBC that Russia is producing hundreds of tanks annually and many of these could be used in an attack on NATO's Baltic member countries by 2029 or earlier. 'We are facing a very serious threat from Russia, a threat I have never seen in my 40 years of service,' Breuer said. He claims that Russia is building up its forces 'to an enormous degree' and producing around 1500 tanks per year, not all of which are being used in the war in Ukraine, but also stored for future use against the West. 'There is an intention and a buildup of reserves for a possible future attack on NATO's Baltic member countries. Analysts estimate that this could happen in 2029. So we must be clear by 2029,' Breuer said. 'If you ask me now if this is a guarantee that it won't happen before 2029, I would say no. So we must be able to fight already tonight,' he added. Breuer pointed out the Suwalki Corridor, a region bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable areas. NATO forces, including those from Norway, have had a significant presence in the Suwalki Corridor in recent years to show muscle against Russia. 'What we need to do now is really to lean in and tell everyone: Come on, step up... engage more in this, because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves and thus also build up deterrence,' Breuer said.

**Germany's Top General Warns of Potential Russian Attack on NATO by 2029**
German Chief of Staff, General Carsten Breuer, believes that Russia may attack NATO within the next four years. He stated in an interview with the BBC, published on June 1, that NATO members must prepare for a possible Russian attack by 2029 or even earlier. According to Breuer, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never encountered in his 40-year career. He noted that Russia is rapidly increasing its military capabilities, producing around 1,500 main battle tanks per year and 4 million 152mm shells in 2024, not all of which were sent to Ukraine. Some of the military equipment is being stored in warehouses, awaiting a potential attack on the West. 'There is an intention and a buildup of reserves' for a possible future attack on Baltic states, he said. 'We must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it won't happen before 2029, I would say no, it's not. So we must be able to fight tonight,' Breuer said. He highlighted the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable areas. General Breuer asserts that NATO members must again increase their military forces. He added that it will take years for the European military-industrial base to ramp up to match the scale of Russia's military production.

**Germany's General Staff Chief Warns of Potential Russian Attack in 2029**
German General Staff Chief, General Carsten Breuer, has stated that Russia is likely to attack in four years. According to him, Russia produces around 1,500 main battle tanks annually and significantly increases its military forces. 'Not all tanks are sent to war in Ukraine, but they also go to reserves and new military structures that are always directed against the West,' he said. Breuer also mentioned that in 2024, Russia produced 4 million 152mm artillery shells, not all of which are intended for the front in Ukraine. 'There is an intention and accumulation of reserves' for a possible future attack on Baltic states, he added. 'This is what analysts estimate - in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029? I would say no, it's not. Therefore, we must be ready for battle already today,' he emphasized. Breuer named the Suwałki Gap - a section on the border of Poland, Lithuania, Russia, and Belarus - as one of the most vulnerable zones in case of aggression. 'Baltic states are indeed vulnerable to the Russians, aren't they? And when you're there, you really feel it... during the negotiations we conduct there,' he said. According to him, Estonians compare their situation to feeling heat, seeing flames, and smelling smoke, while in Germany 'you probably see only a little smoke on the horizon.' The general also noted that Russia perceives the war in Ukraine as 'a continuation' of a broader conflict with NATO and 'tries to find ways to penetrate our defensive lines and test them.' As examples of such actions, he cited attacks on underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, cyberattacks on public transportation, and the appearance of drones over critical infrastructure in Germany. Breuer called on NATO allies to urgently increase their defense capabilities. 'What we need to do now is really take action and say to everyone: 'Hey, increase... invest more in this, because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves, and therefore, to increase the deterrent potential,' he said.

**NATO Faces 'Very Serious Threat' from Russia, Says German General**
According to General Carsten Breuer, the inspector general of the German Bundeswehr, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never seen in his 40 years of service. Russia is increasing its military forces 'on a massive scale', producing around 1,500 main battle tanks annually. Not all of these tanks are sent to the front for the war in Ukraine, but remain in storage and in new military structures always oriented towards the West, said Breuer. Russia has also produced 4.152 million 152mm artillery shells in 2024, and not all of them have gone to war against Ukraine. Breuer stated that Russia is 'intentional' and 'stockpiling' for a possible future attack on Baltic countries. 'This is an assessment of analysts - (the attack may occur in 2029 - 24 Kanal) in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029, I would say no, it is not. Therefore, we must be able to fight today,' said Breuer. The minister named the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable points for an aggressor's attack. 'The Baltic countries are indeed very vulnerable to the Russians, are they not? And as soon as you're there, you really feel it... in the negotiations we're conducting there,' said Breuer. According to him, Estonians compare a possible war to being near a forest fire, where they 'feel the heat, see the flames, and smell the smoke', while in Germany 'it's probably just a little smoke on the horizon, and no more.' General Breuer said that this demonstrates different views among European states on the threat of a possible Russian attack.

**NATO Exercises Simulate Battle for Hostomel Airport**
During the NATO's 'Living Scythe' military exercises in Finland, troops simulated a battle for the airport of Hostomel, a key episode at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to Business Insider, the exercise included a rapid airborne operation to capture a strategic airbase, similar to Russia's attempt in February 2022. The scenario involved 'red team', consisting of Polish paratroopers and Finnish troops, landing on a forest airstrip, capturing it, and holding it to allow further transportation of heavy equipment and infantry. This element of the training directly reflected the actions of the Russian army, which attempted to establish control over the airport in Hostomel, a launchpad for the advance on Kyiv. Business Insider notes that NATO countries, especially those bordering Russia, carefully study the course of the war in Ukraine and take into account the combat experience of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in their own defense plans. Finland, which does not have its own airborne units, invited Polish paratroopers to participate in the exercise, which was seen as an important practical step in establishing the Finnish army as a new member of the Alliance. NATO officials acknowledge that these exercises, in part, are conducted because Russia attempted a similar operation at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It is worth noting that the battle for Hostomel is one of the key episodes at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, Russian paratroopers attacked the airport in Hostomel, trying to capture it to transport troops to Kyiv. Ukrainian forces initially repelled the attack, but on February 25, the Russians captured the airport. Fighting continued in the village itself, which became one of the hottest spots in the Kyiv region. On April 2, Ukrainian forces completely liberated Hostomel along with the entire Kyiv region.

According to Business Insider, the exercise included a rapid airborne operation to capture a strategic airfield, similar to Russia's attempt in February 2022. The 'red team', consisting of Polish paratroopers and Finnish troops, landed on a forest airstrip, seized it, and began to hold it to secure further transportation of heavy equipment and infantry. This element of the training directly reflected the actions of the Russian army, which attempted to establish control over the airport in Gostomel, a launchpad for the advance on Kyiv. As Business Insider notes, NATO countries, especially those bordering Russia, closely study the course of the war in Ukraine and consider the combat experience of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in their own defense plans. Finland, which does not have its own airborne units, invited Polish paratroopers to participate in the exercise, which was seen as an important practical step in establishing the Finnish army as a new member of the Alliance.

**Russia Prepares Forces for Potential Confrontation with NATO After Ukraine War**
Russia is preparing its forces for a potential confrontation with NATO after the end of the war in Ukraine, according to The Telegraph. Satellite images have revealed new rows of tents for troops, expanding military bases, and renovated Arctic airfields near the border with Finland, where Russia's expanded army may be relocated after the ceasefire in Ukraine. This development is seen as a potential precursor to a future war by the publication. Last year, Moscow restored the massive Leningrad military district to increase its military presence near Finland, Estonia, and Latvia, as noted in the article. Small brigades stationed there before the war in Ukraine have almost doubled in size and will become divisions of over 10,000 personnel. Additionally, the Kremlin is expanding its army recruitment, increasing arms production, and modernizing logistical infrastructure along the borders with Norway, Finland, and the Baltic states. Finnish defense officials claim that the new buildup is minor, but likely part of preparations for relocating tens of thousands of soldiers and military assets to the border and further north into the Arctic. They believe that the threat is real but not inevitable, and that they have up to five years before Moscow can build up its forces to a concerning level, assuming a full-scale war in Ukraine ends. General-Major Sami Nurmi, head of the strategic department of Finnish defense forces, stated that his country anticipated this and therefore joined NATO. He noted that the military is closely monitoring the situation, calling it preparation for the future when Russia returns its troops from Ukraine, but assured that there is no threat to Finland at present. However, NATO is concerned that Moscow is expanding its military presence further north to strengthen its control over resources in the Arctic region. Nurmi emphasized that the Arctic is an important theater of the future, and this will not change. 'We are very closely cooperating with our Arctic allies to assess Russia's plans,' he said.

**Russia Prepares for New Front in Europe Amid Ukraine Peace Talks**
As peace negotiations aim to end the war in Ukraine, Russia may be preparing to open a new front in Europe. According to recent satellite images confirmed by NATO officials, Russia has begun to reinforce its military bases in the Arctic region, including the base near Mourmansk, where Russian helicopters have returned after a two-decade absence. 'The Russian army has experienced significant expansion,' said a high-ranking Finnish official. 'After the war, the ground forces will likely be larger than before 2022. The planned reorganization of military districts clearly shows that they will prioritize areas facing NATO.' The official added that the increase in military forces in the region will occur after the conflict in Ukraine subsides. 'The augmentation of military forces in our neighborhood will occur after the calm of combat in Ukraine,' said the official. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has frozen financial contributions to the region, and the recent satellite images show a significant buildup of Russian military forces in the Arctic, including dozens of fighter jets at the Olenya airbase, just 160 kilometers from the Finnish border.

**Zelensky: Russia Preparing 'Something' in Belarus for Summer 2025**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia is preparing 'something' in Belarus for summer 2025, using military exercises as a cover. Russia can only prepare for one thing - an invasion. Since 2022, Belarus has been a potential threat to its neighbors, including Ukraine, the Baltic states, and Poland. The threat remains, and the situation is more critical during military exercises, as they can be used to prepare for an attack. It is essential to monitor the situation in Belarus, as it is unlikely that the exercises will be just that. The current Russian contingent in Belarus is not enough for any operations, with around 2,000 personnel, mostly radiotechnical units, airfield maintenance, and anti-aircraft units, as well as about 100 Wagner Group members. The Belarusian army is also not sufficient for any significant actions, and President Lukashenko has not provided Russia with permission to use the Belarusian army. It is necessary to observe the changes in the Russian contingent's numbers and whether Russia uses the exercises as a pretext to increase them. If there are 10,000 Russian troops in Belarus, it will not be a significant threat, and it will not be about large-scale invasions, but there will still be a risk of provocations and sabotage. If Russia increases the contingent to 20-30,000 people before the exercises, it will be a serious threat. This will not be about exercises, but about something else. Zelensky noted that in 2022, a 40,000-strong Russian group of troops was not enough to capture Kiev. Today, Russia has a catastrophic shortage of equipment, inexperienced troops, and serious problems with human resources and officer personnel. Therefore, 40,000 Russian troops will not be enough for a large-scale operation against Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia would need 80-100,000 troops, even more. Ukraine is ready to respond to any provocations from Belarus, and the situation will be different from 2022. The Ukrainian army will appear on Belarusian territory, and the situation will be more complex. The same applies to the Brest region, where a 10,000-strong Russian group of troops is stationed. This is not comparable to the Kursk or Belgorod groups, which have 60,000 and 55,000 troops, respectively. Therefore, the question is what these 10,000 troops will achieve. If Russia plans to invade one of the NATO countries, it will be a disaster, as NATO is slowly but working. Therefore, for Russia, an attack on one of the NATO countries will be a shot in the head. An attack on Ukraine in 2022 was irrational and illogical, as Russia was not prepared for such a war. Unpredictable and irrational steps by Putin are possible now, and he may try to create a 'stir' in one of the NATO countries. He may use such actions not only against the Baltic states or Poland but also against Scandinavian countries, Sweden, and Finland. If Putin sees that NATO is not working, he will continue the global war against all. He will also involve other dictatorships, and North Korean soldiers may appear not only in Ukraine but also in Estonia. The threat of a quick and complete capture of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia by Russia is real if it can gather such a force. Almost all these countries have good transportation infrastructure, and logistics work well, which Russia can use for rapid advancement and capture. 100,000 troops may be enough for Russia to enter Estonia, and it will be difficult for Russian troops to be expelled from there when NATO finally wakes up. Therefore, Russia has the opportunity to enter and capture part of certain NATO countries simultaneously. For example, to control the Suwalki Corridor, Russia would need to take control of Lithuania, block ports in Latvia and Estonia to prevent support for Lithuania by sea. Therefore, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia are all at risk, and Poland is a southern and southwestern flank that needs to be formed to maintain control over the corridor. So, even in four countries, Russia would need to conduct an operation to control the exit to the Kaliningrad region.

**Ukraine Demands European Troops 'Ready for Combat', Not Peacekeeping Forces**
Ukraine's negotiator, Igor Zhovkva, stated, 'We don't need a mere presence to demonstrate that Europe is present.' He emphasized that what Ukraine needs is troops 'ready for combat', not peacekeeping forces. Zhovkva added, 'It's not the quantity that matters (...) but also their willingness to fight, their willingness to defend, their willingness to be equipped and their willingness to understand that Ukraine is part of European security. We don't need peacekeeping missions.' He also said, 'All soldiers must be prepared to participate in real combat. That's what Ukrainians have been doing for three years, or even more. If you're a soldier, you're prepared to participate in combat.' Zhovkva made these comments in Paris ahead of a summit scheduled for Thursday, which will involve over 20 EU and NATO countries, aiming to provide 'security guarantees' to Kiev as part of a potential future peace agreement with Russia, sought by US President Donald Trump.

**Ukraine Demands European Troops 'Ready for Combat' for Security Guarantees**
Ukraine needs a 'serious' contribution from Europe with troops 'ready for combat', not peacekeeping forces, after the end of hostilities with Russia, said Volodimir Zelensky's advisor, Igor Zhovkva, to AFP on Wednesday. 'We don't need a mere presence to show that Europe is present,' Zhovkva said. 'It's not just about the quantity, but also their willingness to fight, their willingness to defend, their willingness to be equipped, and their willingness to understand that Ukraine is part of European security. We don't need peacekeeping missions,' he added. 'All soldiers should be prepared to participate in real battles. That's what Ukrainians have been doing for three years, or even more. If you're a soldier, you're prepared to participate in battles,' Zhovkva said. The 45-year-old negotiator, who participated in two rounds of talks with the United States in Saudi Arabia, spoke to AFP in Paris before a summit scheduled for Thursday, which will bring together more than 20 EU and NATO countries to provide 'security guarantees' to Kiev in the framework of a potential future peace agreement with Russia that US President Donald Trump is trying to achieve.

**France Prepares Special Task Force for Potential Deployment to Ukraine**
France is preparing a special task force for a potential deployment to Ukraine. The force will consist of experts and troops with limited tasks who will operate outside the combat zone, but will support the Ukrainians and show solidarity. However, the plan has raised concerns about the risk of escalation and a European war. The French President Emmanuel Macron has said that the force will not be used for combat, but rather for observation and support. However, the risk of Russian attacks on the force is still present, and the role of the US in the operation needs to be clarified. The US has said that NATO's defense guarantees will not apply to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, and no American troops will be deployed on the ground. The British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said that the UK is ready to contribute troops, but the size of the force is still unclear. The Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj has said that a minimum of 100,000 troops are needed to deter a new Russian attack, but many military experts believe that such a large force is unlikely to be deployed. The French military is preparing for a range of scenarios, including the use of drones and other advanced technology. The operation will require careful planning and coordination to avoid escalating the conflict. 'We have not intended to send combat troops to the front line,' Macron said. 'What we are thinking of is experts and troops with limited tasks who will stay outside the combat zone, but who can support the Ukrainians and show them our solidarity.'

**France Proposes Deploying European Troops Behind Ukrainian Lines**
France has proposed deploying European troops behind the lines in Ukraine, rather than on the future ceasefire line between Russia and Ukraine, according to the Financial Times. The US is pushing for a peacekeeping contingent to be deployed on the contact line, but behind the scenes, there are concerns that this scenario may be too risky, reports the Wall Street Journal. European officials are suggesting that troops be deployed in a supporting role, such as training Ukrainian military personnel, rather than on the front lines. At a summit in Paris earlier this week, leaders from Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, Italy, Denmark, and the EU, as well as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, met to discuss the issue. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her concerns about deploying troops to Ukraine, calling it the most complex and least effective option, according to the FT. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was irritated by the discussions and stated that the issue should not be discussed until a peace agreement is established. 'I'm even a bit annoyed by these debates, I want to say this quite openly,' Scholz said. He noted that the potential outcomes of peace talks, which have not yet taken place, are being discussed without the involvement of the Ukrainian government. Russia has also expressed opposition to the idea of deploying Western troops to Ukraine, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov predicting in 2022 that it would lead to a direct confrontation between Russian and NATO forces, which would be a major risk.

**Europe Secretly Works on Plan to Send Troops to Ukraine**
A group of European countries is secretly working on a plan to send troops to Ukraine to ensure the implementation of any potential peace agreement that would end the war started by Russia. According to The Associated Press, the driving force behind this plan are the UK and France, but details are still scarce as participating countries do not want to reveal their cards and give Russian President Vladimir Putin an advantage if he agrees to negotiate. The idea was first proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron in early 2024 and has since gained popularity. However, the specifics of the peacekeeping mission, including the number of troops and their composition, will depend on the conditions of the potential peace agreement and other factors. 'We are at a very early stage,' said Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur, adding that it is 'critically important' for European allies to understand the line of contact in Ukraine before developing a plan. Experts and officials warn that Europe must send a reliable and large contingent of troops to Ukraine, rather than a team of UN-style 'blue helmets.' 'This must be real force, so that the Russians know that if they ever experience it, they will be crushed,' said former US Army Europe commander Ben Hodges. French General Dominique Trinquand, a former head of the French military mission to the UN, estimated that organizing the operation with soldiers from around the world would take about a year. Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks emphasized the need to invest in Ukraine's defense industry and train Ukrainian soldiers. The AP also noted that Ukraine needs air support in addition to ground troops. However, it is clear that Europeans will struggle to gather large-scale forces and cannot do it quickly. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has advocated for international control over the line of contact, but Europeans disagree, citing the need for too many troops. Almost everyone agrees that some 'American support' is necessary. 'Any security guarantees must be backed by combat-capable European and non-European troops,' Austin said. If they are sent to Ukraine, they must be deployed as part of a mission not linked to NATO,' he added. The role of the US in this plan is unclear. The discussions about sending troops to Ukraine resumed in November 2024, after Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. On December 3, Radio Liberty reported, citing a high-ranking NATO official who spoke on condition of anonymity, that France and the UK are discussing possible options for ensuring Ukraine's security in the event of peace talks with Russia. One of these options is the deployment of troops from both countries along the line of contact to monitor the ceasefire regime. On December 19, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine supports France's initiative to deploy a military contingent on its territory as part of security guarantees and calls on international partners to join these efforts. On February 11, 2025, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the US will not send troops to Ukraine. He added that President Donald Trump hopes for a quick conclusion of a peace agreement. On February 13, Zelensky said that 100,000 peacekeepers are needed to ensure peace in Ukraine and that the military has developed a map showing the real need for foreign troops to ensure peace in the country. On February 14, the president said that Ukraine is ready for a peacekeeping contingent consisting only of Ukrainians. 'When we talk about a contingent, there was a question of whether we are ready for a European contingent. I said that we are ready for a contingent that consists even exclusively of Ukrainians,' he said in Munich.

**Zelenski Warns of Russian Invasion of NATO Country**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski has warned that Russia is preparing to deploy a significant number of troops in Belarus, which could be used for an invasion of a NATO country. Zelenski made these observations in an interview with The Economist, published on Wednesday. 'No one understands what war is until it comes to your home. I don't want to scare anyone. (But) it will come,' Zelenski said. 'As the world stops Putin today, slowly, he will come. And this is a fact,' he added. Citing Ukrainian intelligence services, Zelenski stated that Putin is forming 10 to 15 divisions, with a total of approximately 100,000 soldiers, which will be sent to Belarus for military exercises - as happened before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 'He will say it's a training, that it's exercises near the Ukrainian border, as it was before. But believe me, this is the preparation of a bridgehead for offensive actions. Who told you it will go to Ukraine? Who told you it won't go to Lithuania? To Poland?' Zelenski continued. 'Maybe he is preparing a bridgehead for a large number of troops and, simply, takes this bridgehead and goes in another direction. He goes to Poland, goes to Lithuania and occupies them. Why doesn't anyone believe that this will happen?' he added.
