**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Will AI Wipe Out Humanity? Indian-Origin Expert Issues Apocalyptic Warning**
Indian-origin computer science professor Subhash Kak has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to a dystopian future where the world population shrinks to 100 million by 2300 or 2380. Kak, who works at Oklahoma State University, predicts that AI will replace most jobs, making it difficult for people to raise children due to a shortage of employment opportunities. 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced. Literally everything, even decision-making in offices, will be replaced,' he said. This could lead to a collapse in birth rates, with people reluctant to have children who would grow up to be unemployed. Kak's prediction echoes that of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has long warned about the dangers of AI and declining birth rates. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reassured global leaders that history has shown that work does not disappear due to technology, but its nature changes and new types of jobs are created.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Professor Subhash Kak, a computer science expert, warns that AI could lead to a devastating impact on the human population, potentially shrinking it to 100 million by 2300. He attributes this to AI replacing jobs, making it difficult for people to have children who will grow up with employment opportunities. Kak points to AI as the culprit, saying it will replace 'everything', including decision-making in offices. He notes that demographers suggest the world population could collapse, and he agrees, stating that the world will be devastated. Kak also mentions that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who may be unemployed in the future. He refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential for humanity to go extinct.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to around 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that birth rates are already plummeting in many countries, including Europe, China, Japan, and Korea, due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. He also notes that the great cities of the modern world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to such a low number. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential risks of AI. He emphasizes that nobody really knows what the future holds, but a population collapse is already occurring.

**The Invention of the Fourth and Fifth Age**
The concept of the fourth and fifth age is emerging as the global population ages. According to the World Health Organization, in 2020, the population over 60 surpassed that of children under 5 for the first time. By 2050, there will be over 2 billion people over 60 worldwide. In the US, centenarians are expected to quadruple in the next three decades. Harvard researcher David Sinclair predicts that the first person to live to 150 is already alive, and that advances in AI will accelerate discoveries and help find cures for complex diseases. However, there is a lack of thought and writing on how new older adults will adopt new customs, what social rules they will establish, and how they will differ from each other. Journalist Dariela Sosa has launched an investigation into this topic, asking questions such as how families with four or five generations will function, and how inheritances will be transferred between generations. The concept of retirement may also be replaced by new rhythms of work, pause, and re-invention. The invention of the fourth and fifth age is underway, and we are creating a new universe of ideas, objects, and interpretations.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**The World's Population: A Complex Tapestry of Human Experience**
The world's population has reached over 8 billion people, with a total of around 107 billion people having lived on Earth throughout history. The first billion was reached in 1800, the second in the early 20th century, and the sixth in the year 2000. According to the UN, the population is expected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050. To put this number into perspective, if all people were lined up in a row, the line would be over 3.5 million kilometers long. The author of the article came across a website that displays real-time statistics, including the current population, births, and deaths, as well as the number of people doing various activities such as sleeping, working, eating, and using the internet. The author reflects on the diversity of human experiences and the fact that people are doing different things at the same time, from falling in love to experiencing pain and loss. The article concludes that every moment is important and that statistics can reveal the complexities of human life.

**Longevity experts reveal when humans will start living to 1,000**
Experts predict that humans could live to 1,000 or beyond through various technologies. Dr. Ian Pearson believes that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced tech to live forever, either in enhanced bodies or as digital minds. Ray Kurzweil predicts that AI will match human intelligence by 2029, leading to a merger between humans and machines that could result in immortality by 2045. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, argues that medical advances could make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live to 1,000 or beyond. Each of these breakthroughs offers a different path to immortality, and they're not just about living longer, but changing what it means to be human. 'By 2050, it will only really be for the rich and famous,' Pearson said, noting that these technologies will start expensive but become affordable by the 2060s for middle-class people. Kurzweil believes that AI will transform society, making necessities like food and housing cheaper and connecting human brains to the cloud via devices like Elon Musk's Neuralink. De Grey's approach, called 'integrative rejuvenation,' uses multiple treatments to fix cellular damage, like clearing out harmful waste or repairing DNA. 'Aging is a disease,' de Grey argued, saying that we should treat it like we treat cancer or diabetes.

**The Future of Longevity: Will Humans Live to be 100 and Beyond?**
According to gerontologists, the current generation of children will have a 50% chance of living to be 100 years old, and by the end of the century, most people will live to be 110-120 years old. This optimism is based on the fact that despite epidemics and wars, the average lifespan of people is increasing rapidly. According to the UN, in 1900, the average lifespan was 32 years, while in 2023, it was 73 years. In developed countries, the average lifespan is approaching 85 years. The main reasons for this progress are the reduction in child mortality, the successes of medicine, and the improvement in the quality of life. The number of centenarians (people over 90 years old) is increasing rapidly, with a six-fold increase in their share of the population since the mid-20th century. By 2050, 0.79% of the world's population is expected to reach the age of 90 or more, and by 2100, this number is expected to reach 2.14%. In countries with a high standard of living, such as the EU and Japan, the number of centenarians is expected to increase significantly, with over 10 million people in the EU and 6 million in Japan. The director of the Institute of Gerontology, Sergey Shcherbov, notes that people over 65 years old living today are significantly different from their counterparts 50-70 years ago, with better physical health, cognitive abilities, and a longer period of vitality. The example of 94-year-old Warren Buffett, who only began to feel his age after 90, is cited as an example of how people are living longer and healthier lives. However, it is also noted that there is a limit to human lifespan, and that the maximum lifespan of 110-120 years is considered to be the upper limit. The formula for longevity includes a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, social interaction, and mental stimulation. Researchers are also exploring the use of senolytics, anti-oxidants, and stem cells to promote longevity, but these approaches have not yet been proven to be effective in humans. The article concludes that while there is still much to be learned about the biology of aging, the current understanding of the factors that contribute to longevity provides a solid foundation for further research and development.

**230 Million People at Risk: The Collapse of the World's Ice Sheets**
A recent study has found that the world's ice sheets are on the brink of collapse, which could lead to a catastrophic rise in sea levels of several meters. The study, published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, warns that even if the world manages to limit global warming to 1.5°C, it may not be enough to save the ice sheets. The researchers found that even if the world maintains its current level of warming, which is 1.2°C, it could lead to a rapid collapse of the ice sheets and a catastrophic rise in sea levels. The ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica contain enough freshwater to raise global sea levels by about 65 meters, a scenario that is unlikely but should be considered to understand the full extent of the risks. The study found that the amount of ice lost from these ice sheets has increased by a factor of four since the 1990s, and they are currently losing around 370 billion tons of ice per year. The rapid collapse of the ice sheets is the main driver of sea level rise, and the annual rate of sea level rise has doubled over the past 30 years. Around 230 million people live in areas that are less than 1 meter above sea level, making them vulnerable to the consequences of the ice sheets' collapse. To avoid a rapid collapse of the ice sheets, the study's authors recommend limiting global warming to 1°C above pre-industrial levels, which would require a drastic reduction in fossil fuel burning. However, this goal seems unlikely given the current reliance on oil, coal, and gas. Many studies have shown that reaching 1.5°C is 'highly unlikely' to prevent the rapid collapse of the ice sheets, which would be irreversible on human timescales.

**Rising Sea Levels: $1 Trillion in Damages Per Year by 2100**
A recent study published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment warns that the rising sea levels due to climate change could cause $1 trillion in damages per year by the end of the century. The study, led by Chris Stokes, found that the rate of sea level rise has doubled in the past 30 years, reaching 10 centimeters. If this trend continues, the rate could double again by 2100, reaching 1 centimeter of sea level rise per year. Stokes warns that even if the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C is achieved, the sea level rise will still accelerate at a pace that will be difficult to adapt to. Without protection measures such as sea walls, a 20-centimeter sea level rise could generate $1 trillion in annual losses in the 136 largest coastal metropolises worldwide. Today, 230 million people live within 1 meter of sea level, and over 1 billion people live within 10 meters.

**By 2080, 90% of global population will live in cities, says urbanist**
According to global urbanist Greg Clark, by 2080, the world's population will have peaked at 10 billion, with nearly 90% living in cities. Clark emphasizes the need for adaptable and sustainable cities to accommodate population growth, and notes that once global numbers start to decline, there will be a need for strategies to redistribute the world population in ways that preserve the planet's well-being. Clark highlights the challenges of urban concentration, including inequality and environmental pollution, and outlines the need for innovation in food, housing, and transport sectors. He expresses optimism about the transport sector, but notes that the housing and food problems will require more ingenuity. Clark also emphasizes the need to reconcile cities with the natural world, and suggests that integrating nature into urban spaces could address many pressing challenges.

**Real number of people living on Earth may be far higher than we think**
New research suggests that the actual number of people living on Earth may be higher than the current count of 8.2 billion. According to Finnish researchers at Aalto University, traditional estimates may have omitted between 53 and 84 percent of rural populations from 1975 to 2010. The study analyzed data from over 300 dam projects in 35 countries and found that relocation records are usually accurate, which could indicate that the actual population is closer to 10 billion by 2080. As the study authors noted, 'This is remarkable, as countless studies have employed these datasets without questioning their accuracy in the rural domain.'

In November 2022, the UN celebrated the estimated 8 billion people on Earth, but a new study suggests that we may have been counting incorrectly. According to the study, the human population did not reach the replacement rate in 2023 and is expected to peak at the end of the century before declining. However, the accuracy of these estimates has been questioned for some time, and this study adds to the debate by suggesting that we may have made a mistake in our counting. As one might say, 'the numbers don't add up'.

**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**
British paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species. 'If we make a concerted effort to expand into the Universe, we could 'live -- potentially -- for millions of years,' he says. However, he warns that if we don't take action, 'there might be no one left on the Earth for you to wave back to.'

**From Y2K Fears to Artificial Intelligence: How the World Has Changed in a Quarter Century**
According to the United Nations (UN), the world population was 6.1 billion in mid-2001, 8 billion in November 2022, and 8.2 billion in July 2024. By the end of the 21st century, in December 2100, the Earth's population is expected to reach 10.2 billion. Demographic data allows us to understand the demand for services and goods, as well as the environmental impact of our daily activities. Looking back at the significant events of the past few decades, we see how much progress has been made in improving living conditions and social, economic, technological, and political changes that will shape the third millennium. The start of the 21st century in 2001 marked the end of the fear of the Y2K bug, which threatened to collapse computer systems of most public and private services. Although the Y2K bug was only a threat, the world has experienced significant events such as the 9/11 attack in New York, a devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid technological advancements leading to artificial intelligence, promising medical breakthroughs, and the emergence of new digital native generations.

**World Population Expected to Peak at 10.3 Billion by 2100**
The world's population is expected to peak at 10.3 billion by 2100, with an 80% chance of reaching this number, according to the United Nations (UN). After that, the population will start to decline. This is a more pessimistic prediction than 10 years ago, when it was estimated that the peak population would be over 12 billion. The UN's report, 'Perspectivas da População Mundial em 2024', states that many countries have already reached their peak population, including 63 nations such as Germany, Russia, China, and Japan. The report also predicts that 48 countries, including Brazil, will reach their peak population between 2025 and 2054. In contrast, 126 countries, including the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan, are expected to continue growing after 2054. According to the UN, despite the predicted decline in population, life expectancy is expected to increase. 'In the last three decades, mortality rates have decreased and life expectancy has increased significantly,' said the UN. 'After a brief decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy at birth is increasing again, reaching 73.3 years in 2024, up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.'
