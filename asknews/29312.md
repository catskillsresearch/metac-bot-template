**WHO Warns of New Covid Variant with Increased Cases and Hospitalizations**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has begun to closely monitor a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, known as NB.1.8.1, after detecting an increase in cases globally. According to the latest report from the organization, this new variant, identified for the first time in January of this year, is already responsible for more than 10% of all infections and is dominant in territories such as Hong Kong or China. However, it also raises concerns at the WHO due to its high incidence in tourist nodes, such as Egypt, the Maldives, or Thailand; and after being detected in several US states, such as Virginia, California, or New York. Although it remains behind LP.8.1 -- the dominant variant, with a 39% prevalence and in decline -- the advance of NB.1.8.1 has been rapid, as it only represented 2.5% a month ago. The WHO considers that the current risk to public health remains low, as the variant spreads easily but presents only 'slightly higher' immunological escape compared to LP.8.1. 'The current data do not indicate that this variant causes a more severe disease than other variants in circulation,' explains the WHO. Some countries in the Western Pacific, where the new variant is circulating more intensely, have reported increases in cases and hospitalizations. Thailand is one of the most affected countries, as well as India, where the number of active cases has exceeded 3,000, tripling the confirmed cases from a week ago, according to data published by the Indian Ministry of Health. The Indian government seeks to avoid a repeat of the dramatic situation the country experienced during the second wave of the virus in 2021, when more than 400,000 infections and 4,000 daily deaths were recorded, with a collapsed healthcare system. However, there is no evidence that it causes a more severe disease than other strains currently in circulation. In Spain, the number of cases has increased in the last week. The National Center for Epidemiology has reported, through the Respiratory Infection Surveillance System (SIVIRA), that in the last week there were 39.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to 32.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the previous week. However, there is no information linking the increase in cases in Spain to the new variant NB.1.8.1.

**New COVID-19 Variant Emerges in India: What You Need to Know**
The Indian government has announced the discovery of a new variant of the coronavirus, known as NB.1.8.1, which is a sub-variant of the Omicron variant. The first case was reported in the state of Tamil Nadu in April 2025, and the sample was sent to the INSACOG alliance for genomic sequencing as part of efforts to track the mutations. According to the Indian Express, the World Health Organization has classified this variant as 'under surveillance', which means it has mutations that could potentially affect the virus's behavior, such as its transmissibility or ability to evade immunity, but there is not yet enough evidence to determine its severity. Dr. 'The changes in the spike protein may increase its transmissibility, but further studies are needed to confirm this.' The symptoms of NB.1.8.1 are similar to those of other Omicron variants, with patients experiencing mild respiratory symptoms such as sore throat, cough, runny nose, and a slight fever. So far, there has been no increase in hospitalizations or deaths related to this variant. As of mid-May 2025, more than 518 genomic sequences of this variant have been reported in 22 countries, accounting for over 10% of all sequences analyzed during that period. Despite this spread, experts do not see it as an immediate threat, but rather emphasize the importance of close monitoring. Although there is no specific vaccine for this variant, virologists believe that current vaccines, especially those that boost and target Omicron, are still effective in reducing the severity of symptoms and preventing complications. Additionally, pre-existing immunity plays a role in reducing the severity of the infection. Doctors recommend that people, especially those at higher risk such as the elderly and those with chronic diseases, continue to follow preventive measures, including: Wearing masks in crowded areas Updating vaccinations according to health guidelines So far, NB.1.8.1 does not appear to be a higher risk than its predecessors, but its rapid emergence and spread emphasize the importance of continued surveillance and preparedness. Adherence to vaccination and prevention remains an effective tool in facing any new variant.

**Covid-19: New Variant NB.1.8.1 Raises Concerns, But Experts Remain Calm**
The new Covid-19 variant NB.1.8.1, originating from Asia, has raised concerns in Europe about a potential new wave that could disrupt the summer season. However, medical professionals are reassuring, stating that France is better prepared than in 2020. According to Antoine Flahault, director of the Global Health Institute in Geneva, NB.1.8.1 is a sub-variant of Omicron with increased transmissibility and ability to evade natural or vaccine-induced immunity. This could lead to a rapid spread this summer, a time of increased international travel. Nevertheless, experts emphasize that summer waves are generally less severe than winter ones, with fewer hospitalizations and deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirms this analysis, stating that there is no indication that NB.1.8.1 causes more severe forms of the disease in healthy individuals. Vaccines currently available continue to protect effectively against severe Covid-19. Healthcare professionals are also calm, with Jean-Marie Guillermin, vice-president of the Order of Pharmacists in Occitanie, stating, 'We are much better prepared than in 2020. The state has significant stocks of medical supplies, supply chains can be quickly reactivated, and healthcare professionals are now well-coordinated.' However, there is a concern about the low reporting of epidemiological data, with Jean-Marie Guillermin noting that Covid tests are now rare due to a lack of reimbursement, leading to a lack of visibility on the virus's real circulation.

**WHO Monitors New COVID-19 Variant NB.1.8.1 as Cases and Hospitalizations Rise**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 as 'under surveillance' due to an increase in cases and hospitalizations. Identified on January 22, 2025, this variant is a derivative of the omicron strain and has been detected in several countries, including tourist destinations such as Egypt, Thailand, and the Maldives. According to the WHO, the new strain is responsible for more than 10% of all infections and has become the dominant strain in Hong Kong and China. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US have also identified cases in several states, including New York, California, Arizona, Ohio, Washington, and Rhode Island. The WHO states that the current risk to the population is low and that approved vaccines are expected to remain effective against this variant, both in symptomatic and severe cases. Lara Herrero, a professor and leader of research in Virology and Infectious Diseases at the University of Griffith, said that the new strain could infect cells with greater efficiency than previous strains due to multiple mutations. 'It is possible that a person infected with NB.1.8.1 has a greater probability of transmitting the virus to another person, compared to previous variants', she explained. 'The evidence so far suggests that NB.1.8.1 could spread more easily and partially evade immunity derived from previous infections or vaccination. These factors could explain its increase in sequencing data', she concluded.

**Germany Experiences Rise in Respiratory Infections**
Germany is currently experiencing a rise in respiratory infections such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the 7-day incidence of COVID-19 cases is 0.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, with a slight increase in hospitalizations. The flu season is also underway, with a 7-day incidence of 0.36 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. RSV cases, on the other hand, have decreased. The healthcare system is experiencing increased pressure, with a 230-minute average stay in emergency departments and an 80.4% occupancy rate on intensive care units. 'The current situation is not unusual,' said the RKI, 'but it is still a challenge for the healthcare system.'

**MGMGH opens Covid-19 ward but no cases in district yet**
The Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) has opened a 12-bed Covid-19 isolation ward as a precautionary measure, despite no confirmed cases of the disease in the district so far. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, NB.1.8.1, is more transmissible but does not typically cause severe disease. The Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine has instructed health officers to step up surveillance of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) due to an increase in fever cases across the state. 'Covid-19 is now considered endemic, and many cases are being identified incidentally through broad respiratory virus testing,' said the WHO. The hospital's move is a proactive measure to prepare for potential cases.

**New COVID Variant Confirmed In CA: Here's What To Know**
A new COVID variant has been confirmed in California, but data from the CDC shows that the number of emergency doctor visits resulting in a COVID diagnosis has remained relatively consistent with last year. There were significantly fewer COVID-related deaths in 2025 compared to 2024, with 1,900 deaths in California from January to May 2024 and just over 742 in the same timeframe in 2025. The new variant is more transmissible than the current dominant strain, LP.8.1, and could exploit waning immunity, according to Dr. Todd Ellerin, chief of infectious diseases at South Shore Health. 'Remember, we've seen summer surges,' he said. 'One thing that COVID has done is it's been able to surge in the summer, and it's been able to surge in the winter, and that's very different than respiratory viruses we've dealt with in the past.' However, it's too early to know if this variant will lead to a summer surge.

**US: Flu surpasses COVID as California’s deadliest respiratory illness**
For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza has surpassed COVID-19 as the deadliest respiratory illness in California. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 44% of adults and 46% of children have received flu shots this season, leading to a surge in flu cases. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco, said, 'Influenza seems to be everywhere.' As of February 1, flu test positivity rates hit 27.8%, surpassing cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), COVID-19, and the common cold. Nationwide, the CDC estimates that there were at least 29 million flu cases, 370,000 hospitalizations, and 16,000 deaths during the 2024-25 flu season. Experts warn that the simultaneous circulation of two influenza A strains, H1N1 and H3N2, increases the risk of sequential infections. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said, 'Immunity to one of them does not give you immunity to the other in any sort of durable way.' Public health officials stress that it's not too late to get vaccinated, although it takes about two weeks for the vaccine to provide full protection.

**Flu surpasses Covid as US' deadliest respiratory illness**
For the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began, influenza has surpassed Covid as the deadliest respiratory illness in California, with hospitals struggling to cope with the surge in flu cases. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 44% of adults and 46% of children received flu shots this season, contributing to the spike in cases. 'Our hospital is full to the brim,' said Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. As of February 1, flu test positivity rates hit 27.8%, while RSV cases dropped to 5% and Covid remained at 2.4%. The CDC estimates that there were at least 29 million flu cases, 370,000 hospitalisations, and 16,000 deaths during the 2024-25 flu season. Medical professionals are concerned about the simultaneous circulation of two influenza A strains, which increases the risk of sequential infections. 'It's not too late to get vaccinated,' said John Lynch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington Medicine, 'although it takes about two weeks for the vaccine to provide full protection.' Experts predict high flu activity for at least another month to six weeks, with the possibility of an additional wave of influenza B cases in the spring.

**An intense flu season is filling hospitals with severely ill patients**
The US is experiencing an unusually intense and severe flu season, with hospitalization rates surpassing those seen during the Covid-19 pandemic. Doctors are seeing a high number of patients with severe complications, including neurologic complications in children, such as brain swelling and seizures. Adults are also experiencing unexpected levels of pneumonia caused by flesh-eating superbug bacteria. Dr. John Lynch, an infectious disease specialist, said, 'Fifty percent positivity is really high. Really mind-blowing.' The CDC reports that there have been 14.4 flu hospitalizations for every 100,000 people in the US, slightly higher than the rate of Covid-19 hospitalizations during the height of the Delta wave. Weekly deaths from flu have also surpassed those from Covid for the first time, with 1,302 deaths from flu in the last two weeks of January. Doctors warn of brain complications in kids, with Dr. Keith Van Haren saying, 'There’s something happening. This is really unusual, what we’re seeing.' The flu season is expected to last for at least another month to six weeks, and experts recommend getting vaccinated, cleaning indoor air, and taking antiviral drugs early on to lower the risk of severe infection.

**Major hospital with millions of patients brings back mask mandates**
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is reinstating mask mandates in all of its hospitals and outpatient areas due to 'substantial levels of respiratory illness due to several viruses.' The decision comes as the US sees a surge in cases of flu, Covid, and RSV, with Pennsylvania being one of the states with 'very high' levels of respiratory illness. According to the CDC, there have been between 24 million and 41 million flu cases, up to 18 million doctor visits, between 310,000 and 650,000 hospitalizations, and 13,000 flu deaths since October 2024. RSV has been responsible for 2 million to 4 million doctor visits, up to 230,000 hospitalizations, and up to 14,000 deaths during the 2024 to 2025 season. UPMC, which treats millions of patients, has more than 40 hospitals across the country and employs approximately 100,000 people. The system intakes about 350,000 admissions, has 6.7 million outpatient visits, and 1 million emergency visits per year. Dr. Nathan Money, a pediatric hospitalist at Intermountain Primary Children's, warned that many hospitals are not equipped to handle the surge in respiratory illnesses, particularly in pediatric patients.

**US Faces Second Wave of Influenza with Record Hospitalizations**
The United States is facing a second wave of influenza that has reached levels of contagion not seen in the last 15 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 8% of medical visits last week were due to respiratory illnesses, a record since the 2009-2010 swine flu pandemic. This massive increase has led to a saturation of hospitals and an urgent call for vaccination. The CDC data reflects an alarming scenario: nearly 50,000 people were hospitalized with the virus in just one week. During this flu season, which runs from October to May, there have been 24 million cases, with 310,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 deaths. Additionally, 32% of flu tests have been positive, a significant increase compared to the 18% peak of the previous season. New York is one of the 45 states classified with 'high' or 'very high' flu activity. According to the state's Department of Health, last week there were over 53,000 positive cases and 3,000 hospitalizations, reflecting an increase compared to the previous week. The impact of the flu has been so severe that schools in at least 10 states have been forced to temporarily close due to the large number of students and staff infected. In New York City, 2 children recently died due to complications related to the flu, bringing the total number of pediatric deaths in the season to 3. At the state level, the number is 9, while nationwide, there have been 57 infant deaths due to influenza. In light of the growing wave of contagions, the city's Department of Health has emphasized the importance of vaccination, especially for children under 5 years old, adults over 65, and pregnant women. Vaccination remains the best tool to reduce the spread of the virus and minimize severe complications. Health authorities also recommend taking additional measures, such as wearing masks in enclosed spaces, frequent handwashing, and avoiding close contact with sick people. As the flu continues to spread, other respiratory viruses show signs of decline. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have decreased by 16% in New York. Similarly, Covid-19 cases, which had been increasing in most of the country, now show a downward trend in several regions. The large influx of patients with flu has put pressure on hospitals and clinics across the country. Emergency rooms are experiencing prolonged wait times, and medical staff are facing an extreme workload due to the increase in hospitalizations. Some hospitals have had to reschedule non-urgent surgeries to attend to the demand for patients with severe flu symptoms. In several regions, authorities have implemented emergency plans to manage the health crisis. Beyond government and medical actions, the community plays a key role in preventing the spread of the virus. It is essential that people with flu-like symptoms avoid attending work or school to prevent spreading the virus. Additionally, it is recommended to follow basic hygiene practices, such as covering the mouth when coughing and disinfecting frequently used surfaces. Health experts warn that the flu season has not yet reached its peak and that it is possible that cases will continue to increase in the coming weeks. It is expected that the federal government and state health departments will continue to strengthen vaccination campaigns and adopt strategies to contain the outbreak. The call to action is clear: get vaccinated, maintain good hygiene habits, and be aware of the warning signs of severe complications. With a joint effort, it is possible to reduce the impact of this second wave of flu and protect vulnerable communities.

**US Experiences Second Peak in Influenza Cases This Season**
The United States is experiencing a second peak in influenza cases this season, with a 30% positive test rate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been at least 24 million cases, 310,000 hospitalizations, and 13,000 deaths due to influenza. The cumulative hospitalization rate of around 64 cases per 100,000 people, as of February 1, is the highest at this stage of the season in the past 7 years. Influenza activity is high or high in all states except six. Dr. Sarah Nosal, a primary care physician in the Bronx, New York, emphasizes the importance of isolation to prevent the spread of the disease. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says their emergency department is currently filled with patients suffering from respiratory illnesses, most of whom have influenza. Distinguishing between influenza and COVID-19 can also be crucial in determining treatment and managing symptoms. COVID-19 can cause a more severe illness in certain cases, according to the CDC. Patients who test positive for COVID-19 may also be at risk for long-term COVID. Both viruses also have different antiviral treatment options. While most people will recover within a few days without medication, antiviral medications like Tamiflu and Paxlovid are more effective when given within the first two days of symptoms, according to the CDC.

**Study Finds COVID-19 Infection Associated With More Severe Disease Compared With Flu, RSV**
A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that COVID-19 infection was associated with more severe disease outcomes compared to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during the 2022-2023 respiratory virus season. However, the differences between the three infections were not as pronounced during the 2023-2024 season. The study, which included data from US veterans, found that COVID-19 was associated with higher 30-day hospitalization and mortality risks compared to influenza and RSV. The researchers noted that the differences in disease severity were not observed among vaccinated individuals. According to the CDC, respiratory illness activity in the US is currently high, with COVID-19 and RSV activity decreasing, but influenza activity remaining elevated. The CDC also notes that vaccination coverage for influenza and COVID-19 is low among adults and children, but has increased for older adults. RSV vaccinations remain low for US adults.

**Flu, RSV, COVID-19, and More: Updates on the 2025 Respiratory Virus Landscape**
The US is experiencing a surge in respiratory viruses, including norovirus, RSV, influenza, and COVID-19, resulting in hospitalizations, school closures, and other disruptions. According to Asha Shah, MD, director of infectious diseases and epidemiologist at Stamford Hospital, 'This is not new. I know the media really tries to make this story every winter, but even prior to the pandemic, this is respiratory virus season.' The surge in viral cases is not uncommon or a surprise to health care providers, as every year during the colder winter months, cases of these viruses surge due to more time spent indoors with others. The 'quad-demic' has been reported, with a 350% increase in norovirus cases in New Jersey compared to 2023. Rates of RSV are declining, while influenza rates are up, with 44 states having high or very high virus activity. COVID-19 cases have risen post-holidays, with wastewater levels now high, especially in the Midwest. The CDC reports growing activity in the Southeast, West, and parts of the Northeast, though test positivity is holding at 5.4%. Emergency visits remain low but are highest in young children and older adults, while hospitalizations and deaths, though declining, remain most common in seniors. Shah emphasizes the importance of staying informed and vigilant, and pharmacists play a vital role in patient education and prevention strategies. Proper hygiene, including hand washing, is essential to prevent the spread of germs and bacteria. Staying up to date on vaccinations, recognizing early symptoms, and understanding when to seek medical care can help reduce the burden on health care systems.
