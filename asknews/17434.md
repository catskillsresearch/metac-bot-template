**AI Energy Consumption to Surpass Bitcoin Mining by 2025, Study Warns**
According to a new study, the energy consumption of AI systems is growing faster than expected and could surpass that of Bitcoin mining by the end of 2025. By then, AI will account for almost half of the global energy consumption of data centers, up from 20% currently. The study's author, Alex de Vries-Gao, criticizes the lack of transparency from tech companies about the actual energy costs of AI applications. He draws parallels with the cryptocurrency industry, where the 'bigger is better' approach has led to environmental degradation. The study warns that the US market could see a 25% increase in energy consumption from AI, Bitcoin mining, and traditional data centers by 2030. However, it's not just the amount of energy that matters, but also its source. For example, a search query in West Virginia generates almost twice as much CO2 emissions as the same query in California, where renewable energy dominates. Despite progress in efficiency and sustainability, the study finds the situation alarming. The global energy consumption of data centers could reach the level of Japan's total energy demand by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency. Additionally, the increasing demand for specialized chips and other components drives up the demand for rare earth materials, while water consumption for cooling systems is also on the rise. In some regions, the establishment of data centers and their water consumption is already in conflict with the needs of the local population.

**The End of the World: AI Predictions and the Risks We Face**
According to AI predictions, the end of the world could be cold, silent, and very far away. However, there are also more immediate risks caused by humans. The AI suggests that the most probable long-term scenario is the 'great freezing' or 'death by heat' of the universe, where all stars burn out, the universe expands to the point where energy is no longer usable, and the second law of thermodynamics is completely dissipated. This process will occur in millions of years, so it's not something that will be seen by anyone alive today. The AI also warns of more urgent risks caused by humans, such as climate collapse, nuclear war, and uncontrolled AI. These risks can be prevented by promoting international cooperation, establishing legal and ethical frameworks for AI, investing in green technology and renewable energy, and creating global institutions to regulate advanced AI systems. The AI notes that these scenarios are not just fictional, but are based on scientific data and analysis. It also recognizes that some of these scenarios, such as a pandemic or a nuclear winter, are not entirely impossible. The AI concludes that knowledge, cooperation, and immediate action are the best tools to prevent a premature end to humanity.

**Is the AI Bubble on the Brink of Collapse?**
The AI market appears to be booming, with tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft investing $246 billion in 2024, a 63% increase from 2023. However, some researchers, such as Italian philosopher Luciano Floridi, predict that the market could soon collapse, likening it to a 'technological bubble' similar to the cryptocurrency bubble of a few years ago. Floridi describes the AI market as a 'bubble ready to burst.' In this episode of Prophétie, journalists Blaise Mao and Emilie Echaroux explore whether the AI economy will indeed collapse and if we should say goodbye to ChatGPT and other AI systems. 'The AI market appears to be more flourishing than ever,' Mao and Echaroux say, 'but some experts warn that it could be on the verge of a crash.'

**Two AI Winters and a Neural Spring: The Case for Patience in R&D**
The current AI boom is built on decades of fundamental research, often unfashionable and invisible. The AI community has experienced two major 'winters' or periods where interest dried up, funding disappeared, and the field was written off as over-promised science fiction. However, real, gritty research and development (R&D) brought us out of those winters. Advances in hardware, materials science, data storage, and sensing technologies (1974-80) and the quiet perseverance of researchers in neural networks (1987-93) laid the groundwork for progress. The Australian Government's Strategic Examination of Research and Development (SERD) is asking important questions about investing in the future, but AI is the perfect case study in why we can't afford to treat research like a short-term lever for growth. We need to fund basic research, value scientific curiosity, and support the research ecosystem through the winters, not just the boom times. 'The real miracle is that anyone kept the faith long enough to get us here,' as the article notes.

**Will There Be a Third 'Winter' of AI?**
The author believes that a third 'winter' of artificial intelligence (AI) is possible, similar to the two previous 'winters' in the 1970s and 1980s. The current AI boom, led by language models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, may be followed by a period of disillusionment. The author notes that the previous 'winters' occurred when expectations were inflated and reality failed to meet them. Today, the author sees signs of a bubble forming, including IPOs of companies with no product, startups without business models, and numerous 'assistants' based on OpenAI's API. When the bubble bursts, funding will decrease, large companies will reassess their budgets, and many startups will disappear. However, unlike previous 'winters', the author believes that AI will not collapse completely, as it has become an integral part of the infrastructure. Instead, the market will transition from a hype phase to a mature phase, with a focus on compact open-source models, specialized AI tools, and integration of AI into real-world processes. The author predicts that the first signs of this 'autumn' will appear within 18-24 months.

**'This might be the boom that doesn't go bust': Jim Cramer remains optimistic about AI because of Big Tech's deep pockets**
CNBC's Jim Cramer remains optimistic about the artificial intelligence boom, citing the deep pockets of Big Tech leaders. He said, 'This might be the boom that doesn't go bust, because the players are so well capitalized it simply doesn't have to end that way.' Cramer acknowledged concerns about data center proliferation and the potential for a bust, but noted that some companies may 'make out like bandits.' He referenced a Deutsche Bank analysis that found some private sector booms were financed with debt and stock issuance, but countered that the AI boom consists of companies with 'unlimited firepower.' Cramer also disputed the idea that the AI craze is a typical private sector boom, citing the technology's vast potential across various arenas and likening it to the industrial revolution. He said, 'It's just too early to find out the winners because everything's so new and we don't know what these companies are really working on.' Cramer's comments come as Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft plan to spend up to $320 billion on AI technologies and data centers in 2025, up from $230 billion in 2024.

**The 'Winter of AI' Prediction Was Premature: Experts Now See a 'Spring' Ahead**
Just 14 months ago, experts like Rodney Brooks, a renowned robotics and AI expert, warned of an impending 'winter of AI', a period of stagnation following the enthusiasm for this technology. However, the reality has shattered that theory. Brooks criticized the language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, saying they 'lack a real understanding of the world': 'They have no underlying model of reality. They are linguistic correlations, not intelligence.' He believed that these advancements were not bringing us closer to General Artificial Intelligence (AGI). But 2024 came and went, and the technological landscape has changed, making us think that the predictions of a 'winter' were premature. Instead of stagnating, AI has continued to evolve, driven by growing business demand and several key factors: the infrastructure, accumulated talent, and economic incentives were aligned to prevent a stagnation. Additionally, the exponential nature of AI has proven to be difficult to anticipate. Models that train faster, consume less, and learn more have led to significant improvements in weekly, even daily, iterations. In summary, the winter that Brooks predicted may have been suspended in favor of an early spring. The contrast between the expectations of a few months ago and the current situation illustrates the vertigo of living in a moment of accelerated technological change: we are not facing a simple extension of the LLMs' fashion, but a turning point in their evolution.

**AI Predicts Alarming Scenarios for the End of the World**
The ChatGPT AI model from Open AI has made alarming predictions about the end of the world, sparking concerns worldwide. The AI has analyzed historical, environmental, and social patterns to predict potential threats that could lead to the end of the world. One of the most terrifying predictions is the impact of extreme climate change. Models suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the Earth could face unprecedented natural disasters, such as massive floods, endless droughts, and the disappearance of fundamental ecosystems. The AI also warns that climate change could destabilize global economies and force massive population displacements, leading to unprecedented social and political conflicts. Another predicted scenario is the impact of an asteroid. While the risk of a catastrophic event of this type has been a recurring theme in scientific predictions, the AI has identified that 99% of the most dangerous asteroids remain undetected, which could result in a future apocalyptic event if a massive object were to collide with the Earth without warning. A nuclear war is also a highlighted factor in the AI's projections. According to the models, the irresponsible use of nuclear arms or a large-scale conflict between nuclear powers could lead to a nuclear winter, where the darkness of the atmosphere caused by dust and soot blocking sunlight would drastically reduce global temperatures. This scenario would end most life on the planet and could trigger a total collapse of civilization.

**The Final Rally, Deflationary Bust, and the AI-Driven Disruption of the 2030s**
Faisal Aftab's speculative market outlook predicts a final rally in the markets before a deflationary bust in late 2025, followed by a structural upheaval in the 2030s driven by inflation, technological disruption, and systemic unemployment. The convergence of AI, blockchain, and automation will fundamentally transform the global economy, displacing labor and eroding traditional industrial-age structures. Aftab suggests that markets will experience a 25-50% upside in the next few months before the peak, but this rally will give way to a sharp deflationary bust. He also predicts that Bitcoin will become a monetary hedge in the 2030s, and that hard assets such as gold, silver, and commodities will become critical during the inflationary recovery phase.

**The AI Winter: A Threat to the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has experienced periods of high enthusiasm followed by disappointment, stagnation, and coldness, known as 'AI winters'. During these periods, interest and funding for AI research decrease dramatically, causing a slowdown in technological development. Historically, two AI winters have been identified in the last 50 years, both marked by unfulfilled expectations. The first AI winter occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, characterized by exaggerated expectations inspired by science fiction. However, real progress did not meet the promises, leading to a significant decrease in funding. The second AI winter occurred between the late 1980s and early 1990s, after an initial resurgence of interest, expectations again surpassed the achievements. Despite these discouraging events, the victory of Deep Blue, IBM's supercomputer, over chess champion Gary Kasparov marked a milestone, demonstrating the potential of AI and laying the groundwork for its future development. Today, we are in a virtuous era for AI, with autonomous vehicles (Tesla), navigation assistants (Google Maps or Waze), virtual assistants (Siri), and generative systems like ChatGPT, all relying on AI. However, some experts warn of the possibility of a third AI winter due to a combination of factors, including the fear of AI's impact on society, job loss, privacy invasion, and lack of transparency. According to the Deloitte report '2024 Gen Z & Millennial Survey', 60% of young people from Gen Z and Millennials fear that AI-driven automation will eliminate jobs. Additionally, only a minority plan to train in AI immediately, which could limit their ability to adapt to changes in the labor market. AI relies on large volumes of data to train its models, and if the data is not representative or of poor quality, progress could stagnate. Excessive regulations could limit innovation and the development of new technologies. The European Union's AI Law, which came into effect on August 1, 2024, is the first global regulation to govern AI. The law aims to ensure that AI systems are secure, transparent, and respectful of fundamental rights, while promoting innovation in the European single market. The legislation adopts a risk-based approach, classifying AI systems into levels ranging from unacceptable risk (prohibited) to limited risk, which only requires transparency.
