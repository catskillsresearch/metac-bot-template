**The Oceans in Peril: Rising Temperatures, Ocean Acidification, and Decreased Oxygen Levels**
The world's oceans are facing numerous challenges due to human activities, including rising temperatures, ocean acidification, and decreased oxygen levels. According to a study, the oceans have absorbed 90% of the excess heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rapid increase in ocean temperatures, with a rate of increase twice as fast as in the 1960s. The study also found that the average temperature of the ocean surface in 2024 broke the previous record set in 2023. The oceans cover 70.8% of the Earth's surface and play a crucial role in regulating the climate. However, they are facing numerous threats, including rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and decreased oxygen levels, which are affecting marine life and coastal communities. The study suggests that if global warming continues, the rate of sea level rise will accelerate to 1 meter per century by 2100, affecting 230 million people living in coastal areas. The study also highlights the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the effects of climate change.

**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Climate Change Adds a Month of Extreme Heat to 4 Billion People, Report Finds**
A new scientific report reveals that human-induced climate change has added a full month of extreme heat to approximately 4 billion people, or 49% of the world's population, from May 2024 to May 2025. The analysis, conducted by researchers from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central, and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre, found that 67 heatwaves occurred during this period, all of which were directly influenced by climate change. The report defines 'extreme heat' as days where temperatures exceed 90% of the values recorded at the same location between 1991 and 2020. The regions most affected by this phenomenon include the Caribbean, where the island of Aruba recorded 187 days of extreme heat, a 142-day increase from expected levels in the absence of climate change. Other regions, such as Central Asia, South Sudan, and the Mediterranean basin, also experienced unprecedented heatwaves that would not have occurred without the effects of global warming. The report highlights that climate change has doubled the number of extreme heat days in 195 countries and territories worldwide, leading to increased mortality and disease rates, crop damage, and strain on energy and healthcare systems. The researchers emphasize that heatwaves are among the most destructive natural disasters, often receiving inadequate media coverage. Professor Frederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and a contributor to the report, stated, 'Heatwaves kill silently. People don't die in the streets, but in their homes or hospitals, and often their deaths are not linked to the heat.' The report warns that continued reliance on fossil fuels will exacerbate these phenomena, with each degree of temperature increase increasing the likelihood of more severe and prolonged heatwaves. It calls for urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and enhance climate resilience, particularly in vulnerable and fragile communities that suffer disproportionately. This report comes at a time when many countries are preparing for a summer that is expected to be one of the hottest in history, highlighting the urgent need to accelerate international efforts to combat climate change and mitigate its devastating impacts on human and environmental health.

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Scientists Predict Sea Level Rise and Irreversible Consequences Due to Glacier Melting**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if current warming trends continue, three-quarters of the Earth's glacier mass will disappear by 2100, causing a 23 cm sea level rise and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the journal Science, highlights the situation in Alaska, where up to 69% of the glaciers could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest glacier reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even in the best-case scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, and global losses would be 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers the period until the glaciers reach a state of 'equilibrium' - in the case of Alaska, this would take 330 years. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 glaciers. The scientists believe that even if warming stops, glaciers will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia'. They consider the current decade critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Scientists in Panic: Planet Faces Catastrophic Consequences Due to Ice Loss**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if the current rate of warming continues, three-quarters of the Earth's ice mass will disappear by 2100, resulting in a 23 cm rise in sea levels and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the Science journal, notes that the situation in Alaska is particularly alarming, where up to 69% of the ice could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest ice reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even under an optimal scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, with global losses reaching 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers a period of up to 330 years to reach 'equilibrium' for Alaska's ice. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 ice formations. The researchers emphasize that even if warming stops, ice will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia.' They stress that the current decade is critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Half of the world's population suffered an additional month of extreme heat: "Climate change is here and it kills"**
According to Climate Central, 4 billion people experienced at least 30 additional days of extreme heat, with some countries experiencing up to 48 days. Without human-induced climate change, these temperatures would have been significantly lower. Kristina Dahl, Chief Scientist at Climate Central, stated, 'There is no place on Earth that has not been affected by climate change, and heat is its deadliest consequence.' Mariam Zachariah, a researcher on global weather event attribution, noted that frequent and intense heat episodes have severe effects, including heat-related illnesses, deaths, and crop losses. The Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre's Roop Singh emphasized, 'The evidence of the link between climate change and heatwaves is undeniable.' The planet is likely to exceed the 1.5°C threshold compared to pre-industrial levels with a 70% probability between 2025 and 2029.

**40% of glaciers "are doomed" even if we were to stop global warming and sea levels would rise by 10 centimeters**
Even if global warming were to stop, 39% of the world's glacier mass would still disappear, and sea levels would rise by over 10 centimeters, according to a study led by Harry Zekollari. The study, which simulated the long-term impact of current climate policies, found that glaciers would continue to melt for centuries, even without additional warming. 'Most glacier studies stop at the year 2100, which is problematic when simulating the long-term impact of current climate policies, given the glaciers' long-term response over time,' explains Zekollari. The study also found that around 20% of the current glacier mass would be lost regardless of future warming. The researchers note that the retreat of glaciers allows us to see the effects of climate change with our own eyes.

**Scientists Warn of Human Extinction Due to Climate Change and Resource Depletion**
A supercomputer called World One has predicted that humanity may become extinct between 2040 and 2050 due to the cumulative effects of human activity. The main factors contributing to this are overpopulation, global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental pollution. If these trends continue, climate change and resource depletion will make the Earth uninhabitable for humans by the mid-21st century. While some experts criticize the supercomputer for oversimplifying complex processes, many agree with its conclusions. Rising natural disaster frequency and growing oxygen and water scarcity are seen as major causes of human extinction. Even if immediate action is taken to mitigate these factors, the population may still decline to 19th-century levels by the predicted time. Climate scientist Alexander Chernokulsky notes that water scarcity is a pressing issue, citing the melting of glaciers, which replenish water supplies in some regions. He warns that rising sea levels, which could reach 12-15 cm by mid-century and 40-60 cm by the end of the century, will lead to the flooding of coastal areas and entire islands within a few decades. However, climate expert Nikolai Tereshonok believes that the predicted extinction timeline is exaggerated, suggesting that it may take longer, around 300 years. He emphasizes that reversing the current trend is extremely challenging, citing paleoclimatic data that show such processes have never occurred before. Nevertheless, Tereshonok stresses the need to continue fighting climate change, prioritizing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to alternative energy sources.

**Climate Crisis May Cause New Mass Extinction, Warns Renowned Researcher**
Renowned researcher Hugh Montgomery warns that if the effects of climate change are not reversed, the Earth may experience a mass extinction similar to the one that occurred during the Permian Period, where around 90% of species were unable to survive the extreme conditions. Montgomery, director of the Centre for Human Health and Performance at University College London, made the warning at the Forecasting Healthy Futures Global Summit in Rio de Janeiro. He emphasized that this extinction is already occurring, 'the largest and fastest the planet has ever seen, and we are the ones causing it.' However, the death of species could reach catastrophic levels if the global average temperature increases to 3°C above pre-industrial levels. In 2024, the world reached a record increase of 1.5°C, and scientists estimate that if current actions are maintained, especially regarding greenhouse gas emissions, this increase will reach 2.7°C by 2100. 'If we continue to hit the base of this unstable column on which we are supported, the human species itself will be threatened,' Montgomery explained. He also highlighted other drastic consequences that could affect the Earth before then, such as the collapse of the Arctic ice sheets and a significant slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Circulation, which would lead to a significant rise in sea levels and catastrophic consequences. Montgomery emphasized the need for immediate action to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, which he believes is essential for the global economy, which is expected to reduce by 20% per year, or $38 trillion, from 2049 due to the effects of climate change.

**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**
British paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species. 'If we make a concerted effort to expand into the Universe, we could 'live -- potentially -- for millions of years,' he says. However, he warns that if we don't take action, 'there might be no one left on the Earth for you to wave back to.'

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.

**The End of the World in 2026: A Prediction from Harvard Expert**
A 1960 study by Heinz von Foerster, Patricia Mora, and Lawrence Amiot, published in the journal Science, predicted a critical point for humanity: November 13, 2026. The study, titled 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026,' argued that the world's population was growing at an unsustainable rate, and that by 2026, the number of people on the planet would reach a level close to infinity, leading to a crisis of resources and the inability of social systems to sustain themselves. The researchers claimed that even if a stable food supply and the avoidance of natural disasters were achieved, the demographic growth alone could trigger the collapse of societies. The study highlighted overpopulation as the greatest threat to humanity, due to the increasing demand for resources and environmental impact. However, this idea has been questioned over time, as population growth rates have decreased and it is expected that the global population will stabilize in the coming centuries. While the prediction of a collapse in 2026 is viewed with skepticism, the debate on the planet's sustainability remains ongoing. The UN estimates that the global population will reach 11.2 billion by 2100, posing challenges in terms of resources and the environment. Experts recommend focusing on responsible management of the planet and preparing for possible global crises, rather than worrying about apocalyptic scenarios.

**Dire Future Predicted for the World by 2100: Rising Sea Levels, Extreme Weather, and Catastrophic Air Pollution**
A study using Google's ImageFX generator and the latest scientific research predicts a dire future for the world by 2100. Cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main factors will be rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions. If nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these changes will continue for a century. Climate scientist Professor Julian Stoye said, 'The biggest impact that everyone will feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will be increasing over the century if we do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.' The IPCC predicts that the global temperature will rise by 2.7°C by 2100 under a medium scenario and by 4.4°C under a worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than double, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. Countries like France, already struggling with water scarcity, will likely face devastating droughts. It is predicted that only extreme heat will lead to 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. Barcelona will be the most affected city, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. The study predicts that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather events will become more frequent, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. The risk of sudden floods will be high in areas where droughts have already weakened the land. Mega-tornadoes will become more common, posing a threat to countries like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the southern states of the US. Large-scale forest fires will also become more frequent, with a 50% increase in extreme forest fires by 2100. The World Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with 60,000 additional deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.

**Scientists Predict Bleak Future for Earth in 2100**
Scientists from Google and MailOnline used a generator with artificial intelligence to predict what the world will be like in 2100. The picture is bleak: cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main impact will be the rise in sea levels and extreme weather conditions. 'The biggest impact we'll feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will increase over the century if we don't do anything to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,' said Dr. Julian Stowell, a climate expert from University College London. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that the global temperature will be 2.7°C higher than the pre-industrial average by 2100, and 4.4°C higher in the worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than twice, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. 'This will lead to devastating droughts in countries like France, which are already struggling with systematic water shortages,' said Dr. Stowell. It is predicted that only excessive heat will cause 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. The city of Barcelona will be the most affected, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. 'This will warm the Arctic even faster, leading to more melting of Greenland and a faster rise in sea levels, destabilization of permafrost zones, and disruption of deep ocean currents,' said Dr. Stowell. It is predicted that more than half of the world's glaciers will disappear by 2100, and the European Alps will lose 75% of their glaciers under a high-emissions scenario. Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore predict that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather will become more frequent and intense, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. 'When these sudden downpours hit areas where drought has already weakened the land, the risk of catastrophic flooding becomes extremely high,' said experts. The number of 'megastorms' will increase, which occur when warm, moist air rises from the ocean. For places like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and southern US states, these destructive storms will become much more common by 2100. Large forest fires will also become more frequent, as a combination of strong heat and low rainfall makes some regions extremely vulnerable to fires. The UN Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. The frequency of extreme fires will increase by 14% by 2030, 30% by 2050, and 50% by the end of the century. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with cities like Delhi in India facing even worse conditions. Warm air and less rainfall mean that pollution stays in the air longer. In countries experiencing rapid industrial growth, poor environmental regulation has led to hazardous levels of pollution. Research shows that if climate change continues, air pollution will cause an additional 60,000 deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.

**Expert Predicts 'Only Two Years Left Before the End of the World'**
A study by Heinz von Foerster, published in 1960 in the Science journal, predicted that the world would reach a critical point on November 13, 2026, due to an exponential growth of the world population. According to the study, the population growth would lead to a collapse, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to human decisions and actions. The study used a mathematical formula that projected the population would reach near-infinite levels by 2026, even if a constant food supply and natural disasters were avoided. The study warned that the overpopulation could trigger the collapse of social and environmental systems. The true threat is overpopulation, not climate change, and the study attributed the responsibility to humans, not external factors. The research advised that if the population continued to grow at this rate, we would reach an unsustainable threshold where societies could not preserve their stability or sustainable development. Although this prediction is now viewed with skepticism, the dialogue about the limits of human growth remains relevant, and institutions like the UN estimate that the world population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, raising questions about resource management and environmental protection in a world with a constantly increasing population.

**The True Threat: Overpopulation, Not Climate Change**
A 1960 study by physicist Heinz von Foerster and his team predicted that the world would reach a critical point on November 13, 2026, due to exponential population growth. According to their projections, the growth of the world population would be so significant that humanity would experience a collapse, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to its own decisions and actions. The study, titled 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026', argued that even if a constant food supply and the avoidance of natural disasters were achieved, overpopulation could trigger the collapse of social and environmental systems. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that demographic growth has reached a pace that technological advancements cannot mitigate adequately. As a result, addressing this phenomenon is imperative to ensure a sustainable future. According to the model used, overpopulation will lead to extinction due to resource scarcity and the environmental impact of human activities. The research warned that if the world population continues to grow at this rate, we will reach an unsustainable threshold where societies cannot preserve their stability or sustainable development. Although this prediction is now viewed with skepticism, especially due to the stabilization of population growth rates, the dialogue about the limits of human growth remains relevant.

**Humanity's Well-being at Risk Due to Biodiversity Decline**
Human activity has led to a decline in animals and plants across all regions of the world, putting our own well-being at risk through excessive resource exploitation and pollution, warned a comprehensive research on species on Friday. Fish stocks may be depleted by 2048 and more than half of bird and mammal species in Africa may disappear by 2100 unless drastic measures are taken, according to four comprehensive reports released in Medellín. Up to 90% of corals in the Asia-Pacific region will suffer 'severe degradation' by 2050, while in Europe and Central Asia nearly a third of known fish populations and 42% of terrestrial animals and plants are in decline. 'This alarming trend puts at risk economies, livelihoods, food security, and the quality of life of people everywhere,' warned the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Elaborated by almost 600 scientists over three years, the reports highlight that nature provides humans with food, clean water, and energy, and regulates the Earth's climate - practically everything we need to survive and thrive. 'We are undermining our own future well-being,' said IPBES President Robert Watson. 'Biodiversity continues to be lost in all regions of the globe. We are losing species, degrading ecosystems... if we continue to act in this way, we will continue to lose biodiversity at increasing rates.' The IPBES assessment divided the world into four regions: the Americas, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Central Asia - the entire planet, except Antarctica and open seas. Volunteer scientists examined around 10,000 scientific publications for the most extensive survey of biodiversity since 2005. The conclusions were summarized in four reports approved by the 129 member countries of IPBES in Colombia. They contain guidelines for governments to create more biodiversity-friendly policies in the future. - Mass extinction - For the Americas, the research warned that species populations - already 31% smaller than when the first European colonizers arrived - will have shrunk by about 40% by 2050. It is estimated that around 500,000 square kilometers of African land will be degraded, added. The continent will suffer 'significant' plant losses and its lakes will be 20-30% less productive by 2100. In the European Union, however, only 7% of evaluated marine species had a 'favorable conservation status.' 'If we continue the way we are... the sixth mass extinction, the first caused by humans, will continue,' said Watson to AFP. Scientists say that humanity's voracious consumption of biodiversity has triggered the first mass extinction of species since the dinosaurs disappeared - the sixth on our planet in 500 million years. - Increased demand - In many places, climate changes caused by burning fossil fuels for energy were worsening the loss of biodiversity, according to the reports. 'That's what we have to convey to policymakers: we have to look at climate change and biodiversity together,' said Watson. 'Climate change affects biodiversity, changes in our natural vegetation affect climate change. And both, if we don't do it correctly, will harm many of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals: clean water for all, food security for people, energy security, human security, equity.' There are many obstacles. 'Economic growth will continue. Population growth will continue until 2050, so resource demand will increase,' said the IPBES president. Even in the best scenarios, global warming will continue to contribute to species loss, causing greater ecosystem degradation. But scientists point to possible solutions: creating more protected areas, restoring degraded zones, and rethinking subsidies that promote unsustainable agriculture. Governments, companies, and individuals must consider the impact on biodiversity when making decisions about agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining, or infrastructure development. Different regions will require different solutions, said Watson. 'It's not too late' to stop or even reverse some of the damage, he said. 'We can stop it all? No. We can slow it down significantly? Yes.' IPBES will release a fifth report on the global state of the soil, which is being rapidly degraded through pollution, deforestation, mining, and unsustainable agricultural methods that deplete its nutrients.
