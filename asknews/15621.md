**Greenpeace Protests French President Macron's 'Double Discourse' on Ukraine and Russia**
Greenpeace activists stole the wax figure of French President Emmanuel Macron from the Musée Grévin in Paris and placed it in front of the Russian embassy as a protest against France's economic relations with Moscow. The activists criticized Macron's 'double discourse' for supporting Ukraine while maintaining economic ties with Russia. According to Jean-François Julliard, director of Greenpeace France, 'We took the wax figure of Emmanuel Macron from the Musée Grévin this morning. We brought it out of the museum and exhibited it symbolically in front of the Russian embassy to denounce the double standards of the French government and the President regarding the war in Ukraine.' Julliard emphasized that while France maintains political, diplomatic, and financial support for Ukraine, it continues to import Russian products that, according to Greenpeace, help finance Moscow's war effort. 'We do not deny the political and financial support of France and Europe to Ukraine. But if we want coherence, we cannot support Ukraine and at the same time import enormous quantities of gas, chemical fertilizers, and uranium,' he said. 'In 2024, France was the first European importer of liquefied natural gas from Russia. This is not a minor issue, we are talking about billions of euros that continue to feed the Russian economy.' Julliard also stated that Macron 'embodies this double discourse' and has a 'particular responsibility' for not taking stronger measures at the European level to curb trade with Russia. 'It is he who should lead in Europe to end these commercial contracts,' he said.

**Macron navigates rocky path to recognizing Palestinian state - Japan Today**
French President Emmanuel Macron is considering recognizing a Palestinian state, but diplomats and experts warn that such a move could deepen Western splits and be ineffective in pressuring Israel into a peace deal. Macron's stance has shifted amid Israel's Gaza offensive and escalating violence in the West Bank, and there is a growing sense of urgency in Paris to act now. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said, 'If France moves, several (European) countries will follow.' Macron's move would be a significant step, potentially giving momentum to a movement dominated by smaller nations critical of Israel. However, experts say it would need to be accompanied by other measures, such as sanctions and trade bans, to be more than a symbolic gesture. France is weighing the move ahead of a United Nations conference to lay out the parameters for a roadmap to a Palestinian state, while ensuring Israel's security.

**Israeli Politician Warns Macron of 'Next Slap' for France**
Israeli politician Almog Cohen warned French President Emmanuel Macron in a tweet, saying, 'Dear President Macron, I heard you're keen on establishing a Palestinian state. Considering the chaos in Paris last night, you're making great progress... just in France.' He added, 'I have a feeling that the next slap the French people will receive will be even more painful.' Cohen, a member of the Israeli Knesset from the far-right 'Jewish Power' party, made the comments after Israel accused Macron of waging a 'crusade against the Jewish state' for calling for stronger international action against Israel unless the humanitarian situation in Gaza improves. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement, 'Instead of exerting pressure on terrorists, Macron wants to reward them with a Palestinian state. There's no doubt that their national day will be on October 7th,' referring to the 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war.

**50 of the Funniest Burns from the Week of May 30, 2025**
France is banning smoking in outdoor areas like parks and sports arenas to limit children's exposure to secondhand smoke, according to French Health Minister Catherine Vautrin. 'The freedom to smoke must end where the freedom of children to breathe fresh air begins,' Vautrin said. The ban, set to take effect July 1st, has sparked a series of humorous Twitter roasts from the French and their American allies, with one user joking 'Then what is the point of the French?' Another user credited the ban with prompting a viral physical altercation between French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron. Despite the ban, the French can still enjoy their fancy cheeses and pretentious air, and we can enjoy this week's most scathing digital burns, which roast 60-year-old situationship drama, night showerers, and Timothée Chalamet.

**Can Emmanuel Macron Survive The Storm Until 2027?**
Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, is facing a challenging period ahead of the 2027 elections. France has been plagued by political crises, with four prime ministers in just under a year, and a divided National Assembly. Macron is set to unveil a two-year plan to address social and economic reforms, but his personal life is also under scrutiny. Astrological predictions suggest a rough period for his relationship with his wife, with a possible no-confidence motion against his government and health issues. Macron's term as President ends in May 2027, and he will face a tough election campaign in April 2027, during which he will be under the influence of the Rahu/Mars dasa. As per the astrological analysis, Macron's party, Ensemble, is expected to perform poorly and may not get a majority in the National Assembly. 'The views expressed here are solely of the columnist and the publication does not necessarily subscribe to the same,' the article notes.

**Macron Calls on EU to Strengthen Stance Against Israel Over Gaza Crisis**
French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the European Union to strengthen its stance against Israel if it does not improve the conditions of the Palestinian population in Gaza. Macron made the statement during a press conference in Singapore, where he emphasized that the EU should 'apply' its rules against Israel 'if there is no response to the humanitarian situation' in the Palestinian territory. He proposed possible measures, including ending the association agreement between the EU and Israel, or 'applying sanctions'. The UN and humanitarian organizations have denounced the situation in the devastated Palestinian territory, where the population has suffered over two and a half months of Israeli blockade of all international aid. Macron stated, 'We have to harden our position because it's a necessity today, but I still have hope that the Israeli government will change its position and we will finally have a humanitarian response.' He also emphasized that if Western powers 'abandon Gaza' and let Israel do as it pleases, they risk 'losing all credibility in the eyes of the rest of the world.' The French president also reiterated that recognizing the Palestinian state is not only a 'moral duty, but a political necessity,' and listed conditions for doing so, including the 'release of hostages' taken by Hamas, the 'demilitarization' of the Islamist movement, and its 'non-participation' in the government of a future Palestinian state. Macron said in April that France could recognize a Palestinian state in June. However, Israel responded harshly, accusing Macron of launching a 'crusade against the Jewish state.' The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, 'There is no humanitarian blockade. That's a blatant lie.' The Israeli government also announced the creation of 22 new settlements in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law. The UN has regularly denounced this. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said, 'We will continue to advance in Gaza and especially in the West Bank, where we will build a Jewish Israeli state.' He added that Macron and Europe can 'recognize a Palestinian state on paper,' but that the Israelis 'will build the Jewish Israeli state here on the ground.' 'The paper will be thrown into the trash of history, and the State of Israel will flourish and prosper,' he said during a visit to the settlement of Sa-Nur in the north of the occupied West Bank.

**Macron: The West Risks Losing Credibility if it Abandons Gaza**
French President Emmanuel Macron warned that the West risks losing its credibility in the eyes of the world if it abandons Gaza and allows Israel to do as it pleases. Macron expressed his support for the Egyptian, Qatari, and American efforts to stop the fighting in Gaza, saying that 'we cannot leave Israel to do in Gaza what it wants'. He also emphasized that France rejects the double standards, which should also apply to the war in Ukraine. Macron stated that France defends its interests first and wants cooperation, not subordination. He warned that France may take a harder stance on Israel if it continues to block humanitarian aid to Gaza, and that Paris is committed to a two-state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Macron also expressed his hope that the new Israeli government will change its stance and respond to the humanitarian situation in Gaza. He emphasized that the humanitarian blockade in Gaza is unacceptable and that France may consider imposing sanctions on Israeli settlers if there is no satisfactory response to the humanitarian situation in the coming days.

**Three Potential Candidates Emerge for French Presidency in 2027**
Three potential candidates are emerging to succeed Emmanuel Macron as President of France in 2027: Bruno Retailleau, the current Minister of the Interior and winner of the Republican Party presidency; Gabriel Attal, the former Prime Minister, who is positioning himself for the center-right block; and Édouard Philippe, also a former Prime Minister under Macron. According to Mathilde Siraud, editor-in-chief of Le Point's political service, 'They are starting to line up for the succession of Emmanuel Macron.'

**Macron says France does not want to unleash 'World War III' over Ukraine**
President Emmanuel Macron stated that France does not want to spark 'World War III' over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pledged referendums on major reforms. Macron outlined his priorities for his final two years in office before stepping down in 2027. He emphasized the need to help Ukraine defend itself but avoid a global conflict. Macron also discussed potential referendums on key issues, including reducing France's debt, access to social media for under-15s, and assisted dying. However, he rejected the idea of putting immigration issues to a popular vote. Macron's recent months have seen a renewed energy, boosted by his presence on the international front, and he has outlined his aims for the remaining two years of his mandate. 'We must help Ukraine defend itself but we do not want to unleash a Third World War,' Macron said in the interview. 'The war must cease and Ukraine must be in the best possible situation to go into negotiations,' he added. Macron also expressed his willingness to discuss deploying French warplanes armed with nuclear weapons on European territory, similar to the United States. 'The Americans have the bombs on planes in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Turkey,' Macron said. 'We are ready to open this discussion. I will define the framework in a very specific way in the weeks and months to come,' he said. Macron's future plans are uncertain, but he stated that he has not yet thought about his future after 2027 and is only focused on France in his daily work.

**Macron Considers Dissolving French Parliament and Holding Early Elections**
French President Emmanuel Macron is considering dissolving the French parliament and holding early elections in the fall of 2025, according to Bloomberg. Macron has been consulting with his team about the possibility, but no decisions have been made yet. The next parliamentary elections in France are scheduled to take place no earlier than 2029, according to the country's legislation. Macron had previously stated that he wanted to avoid holding early elections before the end of his presidential term in 2027. However, recent polls have shown a rise in Macron's popularity, with his approval rating increasing to 31%, which is close to the level it was before the last parliamentary elections. Macron's efforts to respond to the geopolitical actions of US President Donald Trump have also contributed to his rising popularity. However, some of Macron's allies are concerned that holding early elections could further destabilize the country, which has been experiencing relative stability since Macron appointed François Baire as Prime Minister in December. The early elections could also give the far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, an opportunity to gain more power and potentially take control of the government. 'Such a step could put the relative stability in France at risk, which has been maintained since December, when Macron appointed Baire as Prime Minister,' said Bloomberg. 'Macron has survived catastrophic elections in July, which split the National Assembly and left no group with a majority, causing months of political chaos. Early elections to the legislative bodies could also give the National Rally party the opportunity to develop its potential and, possibly, take control of the government,' added the agency.

**Macron Considers Dissolving Parliament and Holding Early Elections**
French President Emmanuel Macron is considering dissolving parliament and holding early elections this fall, according to Bloomberg, citing sources close to the president. Macron has been consulting with advisors on the possibility of holding elections either this fall or next year, coinciding with the scheduled municipal elections. However, these discussions 'had an exclusively consultative character, and no decision was made,' notes the publication. Macron's advisors argue that this is a bad idea, as early elections to the legislative body could give the far-right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, 'an opportunity to strengthen and take control of the government.' Macron had previously assured parliamentary party leaders that he would avoid early elections until the end of his term in 2027. However, his personal rating has been increasing lately due to 'decisive steps by the French president on the international arena.' According to a recent survey, Macron's rating reached 31% in March, a seven-point increase from the previous month and close to the level before the parliamentary elections last year. However, the National Rally showed its best result in the July 2024 early elections, and Marine Le Pen has been recognized as guilty of embezzling EU funds to finance her party. She was sentenced to four years in prison, with two suspended and two under house arrest, and was also banned from running for public office for five years. Despite this, Le Pen has stated that she intends to run for the presidency of France, saying 'she will not leave politics for anything.'

French President Emmanuel Macron is considering dissolving parliament and holding early elections this fall, according to Bloomberg, citing sources close to the matter. Macron has been consulting with his advisors on the possibility, but no decision has been made. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2029. One of the options being considered is to wait until next year before dissolving parliament, allowing for simultaneous elections with the planned municipal elections in 2026. However, Macron has been told that this is a bad idea. In December, Macron told party leaders that he would aim to avoid early elections until the end of his term in 2027. The Elysee Palace refused to comment on the possibility of dissolution, but a person close to Macron said that his intentions have not changed. Recent polls have shown a surge in Macron's popularity, with his rating increasing to 31% in March, up seven points from the previous month and close to the level before the last parliamentary elections.

Macron has been touring the continent, trying to rally allies in support of Ukraine and European sovereignty. However, some of Macron's allies are concerned that early elections could further erode his majority. The last snap elections in July 2024 saw his coalition lose around a third of its seats in the National Assembly, while the far-right 'National Rally' showed its best result. Early elections could give the 'National Rally' the opportunity to develop its potential and possibly take control of the government. Marine Le Pen, the informal leader of the far-right, who has been leading in several polls for the 2027 presidential election, was found guilty of embezzlement in March and received a five-year ban on participating in elections. However, her hopes for participating in the 2027 presidential election have not been extinguished, as an appeal court in Paris has announced that it will make a decision on her appeal and ban by mid-2026, much earlier than expected. Jordan Bardella, the second-in-command of the party, is now seen as the leader in the 2027 presidential election.
