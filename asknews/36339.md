**Trump Rejects $15 Million Settlement Offer from CBS News**
Donald Trump, the US President, has rejected a $15 million settlement offer from CBS News, which accused him of editing interview content to favor his opponent during the 2022 presidential election. Trump's team demanded $25 million or more, according to the Wall Street Journal. The dispute began when CBS News' flagship program '60 Minutes' edited out some of Trump's comments during an interview with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November 2022. Trump claimed that the edited version made him look bad and sued CBS News for $2.7 billion. CBS News, which has been embroiled in several lawsuits, has seen its CEO Wendy McMahon and the producer of '60 Minutes' Bill Owens step down. Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, is currently pursuing a merger that requires approval from the Trump administration, which may motivate them to settle the lawsuit quickly. However, Paramount is concerned that paying too much in settlement could lead to lawsuits from shareholders or even criminal charges for bribery.

**Trump's Weakness for TikTok: A Possible 'Save' for the App in the US**
Former US President Trump has expressed a weakness for TikTok, stating, 'I have a weakness for TikTok. I know I shouldn't.' Trump believes that the app contributed to his victory in the November elections by boosting his approval among young people. The Trump administration had demanded that TikTok disassociate itself from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, in order to operate in the US. After failing to reach an agreement, TikTok stopped functioning in the US for several hours. Trump later signed an executive order granting a 75-day extension, which he later extended. Trump still believes that TikTok will need approval from China to operate in the US, suggesting that it may be saved, but with certain conditions.

**Trump Job Approval Is Rising**
Donald Trump's job approval ratings have been rising, reversing a trend that saw his numbers drop after his 'liberation day' announcement. According to Morning Consult's poll, there has been a 9-point swing in voters' approval of Trump's trade policy in just two weeks, driven by an increase in confidence that Trump's tariff policies will pay off. This optimism is also reflected in consumer confidence, which skyrocketed in May, far outstripping expectations. The Democrats' strategy of loudly screaming about every little thing has backfired, as every time they predict disasters that don't come, Trump gains a bit more benefit of the doubt. As one observer noted, 'the Democrats are drowning, and all that flailing hasn't helped a bit.'

**Leaderless Democrats in search of an anti-Trump strategy that sticks**
More than six months after Trump's presidential victory, Democrats are still struggling to find a message that resonates with the public. Democratic strategist Stefan Hankin said, 'I don't think we know' what the party's message should be, and advised Democrats to 'try a little bit of everything.' Meanwhile, other party strategists are confident that Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' will backfire politically. The Democratic National Committee is attempting to oust vice chairman David Hogg from his leadership position due to his advocacy of primary challenges and criticisms of it. The party is also reportedly poised to spend $20 million on a project called 'Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan' to 'study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces.' Democrats have a slight 2 percentage point edge in early average congressional generic ballot polling, but Trump's approval rating has recovered since the fallout from his 'Liberation Day' duties. Trump's approval rating is net negative 2 points, but his approval is 48%, and his persistent approval rating is regardless of the chaos caused by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and other issues. A Conference Board consumer confidence report found sentiment improved this month to 98, the first time since November after recession concerns. White House spokesman Kush Desai said, 'President Trump's America First economic agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, rapid deregulation, and domestic energy production continues to pay off.' With Trump firmly in power, the leaderless Democratic Party is years away from electing a new nominee, and the party is about to experience another crowded primary in 2028.

**Australia Sees Home Approvals Soar As Costs Fall**
Australia's housing market is experiencing a surge in new home approvals and construction activity, with the highest levels in over a year. This trend is a welcome relief for prospective buyers, who have faced skyrocketing property prices in recent years. The increase in approvals is part of a national push to build 1.2 million new homes, with falling construction costs underpinning confidence in the industry. Queensland is leading the boom, with home approvals up 26% in September compared to the previous year. The recent surge in home building activity is partly attributed to a steady drop in global construction material costs and rising domestic demand for houses. Analysts expect material prices to ease further starting in 2025, driven by anticipated policy changes under the incoming Trump administration in the United States. This could lead to a more balanced housing market, with the combined impact of lower construction costs and increased housing supply potentially improving housing affordability in the near future.

**Shereef Amer: Trump to Announce Ceasefire in Gaza Once 'Witkov' Document is Approved**
Egyptian media personality Shereef Amer said that there are developments in the negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza, citing a document called 'Witkov' that includes a 60-day ceasefire with the possibility of extension. The document also includes the release of 10 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners, as well as the entry of humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from some of their military centers in Gaza. Amer added that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's government has agreed to the 'Witkov' document and the complete agreement, and that a formal announcement of the ceasefire will be made by US President Trump once he has approved it. Amer stated, 'The Netanyahu government has agreed to a ceasefire or the 'Witkov' document and the complete agreement. This is one of the important developments in Gaza, and the announcement will be made officially in the coming hours by President Trump himself.'

**Trump Considers Saving TikTok in US, but Seeks Chinese Approval**
US President Donald Trump considered the possibility of 'saving' TikTok in the US, but estimated that it would require Chinese approval. 'To do it well, we probably need the approval of China. China is never easy, but I think we can save TikTok. I'd like to save TikTok. TikTok treated me very well. I won the youth by 37%', Trump said at a White House event. The Republican administration had demanded that TikTok disassociate itself from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to operate in the US. Trump has a 'soft spot' for TikTok, which he believes contributed to his election victory in November by boosting his approval among young people. Trump granted TikTok an additional 75-day deadline to reach an agreement with US companies that would allow it to separate from ByteDance. The previous Congress, under the Democratic government of Joe Biden, had passed a law requiring TikTok to find an investor from a country not considered an 'adversary' by January 20, when Trump took office. Without an agreement, the app stopped working for a few hours in the US until Trump, on his first day back at the White House, signed an executive order granting a 75-day extension, which he later extended.

**How Donald Trump Beat the PUCK Out of the Democrats**
According to recent opinion polls, the Republican Party is gaining ground and the Democratic Party is struggling. A survey by The Hill found that the GOP has a higher favorability rating than the Democrats, with a net favorability of -10% compared to the Democrats' -24%. Another poll by Rasmussen Reports found that a majority of Americans believe the country is on the right track, which could diminish the appeal of the Democratic Party's opposition to President Trump. A third poll by Newsweek found that Trump's approval rating has soared among Hispanic voters, with 57% approval, up from 42% in April. These polls suggest that the Democratic Party's strategy of opposing Trump may not be effective and that the Republican Party is well-positioned to buck historic trends in the 2026 midterms.

**US House Approves Tax Bill with 3.5% Remittance Tax**
The US House of Representatives has approved a tax and spending bill proposed by President Trump, which includes a 3.5% tax on remittances sent to Mexico and other countries. The bill, which also includes measures to extend Trump's tax exemptions, increase funding for border security, and reduce funding for social programs, is expected to add $2.4 billion to the national debt over the next decade. The tax on remittances, initially proposed at 5%, was reduced to 3.5% during negotiations. The measure is expected to affect millions of Mexican households and individuals who rely on remittances from the US. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has criticized the measure, calling it 'unjust' and 'discriminatory'. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it will face further debate and potential amendments. If approved, the tax on remittances will take effect on January 1, 2026.

**Trump's Tax Plan 'On the Right Track' for Approval, But Faces Challenges**
US President Donald Trump is pushing lawmakers to quickly approve his 'great and beautiful' tax plan, which aims to extend tax credits from his first term that are set to expire at the end of the year. However, the plan is not consensual among Republicans, with moderates fearing that significant cuts to Medicaid could have electoral consequences in November 2026, and conservatives demanding more cuts. Trump tweeted, 'REPUBLICANS MUST UNITE IN SUPPORT OF A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL PROPOSAL OF LAW!' and directed a message to recalcitrant Republican congressmen, saying, 'STOP TALKING, AND DO IT!' The Republican leader in Congress, Mike Johnson, aims to have the bill approved by both chambers before Memorial Day, May 26, and ready for Trump's signature before Independence Day, July 4. Democrats have labeled the proposal 'a great and bad law' and 'a great and beautiful betrayal', criticizing the planned removal of healthcare and food assistance for millions of people, while the wealthy would receive massive tax cuts, and the proposal would increase future budget deficits. 'This is bad economics. It's unconceivable,' said Representative Brendan Boyle, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. The proposal would cut federal Medicaid spending by over $700 billion in the next decade, threatening to deny health insurance to over 8 million Americans, according to a nonpartisan Congressional analysis. The plan also seeks to include tax exemptions for tips, overtime pay, car loans, and Social Security benefits, as well as increasing tax exemptions for the elderly and families with children.

**Polls: Trump Job Approval Stabilizing, But Still Underwater**
Donald Trump's job-approval ratings have stabilized in May after a decline in April, but he remains more unpopular than popular. According to the Silver Bulletin polling averages, Trump's net job approval improved from minus 9 percent on April 30 to minus 6.2 percent on May 15. However, some of the improvement is attributed to Trump-friendly polls, while other polls, such as Economist-YouGov and Reuters-Ipsos, show little change in their trend lines. Silver Bulletin's averages on the intensity of approval and disapproval are also stable, with 27-28% strongly approving and 41-42% strongly disapproving. Trump's job-approval ratings on handling particular issues, such as the economy and trade, have also shown little change. The generic congressional ballot also shows recent stability, with Democrats leading by a two-point margin (45.5% to 43.5%). As the 2026 midterm elections approach, this metric will become increasingly important.

**Leading Dem: Trump's MAGA army in House is already plotting their escape**
Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu believes that House Republican Members are already planning their exit from the House, citing President Donald Trump's low approval rating. According to CNN's Harry Enten, there is 'pretty much zero chance' that the Republicans will hold the House of Representatives if Trump's approval rating remains at 41% in November 2026. A recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll shows that Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating of any president in the past 80 years, with 55% of people disapproving of his job performance. The poll also found that 53% of people believe the economy has gotten worse since Trump took office, while only 21% think it has improved.

**Trump, MAGA and GOP have 'zero chance' of surviving this, pollster says**
According to a CNN poll, Donald Trump's approval rating has hit a historic low of 41% in his first 100 days, making it the lowest for any newly elected president since Dwight Eisenhower. Pollster Harry Enten believes that 'there is pretty much zero chance' that the Republicans will hold the House of Representatives in the midterm elections if Trump's approval rating remains at 41% in November 2026. Trump's disapproval ratings are also high across various issues, including immigration, managing the government, and the economy. Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted that 'the American people do not want oligarchy, authoritarianism or attacks on Social Security, Medicaid or the VA.'

**Trump's Popularity Plummets Among American Voters**
Donald Trump's popularity has taken a significant hit among American voters, according to The Economist. Even when Trump achieves something positive, such as winning the popular vote for the first time in three attempts, he tends to exaggerate it. Trump's base remains enthusiastic, but the voters who elected him in November seem to be turning against him. The Economist's analysis of YouGov data shows that Trump's approval rating has decreased by 14 points since his inauguration, with a net negative rating of -7% for his economic policies. A significant number of his supporters, particularly among young voters and those from Latin American backgrounds, have lost faith in him. The Cooperative Election Study found that 84% of Trump's supporters in 2020 and 2024 were white, identified as conservative, and were over 45 years old. In contrast, the new voters he attracted in 2024 were more diverse, with 65% being white, 42% identifying as conservative, and 41% being over 45 years old. If Trump fails to deliver the economic boom he promised, these voters may turn against him. The analysis suggests that the places that Trump won in 2020 are now turning against him, with a net negative approval rating in all six swing states he won from Joe Biden. The Economist's data also shows that Trump's approval rating has decreased in the swing states of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The biggest test will be the 2026 midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress and the fate of Trump's agenda.

**Donald Trump's approval rating is dropping**
Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped by 14 points since he entered office, more steeply than the five-point drop he had suffered by this time in his first term. His handling of the economy has a net rating of minus-seven percentage points, with nearly one in five of his own voters disapproving of his handling of inflation and prices. The administration's policies, including the tariff rollercoaster, have directly affected some of his voters and caused a 19% drop in the S&P 500. While his base remains enthusiastic, swing voters and infrequent voters who were disillusioned with the economy under Joe Biden are turning against him. According to The Economist's analysis of YouGov data, Mr. Trump has a net negative approval rating in all six swing states he flipped away from Joe Biden in November's presidential election. The biggest test will be the midterm elections in 2026, which will determine control of Congress and the fate of Mr. Trump's agenda.

**Trump's popularity plummets in first 100 days as president**
Donald Trump's popularity has plummeted in his first 100 days as president, with a 14-point drop in his approval rating. According to a YouGov and The Economist poll, Trump currently has a net negative rating of 7 points on economic issues, a stark contrast to his better numbers in 2017. Almost one in five voters who supported Trump in 2024 disapprove of his handling of inflation, and 12% are dissatisfied with his job policy. The University of Michigan's latest poll reflects unprecedented pessimism among Republican voters about the economy's direction, comparable only to the 2020 election loss. Trump's initial decisions, including the dismantling of federal officials and cuts to aid programs, have affected key segments of his electorate. The ongoing trade war has also hit markets hard. Trump acknowledges that his decisions may cause 'short-term pain', but insists they will bring industrial benefits in the future. Not everyone shares his conviction. The 2026 legislative elections will be crucial for the balance of power in Congress, and Trump's popularity is already affecting his party's chances. He won re-election with the support of unusual voters and disenchanted sectors, but his link with these groups is starting to fray. The Economist's data shows a net disapproval of -37 points among Latinos and -25 points among those under 30. In the six states that decided his victory, polls now give him a negative score. As Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight, noted, 'pollsters have been struggling to gauge Trump's popularity for years', but the signs are clear: Republicans have suffered setbacks in several special elections, including the recent Wisconsin Supreme Court election. Virginia and New Jersey, which will hold elections this November, also reflect the decline. In both states, The Economist's analysis puts Trump's net approval at negative figures: -11 and -14 points respectively. While Trump maintains a loyal base, his political continuity depends on the favor of more volatile sectors, those who voted for him out of a desire for change, not conviction.

**Trump's approval ratings: What the latest polls show**
President Donald Trump's approval ratings have improved significantly since his second term began. According to FiveThirtyEight polling averages, Trump's net favorability rating has narrowed from 8.6 percentage points underwater on Election Day to 0.6 percentage points underwater. When evaluating his performance as president, Trump has a 49% approval rating and 44% disapproval rating nationally. This is a significant improvement from his ratings in February 2017, when he had a 44% approval rating and 48% disapproval rating. However, Trump's numbers still lag behind those of his two Democratic predecessors, President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama, at this point in their presidencies. Trump's favorability rating varies significantly by state, with him being most popular in deep-red states and least popular in solid blue states. Interestingly, Trump's favorability rating is underwater in six of the seven 'swing states' he won last November, suggesting that these voters may have been motivated more by opposition to Democrats than by strong support for Trump.

**SEC Approves Bitwise ETF As Netflows Rise In Spot BTC & ETH ETFs**
The SEC has approved the Bitwise Spot BTC ETF and ETH ETF, allowing investors to gain exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum through a single regulated financial product. The new ETF aims to track the market value of Bitcoin and Ethereum, allocating assets based on their relative market capitalizations. The spot BTC ETF has 12 sponsor AUM organizations, including Bitwise, managing net assets totaling $123.43 Billion, which accounts for 5.94% of Bitcoin's market capitalization. The spot ETH ETF has 9 AUM sponsors with combined net assets of $11.78 Billion, accounting for 3.02% of Ethereum's market cap. The net assets of these spot BTC ETFs and ETH ETFs have reached $135.21 Billion, with a total net inflow of $42.91 Billion. The popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs prompted Bitwise to file an S-1 on November 26, 2024, proposing a new ETF. This move comes as asset managers are eager to launch new crypto-related ETFs, stimulated by anticipations of a more favorable regulatory climate under the 47th President Donald Trump's administration. As a result, multiple registration applications have recently surged, majorly fueled by expectations of fewer restrictions under the new administration.
