**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**EU demands CO2 storage from oil and gas companies**
The European Union has set ambitious climate goals, but without facilities to store carbon dioxide (CO2), these goals are illusory. The EU is now requiring oil and gas companies to ensure the necessary storage facilities by 2030. The EU has published a list of 44 companies, including OMV, Total Energies, and Eni, which must store 50 million tons of CO2 per year by 2030. The EU aims to store at least 250 million tons of CO2 per year by 2040 to achieve its climate goals. The industry has expressed concerns about the feasibility of these targets, citing the high costs of building CCS infrastructure, lack of economic incentives, and regulatory uncertainty. Total Energies estimates that only about half of the target will be achieved by 2030, citing delays in project development and a lack of final investment decisions. The company is, however, continuing to develop its CCS projects, including the 'Northern Lights' project in Norway, which aims to store CO2 from European companies in the North Sea. The EU has promised faster permitting procedures and solid financial support to the industry, but the companies remain skeptical. Environmental organizations, such as Clean Air Taskforce (CATF) and Bellona, welcome the EU's decision, but also emphasize the need for a complete CCS value chain, including a European network of pipelines, railways, and roads to transport CO2 from emitters to storage sites.

**NBBL proposes a five-year pause on building requirements**
The Norwegian government aims to start construction on 130,000 new buildings by 2030, but last year only 18,678 new homes received building permits, according to the Statistics Norway (SSB). This is the lowest number since 1993. The Norwegian Building Association (NBBL) is part of a working group tasked by Minister of Local Government and Regional Development Kjersti Stenseng to find ways to simplify and streamline the planning and building process. Fredriksen believes that a pause in cost-driven requirements could make new apartments 150,000-250,000 NOK cheaper. Stenseng stated that the government will take additional measures to reduce costs, but is not entirely positive about NBBL's proposal. 'When the construction of new homes is low, we must be extra critical about the total sum of current requirements and framework conditions affecting the construction of new homes. However, the construction industry, which is almost the only industry, will not be exempt from our requirements,' she said.

**From Taxation To Confiscation: Europe's Wealth Exodus & The Coming Asset Seizure**
Europe's deindustrialization and bankruptcy continue, with the next step being asset seizure. Governments are raising taxes, including wealth taxes, but individuals are leaving the country to avoid them. Norway's experience shows that raising wealth taxes can lead to a loss of tax revenue as individuals with wealth leave the country. Spain has recorded a negative millionaire migration, and the UK has lost 12,500 high-net-worth individuals in 2023, with 9,500 more expected to leave in 2024. The proposed solution is an exit tax for citizens leaving the country, but the author believes the next step will be confiscation. The EU has already taken steps towards confiscation, including requiring citizens to register all their assets in a central register and eliminating cash. The author advises buying Bitcoin and self-custodying it to avoid seizure.

**EU Adopts White Book of Security: A New Era for European Defense?**
European politicians have adopted the White Book of Security, which includes two sections on cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, including the creation of a joint military-industrial complex and the accumulation of 800 billion euros by 2030 for defense purposes. However, according to political scientist Oleksiy Buriachenko, the EU's bureaucratic nature is a significant obstacle. Buriachenko noted that the EU was not created as a security union, but rather as an economically horizontal confederation. He emphasized that the EU should not try to solve all of Ukraine's security and arms supply issues, as this is not its purpose. Instead, the EU should focus on its own security, which should be guaranteed by the US through NATO. Buriachenko believes that the EU has finally realized that a reset in relations with the US is inevitable. He warned that the EU's attempt to scale up arms production will require significant state orders, which may come at the expense of other programs, such as migrant support or social welfare. 'This is money that needs to be taken from somewhere,' Buriachenko said. 'For example, from programs supporting migrants, social or humanitarian spheres. If this is done, right-wing and ultra-right forces will immediately start playing on the fact that Russia is not their threat.' Buriachenko emphasized that Ukraine and Europe need to find a common system of coordinates and come to a realization that only together can they guarantee their own security without a third player. He suggested that the 'Coalition of the Willing' format, which includes countries such as the UK, Norway, and Turkey, could become a united Europe, and NATO could transform into the EU's army.

**EU's White Book on Security: A Call for Unity and a New Approach to NATO**
Russia benefits from portraying the Russian-Ukrainian war as a regional conflict. It is interested in reducing the role of the US in ensuring European security, a role that has traditionally been held by the US since the end of World War II and the creation of NATO. According to Alexey Buraychenko, executive director of the International Association of Small Communities, if Europe and Ukraine cannot convince the US to return to the dialogue and interest Trump in staying in European politics, ensuring their position in Ukraine (by transferring arms), then the EU will face difficult times. The EU has adopted the White Book on Security, which includes two sections on cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, including the creation of a joint defense industry and the accumulation of 800 billion euros by 2030 for defense issues. However, as Buraychenko noted, the EU has a large bureaucratic component. The EU was not created as a security union, but as a horizontally economic confederation. When many politicians and experts say that the EU should solve all security issues and arms supplies for Ukraine, they forget that the EU was not created for this purpose. Even its own security should not be implemented by the EU, as this should be done by the US through the NATO instrument. According to Buraychenko, the EU has now realized that a reset of relations with the US will definitely take place. Today, there is no clear understanding of whether the US is ready to go to war for Europe in the event of, for example, a Russian attack. Therefore, Europeans are trying to scale up arms production, but this requires significant state orders. 'This is money that needs to be taken from somewhere: for example, from migrant support programs, social or humanitarian spheres. If this is done, right-wing and ultra-right forces will immediately start playing, saying that Russia is not their threat,' Buraychenko said. He emphasized that Ukraine and Europe need to find a common system of coordinates, come to an understanding that only together they will be able to guarantee their own security without a third player. 'The 'Coalition of the Willing' format, which is wider than the EU, because it includes the UK, Norway, Turkey, and in the future may become a united Europe, to which we strive. And NATO may transform into the EU's army, because many defense practices have taken place within the Alliance,' Buraychenko said. However, as the politician concluded, for this to happen, Europe needs to wake up and understand that if it behaves so amorphously as it does now, allowing itself to be manipulated, it will not be able to unite.

**Norway Experiences Record-High Tourism in 2025, Oslo Leads the Way**
Norway is experiencing a record-high number of tourists in 2025, with Oslo being the most popular destination. According to Christian Lunde, the CEO of Visit Oslo, the city has become a cultural hub in Europe and is attracting tourists with its unique culture and traditions. The Norwegian krone's weakness is also making Norway a more affordable destination for tourists. Aase Marthe J. Horrigmo, the director of Innovasjon Norge, notes that Norway has had a continuous monthly growth in foreign commercial overnight stays since April 2023. Jocelynn, a Canadian tourist, says, 'Norge er veldig likt Canada, men mer moderne' (Norway is very similar to Canada, but more modern). She adds that people are friendly, the food is good, and they are fascinated by the cultures and traditions. Oslo is expected to see the largest increase in tourism, with bookings for the summer already higher than last year. Håvard Uglem Hovdahl, the loyalty manager at The Hub hotel, says, 'Her i Oslo er markedet opp 13 prosent' (The market in Oslo is up 13 percent). He believes the weak krone is one of the reasons for the increase in tourism, but also notes that Norway has become a more attractive destination.

**Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of the Profession of Lawyer Established in Luxembourg**
The Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of the Profession of Lawyer was established in Luxembourg today, with Norway being one of the first countries to sign the convention. According to Maria Varteressian, the Norwegian State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, 'The purpose of this Convention is to strengthen the protection of the profession of lawyer and the right to practise this profession with independence and without discrimination, improper hindrance or interference, or being subjected to attacks, threats, harassment or intimidation.' The convention also regulates professional freedom of expression and the right to an independent disciplinary regime. However, Varteressian noted that 'the challenging part will be to get the countries that did not sign today to join.' The convention requires ratification from at least eight states before it can come into effect. The other countries that signed the convention today were Andorra, Estonia, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Sweden, and Poland. Justis- og beredskapsminister Astri Aas-Hansen (Ap) said in a press release that 'this year has been a milestone year for the legal profession, and we have taken big steps both nationally and internationally for the development of the law in this important area.'

**EU's Reliance on American LNG Proves Costly**
The European Union's (EU) reliance on American liquefied natural gas (LNG) is proving to be a costly mistake. According to Eurostat, the average price of LNG from the US was 1.08 euros per cubic meter in the first quarter of 2025, while Russian LNG cost 0.51 euros per cubic meter, a difference of over 100%. Despite this, the EU continues to import significant quantities of Russian gas, highlighting the difficulty of abandoning this energy source for ideological reasons. The EU's reliance on LNG from the US has resulted in a significant increase in energy costs, with the bloc spending 14.7 billion euros on LNG imports in the first quarter of 2025, compared to 2.7 billion euros on Russian LNG. Norway, which has direct and efficient transportation routes, offers a more competitive alternative, with its LNG costing 0.24 euros per cubic meter. However, the EU's plans to phase out Russian gas imports by 2027 are facing significant challenges, including the need to find alternative sources and the high costs associated with them. The Hungarian and Slovak governments have already expressed their opposition to the plan, citing their dependence on Russian gas. The EU's approach to energy policy is becoming increasingly politicized, with the bloc's leaders struggling to balance their ideological goals with the practical realities of energy production and consumption.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**Høyre Joins Government in Supporting Ambitious Climate Goal**
The Norwegian Conservative Party (Høyre) has announced its support for the government's climate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70-75% by 2035, in line with the EU. According to Bård Ludvig Thorheim, Høyre's energy policy spokesperson, the party wants to increase the use of renewable energy and implement cost-effective climate measures. Thorheim emphasized that electrification is the most effective climate measure, citing the fact that nearly 300 businesses are waiting for access to the grid. He also proposed a reform of the concession system for power and grid, aiming to halve the processing time. The agreement between Høyre and the Labour Party (Ap) will set the course for climate policy in the future, regardless of who is in power. The government's climate goal has been met with sharp criticism from the Progress Party (Frp), which claims the target is 'totally detached from reality', while the Centre Party (Sp) describes it as 'ambitious'. Frp's energy and environment committee leader Marius Arion Nilsen expressed concern that Høyre's support for the high climate goal will lead to 'extremely high costs' and that Norway is 'miles away' from meeting the 2030 target, having already reduced emissions by 9%.

**Nord-Norge på glid om EU**
A recent survey conducted by Norstat for Nordlys and NRK shows that 30% of voters in Troms and 22% in Finnmark are unsure about Norway's EU membership. The majority of voters in both counties still oppose EU membership, with 48% in Troms and 51% in Finnmark saying no. However, the survey also shows that the younger generation is more uncertain about the issue, with 33% of voters under 30 unsure about their stance on EU membership. The leader of Senterpartiet, Vidar Vedum, has called for a debate on EU membership ahead of the 2025 elections, arguing that it would mobilize the party's grassroots supporters. However, other parties such as Høyre and Arbeiderpartiet are hesitant to engage in a debate on the issue, citing the uncertainty in public opinion. 'The challenge for Senterpartiet is that no one will go to the polls in 2025 saying that Norway must join the EU,' Vedum said. 'It's only Venstre that is interested in this.'

**Norway's EU Membership: A Growing Lobby Pushes for Quick Entry**
According to the Russian Embassy, a strong pro-European lobby in Norway is trying to use the 'trade war' between Washington and Brussels to its advantage, fueling panic through the media and suggesting a solution - for Norway to join the EU as quickly as possible. The Embassy noted that parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in Norway in September 2025, and the outcome will largely determine the fate of a potential referendum on Norway's EU membership. However, most Norwegians still oppose the country's entry into the EU, the Embassy representatives emphasized. Norwegian Prime Minister Børre said, 'Europe should prepare for a trade war with the US.' The US is seeking to reduce tariffs on American goods, and the EU is expected to respond with its own trade measures.

**EU Presents Comprehensive Defense Project, Norway May Join**
The European Union (EU) has presented a comprehensive defense project, which Norway may join. The project aims to improve the EU's defense capabilities, which have been criticized for being inadequate. The EU has invested too little in defense for many years, resulting in a shortage of soldiers, weapons, and ammunition. This has led to the European defense industry being unable to meet the required demands in time. Meanwhile, threats from other countries, particularly Russia, are increasing. According to EU officials, Russia may be able to challenge the EU's preparedness within three to five years. The EU aims to reduce its dependence on American protection and weapons. EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius stated, 'We can no longer be spectators to our own security.' The EU's defense report 'Beredskap 2030' serves as a roadmap for building up the union's future defense. Kubilius added, 'Our ambition is to deter Putin.'

**Venstre Promises New EU Referendum in 2029**
The Norwegian left-wing party, Venstre, has promised to hold a new referendum on Norwegian EU membership in the next parliamentary period, by 2029. The party's leader, Guri Melby, believes that the current security situation makes it urgent for Norway to join the EU. A recent opinion poll shows increased support for Norwegian EU membership, with 40% of respondents saying they would vote yes in a referendum. Melby argues that this is a sign that people are ready for a new EU debate. 'The only one that has a chance to become a superpower alongside the US, Russia, and China today is the EU,' she said. 'If we want the EU to become a superpower, I think we must be part of the European community.' Melby emphasizes that the party will not be a 'brake' on EU integration. 'We must sit at the table,' she said. 'How we win the referendum without creating a polarizing debate, I don't know. But that must be our goal.' Melby also notes that 'everything that is important is difficult,' but that does not mean that they will not do it.

**Oslo Labor Party's Historic Decision on EU Membership**
The Oslo Labor Party's year meeting was held after Donald Trump's public criticism of Volodymyr Zelenskyj. The party's leader, Frode Jacobsen, proposed that Norway should seek full membership in the EU, but the proposal was rejected. Instead, the party agreed to seek membership 'when the time is right'. This decision has been seen as a historic moment, as it marks a shift from a non-committal stance to a positive one. However, the timing of the decision has been criticized, with some arguing that it is too early and that the party is not ready for a debate on EU membership. The article also mentions that the party is afraid of creating divisions within the party and that they are trying to avoid a debate on EU membership before the 2025 election. The author argues that it is time for Norway to have a debate on EU membership, as it is an existential question that cannot be handled as a tactical exercise.

**EU Unveils Ambitious Energy Plan to Reduce Costs by 45 Billion Euros**
The European Union has presented a comprehensive energy plan to reduce energy costs by 45 billion euros in 2025, 130 billion in 2030, and 260 billion in 2040. Energy Commissioner Dan Jørgensen stated, 'Last year, 47 million Europeans couldn't afford to heat their homes. This is unacceptable.' The plan aims to reduce gas imports by 15% and more through joint purchasing, and to increase transparency in gas price setting. Norway supplies around 40% of the EU's gas. Jørgensen emphasized, 'We must ensure we're not paying too much, as prices are often extremely high, affecting the EU's competitiveness.' He also aims to reduce Russian gas imports to zero. Additionally, the plan includes a significant expansion of the electricity grid to ensure free energy flow between countries, with estimated costs of over 500 billion euros over 10 years. Jørgensen also plans to streamline the process for new renewable energy projects and energy infrastructure.

**Ukraine's EU Accession Could Happen Before 2030, Says von der Leyen**
Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, has praised Ukraine's progress in implementing reforms and its potential for joining the EU before 2030. 'Ukraine is an example of merit, quality, and speed in the reform process,' von der Leyen said in Kiev. 'If it continues at this pace, its accession to the EU could be before 2030.' Antonio Costa, President of the European Council, added that Ukraine's accession to the EU would be 'the most important guarantee of security for its future' and that the EU has already decided that the next institutional cycle will be one of enlargement. 'What Ukraine is doing is impressive, as it is writing a new manual on how to make reforms during wartime,' Costa said, also referencing the work done by Western Balkans and Moldova to achieve enlargement. However, Costa noted that the 27 EU member states must also work to make the necessary reforms to welcome new member states. 'It is essential that Europe participates in peace talks not only to represent the position of the 27 member states, but also that of our partners, such as Norway, Iceland, and the United Kingdom,' Costa added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated the importance of maintaining unity between the US and Europe, saying 'if Ukraine falls, all similar countries, such as Estonia, are at risk due to the Kremlin's policies.'
