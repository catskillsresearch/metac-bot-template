**UK Must Prepare for War, Says Labour Leader Keir Starmer**
UK must prepare for war, said Labour leader Keir Starmer in a defense industry in Scotland on Monday, presenting a report on the state of the country's defense. - The threat we face today is more serious, less predictable, and more immediate than anything we've seen since the end of the Cold War. We are facing a war in Europe, a new nuclear threat, cyber attacks, increased Russian aggression in our territorial waters and airspace, and their reckless behavior is leading to increased living costs in our country. This is a new era for security and defense, said Starmer. The British government has announced an increase in defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and now aims to reach 3%. Six new ammunition factories will be built to replenish the army's dwindling stockpiles, which are being depleted as artillery ammunition is sent to Ukraine. A new generation of nuclear weapons and submarines is being developed, and new drones, ships, and aircraft will be acquired to increase naval capabilities. The Times reports that the government is considering purchasing American F35A fighter jets to be able to launch nuclear weapons from the air. However, there are question marks about the pace of the buildup. - I'm not going to engage in fantasy politics and take dates out of the air now, said Starmer when pressed by the BBC about when the 3% target will be met. Ministers have spoken of 'the end of the next parliamentary term' - but within Starmer's Labour Party, criticism is growing that they have already cut aid and support for poor families. Meanwhile, the center and right-wing opposition argue that it is happening too slowly. Former army chief Richard Dannatt is among those who criticize the pace of the buildup. - A vague goal of increasing defense spending to 3% by 2034 is not enough, it's like asking Adolf Hitler to wait until 1946 to attack us in 1938, he said.

**UK Prepares for Possible War with Russia, Announces Defense Spending**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated on Monday (2) that the United Kingdom faces a threat 'more grave, more immediate, and more unpredictable than at any other time since the Cold War', and anticipated that the country's Armed Forces are preparing for a potential armed conflict. Starmer made this warning in a speech in Glasgow, Scotland, on the occasion of the presentation of the Defense Review, commissioned by experts from the government to know how to deal with growing threats, such as nuclear and cyber attacks. 'There is a 'growing Russian aggression', whose 'imprudent actions are increasing the cost of living in our country', said Starmer, emphasizing that the United Kingdom is moving towards 'preparation for war as the central objective of our Armed Forces'. Starmer explained that these threats require 'a new era for defense and security' and emphasized that his government 'will never compromise' the national security of the United Kingdom. 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared. And, frankly, to show them that we are ready to achieve peace by force', he added. Starmer stated that the United Kingdom will build a more integrated, more prepared, and more lethal combat force than ever before. According to him, everything the United Kingdom does in terms of defense will contribute to the strengthening of NATO, a collective military alliance that means 'we will never fight alone'. 'It is a fundamental source of our strategic strength. That's why our defense policy will always prioritize NATO', he concluded. Another goal of the government is to focus on innovation, Starmer emphasized, citing drones, destroyers, and aircraft with Artificial Intelligence (AI) as combat equipment, in order to create Armed Forces ten times more lethal by 2035. 'Each citizen of this country has a role to play, because we must recognize that things have changed in the world today', he declared. As part of its defense investment, the government announced yesterday that the country will build up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines and invest £15 billion (approximately R$ 116.9 billion) in its nuclear warhead program. On Saturday, it announced that it will invest £1.5 billion (approximately R$ 11.6 billion) in the construction of at least six ammunition and explosive components factories, as well as acquiring up to 7,000 long-range British-made firearms.

**Farage Criticizes 'Net Zero' Policies for Job Losses and Promises to Protect UK Gas Before Crucial Scottish By-Election - Internewscast Journal**
Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform party, has criticized the UK's 'net zero' policies for causing job losses in the oil and gas industry. He stated, 'We can con ourselves as much as we like. history “Even the most adren proponent of net zero has to accept the world will still be using oil and gas up until 2050 and beyond.' Farage warned that Scotland is 'literally de-industrialising before our eyes' and that the public is waking up to the fact that the policies are putting a 'massive cost' on the country. He also acknowledged that it would be an 'earthquake' level shock if Reform's candidate wins the upcoming Holyrood by-election in Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse, but stated that the party 'can replicate success in Scotland'.

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognize the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**UK to Build 12 New Nuclear-Powered Submarines and Invest £15 Billion in Warhead Program**
The UK government has announced plans to build 12 new nuclear-powered submarines and invest £15 billion ($20.25 billion) in a nuclear warhead program. According to Defense Minister John Healey, these steps are necessary to 'counter Russian aggression.' The program, part of the AUKUS agreement, aims to replace the current Astute-class submarines with new SSN-AUKUS models, with one submarine to be built every 18 months. The investment is expected to create 30,000 high-skilled jobs across the country by the 2030s. Healey stated, 'Our exceptional submariners patrol 24/7 to ensure our security and that of our allies, but we know threats are growing, and we must act decisively to counter Russian aggression.' The program will also modernize the infrastructure at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) in Aldermaston, creating over 9,000 jobs, and provide thousands more jobs throughout the supply chain across the UK, from Scotland to Somerset. 'As a British program for creating sovereign warheads and a British conventional submarine fleet, they will ensure the security of the UK and NATO for decades to come,' the release noted.

**Achieving child poverty target could cost £920m a year in benefits,...**
A report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) suggests that Scotland could meet its 2030 child poverty target, but at a cost of £920 million a year in benefits. The report, which examined the costs and impacts of different measures to tackle child poverty, found that increasing the Scottish Child Payment to £40 a week would have the best poverty reduction impact per pound, but would only bring the child poverty rate down to 18%. However, by supplementing the benefit for families with babies and single parents, and boosting take-up to 100%, combined with other measures such as boosting employment among parents in poverty, 90,000 youngsters could be lifted out of poverty, meeting the 10% target. Chris Birt, associate director at the JRF, said, 'Holyrood has the chance to prove that it's up to the task of not just setting lofty ambitions, but straining every sinew to deliver on them.' Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville welcomed the report and said, 'We are absolutely committed to meeting the 2030 child poverty targets and thanks to the actions we are already taking, families in the poorest 10% of households are estimated to be £2,600 a year better off in 2025-26.'

**From submarines to Trident: The UK's nuclear capability explained**
The UK will build up to 12 new nuclear-powered submarines, as part of a £15bn investment in new nuclear warheads and military infrastructure. The plans, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, will significantly increase the UK's conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine fleet. The new submarines will be built under a joint deal with the US and Australia, known as the Aukus partnership. The UK's current fleet of nine submarines includes five Astute-class conventionally armed nuclear-powered attack vessels and four Vanguard-class ballistic missile submarines. A new group, the Dreadnought class, will be introduced in the early 2030s, which will be both nuclear-powered and ballistic missile-armed. The Royal Navy Submarine Service base in HMNB Clyde, Scotland, is one of Scotland's largest employers, employing over 6,000 military and civilian personnel. The submarines play a key role in the UK's nuclear deterrent, with the Royal Navy website stating, 'Their presence alone sends the most powerful message to anyone who would do us harm.'

**Disposable vapes banned in Scotland from today in public health crackdown**
A ban on disposable vapes in Scotland has come into effect, as part of the Scottish Government's efforts to reduce nicotine use and environmental damage. The ban, which aligns with a similar measure in England and Wales, makes it illegal to sell or buy disposable vapes in the country. According to Gillian Martin, Scotland's acting Net Zero Secretary, 'Scotland was the first nation in the UK to commit to taking action on single-use vapes.' The ban aims to prevent the estimated 26 million disposable vapes thrown away in Scotland in 2023 from causing environmental harm and health concerns. 'It's estimated that over half of disposable vapes are incorrectly disposed of each year in Scotland, creating a fire risk and littering our beautiful environment,' Martin said. The Scottish Government plans to move towards a tobacco-free generation by 2034.

**Disposable vapes ban comes into force**
A ban on disposable vapes in Scotland has come into force, as part of the Scottish Government's efforts to reduce nicotine use and environmental damage. According to estimates, 26 million disposable vapes were thrown away in Scotland in 2023, with over half not being recycled properly and 10% littered. Acting Net Zero Secretary Gillian Martin said, 'Scotland was the first nation in the UK to commit to taking action on single-use vapes. It's estimated that over half of disposable vapes are incorrectly disposed of each year in Scotland, creating a fire risk and littering our beautiful environment. They also contain nicotine which is highly addictive.' The ban is part of the UK-wide Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which aims to move towards a tobacco-free generation by 2034.

**Scotland's Climate Aims: A Path to Net-Zero by 2045**
The Scottish government has been advised by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) to set four carbon budgets for the period from 2026 to 2045. The carbon budgets are a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted into the atmosphere over a certain period to keep temperatures within a certain limit. The CCC recommended that the Scottish government set carbon budgets that require a 57% reduction in emissions by 2030, 69% by 2035, 80% by 2040, and 94% by 2045 compared to 1990 levels. The Scottish government has been advised to prioritize the development of onshore and offshore wind power, as well as solar power, which needs to grow by more than three times from 15 gigawatts in 2023 to 49 gigawatts by 2035 and 66 gigawatts by 2045. This growth in renewable energy capacity will help Scotland generate 98% of its electricity by 2035, meeting the growing demand for this vital resource in Scotland and the rest of the UK. The CCC also recommended that the Scottish government set a target of making electricity cheap, by removing policy and tax costs from electricity bills. This will require the Scottish government to work with the UK government to ensure that the target is met. According to Morag Watson, Director of Onshore Wind at Scottish Renewables, 'The advice from the Climate Change Committee makes it clear that Scotland cannot deliver a balanced and credible pathway to its climate ambitions without accelerating the deployment of renewable energy, the new grid infrastructure and clean heat solutions.' She added, 'As we approach the publication of the Heat in Buildings Bill, we are calling on the Scottish government to take decisive action'.

**Scotland could take until 2080 to reach net zero, Conservatives claim**
The Scottish Conservatives have claimed that Scotland will not reach net zero until 2080, 35 years after its target date, based on current projections. The party criticized the 'snail's pace progress' Scotland has made in reducing emissions in recent years, saying that the legally binding goal of reaching net zero by 2045 'is now little more than a pipe dream'. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) warned earlier this week that hitting the 2045 target could cost 'around £750 million per year'. The CCC suggested that about three-fifths of cars and vans should be electric by 2035, and that two-fifths of homes should be heated by low-carbon electric systems by 2035. Scottish Government ministers have stressed their commitment to meeting the 2045 target, but the Conservatives have called for an 'affordable transition to net zero which prioritises keeping bills low over only focusing on meeting arbitrary deadlines'.

The Climate Change Committee (CCC) has advised the Scottish Government that achieving net zero by 2045 will require 'immediate action at pace and scale'. The CCC suggests that by 2035, three-fifths of cars and vans should be fully electric, and two-fifths of homes should be heated by low-carbon electric systems. To achieve this, the CCC recommends a 'rapid increase' in the installation of heat pumps and electric vehicles, with annual heat pump installations in existing homes reaching nearly 35,000 by 2030. The CCC also stressed the importance of making electricity cheaper and increasing the number of public EV charge points. Interim CCC chair Professor Piers Forster said, 'Scotland's new system of carbon budgets will help guide the action we need to get to net zero by 2045.' Acting Net Zero Secretary Gillian Martin said the government will 'carefully consider the committee's advice before bringing forward regulations to set carbon budget levels for Scotland.'

**Scottish Government admits it has ditched target to cut car use**
The Scottish Government has admitted to ditching its target to cut car use in Scotland by 20% by 2030, citing it as 'unrealistic'. Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop stated that the government will have 'more realistic targets' and will need to 'drop the target' or 'change the target from 20%'. The decision comes after a report from Audit Scotland and the Accounts Commission criticized the government for having no clear plan to meet the ambitious target. Friends of the Earth Scotland's head of campaigns, Caroline Rance, called the development 'shameful', highlighting the impact of toxic air pollution on vulnerable households. Despite ditching the car target, the Scottish Government remains committed to its goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2045.

**Navigating the Renewable Energy Landscape: Post-Brexit and Government Transition in the UK**
The UK's renewable energy targets have shifted following Brexit, and the Ukraine-Russia War has made the transition to renewables a priority. The Labour Party has set ambitious targets for clean energy by 2030, which will require an investment programme averaging over £40 billion annually. According to the National Energy System Operator (NESO), this can be achieved without increasing costs for consumers, compromising security of supply, or reducing local economic and job opportunities. Scotland has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy strategy, with 113% of its electricity consumption coming from renewable energy sources in 2024. The country is renowned for its onshore and offshore wind energy, and has pioneered innovations in tidal and wave energy. The UK must adopt a multi-faceted approach to renewables, including increasing capacity, optimising existing infrastructure, and integrating innovative technologies. Collaboration with international models and a commitment to public engagement will be essential in achieving the UK's renewable energy goals.

**Scotland will miss 2030 child poverty target without urgent investment, warns think tank**
A new analysis from the Institute for Public Policy Research Scotland (IPPR Scotland) warns that over 210,000 children in Scotland will be trapped in poverty by 2030 without urgent investment from the Scottish Government. The report notes that First Minister John Swinney has described eradicating child poverty as “the single most important objective” of the Scottish Government. However, researchers say that a “business as usual” approach to social security would leave 22% of Scotland’s children in poverty by 2030, while in the rest of the UK, 32% of children could be in poverty at the end of the decade. To meet Scotland’s legal child poverty target, researchers say that additional spending is necessary, specifically increasing social security payments to families in or at risk of poverty. They modelled an uplift to the Scottish Child Payment, finding that doubling its real terms value would add around £500 million to the social security budget in 2030, and would lift 40,000 more children out of poverty.

**Scotland faces 'dole baby dole´, Tories say, as North Sea oil plan...**
The Conservatives have accused the Labour government of planning a 'dole baby dole' scenario for Scotland's oil industry, as it considers ending new oil and gas field licences. Shadow Scotland secretary Andrew Bowie said this would be a 'betrayal of those workers' in the sector. Industry minister Sarah Jones pledged a 'well-managed, orderly and prosperous transition' away from oil and gas, but Andrew Bowie argued that companies are leaving the UK for other countries due to the government's 'mad rush to clean power 2030'. He also claimed that the government is 'aggressively and at pace shutting down its domestic oil and gas industry'. Ms Jones said that the government is 'working with businesses, workers and communities to strengthen north-east Scotland's status as the energy capital of the UK' and that 'sprinting to clean energy is the only way to deliver energy security and good long-term jobs for the workforce and communities.'

**Windfall tax on oil and gas companies to end in 2030, UK Government confirms**
The UK Government has confirmed that the windfall tax on oil and gas companies will end in 2030, with a new consultation launched on a replacement regime. The consultation aims to protect jobs and deliver a 'fair return for the nation, during times of unusually high prices'. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said, 'The North Sea will be at the heart of Britain's energy future.' Scottish Secretary Ian Murray added, 'Scotland is at the heart of the UK Government's clean energy future.' Industry figures welcomed the announcement, with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) saying it highlighted the Government's commitment to a managed transition. The UK's net zero economy is growing faster than the rest of the economy, and the future is green growth and managing the transition away from fossil fuels to a clean energy future for the North Sea is vital to achieving it.

**Groundhog Decade**
A recent article in The National claimed that the Scottish branch of Reform UK would have a significant say in the party's policy, but this is not true. According to the party's structure, the Scottish branch would have no more say than Ruth Davidson did in 2012 or Anas Sarwar has now. Nigel Farage's opinion would ultimately decide the policy, and he has made no comment on the subject. The article also notes that Reform UK's voters are largely elderly, but younger voters in the rest of the UK are less bothered about Scotland leaving the UK. In fact, only 1 in 3 younger voters said they would be upset if Scotland left. The author of the article, 'wingsoverscotland.com', concludes that the future of Scottish politics looks 'grimly dull' and that independence will not be a live topic again until at least 2031. As the author sarcastically notes, 'We hope that’s enough to sustain everyone until 2031'.
