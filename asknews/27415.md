**Wu Jing-yi Questions '2028 No-Coal Mid-Fire' Plan: Genuine or Ploy for Nuclear Power Referendum?**
Taiwanese politician Wu Jing-yi has questioned whether the proposed '2028 no-coal mid-fire' plan is a genuine attempt to improve air quality or a ploy to pave the way for a nuclear power referendum. Wu said that the current strategy of the ruling and opposition parties is to 'abolish coal, not subsidize Taipower, and not raise electricity prices', but in reality, they are using their legislative power to interfere with the administration's authority. Wu pointed out that the current plan to achieve mid-fire without coal by 2034 is already in place, and the Kuomintang's proposal to accelerate the timeline to 2028 without providing any alternative energy solutions is 'intentionally creating an energy crisis and inducing electricity panic to justify their nuclear power extension advocacy.' Wu criticized the Kuomintang's actions as an overreach of their legislative power and a disregard for energy expertise, saying that energy transformation requires scientific planning and technical support. She also warned Taichung Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen that 'the air at Guanyuan' will not generate electricity, and that if Lu is genuinely concerned about air pollution, she should urge Taipower to accelerate the construction of gas-fired power plants. Wu asked Lu, 'If you support using the energy issue in Taichung to manipulate the nuclear power extension referendum, do you support storing nuclear waste at home? Do you support storing nuclear waste in Taichung?' Wu concluded that the only way to achieve a normal parliament is through a large-scale recall, as these politicians have 'gone mad.'

**Wu Jingyi Questions Lu Hsiu-yen's Motives on Nuclear Power Plant Delay and 'No Coal' Proposal**
Media person Wu Jingyi questioned whether the proposal to delay the shutdown of the Third Nuclear Power Plant is a genuine environmental concern or a ploy to pave the way for a nuclear power plant referendum. She pointed out that the opposition party's strategy is to 'no coal, no subsidy to Taipower, and no electricity price increase' and that the Legislative Yuan's proposal to achieve 'no coal' by 2028 is not a genuine concern for air pollution in Taichung, but rather a deliberate attempt to force Taiwan to play a political game at a critical juncture in the energy sector. Wu Jingyi stated that the current plan to achieve 'no coal' by 2034 is a reasonable and scientifically-planned goal, but the Kuomintang's proposal to accelerate the timeline to 2028 without providing any alternative energy solutions is a reckless and unprofessional move. She also questioned whether Lu Hsiu-yen, the chairperson of the Legislative Yuan, would support storing nuclear waste in Taichung, and asked if she would support storing nuclear waste in her own home. Wu Jingyi emphasized that Taiwan is located in a seismically active area and that these lawmakers are pushing for nuclear power plant delay in the 'low-end' areas of the south, while the country's high-tech industry is thriving. She concluded that only a mass recall can bring about a normal parliament, as these lawmakers have gone mad.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China warned the US not to 'play with fire' over Taiwan, in response to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's accusations that Beijing is preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and seeking to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson in a statement issued after midnight. Beijing expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore warned that the Chinese military 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and hinted at the supposed intention to do so before 2027. 'Let me be clear: any attempt by the Communist Party (Chinese) to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world (...) The Chinese threat is real. And it could be imminent,' emphasized the Pentagon chief. China also accused the US of fomenting confrontation between blocs, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea, and 'turning the region into a powder keg.' The spokesperson warned the US not to 'harbor illusions' about using the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and announced a formal protest had been lodged with Washington. 'China manages its differences through dialogue and in accordance with the law,' the spokesperson said.

**US and China Engage in Confrontational Rhetoric Over Taiwan**
The rhetoric has become sharper and the tone more confrontational between Washington and Beijing in Singapore, as they accuse each other of destabilizing the Indo-Pacific region. At the center of the dispute is Taiwan and the question of how long peace will last. The Chinese government has strongly criticized US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth's comments on the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, accusing the US of undermining 'peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region' and turning it into a 'powder keg'. Beijing also warned the US government against interfering in the Taiwan issue. Hegseth had warned of a possible Chinese military intervention in Taiwan at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore, saying 'China's army is training for the worst-case scenario.' 'We will not sugarcoat it - the threat from China is real, and it could happen at any moment,' he added. Chinese Admiral Hu Gangfeng countered that Hegseth's accusations were 'unfounded' and aimed at 'provoking conflicts' and destabilizing the Asian-Pacific region. Hegseth also called on Asian allies to increase their defense spending in the face of the 'threat from communist China', saying that 'deterrence has its price.' China aims to become the dominant power in Asia and control the entire region, he said. 'But we will not start a conflict with China. However, we will not let ourselves be pushed out of this critical region. And we will not allow our allies and partners to be subordinated.' China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, despite the island having had an independent and democratically elected government for decades. The People's Republic has threatened to use military force to annex Taiwan if it does not do so peacefully.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had stated that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is currently on track to reach defence spending levels of 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is optimistic about the progress of the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine deal.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**

In his Saturday speech, Hegseth had warned that China seeks to 'dominate and control' Asia, and assured that Washington will not allow Beijing to modify the status quo by force.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**Taiwan and China: A Path to Reunification?**
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has called for dialogue and peace with China, but Beijing has set conditions for talks. China has accused Tsai of undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and damaging the island's well-being during her first term. Beijing has demanded that Taiwan stop its 'provocative' actions and recognize that both sides belong to one China. The US has also been accused of fueling tensions by increasing military cooperation with Taiwan. China has expressed concern over the US-Taiwan relationship, which it sees as a threat to its national security. The US has maintained its support for Taiwan, and it is unlikely that the US will abandon Taiwan or make it a bargaining chip in talks with China. China's President Xi Jinping has stated that he will not hesitate to use any opportunity to reunify Taiwan peacefully, but without compromising China's great rejuvenation. The reunification of Taiwan with China is expected to happen before 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

**Preparing for the Challenges of 2035: Taiwan Must Be Ready**
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has released a report titled 'Possible Scenarios for 2035' which presents three possible scenarios: China's economy stagnating, the United States' global leadership waning, and the global trust system collapsing. The report consulted with multiple think tanks, including the Brookings Institution, the American Enterprise Institute, and the RAND Corporation, to identify the driving factors behind structural changes and their potential far-reaching effects. It is not meant to predict the future, but rather to help countries understand how to respond to the changing trends and provide warnings and take action. The report highlights the importance of Taiwan being prepared for the challenges that lie ahead, regardless of the scenario that unfolds. Taiwan must be aware that China's economic stagnation or continued growth will bring different security and economic challenges. If China's economy stagnates, it may increase the possibility of Beijing taking more aggressive actions against Taiwan; if the US' global leadership wanes, Taiwan may face reduced US support in the region. In the event of a global trust collapse, Taiwan's economy, which is heavily reliant on international trade, will be particularly vulnerable.

**US Think Tank Warns of Nuclear War if China Invades Taiwan in 2030**
A recent report by the Atlantic Council, a US think tank, has warned that if China were to invade Taiwan in 2030, the Korean Peninsula could become a second battlefield, and a nuclear war may be unavoidable. The report, titled 'Guardian Tiger II', simulated a hypothetical scenario in which China launches a large-scale conventional war against Taiwan, leading to a US-China confrontation. According to the report, North Korea would play a significant role in this conflict, with China and North Korea sharing intelligence and North Korea launching short-range ballistic missiles at US military bases in South Korea. The report warns that the conflict could escalate into a nuclear war, with China using nuclear weapons to cut off Taiwan's external aid and then invoking a military alliance treaty with North Korea to justify its intervention in the Korean Peninsula. The report also suggests that the US may struggle to make a quick decision on whether to use nuclear force in response to North Korea's provocations, given the complexity of the situation. Experts are calling for the US to reorganize its command and control systems in the Indo-Pacific region and to engage in regular trilateral security talks with South Korea and Japan to address the synchronized threats from China and North Korea.

**China, the war-monger - The Singapore Post**
China has rejected a proposal from US President Donald Trump to cut the defense budget by 50%, which would have reduced the chance of a global war and spared funds for development. Instead, China has increased its defense budget to a record high of $249 billion, a 7.2% increase over the previous year. This move has triggered an arms race, with the US and its allies stepping up their defense efforts to combat the threat. The US has announced plans to develop a next-generation fighter jet, the NGAD, which will be way ahead of any other fighter aircraft of the current generation. China has been modernizing its navy and air force, with plans to possess six aircraft carriers by 2035. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is on the rise, and nations facing the Chinese threat are not sitting idle, increasing their defense budgets and developing advanced arms and weapon platforms. Posterity will brand China as the war-monger, having triggered an arms race through its aggressive moves.

**Taiwan's military exercises to focus on invasion preparation**
Taiwan's military is conducting exercises focused on preparing for a potential invasion by China in 2027, a deadline previously mentioned by security experts and military officials. Former US Navy admiral Philip Davidson warned that China could attempt to invade Taiwan by 2027, while Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly instructed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be prepared for an invasion by then. However, Su Tzu-yun, a fellow at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, noted that there is no clear indication a formal decision has been made to resort to force by then. Security analysts worldwide have urged their governments to prepare for a possible conflict, and the Han Kuang exercises' focus on 2027 is a logical response to these concerns, according to Su. 'It could create a perfect storm,' he said, 'if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership.' The defence ministry's 'immediate response drills' were specifically designed to deter China from 'turning exercises into war,' Su added. 'The principle of risk control was followed,' he said. 'It is normal to use timelines as a reference for defence strategy,' Su noted. 'The US military must be prepared for contingencies before then,' said former US Indo-Pacific commander John Aquilino. 'China is accelerating its military expansion, particularly in dual-use shipyards and nuclear weapons launch platforms,' said US Air Force Strategic Commander General Anthony Cotton. 'These developments align with preparations to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027,' he added. 'The US should expedite its own military production in response,' Cotton said. 'It is a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,' said former CIA director William Burns, describing Xi's directive to the PLA. 'China is accelerating its military expansion,' Burns added. 'It will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Davidson. 'Whether or not China launches an invasion in 2027, it will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' he added. 'Alternative deadlines have been proposed, including 2035 and 2049, both of which mark major PLA anniversaries,' Su noted. 'However, if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership,' he warned.

**Taiwan Warns of Potential War with China in 2027**
A potential war between Taiwan and China may start in 2027, according to a document published by Bloomberg. The document, intended to inform Taiwanese lawmakers about future military drills, mentions the year as a possible date for a Chinese attack. '2027 is a way to overcome the contradictions in the Taiwanese parliament, where opposition parties reject military spending plans,' said Jack Chen, director of the Formosa Defense Vision rights group. Chen added that it could pressure the opposition to feel that increasing the military budget is a pressing need. A marker of China's readiness for an attack on Taiwan is Chinese leader Xi Jinping's demand to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to 'become more modern' by 2027 and a world-class army by 2047. Additionally, US officials have warned Taiwan about the threat of a 2027 invasion: by that time, China plans to increase the number of fighter jets, military ships, and double its stockpiles of conventional ballistic and cruise missiles. 'Chinese forces are conducting aggressive military exercises around Taiwan, and the official rhetoric from Beijing is full of threats against the island,' the Bloomberg journalists added. Taiwan considers itself an independent state, while China sees it as a breakaway province. Taiwan has its own constitution, army, and elected government. The island complains that Beijing is increasingly conducting missions near Taiwan, and Chinese fighter jets frequently violate Taiwan's air defense zone.

**TSMC to Invest $165 Billion in US Chip Production, US to Control 22% of Global Market by 2030**
Taiwanese company TSMC plans to increase its investments in advanced chip production in the US to $165 billion, which will give the US control over more than 22% of the global market by 2030. This decision is driven by several factors, including reducing geopolitical risks associated with concentrating production in Taiwan and the escalation of trade wars and tariffs. According to TrendForce, Taiwan's share of the global market for advanced chips will decrease from 71% in 2021 to 58% by 2030 due to the growth of production in the US and China. However, the increase in production in the US may lead to higher chip prices due to increased production costs. As TSMC's CEO said, 'the impact of new investments on the market is currently insignificant.'

**Lin Yifu: China's Economy Will Surpass the US by 2030**
Lin Yifu, a Taiwanese-born Chinese economist, spoke at the 'Taiwanese Enterprises Association Great Lecture Hall' in Beijing, saying that it's difficult to say whether the US will benefit more than China in the trade war, as the US is an extremely practical country that will 'follow you and live in peace' when it can't 'strangle' you. He believes that China has a strong belief in its own abilities and will 'ride the wind and break through the waves' as long as it does its job well. According to Lin, China's economy will surpass the US by 2030, and its per capita GDP will reach 50% or even higher than the US by 2049, assuming no external influences such as trade wars. He also stated that the US is not only targeting China, but also other countries like Canada and Mexico. Lin believes that China's internal market and supply chain advantages will allow it to thrive in this challenging environment and even widen the gap with other countries. He also emphasized that China's goal of becoming a modernized strong nation and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation by 2049 is 'inevitable' and that Taiwan will not be left behind.

**Taiwanese Government Encourages Local Banks to Finance Offshore Wind Power**
The Ministry of Finance will discuss ways to increase the participation of local banks in offshore wind power financing in the first half of this year. According to the plan, Taiwan Intelligent Energy Corporation will act as the main contractor, purchasing green energy and selling it directly to small-scale electricity retailers, increasing the flexibility of green energy operations and encouraging banks to provide financing. The Economic Department estimates that 1.08 trillion Taiwanese dollars in funding will be needed for offshore wind power development by 2030. Taiwan Intelligent Energy Corporation is currently in the fundraising stage, with China Steel as the main investor, but the company's shareholding will be reduced in the future. The Economic Department has announced that six private companies, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, have signed MOUs to express their intention to invest in the company. The government has also planned a flagship project to increase offshore wind power capacity to 10.9 GW by 2030 and 18.4 GW by 2035. However, the government faces another challenge: the demand for installation space before 2030 has been met. To address this issue, the National Development Council will launch three measures to strengthen the industry, including cross-ministerial discussions with the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Agriculture to utilize space for national defense, maritime routes, and fisheries. The government will also implement fee reductions, including port rental fees and electricity costs, with details to be announced in March. 'We are optimistic that we can see the effects of these measures by the first half of this year,' said an official. 'The government will continue to support the development of offshore wind power and create a favorable environment for investment.'

**China Builds Massive Military Complex, Ten Times Larger Than the Pentagon**
China is building a massive military complex, ten times larger than the Pentagon, according to the Financial Times. The construction began two years before 2027, the year Xi Jinping set as the deadline for the country's military to be able to attack Taiwan. The complex, located near Beijing, will serve as a command center in case of a regional or global conflict. It will provide shelter for high-ranking officials and military personnel in case of nuclear attacks on the People's Republic. The construction is part of China's modernization efforts, which include the expansion of its nuclear arsenal, with 100 new atomic warheads added in 2024, bringing the total to around 600. By 2030, this number is expected to reach 1,000. The Chinese military is also undergoing institutional reforms to modernize its units and reduce corruption, which is still a major issue within the People's Liberation Army. This effort is aimed at achieving the ultimate goal of the Xi Jinping regime: the reunification with Taiwan by 2049, the centenary of the birth of the People's Republic.
