**China Develops AI System to Verify Nuclear Warheads**
Chinese scientists have developed a new system using artificial intelligence to accurately distinguish between real and fake nuclear warheads. This is the first solution of its kind globally in the field of nuclear arms verification. According to a research paper published in April by researchers at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE), affiliated with the Chinese National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), this innovation has sparked widespread debate about the increasing role of artificial intelligence in managing weapons of mass destruction and the future of nuclear control. The study states that this project is based on a common verification protocol proposed by Chinese and US scientists over a decade ago, but faced numerous obstacles that prevented its practical implementation. The reasons for this delay, according to the researchers, include the difficulty of training and testing artificial intelligence using sensitive data related to nuclear warheads, as well as difficulties in convincing Chinese military leaders that the system does not pose a threat to national security. Some countries, such as the US, have expressed skepticism about this invention. The research team in their study published in the journal 'Science and Technology of Nuclear Energy', in statements carried by the 'News AZ' website, pointed out that 'the secrecy of nuclear warheads and their component designs prevent the disclosure of accurate data in this context', referring to the tension between the requirements of scientific transparency and the imperatives of military secrecy. The verification protocol, which bears the name 'Technical Verification Plan for Deep Learning Algorithm Based on Zero-Knowledge Interactive Protocol', relies on a multi-stage process that combines cryptography and nuclear physics. Using the 'Monte Carlo simulation' technique, the researchers created millions of virtual models of nuclear components, some containing highly enriched uranium used in weapons, and others containing misleading materials such as lead or low-enriched uranium. To avoid the system accessing sensitive designs of nuclear warheads, the researchers placed a 'polyethylene' barrier containing 400 holes between the inspection device and the nuclear head. This barrier allows radiation to pass through without revealing details of the internal design. Then, a deep learning neural network was trained on patterns of neutron flow, enabling it to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between real and fake warheads. The study found that implementing several random rounds of verification between inspectors and the host country can significantly reduce the likelihood of tampering to near zero. The strength of this system, according to the researchers, lies in its ability to evaluate the warhead's ability to cause a nuclear chain reaction, the core of any nuclear weapon, without the need to reveal details of its design. The artificial intelligence used does not know anything about the shape or design of the warhead, but it can verify its authenticity through partial radiation signals, some of which are intentionally hidden. The 'News AZ' website reported that this innovation is the first of its kind in the world and will enhance China's position in stalled nuclear disarmament talks, providing a mechanism for verification that balances military secrecy and transparency, which may rebuild trust and give Beijing a diplomatic card in international negotiations.

**China's grip on rare earths gives President Xi leverage in US trade duel**
The US and China are at odds over access to critical minerals, with Beijing having the upper hand. The US has accused China of violating a trade agreement struck in Geneva, and has imposed its own tech restrictions. China has tightened controls over rare earths, which are crucial for making fighter jets, nuclear reactor control rods, and other critical technology. The US is struggling to secure rare earths independently from Beijing, and Chinese firms have developed capable alternatives to most US chips. 'China's leverage is more durable than a lot of the US leverage at this stage,' said Cory Combs, associate director at consultancy Trivium China. The US has pledged to develop a complete mine-to-magnet rare earth supply chain for all domestic defense needs by 2027, but faces significant challenges. China's controls on rare earths are a warning against further escalation, but could inflict real pain on US defense supply chains if tensions worsen.

**China's Rare Earths Grip Gives Xi Leverage in US Trade Duel**
China's control over rare earths is giving President Xi Jinping leverage in the US-China trade duel. The Asian nation produces almost 70% of the world's critical minerals, which are essential for making fighter jets, nuclear reactor control rods, and other critical technology. China's tightening controls over rare earths are forcing the US to ease its restrictions, and Washington is still a decade away from securing rare earths independently from Beijing. 'China's leverage is more durable than a lot of the US leverage at this stage,' said Cory Combs, associate director at consultancy Trivium China. The impact of China's rare earths controls is not limited to American importers, with India's largest electric scooter maker, Bajaj Auto Ltd., warning that the country's vehicle production will take a hit if China doesn't resume shipments. 'Supplies and stocks are getting depleted as we speak,' said the firm's executive director Rakesh Sharma. China's squeeze on all countries highlights another risk for Trump: Strategic US sectors, such as batteries and semiconductors, depend on South Korea and Japan for components. If Beijing cuts off those US allies from rare earths, American firms could face even more pain.

**EUA to Develop 'Artificial Sun' with Big Tech Support**
Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a startup from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has raised over $1 billion (R$ 5.7 billion) to build the world's first commercial-scale fusion power plant in the United States. The investment was led by an unnamed hyperscale developer, according to Axios Pro. Google and Microsoft, among other big tech companies, have already invested in the project. Microsoft is also the cloud services provider for CFS. The ARC plant, which aims to start operations in the early 2030s, will generate 400 megawatts of clean and carbon-free electricity, enough to power large industrial facilities or around 150,000 homes. The plant will be built in collaboration with Dominion Energy Virginia, which will provide development and technical expertise, as well as land rights. CFS will finance, build, own, and operate the plant independently. The project is seen as a cleaner alternative to nuclear fission, using less resources and generating no long-lasting radioactive waste. However, harnessing fusion energy has proven to be challenging, requiring high temperatures to create and maintain the fusion reaction. CFS is currently developing its SPARC machine, which is expected to produce its first plasma in 2026 and demonstrate a commercially relevant project that produces more energy than it consumes.

**China's First Commercial Land-Based Modular Nuclear Reactor Set to Launch**
The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) is set to launch the Linglong-1, the world's first commercial land-based modular nuclear reactor. This compact reactor, also known as the ACP100, is designed to provide a new generation of nuclear energy that is safer, more accessible, and adaptable to various geographical and industrial contexts. The Linglong-1 is a 'bank of nuclear energy' due to its ability to provide continuous and reliable power. Unlike traditional reactors, small modular reactors (SMRs) like this one do not require large infrastructure and can be installed quickly. They are intended for use in industrial areas, mining regions, and isolated territories where energy demand is constant but logistical resources are limited. Each Linglong-1 reactor can generate 125,000 kilowatts, equivalent to approximately 1 billion kilowatt-hours per year, enough to power 526,000 homes and serve around 1 million people. The environmental impact is significant, as the reactor will reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 880,000 tons, equivalent to the ecological benefit of planting 7.5 million trees.

**China Uncovers "Limitless" Energy Reserves Capable of Powering the Country for 60,000 Years**
China has discovered a massive thorium reserve in the Bayan Obo mining complex in Inner Mongolia, which could power the country for 60,000 years. Thorium is a rare element that can be transformed into uranium-233, a fissile material, through neutron bombardment inside a molten-salt reactor (MSR). China plans to harness thorium's potential by building the world's first thorium molten-salt reactor plant, which is expected to produce 10 megawatts of electricity by 2029. The country's investment in thorium technology comes amid a broader global competition in nuclear energy development. According to senior engineer Fan Honghai, 'these thorium resources in tailings remain totally untouched,' and five years of mining waste from an iron ore site in Inner Mongolia contains enough thorium to supply the entire United States' household energy demands for more than a millennium.

**Anhui Hefei's 'Eastern Super Ring' Aims to Lead the World in Nuclear Fusion Power Generation**
China has been actively researching and developing nuclear fusion (nuclear fusion) energy facilities in recent years. In addition to the 'China Flow 3' in Chengdu, Sichuan, Anhui Hefei also has 'Eastern Super Ring', with several experimental devices under construction. According to the latest news, the Hefei compact fusion energy experiment device will be completed in 2027, and experts also emphasize that 'the first light of nuclear fusion' can be seen in 5 years. The construction of the compact fusion energy experiment device (BEST) project in Hefei has officially started, with a total weight of 6000 tons of components. BEST project director, Yan Jianwen, said, 'We will strive to complete the BEST project construction in 2027' and 'achieve the first deuterium-tritium (D-T) operation and discharge in the world.' Nuclear fusion energy refers to the energy released when two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier atomic nucleus. The main fuel for fusion is the isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, which are combined into helium, with the lost mass converted into super-strong energy, similar to the principle of solar radiation and heating. According to China Engineering Academy Academician, Li Jiangang, who is the commander-in-chief of the 'Fusion Reactor Main Machine Key System Comprehensive Research Facility', it is expected that a nuclear fusion energy experiment device can be built in 2027, and 'the first light of nuclear fusion' can be seen in 5 years.

**China's 'Artificial Sun' Exceeds 100 Million Degree Threshold in Nuclear Fusion Experiment**
Chinese scientists have developed a 'nuclear fusion reactor' called 'Huanliu-3' (HL-3), which has exceeded the 100 million degree threshold in ion and electron temperature values. According to CCTV, the HL-3 reactor in Chengdu, Sichuan province, has approached the nuclear fusion reaction temperatures similar to those of the Sun. Researchers have achieved an ion temperature of 117 million degrees and an electron temperature of 160 million degrees. Cong Vulu, the main designer of the reactor, said, 'We have achieved a major breakthrough in general fusion performance in our experiment, reaching the double 100 million degree target. This means that China's fusion research has entered the burning plasma stage.' Cong also emphasized that HL-3 is the first reactor where the entire heating, control, and diagnosis systems were developed in China. The researchers used large microwave generators to heat the electrons and high-energy particle beams to increase the temperature of the atomic nucleus. They have also developed a new method to confine the energy in the plasma core, overcoming instabilities that limited the temperature levels, and established new global standards for fusion experiments with high-precision control and diagnosis tools. China also has another plasma reactor called 'Deneysel Gelişmiş Süper İletken Tokamak' (EAST), which is located in Hefei, Anhui province, and is used for longer-term plasma experiments. HL-3 is expected to be used not only for research and experiments but also for the development of a real nuclear fusion reactor.

**China's 'Artificial Sun' Reaches Record-Breaking Temperatures in Nuclear Fusion Experiment**
China's 'artificial sun' has reached a temperature of 117 million degrees Celsius in ion heat value and 160 million degrees Celsius in electron heat value, according to CCTV. The Huanliu-3 (HL-3) experimental reactor, located in the capital of Sichuan province, Chengdu, has achieved a nuclear fusion reaction similar to that of the Sun. According to Cong Vulu, the main designer of the reactor, 'We achieved a major breakthrough in general fusion performance in our experiment, reaching the double 100 million degree target. This means that China's fusion research has entered the burning plasma stage.' Cong also emphasized that HL-3 is the first reactor to develop a fully domestic heating, control, and diagnostic system. The Tokamak, a nuclear fusion ring, controls the high-temperature plasma in a ring-shaped magnetic field. The nuclear reaction, where hydrogen atoms are converted to helium, releases a large amount of energy. To achieve record-breaking heat values, Cong and his team used large microwave generators to heat electrons and high-energy particle beams to increase the temperature of the atomic nucleus. Researchers have also developed a new method to confine the energy in the plasma core, overcoming instabilities that limited heat levels and creating new global standards for fusion experiments with high-precision control and diagnostic tools. China also has another plasma reactor called the 'Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak' (EAST), located in Hefei, Anhui province, which is used for longer-term plasma experiments. HL-3, which is larger than EAST, aims to develop a real nuclear fusion reactor for research and development, as well as practical use.

**China Aims to Launch Commercial Nuclear Fusion Power Plants by 2050**
China's National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has reaffirmed its ambitious plan to launch a series of 'artificial suns' - commercial nuclear fusion power plants - by 2050. To achieve this, a state-owned company, China Fusion Corp, was established on December 29, 2023, to collect investments and develop necessary technologies. According to a statement by CNNC, the commercial operation of the first project is expected to start around five years after the demonstration phase, which is scheduled to begin around 2045. China aims to surpass the US and other countries in the number of nuclear fusion reactors. Bloomberg reported that China Fusion Corp has attracted around $240 million in investments from CNNC and Zhejiang Zheneng Electric Power over the past year to develop ultra-modern tokamak reactors, which use magnetic fields to contain and control superheated plasma. CNNC plans to expand the development of conventional nuclear reactors (fission) and small modular reactors over the next five years, as stated by Xin Feng, deputy general director of the company. While nuclear fusion reactors are still in the experimental phase, China aims to increase the number of conventional nuclear power plants in the country. Since 2022, 10 new reactor blocks have been approved for construction each year, a pace that is expected to continue until at least 2030. This will allow China to surpass the US and France in the total number of reactors and ensure a stable energy supply.

**Behind China’s ‘secret’ laser facility**
A recent article in the press highlighted a US satellite photo of a large laser facility under construction in southwestern China, implying it was a secret project. However, the reality is that China has been working on this project, known as Shenguang-IV, since 2015. This facility will be capable of reaching fusion ignition and will rival the largest existing system, the US National Ignition Facility. Shenguang-IV will have up to 228 laser beams and a total pulse energy of between 1.5 and 2 megajoules. China's Shenguang laser facilities are situated in Mianyang, a leading center for research and development of nuclear weapons, directed energy weapons, and other military-related advanced technologies. The facilities belong to the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics, which has played a key role in China's effort to develop nuclear weapons. Laser fusion has a strong military connection and is also a pathway to fusion as a practical energy source. China is also pursuing other forms of inertial confinement fusion, including the Z-FFR fusion-fission hybrid reactor project, which uses a Z-pinch to compress and ignite the fusion fuel. The construction of this facility was approved by the government in 2021 and is expected to be completed soon.
