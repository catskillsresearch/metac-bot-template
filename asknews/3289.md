**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**Kashmir University Researchers Create India’s First Gene-Edited Sheep Using CRISPR Technology**
Researchers at Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology (SKUAST-Kashmir) have successfully created India's first gene-edited sheep using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The lamb, developed at the university's Centre for Animal Biotechnology, has an edited myostatin gene that boosts muscle growth, increasing muscle mass by nearly 30%. This trait is not naturally found in Indian sheep. 'This is not just the birth of a lamb, but the birth of a new era in livestock genetics in India,' said Dr. Nazir Ahmad Ganai, Vice Chancellor of SKUAST-Kashmir. The research team, led by Dr. Riyaz A Shah, used the CRISPR-Cas9 technique in a controlled lab setting following international biosafety norms. The gene-edited sheep carries no foreign DNA, making it more favorable under India's emerging biotech regulatory landscape. The research has the potential to address several challenges in livestock management, from improving meat yield and disease resistance to enabling climate-resilient breeds.

**Their children have a rare condition. They didn't know its name - until now.**
Five families with children who have the newly discovered rare condition, ReNU syndrome, recently gathered in a D.C. park. The condition, caused by a genetic anomaly, affects 100,000 people worldwide. Scientists estimate that 0.4% of babies born with severe neurodevelopmental disorders have ReNU syndrome. The discovery was made possible by a global partnership among genetics researchers and the relentless organizing of parents. For families, it's been like they've been given access to a time machine, allowing them to see into the opportunities and dangers coming years or decades down the line. Parents are now organizing to find therapeutics that could help people with ReNU, with a 'bullish' five-year timeline to try to find treatments.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Trump cuts will reverse progress on AIDS**
The global AIDS epidemic is at risk of spiraling out of control due to the Trump administration's cuts to foreign assistance and recommitment to funding global health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of new HIV infections in 2023 was still more than three times the 2025 target of 370,000 or fewer new infections. If this trend continues, the target of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 will not be reached. UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima warned that the Trump funding freeze 'means that overnight one in every three dollars for fighting disease, preventing pandemics, has halted.' This has led to real-world consequences, including clinics shutting down and HIV, TB, and malaria efforts grinding to a halt. Byanyima estimated that 5,800 people are now being infected every day, up from 3,500, and that if the U.S. global health funding cuts become permanent, there will be an additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths globally by 2029. 'All the progress made over the last 25 years would be gone,' Byanyima warned. 'It would be a disaster for those countries with the highest HIV burden in Africa. But it would also be an unmitigated crisis for global health with devastating consequences too for rich countries.'

**Personalised gene editing heals baby in world first**
Baby KJ, diagnosed with CPS1 deficiency, a rare genetic disorder affecting one in 1.3 million babies, has shown significant improvement in health markers and meeting developmental milestones after receiving three doses of a gene therapy. The breakthrough, developed by dozens of researchers over six months, has the potential to save and improve many more lives in the future, including those with extremely rare conditions and more common genetic disorders. According to Dr. Kiran Musunuru, 'This is a triumph for the American people's investment in biomedical research.' Federal funds supported the basic research on bacterial immune systems and the discovery of CRISPR, which led to the development of the gene-editing method used to fix KJ's mutation. The case serves as an important reminder of why investment in science is critical, particularly for the more than 30 million Americans living with one of over 7,000 rare genetic diseases. As President Donald Trump pushes to cut billions from science funding, including medical research, KJ's case highlights the importance of government investment in medical advances.

**World's First: Baby Treated with Gene Editing Therapy**
A 9.5-month-old baby, KJ Muldoon, has become the first patient in the world to be treated with gene editing therapy. Born with a rare genetic disorder called CPS1 deficiency, which affects only 1.3 million people worldwide, the baby's liver was unable to produce a crucial enzyme due to a genetic mutation. This enzyme deficiency caused the body to accumulate toxic ammonia, leading to life-threatening risks. Doctors initially said the baby was at risk of death in the first week of life, and if not fatal, would likely suffer from severe mental retardation and require a liver transplant. Despite the risks, doctors offered the baby a groundbreaking treatment using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the baby's genome and correct the mutation. The baby received the first dose of the treatment in February 2025, and showed a positive response to the treatment. According to doctors, there were no serious side effects. This treatment has brought hope to those with genetic disorders.

**Gene Editing Breakthrough: Saving a Baby's Life**
A baby named KJ was born with a rare and life-threatening genetic disorder called CPS1 deficiency. The condition affects only one in 1.3 million babies and can cause severe mental and developmental delays, as well as the need for a liver transplant. However, the prognosis is grim, with half of affected babies dying in the first week of life. KJ's parents were offered palliative care, but they decided to give their child a chance. A team of researchers, led by Kiran Musunuru, worked tirelessly to develop a personalized gene editing treatment for KJ. The treatment, which was based on decades of research funded by the US government, used a precision approach called base editing to correct the specific mutation that caused KJ's condition. The treatment was delivered via an infusion, and KJ received three doses over several weeks. The results were remarkable, with KJ's levels of amoniac decreasing and her ability to eat proteins increasing. While it's too early to say if KJ will be able to stop taking medication altogether, the team is optimistic. The success of this treatment has far-reaching implications, with the potential to treat over 30 million people in the US who suffer from one of the over 7,000 rare genetic diseases. 'This is a game-changer,' said Peter Marks, a former FDA official. 'It's a technology that could potentially transform the way we approach medicine.' The researchers credited the US government's investment in biomedical research for making this breakthrough possible. 'This is a triumph of the American people's investment in biomedical research,' said Fyodor Urnov. 'We couldn't have done this in any other country.'

**Gene editing helped a desperately ill baby thrive. Scientists say it could someday treat millions**
A baby born with a rare genetic disease, CPS1 deficiency, is thriving after receiving an experimental gene editing treatment. The treatment, made with the CRISPR gene editing tool, was designed to correct the baby's faulty gene. The therapy, known as 'base editing,' reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes. The baby, KJ Muldoon, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases. His parents, Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, decided to try the experimental treatment after weighing their options, including a liver transplant. 'This is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders,' said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. Researchers hope that what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients. Gene therapies can be expensive to develop, but the cost of creating a custom treatment for KJ was 'not far off' from the cost of a liver transplant. Scientists also believe that this research 'sets the stage' for treating other rare conditions.
