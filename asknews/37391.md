**GIEWS Country Brief Mali 28-May-2025**
According to the latest Cadre Harmonisé (CH) analysis, about 1.52 million people (7 percent of the analyzed population) in Mali are projected to face acute food insecurity during the June to August 2025 lean season period, including over 64,000 people in CH Phase 4 (Emergency) and about 2,600 people in CH Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Conflict remains the primary driver of acute food insecurity, particularly in central and northern regions. The planting of 2025 cereal crops is underway in southern areas, but conflict is expected to continue to affect agricultural activities in central and northern areas, likely leading to localized production shortfalls. Average to above-average rainfall amounts are expected between June and September 2025, but also heighten the risk of flooding. The 2024 aggregate cereal production is officially estimated at 10.4 million tonnes, about 5 percent above the average of the previous five years, but flooding and civil insecurity disrupted agricultural activities, resulting in localized production shortfalls. Wholesale prices of locally produced sorghum and rice remained stable or increased between January and April 2025, mainly reflecting shortfalls of the 2024 production in several regions and conflict-related market disruptions.

**When is the 2025 hurricane season? Here's when it officially begins and ends**
The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to begin on June 1 and end on November 30. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there is a 60% chance that the season will be above average, with 13-19 named tropical storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) expected to form. The NOAA attributes this forecast to warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures, ENSO-neutral conditions, low wind shear, and a more active African monsoon season. Historically, Florida is the most hurricane-prone state, with over 120 impacts since 1851. Authorities recommend anticipating and preparing for the threat, which is not limited to coastal areas, as inland flooding can also occur. 'All of these elements favor the formation of tropical cyclones,' the NOAA said in its report. The list of names for major hurricanes in 2025 includes Andrea, Barry, Chantal, and others. A low-pressure area could develop south of the Mexican coast between May 26 and 30, potentially becoming the first named storm, Alvin.

**World Hunger Day 2025: Nigerians are hungry**
Nigeria is facing a severe food crisis, with nearly 31 million people expected to face acute food and nutrition insecurity by June-August. The country is experiencing severe desertification, coastal erosion, and irregular rainfall patterns, which are disrupting planting seasons and leading to hunger. The climate crisis is compounded by insecurity, banditry, and farmer-herder conflicts, which have displaced millions and deterred agricultural investment. Economic reforms have also added strain to vulnerable households, with inflation pushing basic food items out of reach. The government is urged to take urgent action, prioritizing smallholder farmers, improving access to credit and inputs, and implementing climate-resilient strategies. Without comprehensive investments in resilient food systems, Nigeria risks a catastrophe by 2050.

**Florida Faces Worst Drought in 13 Years, Everglades Dry and Wildlife at Risk**
Florida is facing its worst drought in 13 years, with areas of the Everglades completely dry, wildlife at risk, and tours canceled. The vast wetland ecosystem known as the Everglades, spanning over 7,800 square miles in southern Florida, is currently experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely. According to AccuWeather, the lack of rainfall has forced the suspension of airboat tours in places like Everglades Alligator Farm, located about 30 miles southwest of Miami, due to the complete absence of water. This tourist attraction, although remaining open with educational exhibits and shows, warned on Instagram that 'this drought not only affects tourism, but also puts native wildlife under stress and increases the risk of forest fires.' Mack's Fish Camp, 40 miles north, has also canceled excursions. The situation has led to wildlife concentrating in the few remaining bodies of water, resulting in overcrowding, algae proliferation, and fish mortality due to lack of oxygen, as reported by CBS News. Currently, 84% of Florida is under moderate, severe, or extreme drought conditions, a scenario not seen since April 2012, when the entire state registered similar levels. Much of the Everglades is now classified as an extreme drought zone, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. AccuWeather's climate expert, Paul Pastelok, warned that 'rainfall will be very scattered throughout the rest of May in Miami and the Everglades,' meaning that the risk of forest fires will continue to be high at least for the next month in southern Florida. Meteorologist Matt Devitt also referred to the situation on his X account, sharing new images of the wetlands: 'Update: new photos show the extreme drought in southwest Florida and the Everglades, the worst locally in 24 years.' Devitt explained that even compared to a typical dry season, the region is 6-10 inches below the average rainfall since mid-October. Although he predicted better chances of rain in the coming days, he warned that 'it is not expected to eliminate the drought.'

**Hurricane season begins June 1. This Florida emergency official reveals what keeps her up at night**
The Florida Keys are the most vulnerable place in the U.S. to hurricanes due to their location between the Gulf and Atlantic Ocean. Monroe County's emergency management director, Shannon Weiner, oversees the safety of the islands' 80,000 inhabitants. With the Atlantic hurricane season starting June 1, the county has new tools, including a new emergency operations center and a seawater desalination water treatment plant. However, the potential for a catastrophic storm like Hurricane Irma in 2017, which destroyed 1,180 homes and damaged 3,000 more, is always a concern. Weiner said, 'The potential for a catastrophic storm is always at the back of residents' minds.'

**WFP Lebanon Situation Report - April 2025 - Lebanon**
As of the end of April, nearly 970,500 internally displaced people (IDPs) have returned home in Lebanon, while 90,000 remain displaced. Meanwhile, 35,500 Syrians have fled to North Lebanon, with many sheltering in mosques, community halls, or with vulnerable families. The sixth IPC Acute Food Insecurity Analysis in Lebanon shows a decline in food insecurity, with 1.17 million people (21 percent of the population) projected to face acute food insecurity between April and June 2025, down from 1.65 million (30 percent) in March 2025. Despite this slight improvement, conflict aftershocks, economic stagnation, inflation, and funding gaps still threaten Lebanon's fragile food security, according to the report. 'The situation remains fragile,' said the report, 'underscoring the need for continued support to address the root causes of food insecurity.'

**Will we have a rainy event with intense rains in the coming days?**
According to the 'rule of the 5 days', a reliable forecast should not exceed 120 hours or 5 days, as this is the period in which it can be predicted with the greatest certainty. Beyond this time, accuracy decreases due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere and the difficulty of predicting changes in initial conditions. From Tuesday to June 1, normal precipitation is expected, with showers, rain, and thunderstorms, mainly in the afternoon and in interior and southern localities of the province. Some of these rains could be strong and register intense accumulations in isolated areas. This situation is normal for the time of year, as we are in the rainy period and are in the second month with the highest annual precipitation accumulation. The rains would be welcome, as our territory is experiencing a drought event that, in some areas, reaches the severe level. The precipitation will be associated with the presence of a trough in the upper layers of the troposphere with representation in the middle levels, as well as the transit of tropical waves over the seas to the south of the archipelago, in combination with the strong diurnal warming and local factors. Beyond 5 days, that is, after June 1, it cannot be assured that we will have a rainy event with intense rains. As I explained at the beginning, the accuracy and confidence of the models decrease beyond 120 hours; it would be unprofessional and lacking in scientific rigor to make statements in this sense. After 5 days, the models are very changeable and, in each run, can show very different scenarios. Temperatures will remain high, with very warm afternoons. Remember to always stay informed through official sources.

**Sixth Consecutive Year of Increasing Hunger: A Failure of Humanity**
The world is experiencing its sixth consecutive year of increasing hunger, with 295 million people in 53 countries facing acute hunger. According to UN Secretary-General Guterres, 'this is a failure of humanity.' The main cause of hunger is conflict, with 38 million children affected. In Gaza, the situation is catastrophic, with malnutrition and diseases threatening the lives of 1.1 million people. Meanwhile, governments are spending a record $2.718 billion on military arms. As Guterres said, 'the will to act, concrete solidarity, and a new order of priorities are lacking.' The article calls for action to stop the arms trade and to revoke the military agreement between Italy and Israel, which is set to expire on June 8, 2025. 'Every euro spent on rearmament is an euro taken away from hope,' says the article. 'Let's make our voice heard and not be complicit in crimes against humanity.'

**Nicaragua Prepares Institutions for the 2025 Rainy Season with Invierno Seguro Plan**
As the rainy season approaches, the Nicaraguan government has presented the National Interinstitutional Plan Invierno Seguro 2025, which brings together over 20 institutions to act before, during, and after climate-related emergencies. The plan, led by the Presidency of the Republic, proposes measures to prevent and respond to rain, floods, landslides, hurricanes, and other phenomena that could severely affect vulnerable communities nationwide. According to the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (INETER), the winter will begin with isolated rains in May, intensifying in June. Although normal precipitation ranges are expected, the Caribbean could receive accumulations exceeding 1,000 mm. A cyclone season above the usual is also anticipated. The plan identifies vulnerability scenarios based on past events and geographical characteristics: Over 2.4 million people live in areas at risk of hurricanes, and 1.5 million in areas at risk of floods, distributed in 2,047 critical points between neighborhoods and communities. Some concrete actions include: strengthening risk communication through radio alerts, WhatsApp, and SMS messages; and periodically evaluating the condition of schools, hospitals, markets, and access roads. Public schools in Nicaragua will have trained school brigades, simulations, and infrastructure reviews. The Ministry of Health has 76 hospitals, 142 health centers, and mobile clinics to address health emergencies. ENACAL and ENATREL will execute maintenance plans for water and electricity networks. Temporary shelters with psychological accompaniment, protection of vulnerable groups, and food, water, and medicine supplies are also planned. The Nicaraguan Army will be actively involved with specialized units for search and rescue, humanitarian aid transport, and preventive evacuations. The National Police will implement road safety measures and protection in high-risk areas. Local governments will also take preventive actions: cleaning drains, pruning trees, eliminating mosquito breeding sites, and visiting homes in critical areas. The Nicaraguan authorities urge families to update their emergency plans, reinforce their homes, and stay informed.

**Somalia: Number of People Facing High Levels of ‘Acute Food Insecurity’ Projected to Rise to 4.4 Millions**
The World Food Programme (WFP) warns that 4.4 million people in Somalia, or 23% of the population, could face high levels of 'acute food insecurity' between April and June 2025 due to recurrent droughts, floods, conflict, and high food prices. This is a significant increase from the current 3.4 million people experiencing crisis levels of hunger. WFP's Director notes, 'A massive scale-up of humanitarian assistance averted famine then. Now hunger is rising again as another drought looms.' The WFP is facing a critical funding gap of US$297 million, which may force it to reduce assistance and prioritize operations. Without additional funding, WFP operations in Somalia may face pipeline breaks by mid-year.

**Florida Faces Severe Environmental Crisis with Over 100 Active Wildfires**
Florida is facing a severe environmental crisis due to a lack of rainfall, high temperatures, and an alarming increase in wildfires. According to the National Weather Service, over 14 million people are currently living in areas affected by drought, which represents more than half of the state's population. The state is experiencing extreme dry conditions in the north, center, and south, including areas such as Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, and Miami. The county of Marion is in extreme drought, while others like Palm Beach and Hendry are facing severe water scarcity levels. The soil moisture is continuing to drop, and the forecasted rains will not be enough to reverse the situation. April is shaping up to be one of the driest months in five years, increasing the risk of wildfires. Currently, there are over 100 active wildfires, and the combination of dry vegetation and high temperatures makes any spark a real threat to entire communities. Florida is facing a growing environmental emergency, with over 100 active wildfires having already consumed more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. The prolonged drought, combined with high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds, has created ideal conditions for fires to spread quickly. At least 21 counties have issued burn bans to prevent new fires, while emergency services are working against the clock to contain the wildfires. Ground brigades, air support, and specialized teams are fighting day and night to protect residential areas and critical infrastructure. Environmental authorities have raised the alert levels due to the risk of flames approaching urban communities. The drought index shows no signs of improvement, and the lack of significant rainfall in the forecast is making the situation even more dire. Florida is in one of its most delicate situations in years, with impacts that could extend throughout the hot season if conditions do not change soon. As said by the authorities, 'the combination of dry vegetation and high temperatures makes any spark a real threat to entire communities.'

**14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know**
As of April 28, over 14 million Florida residents are living in areas of drought, an increase of 18.3% since last week, according to the Drought Monitor. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Integrated Drought Information System reports that 51.8% of Florida is under drought conditions, with some areas experiencing extreme drought. The National Weather Service has issued drought information statements for several areas, warning of the effects of dry conditions and what's to come. NOAA's National Integrated Drought Information System predicts that nearly half of the US will experience abnormally hot and dry conditions in summer 2025. The mean statewide drought index has jumped to 469, with 21 counties issuing burn bans due to 97 wildfires burning across Florida, charring over 3,600 acres.

**Drought, conflict may push 1M more Somalians into critical food insecurity, warns WFP**
The World Food Program (WFP) warns that drought, conflict, and high food prices may push an additional one million Somalians into crisis levels of food insecurity in the coming months. According to the latest analysis, 3.4 million people are already experiencing crisis-level hunger or worse, and this number is projected to rise to 4.4 million by April to June 2025. WFP's director of food security and nutrition analysis, Jean-Martin Bauer, stated, 'Now hunger is rising again as another drought looms.' The analysis also found that food production in 2024 was 45% below the long-term average, and around 1.7 million children under the age of five are expected to face acute malnutrition through December 2025. The WFP will support 820,000 vulnerable people per month with food and cash assistance starting in April, down from a peak of 2.2 million per month in 2024.

**4.4 million Somalis threatened by hunger until June due to drought and food scarcity**
Approximately 4.4 million people in Somalia are threatened by hunger until June due to drought and increasing food scarcity, according to a report supported by the UN, published on Wednesday. This is 1 million more people than in the first quarter of the year. The Integrated Food Security Classification System (CIP) report estimates that in the first quarter of 2025, around 3.4 million inhabitants or 17% of the country's population will face acute food insecurity, following a decrease in agricultural production at the end of 2024 due to rainfall scarcity. Stéphane Dujarric, the UN Secretary-General's spokesperson, warned on Wednesday about 'the deterioration of food security in the country.' The CIP analysis predicts that between April and June, 4.4 million men, women, and children (23% of the population) will suffer from acute food insecurity, among other things due to below-average monsoon rains, ongoing conflicts, high prices, and localized flooding. The report also estimates that 1.7 million children under the age of five (4% more than in 2024) will suffer from acute malnutrition and require treatment, including 466,000 in the category of severe acute malnutrition. 'The worsening drought, unpredictable rains, and ongoing conflict are eroding livelihoods, plunging families deeper into crisis,' said Etienne Peterschmitt, FAO Representative in Somalia, in a statement. According to the UN, nearly six million Somalis will need humanitarian aid in 2025. However, in a context of chronic underfunding, the humanitarian plan launched at the end of January requests $1.43 billion to help 4.6 million people as a priority.

**UN Report: Over 4 Million Somalis Face Hunger Risk by June**
A report by the United Nations warns that more than 4.4 million Somalis will face the risk of hunger by June, an increase of about 1 million people from the current number. The report, published on Wednesday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system used by UN agencies, estimates that in the first quarter of 2025, around 3.4 million people, or 17% of Somalia's population, will experience a severe food insecurity, following a decline in agricultural production at the end of 2024 due to a lack of rainfall. 'The food security situation is deteriorating in Somalia,' said UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric on Wednesday. According to the IPC analysis, from April to June, 4.4 million men, women, and children (23% of the population) will suffer from severe food insecurity, particularly due to expected below-average rainfall, ongoing conflicts, rising prices, and local flooding. The report also estimates that in 2025, 1.7 million children under the age of five will suffer from severe malnutrition and will need treatment, including 466,000 children who will suffer from severe acute malnutrition. 'The worsening drought, unpredictable rainfall, and ongoing conflict are undermining livelihoods and pushing families deeper into crisis,' said FAO representative in Somalia, Etienne Peterschmitt. The FAO is responding to this situation 'by supporting increased agricultural production, promoting climate-resilient solutions, and strengthening the resilience of agricultural food systems.' According to the UN, around 6 million Somalis will need humanitarian assistance in 2025. However, due to ongoing funding shortages, the humanitarian plan launched in late January calls for $1.43 billion in funding to assist 4.6 million people as a priority.

According to a report supported by the UN, approximately 4.4 million people in Somalia are at risk of famine by June due to drought and increasing food scarcity, a million more than in the first quarter of the year. The report from the Integrated Food Security Classification System (CIP) estimates that in the first quarter of 2025, around 3.4 million inhabitants (17% of the country's population) face acute food insecurity, following a decrease in agricultural production at the end of 2024 due to lack of rainfall. Stéphane Dujarric, the UN Secretary-General's spokesperson, warned of 'the deterioration of food security in the country.' The CIP analysis predicts that between April and June, 4.4 million men, women, and children (23% of the population) will face acute food insecurity, among other things due to below-average seasonal rains, ongoing conflicts, high prices, and localized flooding. The document also estimates that in 2025, 1.7 million children under five years old (4% more than in 2024) will suffer from acute malnutrition and require treatment, including 466,000 in the category of severe acute malnutrition. 'The worsening drought, unpredictable rains, and ongoing conflict are eroding livelihoods, plunging families deeper into crisis,' said Etienne Peterschmitt, FAO Representative in Somalia, in a statement. The UN states that nearly six million Somalis will need humanitarian aid in 2025. However, in a context of chronic underfunding, the humanitarian plan launched at the end of January forecasts $1.43 billion (R$ 8.25 billion) to help 4.6 million people as a priority.

**4.4 Million People in Somalia Threatened by Hunger Until June**
Approximately 4.4 million people in Somalia are threatened by hunger until June due to drought and increasing food scarcity, according to a report supported by the UN. This is 1 million more people than in the first quarter of the year. The Integrated Food Security Classification System (CIP) report estimates that in the first quarter of 2025, around 3.4 million inhabitants or 17% of the country's population will face acute food insecurity, following a decrease in agricultural production at the end of 2024 due to rainfall scarcity. Stéphane Dujarric, UN Secretary-General's spokesperson, warned of 'the deterioration of food security in the country.' The CIP analysis predicts that between April and June, 4.4 million men, women, and children (23% of the population) will suffer from acute food insecurity, among other things due to below-average monsoon rains, ongoing conflicts, high prices, and localized flooding. The report also estimates that 1.7 million children under five years old (4% more than in 2024) will suffer from acute malnutrition and require treatment, including 466,000 in the category of severe acute malnutrition. 'The worsening drought, unpredictable rains, and ongoing conflict are eroding livelihoods, plunging families deeper into crisis,' said Etienne Peterschmitt, FAO Representative in Somalia, in a statement. According to the UN, nearly six million Somalis will need humanitarian aid in 2025.

**Somalia: 4.4 million people at risk of famine by June**
According to a report by the Integrated Food Security Classification System (IPC), supported by the UN, 4.4 million people in Somalia will be at risk of famine by June, an increase of 1 million from the current number. The report estimates that 3.4 million people, or 17% of the population, will face acute food insecurity in the first quarter of 2025. Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, warned of 'the deterioration of food security in the country.' The IPC analysis predicts that between April and June, 4.4 million people (23% of the population) will be in a state of acute food insecurity, mainly due to below-average monsoon rains, ongoing conflicts, high prices, and localized flooding. 1.7 million children under the age of five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition in 2025, with 466,000 in severe acute malnutrition. Etienne Peterschmitt, FAO representative in Somalia, commented, 'Drought, unpredictable rains, and ongoing conflict are eroding livelihoods, plunging families deeper into crisis.' The FAO is responding to this situation by supporting increased agricultural production, encouraging climate change adaptation solutions, and strengthening agro-food systems resilience. The UN estimates that nearly 6 million Somalis will need humanitarian aid in 2025, but in a context of chronic underfunding, the humanitarian plan launched in January requires $1.43 billion in funding to assist 4.6 million people.

According to a recent report, 2024 is the hottest year on record, with devastating floods and droughts causing widespread destruction. Within the next 20 years, parts of New York and New Jersey will become uninhabitable due to destroyed infrastructure, while Florida may see the impacts of flooding much sooner. Miami is predicted to be 60% submerged within the next 25 years, with the city being three feet underwater as soon as 2050. Louisiana is losing 8 football field lengths per month to rising seas, and New Orleans is expected to be underwater within 60 years. Water-related disasters have caused over 8,700 fatalities, displaced 40 million people, and resulted in economic losses exceeding $550 billion. The report also highlights the urgent need for replacement of old water pipes and the loss of fresh water aquifers due to salt water intrusion. Additionally, fires consumed 77,000 square kilometers in 2024, with Southern California experiencing a devastating fire that destroyed 12,000-14,000 structures and caused 39 fatalities. The initial monetary damage is estimated to exceed $80 billion, and the long-term health effects of breathing smoke containing chemicals and particulates will affect millions of people.
