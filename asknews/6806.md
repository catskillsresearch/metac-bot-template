**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Can the Human Brain be Digitally Transferred? The Future of Mind Uploading**
The idea of uploading human consciousness into a computer and living digitally is a concept that has been explored in science fiction, but it is theoretically possible. This concept is known as 'mind uploading' and would allow individuals to exist in a digital world, even without a physical body. However, the biggest obstacle to this is the human brain. Scientists consider the brain to be the most complex structure in the universe, with approximately 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections. Currently, only the brain of a fly has been fully mapped, and only small sections of a mouse's brain have been detailed. It could take decades to model the human brain at this scale, and even then, simulating how neurons change over time would be a significant challenge. When a person's mind is uploaded into a computer, not only would their thoughts be simulated, but also their senses, such as sight, sound, and touch, would need to be simulated. Without these senses, the mind could experience severe psychological problems, known as 'sensory deprivation,' which could be equivalent to torture over time. Therefore, a successful mind upload would require not only a highly accurate simulation of the brain but also of the environment and senses. Currently, neither computer power nor scientific knowledge has reached this level. While some scientists believe that this technology could be possible by 2045, considering the current pace of brain research, this date may be overly optimistic. Some experts even suggest that it may not be possible until the end of the 22nd century. However, given the rapid progress of technology, the possibility of achieving this goal in the next 200 years is not negligible. Moreover, billions of dollars have already been invested in research to achieve this goal.

**Novartis bets on ageing as next frontier in drug development**
Novartis has partnered with BioAge Labs to develop new therapies for age-related diseases. The partnership, which could cost up to $550 million, aims to leverage BioAge's vast trove of data on human longevity to identify the determinants of a healthy lifespan. Novartis has set up a research group called Diseases of Ageing and Regenerative Medicine (DARe) to build on its expertise in musculoskeletal diseases and understand what causes age-related diseases at the molecular level. 'Our goal is to understand the biological drivers of ageing to develop novel treatments for diseases related to ageing,' said Michaela Kneissel, global head of DARe. The market for geriatric medicines is expected to surge from $153 billion in 2023 to $222.5 billion by 2030. Novartis is getting back into the field of ageing research, armed with fresh perspective, new tools, and better data. 'There's more interest from big pharma in the biology of ageing as a source of novel targets, because for diseases like Alzheimer's it's clear that to treat them you have to look earlier in the course of disease, before symptoms even start,' said Kristen Fortney, CEO and founder of BioAge. Novartis hasn't provided details of the specific disease targets it is pursuing through DARe but has said that 'exercise biology' is a key priority, because exercise is 'an absolute proven intervention in quite a lot of diseases of ageing,' said Kneissel. 'If you look across the 8 billion people on this planet, there are a lot of people who already are ageing much more successfully than most of us,' said Fortney. 'If we can better understand ageing, we can discover the real drivers of disease and develop drugs that can even target multiple age-related diseases.'

**Inside the secret lab where pig organs are being grown for humans**
A biotechnology company, eGenesis, is working on a revolutionary solution to the organ donor crisis by growing pig organs for human transplants. The company has made significant progress, with a genetically modified pig kidney being successfully transplanted into a living human recipient. The recipient, Rick Slayman, was a 55-year-old man with end-stage renal failure who had already received a human kidney transplant, but his body had rejected it. Slayman's surgery was a historic moment in the field of xenotransplantation, and it has sparked hope for thousands of people waiting for organ transplants. However, Slayman's death 51 days after the surgery was a setback, and an autopsy revealed that his heart, not the kidney, was the cause of his death. Despite this, eGenesis is continuing to work on perfecting the technology, and the company's CEO, Mike Curtis, believes that cross-species transplants could become widely available to the public within the decade.

**Genetically Modified Pig Liver Successfully Transplanted into Human**
A genetically modified pig liver was successfully transplanted into a person in a groundbreaking study published in the journal Nature. The liver was used to evaluate its performance and rejection in a person in a coma for 10 days, as authorized by the family. The team, led by Ke-Feng Dou, used a miniature Bama pig liver with six genes edited to reduce rejection and improve compatibility. The liver is a complex organ to transplant, and the team was able to evaluate its function alongside the human liver. According to researcher Lin Wang, the liver transplant was auxiliary and heterotopic, meaning the new liver was placed in a different area of the abdominal cavity. Wang considered the result a 'success' as it showed the pig liver could provide 'additional support' to the human liver. The study concluded that the liver could survive in the human body and start functioning, and that current xenotransplantation methods could be used as a bridge therapy for patients with acute liver failure. However, Wang noted that this is only a hypothesis, as they do not know how long the pig liver could support the human liver, 'perhaps a month, two, three'. The study highlights the need for effective methods of orthotopic xenotransplantation of pig liver to human for future patients. The team has already performed another transplant in a patient in a coma, where the pig liver was used as a replacement, said Wang. During the 10-day study, only basic liver functions were measured, and the results showed that the liver produced bile and porcine albumin, maintained stable blood flow, and did not show signs of acute rejection. The study suggests that the xenograft 'remained functional until the end of the study', but the team acknowledges limitations, such as the short observation period and the measurement of only basic liver functions. In vivo, Matesanz considered the study 'an important experience that opens a different path' to the current methods used for vital organs (heart) or non-vital organs (kidney) transplantation. Matesanz and other experts, such as Iván Fernández and Peter Friend, commented on the study's results, calling it a 'milestone' in the history of xenotransplantation, but also cautioning against the limitations of a single case study.

**Growing Organs: A Solution to the Transplantation Crisis?**
Scientists have successfully grown organs using cellular technology. They create a framework from a biocompatible polymer material, such as a nose or ear, and then seed it with the patient's stem cells. The organ grows, is filled with blood vessels and nerve endings, and is eventually transplanted into the patient. According to Timofey Bajenov, a leading researcher, 'In 2024, scientists were able to grow a fully functional heart in a laboratory using stem cells. It had all the necessary blood vessels, valves, and chambers, and functioned normally, but it was only the size of a rice grain. This means it was not suitable for transplantation in humans or even mice. However, science is not standing still, and it is likely that scientists will soon be able to grow organs that can be used for transplantation in humans.' In Russia, there are approximately 10,000 people on the waiting list for donor organs, but only a quarter of the necessary operations are performed. The problem is the shortage of donors and the limited time available for transplantation. Often, patients simply do not have enough time to arrive at the hospital, as donor organs such as the liver have a six-hour lifespan and the heart only four hours.

**Scientists Grow Artificial Blood Vessels from Living Cells**
Scientists at Rosatom's Troitsk Science Institute have successfully grown long, tissue-equivalent blood vessels from living cells. According to a statement by Rosatom, researchers have achieved the bioprinting of blood vessel equivalents up to 10 centimeters in length using ultrasonic acoustic fields. This technology is expected to help people suffering from varicose veins, thrombosis, coronary heart disease, and other vascular diseases. The ultimate goal of this project is to create personalized, compatible artificial organs, such as kidneys, pancreas, lungs, and other organs, which would eliminate the need for organ donors. The project will continue throughout the year, with researchers at the Sechenov Moscow State Medical University conducting tests on the method. According to Yegor Plakhotnyuk, Head of Joint Production Technologies and Biomedical Engineering at the Troitsk Science Institute, 'We have created spheroids with a diameter of 200-300 micrometers, which can merge into a single structure by forming an extracellular matrix. We are currently stabilizing the structure using acoustic fields, but in the future, we plan to use magnetic fields as well.' Plakhotnyuk also stated that the acoustic fields can produce artificial blood vessels up to 10 centimeters in length, and that the use of magnetic fields will make it easier to create more complex tissue-equivalent structures. He added that the team aims to develop a magnetic-acoustic bioprinter that can produce more complex and branched artificial blood vessel systems by 2030, and that this could eventually lead to the creation of functional organ equivalents, such as a liver, with blood vessels that can supply the organ during its maturation process.'

This technology is expected to help people suffering from varicose veins, thrombosis, coronary heart disease, and other vascular diseases. The technology is also expected to be used to repair other damaged tissues and organs in the future. If the project is successful, patients will no longer need to wait for organ donors, and instead, personalized, perfectly compatible artificial organs such as kidneys, pancreas, lungs, and other organs will be produced. 'We have created spheroids with a diameter of 200-300 micrometers, which can merge into a single structure by forming an extracellular matrix,' said Yegor Plakhotnyuk, Head of Joint Production Technologies and Biomedical Engineering at the Troitsk Science Institute. 'We are currently stabilizing the structure with acoustic fields, but in the future, we plan to use magnetic fields as well.' Plakhotnyuk noted that acoustic fields can produce artificial blood vessels up to 10 centimeters in length, and that magnetic fields will make it easier to create more complex tissue-equivalent structures. He also stated that they aim to develop a magnetic-acoustic bioprinter that can produce more complex and branched vascular systems by 2030, and that this will enable the development of functional organ equivalents, such as a liver, with blood vessels around them that will provide nutrition during the organ's maturation process.
