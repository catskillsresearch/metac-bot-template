**Trump Open to Three-Way Meeting with Putin and Zelensky, but Prefers Bilateral Talks**
The White House has not ruled out the possibility of a three-way meeting between US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it would be better for Kyiv and Moscow to hold bilateral talks, including at a high level. According to White House Press Secretary Caroline Livitt, President Trump has already stated that he is 'open to this' - a three-way meeting - 'if it comes to that.' However, he wants the two leaders and their sides to 'sit down together,' Livitt said. The White House declined to comment on the results of the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia on May 2, saying that Trump will share his thoughts on the matter separately. As reported by OBOZ.UA, during the new talks in Istanbul on May 2, Russia and Ukraine exchanged memoranda on a ceasefire. Russia is demanding that Ukraine recognize the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions as 'Russian,' withdraw its troops, cancel mobilization, and effectively disband its military, as well as refuse to join any military alliances, including NATO, and ban foreign military presence on its territory. Ukraine and Russia were able to agree on a new prisoner exchange and the exchange of the bodies of killed soldiers.

The negotiations in Istanbul on May 15 were unsuccessful, with Russia refusing to accept a meeting format. The Ukrainian and Russian sides exchanged memoranda on ceasefire in Istanbul on May 2, but Russia refused to stop the fighting until its demands are met, including Ukraine recognizing the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions as 'Russian', withdrawing troops, and banning NATO membership.

**Trump 'Open' to Meeting with Putin and Zelensky in Turkey**
US President Donald Trump has expressed openness to a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Turkey, in a bid to stop the war in Ukraine. White House spokesperson Caroline Leavitt said that Trump is willing to participate in a meeting with Putin and Zelensky, but emphasizes that there must be a genuine desire from both sides to negotiate. Trump sees direct dialogue as the only way to achieve a lasting peace, not just a temporary ceasefire. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has renewed his proposal for a three-way summit in Istanbul or Ankara, bringing together Putin, Zelensky, and Trump, following new rounds of negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul. Erdogan said, 'I hope to bring together Putin and Zelensky and Trump in Istanbul or Ankara. If this meeting takes place, I will join them to make Istanbul a center for peace.' Erdogan considers the mere holding of bilateral meetings between Moscow and Kiev as a 'success' in itself, especially in light of the recent escalation, referring to the Ukrainian drone attack on four Russian military airports on Sunday, which Ukraine's security agency described as 'the largest' since the start of the war. In contrast, Ukrainian President Zelensky has called on US President Trump to take a tougher stance against Moscow, demanding new sanctions targeting the Russian economy. Zelensky said during a press conference in Kiev, 'We expect President Trump to take decisive steps. We need real American support that includes imposing new sanctions to force Russia to a comprehensive ceasefire.' He added, 'What Moscow wants is a short-term truce to regroup, not a lasting peace.'

**Turkey Seeks 'Concrete Progress' in Ukraine Peace Talks**
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan expressed hope for 'concrete progress' in the second round of direct negotiations between Moscow and Kiev, held today in Istanbul, to try to reach an agreement that ends the conflict in Ukraine. Fidan said, 'Our hope is that the meetings will be productive, that concrete progress will be achieved as quickly as possible, and that the desired results will be achieved.' He recognized that these meetings are important to reduce tensions between the parties and lay the foundations for peace. Fidan also expressed the desire for the parties to reach new agreements for the release of prisoners of war. He noted that US President Donald Trump's determination to achieve peace represents an opportunity, and that a possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be discussed in today's meeting. The Ukrainian delegation is led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, while the Russian delegation is led by presidential advisor Vladimir Medinsky. It is expected that the two parties will agree on a document that establishes the conditions for a ceasefire agreement, although Zelensky has indicated that other issues related to the conflict will also be discussed in this second meeting.

**Zelensky Calls Meetings With Putin 'Meaningless' And Asks For More Military Aid**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin 'meaningless' without more military aid from the US and Europe. Zelensky stated, 'If Putin is not comfortable with a bilateral meeting, or if everyone wants it to be a trilateral meeting, I don't mind. I am ready for any format.' However, the Kremlin suspects that Zelensky is seeking 'clout' and a 'legitimacy boost' by inserting himself in the talks. The article suggests that the war in Ukraine is a proxy war between Russia and NATO, with Ukraine being an incidental party. Zelensky has begged for more money and weapons from western partners, and suggested that long-range attacks are the best way to bring the war to the Russians and convince them to accept a ceasefire agreement. The article also notes that Ukraine's military is on its last legs, and that Russian forces are breaking through on multiple fronts. Donald Trump has sought to balance his peace negotiations with carrot and stick incentives for both sides, but it may be too late for a deal as neither government is anxious for a realistic agreement.

**Ukraine and Russia Escalate War Ahead of Peace Talks**
As negotiations for peace between Ukraine and Russia are set to begin in Istanbul, despite a significant escalation of the war in the past 24 hours. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has confirmed that his defense minister, Rustem Umerov, will attend the talks. However, the war has continued with a major drone battle, a bridge explosion in Russia, and a nuclear-capable bomber attack in Siberia. According to the Ukrainian intelligence, 40 Russian warplanes were hit in the attack. Russia launched 472 drones against Ukraine overnight, the largest nighttime drone attack of the war so far. The US President, Donald Trump, has called for peace and threatened to withdraw support for Ukraine if the conflict continues. The two sides will present their proposals for a peace agreement in Turkey, but it is clear that Moscow and Kiev are still far apart. Putin's initial terms for a ceasefire include Ukraine abandoning its NATO ambitions and withdrawing its troops from four Ukrainian regions controlled by Russia. The Ukrainian negotiators will present a proposed roadmap for a lasting peace agreement, which includes no restrictions on Ukraine's military force, no recognition of Russian sovereignty over Ukrainian territory, and reparations for Ukraine.

**Kremlin Responds Calmly to Trump's Statements, Emphasizing National Interests**
The Kremlin has stated that they closely monitor and respond calmly to any statements made by US President Donald Trump. According to Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesperson, 'We carefully follow every word he says, and every statement he makes.' Peskov emphasized the need to handle these statements calmly, saying, 'Our national interests come first, and in order to achieve these interests, we must continue to improve our bilateral relations with the US.' This comes as Peskov previously mentioned that the US is making significant efforts to reach a peaceful settlement in Ukraine, stating that 'it is clear that the American side is making great efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement.' Trump himself has expressed a desire for a quick settlement, expressing gratitude for the mediation efforts. This statement coincides with a Russian source confirming that the Russian delegation has left for Istanbul to hold the second round of negotiations with the Ukrainian side, scheduled for Monday, June 2. Russian President Vladimir Medinsky is expected to present a memo outlining Russia's vision for addressing all aspects related to the roots of the crisis. The first round of negotiations took place on May 16 in Istanbul, resulting in an agreement on the exchange of prisoners according to the formula '1000 for 1000.' Both sides also agreed to present their views on a potential ceasefire in the future. In a related context, Trump recently expressed his dissatisfaction with Russia's delay in negotiations and settlement, hinting at the possibility of imposing new US sanctions on Moscow. He also considered last week that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin 'is playing with fire,' warning that 'bad things could happen to Moscow.'

**Admiral Ángel Tafalla: 'The Ceasefire is Within Reach'**
Admiral Ángel Tafalla believes that a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia is closer than ever. According to Tafalla, 'the ceasefire is within reach.' The three main players in this situation are Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, with Donald Trump at the forefront. Trump has stated that he can end the war quickly, but the situation is not easy. Tafalla has assured that 'an agreement of peace is not within the time scale of the situation, but a ceasefire could be achieved.' The expert has explained that a ceasefire is not difficult to achieve: 'as we know, to achieve it, it is simply necessary to stop shooting and be supervised by someone, but it does not involve political concessions or any long-term concessions.' However, the question remains, how can it be achieved? Why would Russia accept it? Trump's impatience is well-known, and his goal is to leave Europe, according to Tafalla. However, to achieve this, he wants Europe and Ukraine to be self-sufficient, which is not currently possible. Tafalla has revealed that Trump is waiting for the right conditions to sign a ceasefire, but not a peace agreement. The expert has made it clear that he has always referred to a ceasefire, 'this reason would never be to sign a peace agreement.'

**Trump's Frustration with Putin: A Peace Agreement Still Elusive**
US President Donald Trump has expressed frustration over the lack of progress in the peace talks with Russia, despite a phone call with Vladimir Putin last week. Trump called the conversation 'excellent' and claimed that Putin promised to send a draft peace agreement to the US. However, no agreement has been received by the US administration, which has frustrated Trump. According to a Russian spokesperson, Russia is currently working on a peace agreement that will be sent to Ukraine, but it is unclear if the US will receive a copy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine has not received any Russian agreement and is ready to hold a three-party meeting with the US and Russia. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine, leading to Trump's outbursts against Putin. Trump wrote on his platform Truth Social, 'He has become completely GALEN. He kills people unnecessarily. I have always said that he wants the whole of Ukraine, not just a part of it, and if he does it will lead to Russia's downfall.' CNN warned of a 'third world war' and Trump's comments have not gone unnoticed in Russia. Putin's hawk, Dimitrij Medvedev, responded to Trump's comments on X, calling them 'reckless and inappropriate.' The US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, commented on Medvedev's statements, calling them 'callous and unacceptable.' Trump's frustration with Putin has led to speculation about new sanctions against Russia, but a new sanctions package is not without risks, as it could drive Putin further away from a ceasefire, according to analysts.

**After another call with Putin, it looks like Trump has abandoned efforts to mediate peace in Ukraine**
US President Donald Trump has effectively abandoned his efforts to mediate peace in Ukraine after a two-hour phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine will 'immediately start negotiations' towards a ceasefire, but the conditions for peace will be negotiated between the two parties. This move comes after the first face-to-face negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in over three years ended without a ceasefire agreement. According to Vice-President J.D. Vance, the US can end its shuttle diplomacy, and Trump's approach has been criticized for lacking urgency in ending the war. Putin reportedly said that Russia is ready to work with Ukraine on a possible future peace agreement, but the lack of urgency on Russia's part to end the fighting is evident. The Kremlin's desire to strike a grand bargain with the White House on a broader reset of relations between the US and Russia seems to be driving its calculation. Trump foreshadowed an improvement in bilateral relations, but experts warn that abandoning European allies and Ukraine will deprive the US of the very allies it will need in the long term to prevail in its rivalry with China. Zelensky said he told Trump not to make decisions about Ukraine 'without us', but Trump's approach has raised fears in Kyiv and European capitals that the US might completely abandon its allies across the Atlantic.

**Zelensky says Putin 'has fear of a bilateral negotiation' to end Ukraine war**
Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky stated that Vladimir Putin 'has fear of a bilateral negotiation' to end the war in Ukraine. Zelensky emphasized that 'last week there was a real opportunity to take a significant step towards the end of the war, a ceasefire if there had been a high-level meeting between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey.' However, Zelensky highlighted the agreement reached on Friday for the exchange of 2,000 prisoners, 1,000 from each side. 'In any case, I think the decision on the exchange of prisoners of war is very important. A thousand people are many and I hope we can achieve this result,' he added. Zelensky insisted on the need to 'increase pressure on Russia, on Putin' to 'achieve peace as soon as possible.' To this end, he proposes the need for 'an unconditional ceasefire.' Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he will speak separately with Putin and Zelensky on Monday to put an end to the 'bloodbath' in Ukraine, a day after the first direct conversations in Istanbul in over three years of war. The Kremlin stated that a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be possible only if both parties reach an agreement beforehand. Trump, who has been pressuring Russia to accept an unconditional ceasefire for 30 days, said he will speak with Putin on Monday. The Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitri Peskov, stated that 'preparations are being made' for the call. The goal of this will be 'to put an end to the 'bloodbath', wrote Trump on his platform Truth Social. 'The United States wants to achieve a lasting end to the war between Russia and Ukraine,' declared Tammy Bruce, spokesperson for US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Rome to attend the inaugural mass of Pope León XIV on Sunday. 'The US peace plan defines the best way to move forward,' she added, confirming that Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov held a telephone conversation on Saturday, and welcomed the prisoner exchange agreement reached in Istanbul.

**Trump's Peace Initiative: A New Round of Negotiations with Russia and Ukraine**
US President Donald Trump held two phone calls last week, one with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the other with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The first call aimed to clarify Russia's intentions to end the war, but the outcome was unclear. Putin stated that Russia is not opposed to a ceasefire, but set several conditions, including the cessation of military support and mobilization in Ukraine. The US is seeking a 30-day ceasefire, agreed upon in Jeddah, which can be presented to the American public as a positive achievement. However, Putin linked further peace negotiations to several conditions beneficial to Russia. According to Dmitry Levus, a Ukrainian political analyst, 'They (Russians) are not directly refusing to engage in a peaceful process, but are setting a number of requirements that Ukraine must meet in order to start this process.' New details have emerged, potentially threatening Ukraine, including the possibility of Russia's legal recognition of some occupied Ukrainian territories. This is a key red line for Ukraine, and the US is aware of it, but considers it negotiable. Trump's envoy, Stephen Wietkoff, stated that 'These territories are Russophone, and there have been referendums where the majority of people have expressed a desire to be under Russian control.' Wietkoff also mentioned 'constitutional questions within Ukraine regarding what they can cede their territory.' The US is pushing for a ceasefire, but Ukraine is concerned about the potential recognition of Russian-occupied territories. Trump wants to reach an agreement before Easter, April 20, but the issue of territorial status is likely to block negotiations. The US is also facing internal contradictions, including the possibility of reducing Western aid to Ukraine, which is unacceptable to European countries. The US is trying to speed up the negotiations, but Ukraine is concerned about the potential pressure from the US. The negotiations are taking place in a traditional, bilateral format, with no 'shuttle diplomacy' yet. The Russian delegation includes Senator Grigory Karasin and Sergei Beseda, a former head of the 5th FSB service, which worked against Ukraine. Ukraine's delegation will include experts in energy, military, and other fields, as well as the leadership of the Office of the President and the Ministry of Defense. The US delegation will include Director of Policy Planning at the State Department Michael Anton, assistants to the US Special Representative for Ukraine, and representatives of the Office of the National Security Adviser. For Ukraine, this format may mean new pressure to make concessions if the US considers them necessary for a quick result. The key will be to win over Trump and his team.

**Trump Gives Russia a 'Homework Assignment' on Ukraine Ceasefire**
US President Donald Trump has given Russia a 'homework assignment' to work towards a full and comprehensive 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump stated, 'We will quickly work towards achieving a complete ceasefire and ultimately ending this terrible war between Russia and Ukraine.' However, the conditions for a full ceasefire and a future peace treaty, which would end the Special Military Operation (SVO), are complex. The US has acknowledged Russia's legitimate claims to Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. However, Ukraine must also agree to and implement the terms of any peace agreement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been trying to complicate and potentially derail the negotiation process by involving Europe and seeking favorable positions. There is a precedent for Ukraine's failure to implement agreements, such as the Minsk agreements, which were signed under the guarantee of France and Germany, but Ukraine systematically failed to comply. Similarly, Ukraine has failed to implement partial ceasefire agreements after Zelensky's presidency in 2019. Russia is waiting for the US to demonstrate how it will fulfill its 'homework assignment' and implement effective monitoring measures to ensure the fulfillment of the agreed terms. 'The two leaders agreed that the future with improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia has huge potential,' said Fiona Hill. 'The US has already proposed a significant deal, as I think, and he is not inclined to make any serious concessions,' said Hill. If the US achieves a deal, it will pressure Ukraine to implement it, potentially through sanctions, restrictions on aid, and limitations on officials deemed responsible for violating the agreement terms.

**Only Trump Believes in Peace with Putin**
US President Donald Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours during his campaign, but nearly three months after taking office, the conflict continues unabated. Trump's promise of quick agreements has emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sees this urgency as an opportunity to extract more concessions. The two-hour phone call between Trump and Putin, their second since Trump took office in January, has exposed the shortcomings of the 'negotiator-in-chief' and the difficulties of achieving a lasting peace agreement. Putin rejected the 30-day ceasefire agreed upon by the US and Ukraine, accepting only a limited truce on energy infrastructure. Trump's approach to his friends and enemies has been criticized, as he seems more interested in reaching an agreement with Putin than in ensuring Ukraine's security and independence. This stance plays into Moscow's hands. The phone call with Putin has revealed the extent to which Trump's pressure campaign on Kyiv over the past month, including public humiliation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House, has given Russia more room to maneuver. Putin not only rejected the unconditional ceasefire demanded by the US, but also set his own preconditions for peace, including the end of US-Ukraine military and intelligence cooperation. Trump's recent decision to suspend this cooperation, later reversing it, has set a dangerous precedent for Moscow, which sees it as a plausible demand. The coming weeks will show how far Trump is willing to go to please Putin, even if it means abandoning Ukraine. It all depends on whether the Kremlin can persuade the US that it has more to gain from its supposed economic association than from defending Ukraine. Putin recently spoke of a bilateral cooperation for aluminum production and the exploitation of rare earth minerals. Trump's obsession with disparaging his allies has severely weakened the transatlantic order and reduced Western power to impose its will. The positive side of this earthquake induced by the White House has been the awakening of European defense. Germany has approved its multi-billion dollar rearmament program this week, and the EU has given itself five years to counter its disuasion gaps and to be able to defend itself against Russian neo-imperialism. 'If Europe wants to avoid war, it must prepare for it,' is the new mantra. We Europeans will still have to thank Trump for this.

**Putin and Trump Agree on Ceasefire and Peace Talks in Ukraine**
Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump have concluded their phone talks on Ukraine, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Peskov stated that the talks were 'detailed and straightforward' and that Putin reaffirmed his commitment to a peaceful resolution to the conflict. He also announced that Russia and the US will form expert groups to work on a settlement to the crisis. Additionally, Putin agreed to a 30-day ceasefire on attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Peskov said that 'Ukraine and Russia will exchange 175 prisoners for 175 others', but noted that 'there are still several points related to ensuring control over a potential ceasefire'. The White House stated that Trump and Putin agreed on the 'need to achieve peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war', emphasizing that 'this conflict must end with a lasting peace'. The statement also highlighted the importance of improving US-Russia bilateral relations. Furthermore, reports suggest that Trump may recognize Crimea as Russian territory as part of a potential future peace agreement. According to sources, US officials have discussed the possibility of pressuring the UN to follow suit. However, the White House has refused to comment on the matter.

**Trump and Putin Agree on Immediate Ceasefire in Ukraine Conflict**
US President Donald Trump commented on his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on his Truth Social page, calling the conversation 'very good and productive'. Trump said, 'We agreed on an immediate ceasefire in all energy and infrastructure, understanding that we will work quickly to achieve a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, the end of this terrible war between Russia and Ukraine.' He added, 'This war would never have started if I were president! Many elements of the peace agreement were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are dying, and both President Putin and President Zelensky want it to end. This process is now in full force and action, and we, hopefully, for humanity, will complete this work!' The White House also commented on the talks, stating that both leaders agreed that the conflict should end with a strong peace. They also emphasized the need to improve bilateral relations between the US and Russia. 'The blood and resources that Ukraine and Russia are wasting on this war would be better spent on the needs of their people. This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with genuine and sincere peaceful efforts. The leaders agreed that the movement towards peace will start with an agreement on a ceasefire in the energy and infrastructure sectors, as well as technical negotiations on the implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, a complete ceasefire, and the establishment of a permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East,' said White House spokesperson Caroline Levitt. The leaders also discussed the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts. They also touched on the need to stop the spread of strategic weapons and plan to interact with other parties to ensure the widest possible application of these measures. Trump and Putin also shared a common opinion that Iran should never be allowed to destroy Israel. 'Both leaders agreed that the future with improved bilateral relations between the US and Russia has huge potential, including large economic deals and geopolitical stability after achieving peace,' Levitt said.

**Trump and Putin Discuss Ukraine Conflict and Bilateral Relations**
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone call that lasted over an hour and a half to discuss several strategic issues. According to the White House, Trump and Putin agreed on the 'need to achieve peace and stop the fighting in the Ukraine war', emphasizing that 'this conflict must end with a lasting peace'. They also agreed to 'improve bilateral relations between the United States and Russia'. Trump said, 'The money and blood that both Ukraine and Russia have spent on this war would have been better spent on the needs of their people... This conflict should not have started, and it should have ended a long time ago through sincere and genuine efforts for peace.' The statement confirmed that 'the two leaders agreed that peace in Ukraine will start with a ceasefire in the energy and infrastructure sectors, in addition to technical negotiations on implementing a ceasefire in the Black Sea, and a complete ceasefire and lasting peace. These negotiations will start immediately in the Middle East.' Trump and Putin also discussed the Middle East as a potential area for cooperation to prevent future conflicts, according to the White House. They also discussed the need to stop the spread of strategic weapons and will cooperate with others to ensure the widest possible implementation. They also expressed their opposition to Iran being in a position to destroy Israel. The two leaders agreed that the future holds great possibilities for improving bilateral relations between the United States and Russia, including large economic deals and geostrategic stability when peace is achieved.' The Kremlin reported that Putin supported Trump's initiative for a mutual ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine for 30 days, and issued instructions to the Russian army to comply. Putin also mentioned several important points related to the ceasefire, including Kiev's inability to negotiate, which may pose a challenge to implementing the agreement. Putin assured Trump that Russia will ensure the lives and humane treatment of Ukrainian soldiers who surrender in the Kursk region. In a related context, Putin informed Trump that a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine will take place on March 19, involving 175 prisoners from each side. As a 'goodwill gesture', Moscow announced its intention to hand over 23 wounded Ukrainian soldiers to Kiev. According to the Kremlin, Russia and the United States agreed to form joint expert groups to monitor the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine, and both sides expressed their readiness to start negotiations to establish a comprehensive plan related to maritime security in the Black Sea. Putin informed Trump of Moscow's readiness to work together to find permanent solutions to the Ukrainian crisis. The two presidents stressed the importance of normalizing bilateral relations between their countries, in light of their shared responsibility for ensuring global stability. They also discussed the Iranian file, where both expressed their opposition to Tehran's threat to destroy Israel. Finally, the agencies reported that the presidents discussed a wide range of areas where cooperation is possible, including the sports field, where Trump supported Putin's proposal to organize matches between the US National Hockey League (NHL) and the Russian Hockey League (KHL), in an effort to promote relations between the two countries on all levels.'

**Trump: Call with Putin was 'good and very productive'**
US President Donald Trump said in a social media post that his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin was 'good and very productive'. Trump stated that he and Putin agreed to an immediate ceasefire in all energy and infrastructure sectors, with an understanding to work quickly to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire, and ultimately, end the war between Russia and Ukraine. Trump added that 'this war would not have started if I were the president!' They discussed various aspects of the peace agreement, including the killing of thousands of soldiers, and the desire of both Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky to end the war. Trump concluded by saying 'this process is now in full effect, and we hope to complete the mission for humanity!' The White House stated that Trump and Putin agreed on the 'need to achieve peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war', emphasizing that 'this conflict must end with a lasting peace'. They also agreed to improve bilateral relations between the US and Russia. The White House added that 'the money and blood spent by both Ukraine and Russia in this war would have been better spent on the needs of their people... It was not supposed to start, and it should have ended a long time ago through sincere and dedicated efforts for peace.' The statement confirmed that the two leaders agreed that peace in Ukraine will begin with a ceasefire in the energy and infrastructure sectors, as well as technical negotiations on implementing a ceasefire in the Black Sea, and a comprehensive ceasefire and lasting peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.' Additionally, 'the two leaders discussed the Middle East as a potential area for cooperation to prevent future conflicts', according to the White House. They also discussed the need to stop the spread of strategic weapons, and will cooperate with others to ensure the widest possible implementation. The two leaders also expressed their view that Iran should not be in a position to destroy Israel. They agreed that the future holds great possibilities for improving bilateral relations between the US and Russia, including massive economic deals and geostrategic stability when peace is achieved.'

**Trump Seeks Agreement to End Ukraine War, Doesn't Rule Out Ceasefire**
US President Donald Trump expressed his desire to directly reach an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, but emphasized that a ceasefire usually occurs before a deal is made. 'I would like to go straight to an agreement, but the ceasefire always happens a little before,' Trump said during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. Macron stressed that the achievement of peace should not mean Ukraine's 'surrender', but rather allow for the country's sovereignty and enable it to negotiate with other interested parties on issues affecting it. 'This peace should not mean Ukraine's surrender. It should not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. It should allow Ukrainian sovereignty and allow it to negotiate with other interested parties on the issues that affect it,' Macron said. Macron considered that in this bilateral meeting, 'significant steps forward' have been taken. He is convinced that there is a path to follow and that he and Trump share the same beliefs. Macron is the first European leader to meet with Trump since his return to the White House on January 20. He will also meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. Macron pointed out that he and Trump discussed their desire to put an end to the conflict, have a ceasefire that is measurable, verifiable, and allows for the negotiation of a long-term ceasefire. Macron believes that Trump's return to power offers new opportunities: 'Now there is the possibility of a great change, because there is a new US administration. This is a new context, so there are good reasons for Trump to talk to Putin again.' Macron emphasized that although he would never give 'any advice' to Trump, his experience with Russian President Vladimir Putin allows him to assert that it is essential to have security guarantees and 'talk to other leaders, especially when you don't agree.'

**US and Russia Propose Three-Stage Peace Plan for Ukraine**
According to diplomatic sources close to the US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, the two countries are proposing a three-stage peace plan that includes a ceasefire, elections in Ukraine, and then a final agreement. However, the idea of holding elections was later denied, with Russia explaining that they were pushing for this point. Details: Several diplomatic sources reported that the US and Russia consider holding new elections in Ukraine a key condition for the success of the reconciliation process. However, another American source familiar with the talks softened this statement, explaining that the point about elections was being 'pushed' during the negotiations and 'may be part of future talks', but not currently. The White House has not commented on this statement yet, but is expected to do so soon. Multiple diplomatic sources provided the following view from the Ukrainian side: 'Putin assesses the probability of electing a puppet president (of Ukraine - ed.) as quite high, and is convinced that any other candidate, except for the current President of Ukraine, will be more flexible and willing to negotiate and make concessions. On the other hand, Trump is ready to accept any election result, including the possibility of electing a pro-Russian puppet. Trump and Putin assess the chances of the current President of Ukraine being re-elected as low.' As a result of the meeting, the US and Russian delegations agreed to 'remove irritants from bilateral relations' and continue working on preparing talks on Russia's war against Ukraine.
