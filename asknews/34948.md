**U.S. funding halted Africa's HIV crisis. Trump's cuts have forced a reckoning.**
The US funding for HIV/AIDS treatment in Eswatini has been halted, leaving the country to grapple with the consequences. The Miracle Campus, a hospital built with US aid, has been forced to shut down most of its services, including its maternity ward and preventive care. The hospital's executive director, Echo VanderWal, says that the US aid had become unsustainable and that the country needs to take ownership of its own healthcare. However, many patients and healthcare workers are concerned about the impact of the shutdown on the country's healthcare system. The US government has stated that PEPFAR, the program that provided the aid, will continue, but with a gradual reduction in funding. The situation has raised questions about the role of foreign aid in developing countries and the need for sustainable healthcare systems.

**UNAIDS 'Deeply Encouraged' by Musk's Comments on US Funding for AIDS**
The United Nations agency dedicated to combating AIDS, UNAIDS, expressed 'deep encouragement' on Wednesday (21) by the recent comments of Elon Musk, advisor to Donald Trump, on US funding for international aid. Musk indicated in an interview at the Doha Economic Forum that the adjustments in funding could be revised. UNAIDS calculated that there could be 4.2 million more deaths related to AIDS in 2029 due to the cuts in foreign aid ordered by the Trump administration as part of efforts to reduce US public spending. Musk asked a journalist in the interview, 'What medical programs are not being funded?' before adding, 'I will resolve this immediately.' 'If it's true, I doubt it, we will resolve it,' he completed, after the journalist cited as an example the activities related to prevention. In a statement, the UN agency expressed 'deep encouragement by Musk's statement that he will address the current crisis of lack of funding.' Trump froze a large part of the US international aid while eliminating programs that do not fit his priorities. His administration granted exemptions, including for the Pepfar program, one of the pillars of the fight against AIDS worldwide. However, UNAIDS considers that the fight against the disease has been hindered despite the exemption.

**South Africa says its budget can't cover for the deep US cuts in foreign aid**
South Africa's Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana stated that the country cannot cover the $430 million shortfall caused by the Trump administration's cuts in foreign aid. The cuts, which affected the HIV treatment and prevention program, have put thousands of health care jobs at risk. Godongwana presented an updated budget that prioritizes financial resources for current programs, but warned that more pain may be coming, including the potential withdrawal of PEPFAR funding. According to the U.N. AIDS agency, PEPFAR has saved at least 26 million lives since its inception in 2003. The updated budget allocates 20.7 billion rand ($1.1 billion) for health, a significant decrease from the previous allocation of 28.9 billion rand ($1.6 billion).

**Elon Musk on AIDS Medication: 'I'll Fix It Right Now' | National Review**
At the Qatar Economic Forum, Elon Musk was asked about PEPFAR, a U.S. program to combat AIDS in Africa. Musk claimed that there have been no interruptions in the program due to the DOGE house-cleaning at the State Department's USAID, but was skeptical when informed that whole clinics have closed due to funding and communication issues. Musk insisted that he would 'fix it right now' if he was aware of any stoppages, but experts suggest that he should ask the president to appoint a czar to undo the damage to PEPFAR and other humanitarian aid programs. Dr. Jonathan Ellen and Francesca Merico, experts in public health, expressed concerns about the negative impact of DOGE cuts and the need for a czar to get PEPFAR back online before disease spreads.

**South Africa Says Its Budget Can't Cover For Deep US Cuts In Foreign Aid**
South Africa's Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana presented an updated budget to Parliament, which does not include value-added tax increases. He stated that the country cannot afford to make up for the $436 million in annual funding cuts for HIV treatment and prevention in South Africa, which was lost due to the dismantling of USAID by the Trump administration. Godongwana said the budget prioritizes financial resources for what is currently feasible and defers other programs until 'our resources allow.' He warned that more pain might be coming, citing the potential withdrawal of PEPFAR funding, which has saved at least 26 million lives globally since 2003. The current budget allocates 20.7 billion rand ($1.1 billion) for health, a significant decrease from the previous allocation of 28.9 billion rand ($1.6 billion).

**Sony Shuts Down PlayStation Stars Loyalty Program**
Sony has announced the end of the PlayStation Stars loyalty program, with no new members allowed as of May 21, 2025. Existing members can still earn and redeem points until July 23, 2025, but the program will fully cease to exist on November 2, 2026. Members will retain their Digital Collectibles. Sony is investigating ideas for future loyalty programs, but nothing is set in stone. The program was seen as a strange idea, with Digital Collectibles that were too close to NFTs for comfort. According to the official PlayStation website, Sony has decided to sunset the program, gradually phasing it out until the end of 2026.

**Trump's Measures Leave Africa Without HIV Treatment and Clinics**
The measures taken by Donald Trump are already being felt in Africa, where clinics are being closed and treatment for HIV is lacking. In 2023, the US allocated $4.2 billion to the PEPFAR program, which covered over 20 million people worldwide, mostly in Africa. However, the US government has since stopped funding, with no debate, negotiation, or opportunity to close the programs. 'The way the US government has ended its funding has been deliberately brutal and designed to show that the US is all-powerful,' says a special advisor to the Director-General of the World Health Organization. 'They wanted to show the world that it was their money, that they would do what they wanted with it, and that they would no longer invest in international aid,' he adds. Despite a limited exemption approved on January 28, many people have lost access to vital treatments, and those who still receive treatment are unsure if they will continue to do so. 'The annual per capita expenditure on health is much lower than what is needed to treat a patient with HIV. They simply do not have the money, and they will not be able to take care of it,' laments Abdool Karim. Additionally, even if governments cover medication costs, there may not be enough money for prevention, condoms, sexual health care, or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which has protected vulnerable populations such as sex workers and the LGBTQ+ community.

**ANALYSIS-How US reproductive policy abroad mirrors political divides at home**
The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is facing uncertainty due to the US foreign aid freeze and the politicization of reproductive policies. The program, credited with saving millions of lives from AIDS since its launch in 2003, has been accused of indirectly funding abortion providers, despite the Helms Amendment barring PEPFAR from financing abortion. Conservative lawmakers have renewed the program for only one year instead of its usual five-year authorization, and Trump's 'America First' foreign policy has made PEPFAR a likely target. The program's future is jeopardized by the narrative that it is 'tainted' by its association with reproductive rights, and the uncertainty has already led to clinics closing and confusion about what medicine can be distributed. 'If PEPFAR is modified or discontinued, it's not because of evidence - it's because a manufactured crisis serves an ideological agenda,' said Ngare Kariuki, a researcher and gender advocate.

**The Outlook for PEPFAR in 2025 and Beyond**
PEPFAR, the U.S. global HIV/AIDS program, is facing significant challenges that could impede its ability to fulfill its mission. The program's current short-term authorization expires on March 25, 2025, and Congress is increasingly looking for program reforms and ultimately scale down. PEPFAR has been affected by President Trump's foreign aid funding freeze, which has disrupted services and led to increases in HIV-related deaths and new HIV infections. The program has also been impacted by the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, which requires foreign non-governmental organizations to certify that they will not perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning. Additionally, PEPFAR's reliance on USAID, which is being dismantled, poses a significant risk to the program's operations. The future of PEPFAR is uncertain, with concerns raised by some members of Congress about abortion and increasing pressure on the program to demonstrate more concrete plans about its future.

**Half Of PEPFAR Still Unfunded, USAID Cuts Hamper Implementation**
Despite a recent State Department memo restoring some funding, sources claim that half of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) remains unfunded. The Trump administration's cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are hampering the implementation of PEPFAR, as the agency is being dismantled and its programs targeted for reductions. According to sources, the administration initially paused PEPFAR funding for 90 days after an executive order on January 24, and the situation continues to deteriorate.

**US Withdraws from WHO, Putting Important Programs at Risk**
The US government has officially withdrawn from the World Health Organization (WHO), with the withdrawal taking effect on January 22, 2026. This has put important WHO programs at risk. The US government contributed 18% of the WHO budget last year and funded 75% of the HIV and Hepatitis program, 61% of the Tuberculosis program, and 29% of the program to strengthen health systems in poorer countries. The WHO has expressed concern over the US government's decision to end the PEPFAR program, which has provided HIV medication to over 20 million people in more than 50 poorer countries, including over half a million children under 15. The WHO has also expressed concern over the US government's decision to end the CDC's collaboration with the WHO, which has provided important analyses and expertise in evaluating health risks, researching pathogens, and more. The WHO has warned that the withdrawal of the US program will put lives at risk and threaten years of efforts to prevent infections.

**Funding for long-standing AIDS program at risk: 3 notes**
Funding for the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program is at risk of being halted on January 27, potentially disrupting the provision of antiviral medications for millions worldwide. According to CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered a 90-day review of foreign assistance programs, which will pause funding for PEPFAR. It is unclear if local stockpiles of drugs can make up for the delivery shortfalls during the pause. PEPFAR, which began under President George W. Bush's administration, provides billions in funding to organizations fighting HIV and currently treats 20 million people across 55 countries. As CBS reported, 'It is unclear if local stockpiles of drugs can make up for the delivery shortfalls during the pause.'

**Funding for AIDS relief program to stop in coming days after foreign aid pause ordered**
The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program may face a halt in funding as soon as Monday due to a foreign aid pause ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. According to sources, this could interrupt the provision of anti-viral medications (ARVs) for millions of people. While funding could be turned back on pending the outcome of a 90-day review, there are concerns that congressional support for PEPFAR is in peril due to a revelation that groups receiving aid performed abortions, a violation of U.S. law. President Trump has called for other countries to spend more on foreign aid, stating, 'We're like a one-way street so we want other people to help us and we want other people to join us.' However, Reps. Gregory W. Meeks and Lois Frankel argue that foreign assistance is a 'strategic investment in our future' and 'vital for U.S. global leadership and a more resilient world.'

**US Department of State Freezes Funds for Almost All Foreign Aid Programs**
The US Department of State has ordered the freezing of new funds for almost all of the country's foreign aid programs, with exceptions for emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt. This move threatens to quickly stop billions of dollars in projects funded by the US on health, education, development, job training, anti-corruption, security, and other issues in various parts of the world. The US provides the most foreign aid of any country, with a total of around $60 billion in 2023, or about 1% of the US budget. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's order, sent by cable to US embassies around the world, specifically exempted emergency food programs, such as those helping to feed millions in Sudan, where a famine is occurring amidst an armed conflict. However, the order disappointed humanitarian officials by not including specific exemptions for vital health programs, such as vaccination programs. A globally acclaimed HIV program, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), was among those included in the spending freeze, which will last at least three months. The program is credited with saving 25 million lives, including 5.5 million children, since its launch by President George W. Bush. Some aid projects began receiving orders to stop work on Friday afternoon. Many aid organizations were interpreting the directive as an order to immediately stop work on US-funded aid worldwide, said a former high-ranking official at the US Agency for International Development. Many would likely cease operations immediately to avoid incurring more costs, the official said. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Suspending funding 'could have life-or-death consequences' for children and families around the world, said Abby Maxman, executive director of Oxfam America.

**Funds for fight against HIV/AIDS paused in Trump aid freeze**
President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on foreign aid has put the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) at risk, which has saved 25 million lives worldwide. The pause applies to both new and existing funding, and a stop-work order has been issued for all existing foreign assistance. U.S. officials warn that the consequences could be dire, with 'people will die' if the program is halted. PEPFAR, which disburses billions of dollars in aid to fight HIV every year, has been widely supported by lawmakers from both parties. The likely impact on PEPFAR has shocked advocates, with some calling it 'deadly' and 'a clumsy destruction of U.S. credibility.' It is possible that the Trump administration will issue waivers for PEPFAR and other programs, but some advocates say the pause appears to be designed to be disruptive.
