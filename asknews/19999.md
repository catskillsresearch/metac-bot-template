**The End of the Mobile Era? OpenAI's New Product Could Revolutionize the Way We Interact with Technology**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has announced the company's first product for 2026, which is expected to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. According to Altman, the current products we use are 'decades old' and people will connect with AI in 'new and innovative ways'. Altman has already tested a prototype of this product, which he describes as 'the coolest piece of technology the world has seen', and has paid over 6 billion euros for it. The product is expected to be a device that can hear and respond to audio, without the need for screens. Meanwhile, Meta has already released its own product, a pair of glasses that can be used to make phone calls, take photos, and listen to audio. However, the future of the mobile phone industry is uncertain, and Apple, the creator of the iPhone, has not had success with its AI products and does not seem to be planning to release any smart glasses anytime soon. Jony Ive, the co-creator of the iPhone, has left Apple to start his own design company, LoveFrom, and has collaborated with Altman on a new startup, io, which has been sold to OpenAI. Ive has described Altman as a 'rare visionary', and his involvement in this project gives it a certain level of credibility. However, it remains to be seen whether this new product will be successful.

**Sam Altman Prepares Secret AI Device with Former Apple Designer Jony Ive**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has revealed ambitious plans for a new AI device, developed in collaboration with former Apple designer Jony Ive. The goal is to create 100 million 'assistants' of AI, which Altman believes will be 'the biggest thing we've ever done as a company', according to The Wall Street Journal. The acquisition of Ive's startup, io, for $6.5 billion dollars, could add a value of $1 billion to OpenAI, according to Altman. Altman highlighted the deep connection he has with Ive, who compared their collaboration to the one he had with Steve Jobs. Although the details are scarce, Altman and Ive offered some hints about the project. The new device will be positioned as a third essential device, after a MacBook Pro and an iPhone, and will aim to move users away from screens. According to the Journal, Ive spoke of a 'new era of design', and Altman expressed his admiration for Apple's integration of hardware and software, hinting at a 'family of devices' (or ecosystem). Altman emphasized the importance of secrecy to avoid competitors copying the product before its launch. Despite not sending 100 million devices immediately, Altman predicts that OpenAI will reach that number of shipments 'faster than any company has ever sent 100 million of something new', with the goal of launching the device by the end of 2026.

**Sam Altman and Jony Ive's Mysterious AI Device: A New Era of Interaction?**
Sam Altman and Jony Ive, co-founders of the mysterious AI device, aim to launch it before the end of 2026. According to Jony Ive, 'These products were very bad', referring to previous attempts such as the Ai Pin and R1. The former Apple chief designer, who recently sold his startup io to OpenAI for $6.5 billion, has been working with OpenAI's teams for 18 months. The device will not be a smartphone or smart glasses, but a discreet object that fits in a pocket and can be used on a desk. It will be designed to be aware of the environment and user's life, and will become the 'third essential' device on a user's desk, after the MacBook and iPhone. Jony Ive described it as a 'new design movement', while Sam Altman sees it as a family of products that combine hardware and software in a cohesive way, like Apple. They aim to revolutionize the way we interact with AI, moving away from the traditional model of opening a computer, going to a website, and typing a request. According to Sam Altman, the device should be commercialized by the end of 2026, with a goal of producing 100 million units, although he acknowledged that this is an ambitious target.

**Elon Musk vs Sam Altman continues, so does the courtroom battle: The whole drama explained in 5 points**
Elon Musk and Sam Altman, co-founders of OpenAI, are engaged in a high-stakes legal battle over the direction of the company. Musk claims that OpenAI has strayed from its founding principles as a non-profit organization and has become a 'close-source, maximum-profit' venture controlled by Microsoft. Altman has announced that OpenAI will remain a non-profit organization, but Musk's legal team is not convinced. The lawsuit, which seeks a jury trial, is still scheduled to go ahead in March 2026. The drama is a clash of ideologies, egos, and the future of artificial intelligence, with Musk accusing Altman of betraying the company's original mission. 'OpenAI was created as an open source, non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google Now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all,' Musk said. Altman has defended the company's decision to restructure and has maintained that OpenAI will remain a non-profit organization. The trial may still be a year away, but the drama is already in full swing.

**Sam Altman's lawyers roast Elon Musk in scorching new court filing**
Sam Altman's lawyers have filed a scathing new court document in response to Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI. The filing accuses Musk of trying to take down OpenAI and build a competitor to seize the technological lead for his own benefit. OpenAI has also counter-sued Musk, calling his actions 'bad-faith tactics' to slow down the company and gain control of leading AI innovations. Musk had initially filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in February 2024, accusing the company of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. However, OpenAI's executives claim that Musk was deceived into cofounding the company by playing on his fears about AI's existential risks. The case is set to go to trial in March 2026.

**Sam Altman Defends AI-Generated Ghibli Images: Tools for Creative Democratization**
OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has defended the use of artificial intelligence to generate images in the style of Studio Ghibli, saying it will not replace human art but rather enhance the creative process. Altman argued that AI will 'contribute to the democratization of creativity' and benefit society as a whole, despite the controversy. In a recent podcast with Indian entrepreneur Farooq Mayya, Altman discussed the ethical debate surrounding the imitation of famous artistic styles, such as Ghibli. He referenced a famous quote from Hayao Miyazaki, co-founder of Ghibli, who said nine years ago that AI-generated images are 'an insult to life itself.' However, Altman responded, 'I think it's a misunderstanding.' Altman acknowledged that AI may lead to job losses, but emphasized that it will not replace human art, but rather augment the abilities of artists and expand the pool of participants in the creative process. He added, 'Just as designers adapted from hand-drawn illustrations to tools like Photoshop, artists will find ways to incorporate AI into their work.' Altman noted that OpenAI's image generation tools have seen massive growth, with users on the verge of surpassing 1 billion generated images. He highlighted that India has become the fastest-growing market for OpenAI, where creators and companies use the tools to design logos, 3D models, and infographics. Altman believes that AI will bring about fundamental changes, but humans will remain at the center of the creative process. He also mentioned that new jobs like 'prompt engineering' will emerge in this new era. In another part of the conversation, Altman predicted that AI assistants will make developers 10 times more productive by 2025-2026. He also expected the emergence of 'smart agents' that can perform tasks like booking a car or writing code modifications independently. Regarding the future of India's IT sector, which has a $250 billion export value, Altman said that AI will change the shape of jobs but will not eliminate the need for programming, but rather open up new opportunities due to the increasing global demand for software.

**Sam Altman: Mastering AI Tools is the New Programming**
Sam Altman, the head of OpenAI, believes that mastering AI tools is the new programming. In an interview with Ben Thompson, Altman said that when he was in high school, studying programming was crucial for success and high salary. However, now he thinks that those who can effectively use AI tools will have an advantage in the job market. 'If AI is the brain of the robot, then RPA is its hands', Altman said. He recommends focusing on prompt engineering instead of programming. Altman also thinks that agent-based programming will be the only area of development that will remain in demand. He notes that large companies have already delegated 50% of AI code writing to AI tools. However, Altman acknowledges that OpenAI still has a lot of work and job openings for programmers and will continue to compete for top talent. Nevertheless, in the long run, AI products from OpenAI and competing companies will lead to a reduction in the job market. Altman says, 'Perhaps the world really needs fewer programmers'. Dario Amodei, the head of Anthropic, shares a similar view, but makes more radical predictions, stating that programmers may lose their jobs by 2026. Arvind Krishna, the head of IBM, has a different opinion, believing that AI will make programmers work more, and that quantum computing will be the key to a technological breakthrough for humanity.

**OpenAI CEO Predicts Imminent Arrival of Artificial General Intelligence**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has published a blog post titled 'Three Observations' where he discusses the imminent arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its impact on society. According to Altman, AGI will transform our lives by 2026, making many tasks easier and more efficient. However, this will also lead to the displacement of many jobs, as AI will be able to perform tasks that were previously done by humans. Altman emphasizes the need for people to adapt and find new ways to contribute to society. He suggests that autonomy, determination, and resilience will be essential skills in the future. Altman also predicts that the cost of many products will decrease significantly due to AI, but the price of luxury goods and resources may increase. He also mentions that there will be difficult decisions to be made regarding the security of AGI, which will be unpopular. Altman concludes that by 2035, anyone should be able to access a level of intelligence equivalent to that of the entire world in 2025, and have access to unlimited genius to guide them.

**Rivoluzione AGI: Sam Altman Explains How AI Will Change Our Lives**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has outlined a strategic vision for the role of General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) in shaping the global economic and social future. AGI represents a turning point in the history of technological innovation. Altman imagines a future where AGI can cure diseases, amplify individual creativity, and enable anyone to achieve results previously reserved for a few. He notes that the power of AI is proportional to the resources invested, with predictable scaling laws. The costs of AI are rapidly decreasing, with the cost of GPT-4 tokens dropping by over 150 times in 2024 compared to 2023. The socioeconomic value of AI is growing exponentially, making it unlikely that investments in the sector will stop in the short term. Altman predicts the widespread introduction of AI agents, virtual collaborators that can support professionals in various fields. He emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the benefits of AGI are accessible to all, and that policies and governance are put in place to avoid an authoritarian use of the technology. By 2035, Altman envisions a world where every individual has access to an intelligence comparable to that of the combined population of 2025, democratizing genius and enabling unprecedented creative explosions.
