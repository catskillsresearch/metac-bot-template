**2027: Automatic tickets for lawmakers will boost Tinubu's re-election bid -- Progressive youths**
The Progressive Youths for National Stability (PYNS) has endorsed the proposed plan to grant automatic return tickets to high-performing All Progressives Congress (APC) federal lawmakers, calling it a 'masterstroke' that will boost President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's re-election bid in 2027. According to PYNS President Comrade Aminu Mustapha Bako, the initiative will consolidate the legislative-executive synergy achieved under the Renewed Hope Agenda and reduce legislative turnover that often stalls governance. Bako warned that the APC must guard against internal sabotage and urged lawmakers to remain loyal to Tinubu, citing a history of mutual respect and shared vision for Nigeria's future. He also warned that disrupting this alignment could harm legislative cohesion and derail key policies currently in motion under the Tinubu administration. 'This is not about entrenching individuals; it's about entrenching progress,' Bako said. 'We are advocating for continuity of competence. Lawmakers who have become engines of reform and partners in delivering critical legislation deserve the chance to complete their work.'

**'Heartbreaking': Gas extension decision slammed**
Faith leaders have expressed 'deep concern' and 'heartbreak' over the Federal Government's decision to extend the North West Shelf gas processing facility until 2070. The Uniting Church in Australia's President, Rev Charissa Suli, said she is 'profoundly disappointed' by the decision, citing the devastating impacts of climate change on Pacific nations. Rev Mitchell Garlett from the Uniting Aboriginal & Islander Christian Congress added that the decision was made without 'close consultation with the relevant Traditional Owners'. The project is expected to produce 4.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions over its lifetime, and environmental groups have raised concerns about the threat to First Nations cultural heritage sites, including the 60,000-year-old Murujuga rock art site. Woodside, the company behind the project, claims it will support thousands of jobs and supply affordable energy to Western Australia.

**Taylor Swift's elegant 'swipe' at ex-bestie Blake Lively... as insiders reveal why Travis Kelce WASN'T at celebration dinner | Daily Mail Online**
Taylor Swift has finally bought back the rights to her master recordings, a long-time goal of hers. She celebrated the news with a dinner at her favorite New York restaurant, Via Carota, accompanied by her brother Austin and actress Dakota Johnson. The dinner was a big celebration, according to an insider, who said Swift is 'absolutely on cloud nine' and has been 'praying for this moment for a long time.' The outfit choice of a black, floral print frock and red lip may have been a subtle dig at her ex-bestie Blake Lively, who has been involved in a legal battle with Swift's friend Justin Baldoni. Lively's character in the movie 'It Ends With Us' was a florist, and Swift may have been sending a message that she won't be taken for a ride. Travis Kelce, Swift's boyfriend, was noticeably absent from the dinner, but the insider said they will see more of Swift in the next few months.

**Lai Ching-te's Absence from World Masters Games Sparks Criticism**
Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te missed the opening ceremony of the World Masters Games (世壯運) in Taipei, citing 'busy national affairs'. This decision has sparked criticism, as Lai had been invited to attend the event in February, but only informed the public two days before the event that he would not be attending. Meanwhile, Vice President Shih Ming-teh was scheduled to attend, but Lai's decision to skip the event has been seen as a missed opportunity for him to interact with Huang Ren-xun, the founder of Hua Da Group, who was carrying the torch for the event. Huang had just returned from a meeting with former US President Donald Trump in the UAE and was in Taipei to participate in the event. Lai's decision to miss the event has been seen as a sign of his narrow-mindedness and lack of understanding of his role as President. 'He only sees the event as being held in the north, not as a chance for Taiwan to shine on the international stage,' said a critic. 'He is only concerned about not giving an opportunity to the Taipei City Mayor, Chiang Wan-an, but not about Taiwan's international reputation.'
