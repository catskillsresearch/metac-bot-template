**EU Seeks 'Good' Trade Deal with US Before July 9, 2025**
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that the European Union is ready to move quickly in trade talks with the United States, but will need until July 9, 2025, to reach a 'good agreement'. She added that she had a 'good' phone call with US President Donald Trump. Von der Leyen stated that 'Europe is ready to move forward in the talks quickly and decisively. To reach a good agreement, we will need time until July 9th.' This comes after Trump said on Friday that he is not satisfied with the pace of trade talks with the EU and threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all EU goods starting June 1. In early April, Trump set a 90-day deadline for trade talks between the EU and the US, which is set to end on July 9. Trump's new trade threats, which shook markets in the US and abroad, came after he accused the EU of being 'very difficult to deal with' in a post on his Truth Social platform earlier on Friday. Trump's actions regarding his recommendation to impose new tariffs on the EU and the US administration's frustration with the lack of compliance by countries and companies with US demands were revealed. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump's advisors have privately expressed their frustration to European officials about the EU's inconsistent priorities, which have hindered progress in trade talks. The US team has complained about what they see as a 'cautious and hesitant' European approach to presenting concrete offers to address US concerns, such as tariffs on streaming services, value-added taxes, car regulations, and fines on US companies in antitrust cases. The sources added that Washington has not yet received a commitment from EU leaders to impose tariffs on Chinese industries, which is a priority for the Trump administration in its efforts to escalate trade pressure on China.

**Trump's Frustration with EU: A Threat of Tariffs and a Call for Faster Negotiations**
US President Donald Trump has expressed frustration and anger towards the European Union, accusing Brussels of being created to 'take advantage of the United States'. This frustration has led to a threat of a 50% tariff on June 1. As the deadline of July 9 approaches, when the 90-day pause for trade negotiations will expire, Trump has escalated his demands in an attempt to speed up the negotiations, which he believes are proceeding too slowly. The different priorities of EU member states and Brussels' cautious approach, as well as its reluctance to present concrete proposals to address US concerns, have exasperated Trump and his team. According to the Wall Street Journal, the US administration has not been able to achieve significant progress in its talks with the EU, particularly in obtaining Brussels' commitment to impose new tariffs on Chinese industries, a key element in all ongoing US trade negotiations. Trump has resorted to a new tariff threat, also in view of his upcoming international appointments, including the G7 summit in Canada and the NATO summit in Brussels. Trump has been demanding an increase in defense spending from EU member states, from 2% to 5% of their GDP, in the name of 'America First'. On the commercial front, Trump has said, 'We have been robbed for years, even at the level of NATO. But it will not happen again.' One of the problems in the negotiations with the EU is the diversity in the style of negotiations. Brussels follows the rules of international trade, while Trump does not follow the rules and script. The US president wants to announce an agreement soon and cannot digest the EU's slowness. Additionally, many countries engaged in talks with the US have noted that American negotiators seek unilateral offers, viewing negotiations as 'take' rather than 'give and take'.

**Trump Delays 50% Tariff on EU Imports Until July 9**
US President Donald Trump has announced that he will delay the introduction of a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union (EU) until at least July 9. According to Trump, the decision was made after a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, during which they agreed to start new trade negotiations. Trump stated that it was an 'honor' to delay the introduction of the tariff. 'Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, called me and asked to extend the deadline for the introduction of a 50% tariff on trade with the European Union until July 9, 2025. I agreed to the extension - it was an honor to do so,' Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Von der Leyen also assured Trump that EU-US trade negotiations on tariffs 'will start soon.' The European Commission President stated that the EU has enough time until July 9 to reach a trade deal with the US. Trump wants the EU to unilaterally lower tariffs on American goods. The US is pushing the EU to make concessions, and without them, the EU cannot make progress in tariff negotiations, according to the Financial Times. Trump has previously stated that he wants the EU to buy $350 billion worth of energy from the US, which would eliminate the trade deficit between the two. 'The trade deficit with the EU... will disappear quickly... One easy way is if they buy energy from us... They can buy it, and we'll get rid of $350 billion in a week. They'll have to buy it,' Trump said in April. However, on May 23, Trump announced his intention to impose a 50% tariff on EU imports, citing unsuccessful negotiations between the US and EU. 'Our negotiations with them lead to nothing! Therefore, I recommend introducing a direct tariff of 50% on goods from the European Union, starting from June 1, 2025,' Trump said.

**Von der Leyen and Trump Engage in Transatlantic Dialogue, but Tensions Remain**
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced a positive phone call with US President Donald Trump, rekindling the transatlantic dialogue on trade and tariffs. 'I had a positive conversation with Trump. The US and EU share one of the world's strongest and most strategic commercial relationships. Europe is ready to move forward with determination in the negotiations. To reach a solid agreement, we need time until July 9th', von der Leyen wrote on X. However, in Washington, the atmosphere remains tense. Trump has again accused the EU of taking advantage of the US, threatening new 50% tariffs starting from June 1st. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration's frustration stems from the slow pace of negotiations and the EU's reluctance to make concrete decisions, particularly on the possibility of introducing tariffs against Chinese imports, a key point for the White House. With the July 9th deadline, which marks the end of the 90-day moratorium granted to negotiate, approaching, Trump has intensified the pressure. Americans complain about the internal divisions within the EU and Brussels' too cautious approach. Sources close to the White House report that EU negotiators remain anchored to multilateral trade rules, while Trump prefers a transactional and muscular approach. 'For him - notes the New York Times - negotiations do not follow a scheme of reciprocity, but of unilateral imposition'. The list of American demands is long and ambitious: removal of the European VAT, relaxation of sanitary standards to facilitate the export of US beef, and changes to the regulatory framework for digital services and social media.

**Trump’s tariff chaos rattles markets — and conservative media is split - Poynter**
The stock market has been experiencing significant volatility due to Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff policies. The Wall Street Journal, a conservative publication owned by Rupert Murdoch, has criticized Trump's trade policies as 'reckless' and called for a policy reversal. Meanwhile, Trump supporters are trying to explain or dismiss concerns about his policies, which is a departure from their previous criticism of Joe Biden's administration. The article also mentions a legal battle between Newsmax and Dominion Voting Systems, with a judge ruling that Newsmax made defamatory statements about Dominion. Additionally, the article touches on various media news and tidbits, including a defamation retrial between Sarah Palin and the New York Times, and a new editor-in-chief at The Advocate.

**Trump Spotted Reading New York Post on Tariff Policy**
During a recent visit to the Trump National Golf Club in Florida, President Trump was photographed reading a newspaper while driving. According to the Associated Press, Trump was reading the New York Post, a tabloid newspaper, specifically the four-page special feature on his tariff policy. The article discussed the pros and cons of the policy, noting that it may lead to increased employment in the US and Japan as major automakers move their production bases to the country. However, it also warned that tariffs imposed on Asian countries could lead to price increases for products such as yoga wear. The article also mentioned China's potential retaliatory tariffs and the concerns of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell regarding inflation and slowing growth. Trump has been known to favor conservative media outlets, and the New York Post is often seen as a more populist alternative to liberal-leaning newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post. Trump has previously expressed his admiration for the New York Post on social media and has even displayed a large front-page image of the newspaper on the wall of his Oval Office. Additionally, the Associated Press reports that Trump was also seen reading the Wall Street Journal while driving on the same day.

**How Trump’s Tariff Brinksmanship Could Still Pummel NYC’s Economy**
President Donald Trump's tariff brinksmanship could still pummel New York City's economy, despite a 90-day pause in the latest round of reciprocal tariffs. Experts warn that higher prices, even from earlier tariffs and the 125% levy still in place for China, will strain budgets, especially for less well-off New Yorkers. Emily Eisner, chief economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, said, 'This is going to be a bad year, and that’s going to take a hit on the economy and the revenue that is going to be raised from income taxes.' Businesses are worried, with 90% of those responding to a Manhattan Chamber survey expressing concern about the tariffs. The damage on Wall Street is clear, with major stock market indexes down 20% and mergers and acquisition activity falling sharply. The New York City Tourism + Conventions agency is revising its 2025 forecast downward, and the first signs of the impact of tariffs might come in May, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics releasing the consumer price index. The state and city will report personal income tax collections for the April to June period in July, which will signal how much damage has been done to Wall Street.

**Murdoch's Paper: Trump Just Made the Swamp So Much Bigger**
The Wall Street Journal's editorial board criticized President Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs, stating that they will be a windfall for Beltway lobbyists. The tariffs, which include a 10% baseline import tax and additional duties ranging from 20 to 34% on products from about 60 countries, will likely be passed along to consumers. Companies will seek exemptions to avoid these costs, which the Journal warns will be used as a way to leverage campaign contributions from businesses. The editorial board wrote, 'Mr. Trump is saying there will be no tariff exemptions. But watch that promise vanish as politicians, including Mr. Trump, see exemptions as a way to leverage campaign contributions from business. Liberation Day is Buy Another Yacht Day for the swamp,' implying that the tariffs will only benefit the Washington, D.C. swamp, not the American people.

The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has flagged four words from Donald Trump that could haunt the GOP in the 2026 midterm elections. Trump's recent remark, 'I couldn't care less' about the impact of his 25% tariffs on American consumers, could be used against Republicans. The Journal's conservative board slammed Trump's 'ideological fixation' on tariffs, noting that even he has acknowledged they will cause short-term pain for Americans. The newspaper predicted that Trump's comments will be used in Democratic campaign ads next year, linking Republicans in Congress to Mr. Trump and his comments.

**Wall Street rallies as Trump set to take more targeted approach on...**
Markets rallied on Monday as reports suggested that President Donald Trump's tariffs on April 2 may be more targeted than initially anticipated. According to Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, the tariffs may not include industry-specific levies, and may not be as wide-ranging as originally reported. This welcome news for Wall Street saw the S&P 500 rise 1.7%, the Dow jump 1.4%, and the Nasdaq 100 rise 2%. Trump's administration is focused on applying reciprocal tariffs to the 'dirty 15' - about 15% of nations designated as particular trade abusers. The exact countries included in this list are unclear, but it will likely include nations like Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and more. Trump boasted that his planned tariffs will bring in 'tens of billions' of dollars, and argued that they will help bring manufacturing back to the US and pressure neighboring countries to tamp down on illegal border crossings and fentanyl trafficking.

**WSJ: Trump's Tariff Plan is 'The Dumbest Trade War in History'**
The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has described the tariff imposed by US President Donald Trump on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China as 'the dumbest trade war in history'. The article states that the tariff will negatively affect various sectors, from automotive to agriculture. According to the WSJ, the reason given for the tariff was to prevent the flow of narcotics and increase national security, but it was noted that the problem of drug trafficking in the US is not new. Trump has responded to the WSJ's article by calling it 'Fake News Wall Street Journal' on his Truth Social account, suggesting that those who support the US are in favor of the tariffs, while those who oppose them are controlled by China or certain companies. Trump's tariff plan aims to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on imports from China. The tariffs are set to take effect on February 4, 2025, at midnight US time.

**Trump's Tariffs: A Recipe for Disaster**
The Wall Street Journal has called Trump's trade war 'the dumbest economic war in history'. The editorial board argues that Trump's reasons for imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada do not make sense. The tariffs are unlikely to address issues such as drug smuggling and illegal immigration, and the trade deficit could be addressed through other means. The tariffs are also expected to increase prices for consumers, with the Tax Foundation estimating that households will have to pay an additional $830 in 2025. The Foundation also predicts that the tariffs will shrink the US GDP by 0.4% and lead to the loss of 350,000 jobs. Trump's trade policy is seen as a way to dismantle the international trade and security structure, as outlined in the 'Project 2025' plan. This plan, developed by the Heritage Foundation, aims to transform the US and American society according to extreme right-wing conservative ideals. The plan's architect, Peter Navarro, has been widely criticized for his economic ideas, which have been rejected by economists across the political spectrum. Navarro's idea that tariffs will be paid by China is 'an unwarranted truth' that has been repeated by Trump. The New York Times concludes that tariffs are not a means to an end for Trump, but the end itself, and that he wants to raise money, even if it means that his own citizens will have to pay for it.

**Trump's Tariffs: A Recipe for Economic Disaster**
The Wall Street Journal has called Trump's trade war 'the dumbest economic war in history'. The editorial board of the newspaper argues that Trump's reasons for imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada do not make sense. The tariffs are intended to combat drug smuggling and illegal immigration, but this cannot be achieved through tariffs. The trade deficit could be addressed through other means, and protectionism is not an effective solution. Economists and industry leaders warn that the prices of meat, fruits, and vegetables will rise due to the tariffs, with the Tax Foundation estimating that households will have to pay an additional $830 per year. The Foundation also predicts that the tariffs will lead to a 0.4% decline in GDP and the loss of 350,000 jobs. Trump's trade policy is seen as a way to dismantle the international trade and security structure, as stated in the 'Project 2025' plan, which aims to transform the US and American society according to extreme right-wing conservative ideals. Economists have debunked this plan, pointing out that tariffs are ultimately paid by consumers. The New York Times concludes that tariffs are not a means to an end for Trump, but rather the end itself, and that he wants to raise revenue, even if it means that his own citizens will have to pay for it.
