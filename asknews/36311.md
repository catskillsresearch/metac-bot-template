**Powell Survives Removal Threat, Two Other Threats Remain**
The US Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the threat to the Federal Reserve, which was surrounding Jerome Powell, by ruling that the majority of its members will keep Gwen Wilcox, who was fired by Trump from the National Labor Relations Board in January without cause, out of her position until the case is heard in lower courts. The court indicated that it was leaning towards overturning a 90-year-old precedent that requires Congress to create positions in similar boards, where officials are protected from dismissal, except in cases of serious misconduct. However, they are employees of a 'quasi-public entity with a unique structure', and therefore different rules apply. This is bad news for Wilcox and other officials fired by Trump, but good news for Powell and other Federal Reserve officials. Powell praised American universities, describing them as 'a vital national asset', at a time when they are under attack from the current administration. He called on Princeton University graduates to fight for the defense of American democracy. Powell said, 'When you look back after 50 years, you will want to know that you did everything in your power to preserve and strengthen our democracy, and to get closer to the timeless principles that the founders established.' Only two threats remain out of three, and the jobs of Federal Reserve officials may be safe, but their reputation still depends on their response to threats of tariffs and budget, which surround the American economy. However, it is worth noting how market expectations and analysts' expectations about monetary policy have changed during the past month. In early May, the dominance was of recession risks resulting from tariffs. There were concerns that sharp increases in tariffs would lead to a severe slowdown in the US economy, which would force the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy even if inflation rises. If we draw the future interest rate forecasts for the market by the end of 2025 and the end of 2026, it becomes clear that during May, there was an increase in the understanding that the US Federal Reserve will want to wait and observe before changing interest rates. Everyone knew that inflation would rise, due to the large increases in gas and electricity prices in February, in addition to specific tax increases such as vehicle registration fees, and the possibility of rising air ticket prices, due to the delay of Easter in 2025. Most of the increase in the overall inflation rate can be attributed to the rise in gas and electricity prices, vehicle registration fees, and a 27% increase in air ticket prices, all of which are one-time price fluctuations.

**US Court Blocks Trump's Tariffs, Global Markets Rise**
Global stock indexes and the US dollar have significantly increased after a US federal court blocked President Donald Trump's attempt to impose new tariffs on imports. According to Reuters, the court's decision sparked a rise in markets: the Japanese Nikkei rose by 1.7%, the South Korean KOSPI by 1.8%. European futures also added around 1%. Investors were also pleased with Nvidia's successful quarterly report, which exceeded sales expectations and predicted strong results for the next quarter. This gave a boost to technology stocks - the Nasdaq rose by 2%. The dollar strengthened to 145.86 yen and 0.8327 francs, while the euro fell to 1.1245 dollars. US 10-year bond yields also rose to 4.51%. The US International Trade Court recognized the illegality and blocked most of the global tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Trump was accused of abusing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the imposition of broad global tariffs. This law gives the US President expanded powers in financial transactions during certain emergency situations, usually to impose sanctions. Trump cited US trade deficits and border drug trafficking as national emergencies that, in his opinion, allowed the use of this law. The judges noted that during the hearings, Trump's lawyers stated that the purpose of the tariffs was 'to pressure' other countries to conclude more favorable agreements. The court gave the White House administration 10 days to comply with the decision to repeal the tariffs, but did not specify the steps to be taken. The order applies to Trump's global fixed tariff, increased rates for China and other countries, as well as fentanyl-related tariffs for China, Canada, and Mexico. However, tariffs imposed on the basis of other powers are not subject to this decision - for example, tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars. The Ministry of Justice will appeal the decision. The final decision will be made by the US Supreme Court. For now, the current decision of the lower court will block the tariffs, unless the appellate court allows their temporary reinstatement during the consideration of the case.

**Secret Negotiation to Expand Supreme Court Underway**
A secret negotiation is underway between the government of Javier Milei and a senator, Juan Carlos Romero, to expand the Supreme Court from five to seven judges. Romero, a former Peronist senator, has presented a project to achieve this goal, which has sparked debate in the Senate. The government claims to have no involvement in the negotiation, but sources suggest that Romero is acting as a 'delegado informal' to facilitate a deal. The project aims to increase the number of female judges in the Supreme Court, as well as to ensure that no more than five judges are of the same sex. The negotiation is seen as a way to overcome the two-thirds majority required to appoint judges to the Supreme Court, which the government lacks. The outcome of the negotiation is uncertain, but it is expected to be a complex and challenging process, especially given the upcoming elections in October.

**Argentina's Supreme Court Expansion: Senate to Debate Eight Projects**
The Argentine Senate will begin debating eight projects to expand the number of judges on the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation. The projects, which include seven initiatives in addition to the official one, propose increasing the number of judges from the current three to seven, nine, or fifteen. Most of the initiatives aim for gender parity in the court's composition. The debate will take place in the Arturo Illia Salon of the National Congress. Alejandra Vigo, head of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, will discuss the expansion of the members designated by the General Audit of the Nation (AGN) after the first meeting. The last time the Supreme Court's structure was discussed in Congress was in September 2022, when the Senate approved the expansion to 15 judges, but the project was never treated in the Chamber of Deputies. Currently, the court is composed of three members: President Horacio Rosatti, Vice President Carlos Rosenkrantz, and Ricardo Lorenzetti. After the resignation of Judge Juan Carlos Maqueda, President Javier Milei appointed Manuel García Mansilla, but his nomination was rejected in the Senate.

**Cristina Caamaño: 'The Supreme Court needs to expand, but seven members is still too few'**
Cristina Caamaño, a former prosecutor and ex-head of the Federal Intelligence Agency (AFI), has expressed concerns about the current project to expand the Supreme Court of Justice, which is being debated in the Senate. Caamaño believes that the project, which aims to increase the number of judges from 7 to 15, is not representative of society and does not address the issue of federalism. She also emphasized the need for gender parity in the court and for judges to be more transparent and efficient. Caamaño also spoke about her experience as the head of the University of the Mothers, which was recently intervened by the government, and announced that they will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. 'We have to expand the court, but seven members is still too few. It's a court that is too federal. One of the things I see is that it will continue to be very little federal. It's attended in Buenos Aires', she explained. 'I remember a project that proposed one judge per province. I thought that was very good. Also, there's the issue of gender parity. The court needs to expand, but not with this project, which is very limited: seven members, but five men'.

**Argentina's Senate to Debate Supreme Court Expansion and AGN Changes**
The Argentine Senate is set to debate the expansion of the Supreme Court and changes to the Audit General's Office (AGN). Several projects aim to increase the number of Supreme Court justices from five to seven, nine, or even 15. The projects also propose changes to the AGN, including reducing the term of office for auditors from eight to four years. The kirchnerista Silvia Sapag's project, approved in 2022, aims to increase the number of AGN members to 15. The Senador Juan Carlos Romero's project emphasizes the importance of gender parity in the Supreme Court. The postura of La Libertad Avanza (LLA) is unclear, and the bancada may reveal the president Javier Milei's vision in the upcoming plenary session. The debate is expected to be contentious, with possible agreements and disagreements between different factions.

**Immigrants in U.S. without permanent legal status grew to 12.2 million, study finds • Louisiana Illuminator**
According to a study by the nonpartisan New York think tank, the number of immigrants in the U.S. without permanent legal status grew to 12.2 million between 2020 and 2023, a 2 million increase. The six states with the largest population of people without permanent legal status also saw significant increases, with Florida, New York, and New Jersey experiencing the fastest growth. The study notes that estimating this population could become even more challenging due to potential changes in census data collection and the Trump administration's efforts to enact mass deportations. The study also found that the population of Venezuelan immigrants increased from 55,000 in 2013 to 445,000 in 2023, with roughly half a million Venezuelans under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program at risk of losing protections from deportation. The Trump administration is moving to end TPS for Venezuelans, but the Supreme Court has blocked the use of an 18th-century wartime law to rapidly deport suspected gang members. 'The salient questions would be: Did the decline occur because deportations increased, including of populations stripped of temporary legal status, because fear led to an increase in emigration, because fear reduced the response rates in the surveys, or because of a combination of these or other factors?,' according to the study.

**U.S. Markets Surge After Court Blocks Trump's Tariff Plans | Headlines**
A federal court blocked President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs, causing U.S. stock futures to rise and the dollar to strengthen against the yen and Swiss franc. Analysts suggest that the ruling may increase investment uncertainty due to an impending Supreme Court appeal, but has temporarily boosted market optimism with a 1.5% rise in S&P 500 E-mini futures and a broad dollar rally against major currencies. As the case is likely to head to the Supreme Court, market participants are bracing for potential delays in investments and hiring, as the pause in tariffs induces uncertainty, according to analysts. As one analyst noted, 'the ongoing legal battle and its impact on global trade dynamics' will be closely watched.

**Argentine Senate Debates Proposal to Expand Supreme Court with Strong Criticism from Kirchnerist Movement**
The Argentine Senate began debating a proposal to expand the Supreme Court, with strong criticism from the Kirchnerist movement towards the current judges, whom they described as 'inept' and 'corrupt'. The proposal aims to increase the number of judges from five to seven, with a focus on parity of gender in the court. Senator José Mayans, leader of the Peronist interblock, strongly criticized the current judges, saying they are 'inept and corrupt' and that their function is to 'violate the Constitution'. The Kirchnerist movement presented a project to increase the number of judges from five to 15, while Senator Mónica Silva (Río Negro) proposed increasing the number from five to nine, emphasizing the importance of gender parity and the federal character of the Supreme Court. The officialism left unclear its position on the expansion of the Court and its composition. The discussion on the Court was followed by a meeting of the Commission on Constitutional Affairs, which aimed to accelerate the work of the advisors to reach a text of reform of the General Comptroller of the Nation (AGN), which could be treated next week to modify the period of the mandates of the auditors and their composition.

**Key Debate: Senate to Discuss Expansion of Supreme Court and Reform of National Audit Office**
The Argentine Senate will begin debating two significant institutional reforms: the expansion of the Supreme Court of Justice and the modification of the National Audit Office (AGN). The government, backed by dialoguist sectors, aims to advance a new scheme for the highest court and reconfigure the agency that oversees the state's accounts. Eight projects to expand the Court will be analyzed in a joint plenary session of the Constitutional and Justice Affairs and Penal Affairs committees. The proposals come from senators from different blocks, including Salta's Juan Carlos Romero, an ally of the government, and lawmakers from the Kirchnerism like Silvia Sapag and Nora del Valle Giménez. The proposal that generates the most consensus would increase the number of judges to seven, with a gender parity criterion. The push for this discussion comes after the rejection, almost two months ago, of the executive's plies to appoint Ariel Lijo and Manuel García Mansilla as new ministers of the Court. In parallel, Congress is preparing to review the composition of the AGN, which currently operates with severe difficulties due to the lack of six auditors, three from the Senate and three from the Chamber of Deputies. As Cristina Kirchner previously proposed, a woman could occupy one of the vacancies in the Court, and even in 2022, the Senate approved an initiative to increase the number of judges to 15, although that project failed in the Chamber of Deputies. Now, the idea resurges in a different context, with a more limited proposal that could have a better legislative fate if the Peronism aligns itself. Finally, in the Chamber of Deputies, a reform of the AGN is being evaluated. The Chamber's president, Martín Menem, promotes a proposal that reduces a seat from the Senate to give it to the Chamber of Deputies, as part of an attempt to resolve the political deadlock that prevents renewing the agency's positions.

**Developers behind growing number of planning court cases**
According to Judge Richard Humphreys, the presiding judge of the planning and environmental division of the High Court, a growing number of cases before the planning court are from developers, not those trying to block new projects. He stated, 'In the past, environmental litigation tended to be by environmental challengers complaining about the granting of permission, but in more recent years, a very substantial amount of litigation is now by developers complaining about the refusal of permission.' It is estimated that up to one third of cases now being heard relate to planning permissions which have been rejected, rather than ones given the go-ahead. The workload of the three-judge court has increased significantly since its establishment in 2023, with 659 cases processed, of which 266 were live. Judge Humphreys attributed the sharp jump in cases to an expansion of the remit of the court, a Supreme Court finding, and the turmoil within An Bord Pleanála in 2022. He also mentioned that the Planning and Development Act, which passed in the Dáil last year, will likely lead to an increase in new legal points and a longer settling-in period for the court.

**Government to Evaluate Expanding Supreme Court of Justice**
The Minister of Justice, Mariano Cúneo Libarona, stated that a project to increase the number of members in the Supreme Court of Justice from three to seven is being considered. According to Cúneo Libarona, the current court 'finds ways' to issue rulings by calling in associate judges. The minister is studying a proposal by Senator Juan Carlos Romero to increase the number of members. 'It would be ideal to have the court complete,' said Cúneo Libarona. He also mentioned that the court will be expanded before the end of President Javier Milei's term, although he did not provide a specific timeline. The minister also discussed the change in the procedural law, stating that 'in ten years, an accusatory system was established (...) nobody had made any progress on this. We, with a huge effort, have already implemented it in twelve provinces, and it's working fantastically.' This change allows for sentences to be issued in just two days, although some prosecutors are resisting the changes. Cúneo Libarona also stated that 'there has never been as much judicial independence as there is now' in the country.

**Proposal to Expand the Supreme Court of Justice**
A bill to expand the Supreme Court of Justice was presented to the Senate, proposing to increase the number of judges from five to seven. The initiative, which already has its first legislative support, aims to ensure the speed of decisions from the highest court in the country and guarantee gender representation in its composition. According to the project, the new article would stipulate that 'The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation will be composed of seven (7) judges, of which no more than five (5) of its members will be of the same sex.' The project also clarifies that 'before it will act the Attorney General of the Nation and the Prosecutors before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation and the Defender General of the Nation and the Official Defenders before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation in the terms of Law 24,946 and complementary legislation.' The main objective of the proposal is to improve the functioning of the Court, which in 2024 registered a record number of sentences but continues to be a 'bottleneck' in the resolution of cases, according to the project's foundations. Senator Juan Carlos Romero stated that the expansion of the Court would not only increase its capacity for resolution but also give the tribunal greater legitimacy and representation. Romero emphasized the incorporation of judges with diverse specializations, from different regions of the country, to 'facilitate a greater speed in the resolution of cases.' The project also highlights an approach to gender equality, establishing that no more than five judges can be of the same sex, in line with the principles of the National Constitution that promote real equality of opportunities between men and women. According to the details, 'Our National Constitution, in Article 37, proclaims the real equality of opportunities between men and women for access to elective and party positions,' and this proposal seeks to take a step forward in the implementation of this equality in the judicial field. 'Promoting a more extensive Supreme Court, guaranteeing equal suitability and representation, is the axis of this project,' expressed Senator Romero in his foundation, inviting his peers to accompany the initiative with their signature.

**Korea's Democratic Party Proposes Bill to Increase Supreme Court Judges from 14 to 100**
The Democratic Party of Korea has proposed a bill to increase the number of judges at the Supreme Court from 14 to 100. This move comes as the party continues to pressure the Supreme Court, which recently ruled against their presidential candidate, Lee Jae-myung, in a election law case. The bill aims to alleviate the workload of the Supreme Court, which has seen a significant increase in cases, with 37,669 cases filed in 2023 alone. The current system, where one judge handles over 3,000 cases per year, has led to a decline in public trust in the Supreme Court's ability to thoroughly review cases. The proposed bill aims to increase the number of judges to 100, allowing for more in-depth review of cases and providing opportunities for a more diverse range of candidates to become judges. As one of the proposers, Rep. Jang Kyung-tae, said, 'We aim to create a system where judges can thoroughly review cases and provide fair verdicts, thereby restoring public trust in the Supreme Court.'

**Democratic Party Proposes Bill to Increase Number of Supreme Court Judges**
The Democratic Party of Korea has proposed a bill to increase the number of Supreme Court judges from 14 to 30. The move comes after the Supreme Court's recent decision to overturn the conviction of Lee Jae-myung, a presidential candidate, on charges of violating the election law. The party's lawmakers argued that the current number of judges is insufficient to handle the increasing number of cases. Kim Yong-min, a Democratic Party lawmaker, said, 'We aim to increase the number of judges to 30 to allow them to devote more time and resources to each case, and to reflect social diversity in the composition of the Supreme Court, thereby improving the quality of justice and public trust.' He added, 'As of 2022, the Supreme Court received over 56,000 new cases per year, and each judge handles around 5,000 cases annually, making it impossible for them to handle the workload.' In a parliamentary hearing, Democratic Party lawmakers, including Rep. Jeong Cheong-rae, mocked the current system, saying, 'The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy trial for all citizens, but the Supreme Court only expedited the trial for Lee Jae-myung. We need to increase the number of judges to ensure that all citizens can receive a speedy trial.' Rep. Park Ji-won also said, 'By increasing the number of judges, we can ensure that citizens receive a speedy trial and that the full court can deliver accurate verdicts. We will push for this law despite opposition from the judiciary. This is a crucial step towards judicial reform, which was initiated by Chief Justice Cho Hee-deok.'

**Lawsuits seeking employment link increase by 57% in 2024**
The number of lawsuits seeking to establish an employment link, known as 'pejotização', has increased by 57% in 2024, with 285,055 cases filed, according to data compiled by the Tribunal Superior do Trabalho (TST). This represents a 57% increase compared to 2023. The 'pejotização' refers to the practice of registering professionals as a person juridical (PJ) or autonomous to avoid labor laws. The TST has reported that 53,783 new cases were filed in 2025, making it the 16th most common reason for people to go to court. The number of cases has been increasing since 2018, excluding the decline in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic. The growth coincides with the implementation of the labor reform in 2017, which allowed for the outsourcing of business activities. The Supreme Court (STF) has suspended the processing of all cases related to 'pejotização' until it issues a final ruling on the existence of an employment link. The STF has received 3,418 new labor-related cases in 2024, a 76% increase from the previous year. 'The Judiciary is not aligned. We have a clear divergence,' said Antonio Vasconcellos Junior, a labor and business lawyer. The suspension of the cases has created concerns for both workers and employers, who will have to wait for an indefinite period for the outcome of the cases. The STF is expected to reiterate its position and decide against the employment link.

**Supreme Court Reports Increase in Domestic Violence Cases, Including Threats Through Virtual Wallets**
The Supreme Court's Office of Domestic Violence reported that the number of women denouncing gender violence is increasing, with a 8% increase in January 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. María Emilia Sesin, head of the office, stated that the mechanisms of threats are becoming more sophisticated, with cases of violence even through virtual wallets. 'Unfortunately, the numbers come with a trend of increase year by year. There was a period where we noticed a decrease: it coincided with the COVID-19 quarantine in 2020. But once that moment was overcome, the numbers increased day by day,' said Sesin. The academic emphasized that the advancement of new technologies is 'absolutely accelerated,' making it impossible for the law and organizations working to protect women's rights to keep up. 'The digital violence modality is becoming more common. Violence is now perpetrated through technological means such as mobile phones and social media. Artificial intelligence allows, for example, the creation of images and the reproduction of animated images,' she commented. Sesin added that 'the mechanisms are becoming more sophisticated. Now there is a new modality through virtual wallets. Now it's not enough to block (judicially) the accused on social media or WhatsApp. Now virtual wallets are used because they have the possibility of messaging when making a transfer.'

**Russian Supreme Court to Clarify Court Fee Rules in 2025**
The Russian Supreme Court plans to clarify the rules for paying court fees in 2025 by preparing a plenum resolution, according to Supreme Court Chairwoman Irina Podnosova. She stated, 'In 2025, we plan to prepare an overarching resolution of the Plenum, which will clarify the norms of tax and procedural legislation on the payment of the state fee.' Podnosova also described the increase in court fees as 'justified and timely.' She emphasized that the reform has ensured access to justice for all individuals, 'by expanding the system of benefits for socially significant categories of disputes.' Court fees were increased in September 2024, with the upper limit rising to 10 million rubles in arbitration courts and 900,000 rubles in general jurisdiction courts. The fees for initiating bankruptcy proceedings also increased, from 6,000 rubles to 100,000 rubles for organizations and from 300 rubles to 10,000 rubles for individuals. Podnosova noted that the reform has expanded benefits for socially significant categories of disputes, but the Constitutional Court has accepted a complaint from State Duma deputies regarding the increase in court fees, which they believe restricts access to justice and does not take into account the financial situation of many Russian citizens.

**Brazilian President and Supreme Court Judges to Receive Salary Increase**
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, and ministers of the Supreme Court will receive a 5.36% salary increase, effective February 2025, bringing their remuneration to R$46,300, the maximum allowed for public servants. This increase is based on a decree from the previous administration, which was approved by Congress in 2022. The measure was designed to increase salaries in four stages: two in 2023, one in 2024, and the final one in 2025. As a result, lawmakers and executive branch officials will have the same salary as Supreme Court judges. The maximum salary for federal employees is based on the salary of Supreme Court ministers, but there are still cases of 'supersalaries' due to accumulated benefits and reimbursements. Since the approval of the salary increase, the salaries of Supreme Court judges have increased by 18%, from R$39,200 in 2022 to R$46,300 in 2025. The increase for lawmakers and senators was even higher, as they earned R$33,700 in 2022. The adjustment also eliminates the 'abate-teto' for many executive branch employees, which is the reduction of values that exceed the constitutional ceiling. According to the Ministry of Management, only 0.3% of employees will be subject to these discounts, down from 0.7% before the change. The fiscal impact of the measure has not been disclosed by the Ministry, but it is estimated to be around R$25 million for 2025, with R$20.2 million for the Chamber, R$3.5 million for the Senate, and R$1.3 million for the Executive.
