**Germany to Invest in Southern Gas Power Plants with 'South Bonus'**
German Federal Minister of Economics Katherina Reiche plans to increase gas production in southern Germany. To achieve this, the government will provide a 'South Bonus' to incentivize the construction of gas power plants in the region. Reiche emphasized that the focus is not only on increasing gas production, but also on making energy more affordable. The government aims to reduce high electricity prices for businesses, making them competitive again. Reiche stated, 'We plan to create 20 gigawatts of new gas production capacity in Germany by 2030, with two-thirds of this capacity being built in the technical south.' The government is already in talks with the EU Commission to ensure that the state aid does not distort competition within the EU. Reiche said, 'Supply security, climate protection, and affordability must come together in a balanced triangle again.' The government plans to implement relief measures, including reducing the electricity tax, exempting network charges, and compensating for gas storage fees, before the summer break.

**Germany to Give Southern Region a Special Bonus for Gas Production**
Economy Minister Katherina Reiche (CDU) has made it her first priority in office to lower electricity prices. According to her parliamentary state secretary Gitta Connemann (CDU), this will be concretized by early July and decided before the summer break. Reiche has now commented on her plan for supply security. A focus of the new gas production in Germany will be in southern Germany, as Reiche said, 'We plan a South Bonus, with two-thirds of the total capacity to be built in the technical south.' Reiche had previously announced that she wanted to 'quickly' bring new gas power plants to Germany. She emphasized that Bavaria will benefit from the power plant strategy as well as 'from the tendering of the first 20 gigawatts, which we have set ourselves in Germany.' The federal government is already in intensive talks with the EU Commission on the tendering. Reiche has repeatedly emphasized the need for new gas power plants since taking office. In an interview with the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ), she explained: 'Germany will not be able to supply itself with renewable energies in the foreseeable future if we leave coal and the electricity demand will increase in the future.' According to Reiche, dark doldrums without wind and solar energy can last not only a few days but often weeks. However, this is not accurate, as Ampiron, the transmission system operator, reported that Germany experienced its longest dark doldrum since 1982 in November 2024, lasting 11 days. Reiche's goal is also to lower high electricity prices for companies so that they can become competitive again. Before the summer break, the federal cabinet will decide on the first relief measures, which will also benefit consumers. This includes the reduction of the electricity tax, the relief from network charges and the gas storage surcharge. Currently, high energy costs are causing new investments to go to countries where electricity and energy prices are cheaper. 'Supply security, climate protection and affordability must come together again in a balanced triangle,' said Reiche. It is also important to ensure that existing exemptions for energy-intensive industries are continued, such as the electricity price compensation.

**Reiche Plans New Gas Power Plants in Southern Germany**
German Federal Minister of Economics Katherina Reiche plans to build new gas power plants in southern Germany, with a focus on the technical south. 'We plan to create a South Bonus, with two-thirds of the total capacity to be built in the technical south,' she said after attending a cabinet meeting in Gmund. Reiche aims to 'quickly' bring new gas power plants to Germany, and emphasized that Bavaria will benefit from both the power plant strategy and the auction of the first 20 gigawatts. The German government is already in intense talks with the EU Commission about the auction. Reiche stated that the goal of the new government is to lower high electricity prices for companies, making them competitive again. The cabinet will decide on the first relief measures before the summer break, including reducing the electricity tax, relieving network charges, and the gas storage levy. The current high energy costs are causing companies to invest in countries with lower energy prices. 'Security of supply, climate protection, and affordability must come together again in a balanced triangle,' Reiche said. Additionally, she emphasized the importance of ensuring that existing exemptions for energy-intensive industries are continued, such as the electricity price compensation. Baden-Württemberg's Energy Minister Thekla Walker (Greens) called for the auction of modern hydrogen-capable power plants, saying, 'The south of Germany needs new networks and sufficient buffer capacities. These reserve power plants must be H2-ready and converted to hydrogen as soon as possible.' If the federal government were to switch back to old technology, it would undermine the emerging hydrogen economy. 'Extending the use of gas longer than necessary poses unpredictable cost risks.'

**Realism over Ambition: The High Cost of Germany's Climate Neutrality Goal**
Germany has set an ambitious goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2045, five years ahead of the EU's target. However, this goal may come at a high cost. According to a study by Professor Manuel Frondel, the early achievement of this goal would allow other EU countries to reduce their emissions at a slower pace, resulting in no overall reduction in EU-wide emissions. Furthermore, Germany's share of global emissions will be significantly lower in 2045, making the five-year head start 'only a few weeks of China's emissions.' Frondel estimates the additional costs of achieving this goal five years early to be in the high triple-digit billion range. While some argue that Germany's technological leadership will drive innovation, the risk is that other countries will not adopt these technologies, making the goal of climate neutrality unachievable. 'We should learn from the Soviet Union's failed plans to overtake the US in 20 years,' says Daniel Stelter. 'We should not set unrealistic goals, but instead focus on achieving them with available resources and a plan B for unexpected challenges.'

**Saxony's Minister-President Kretschmer Calls for Adjustment of Germany's Climate Goals**
Saxony's Minister-President Michael Kretschmer (CDU) is calling for an adjustment of Germany's climate goals. Kretschmer said, 'It's enough if Germany becomes climate-neutral in economic terms by 2050.' He emphasized the importance of energy security and prices, especially as the country aims to return to a growth trajectory. Germany plans to become climate-neutral by 2045, which requires a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. Kretschmer is skeptical about the federal government's plans to reduce the electricity tax, saying, 'If taxes are reduced, it costs us financial strength.' He believes that reducing taxes is not a sustainable solution and that the focus should be on reducing the costs of creating renewable energy. Kretschmer stated, 'Speed often comes at a cost, but we still want to be among the first in achieving all climate goals.' He cited the premature coal phase-out by 2038 as an example of an overly hasty decision.

**Kretschmer Calls for Adjustment of Germany's Climate Goals**
Saxony's Minister-President, Michael Kretschmer, is calling for an adjustment to Germany's climate goals. He believes that aiming for climate neutrality by 2045 is too ambitious. 'It's enough if Germany becomes climate-neutral in its economic activities by 2050,' he said in an interview with 'Wirtschaftswoche'. 'Especially when we want to get back on a growth track, energy security and prices are key.' Kretschmer is skeptical about the federal government's plans to reduce the electricity tax, citing the need for financial resources to fund social security systems, security, education, and culture. 'If taxes are reduced, it costs us financial strength,' he said. 'A temporary reduction might work, but it's not a long-term solution.' Kretschmer suggests starting with reducing the costs of implementing climate goals, such as the early coal phase-out by 2038. 'Speed often comes at a cost, but we still want to be among the first in achieving all climate goals.'

**Kretschmer Calls for Delay in German Climate Goals**
Saxony's Minister-President Michael Kretschmer is calling for Germany's climate goals to be pushed back by five years. 'It's enough if Germany becomes climate-neutral in 2050,' Kretschmer said in an interview with WirtschaftsWoche. Currently, the goal is to achieve climate neutrality by 2045, which has been enshrined in the Basic Law since March as an additional provision for the special fund. Kretschmer is skeptical of the federal government's plans to reduce the electricity tax, saying that the focus should be on the 'generation costs of electricity.' 'Speed often comes at the cost of prices, yet we want to be among the leaders in all climate goals,' Kretschmer said. He criticized the planned early exit from coal by 2038 as 'the wrong path.' Kretschmer also called for a slowdown in wind power expansion in Saxony, saying that the current pace is 'wrong.' He cited the increasing number of hours with negative electricity prices, which has risen from 400 hours two years ago to over 1,000 hours now, as an example of 'welfare destruction.'

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Gaps Remain**
The European Commission has stated that the EU is on track to meet its climate goals for 2030, with a 54% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990. This is only 1% less than the legally set target of 55%. However, the Commission notes that this is contingent on the implementation of national climate plans. Vizepräsidentin Teresa Ribera said, 'The updated national energy and climate plans show that the green agenda is not just a goal, but a way to modernize our economies.' Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra emphasized the need for further investment in clean technologies, carbon sequestration in agriculture, electrification, and modernization of the power grid. The Commission's analysis highlights significant gaps that need to be addressed to achieve the 2030 climate goal, with five countries, including Germany and France, failing to meet their sectoral targets. The EU aims to reduce energy consumption by 12% by 2030, but currently stands at -8.1%. The Commission calls for 'more determined measures to reduce energy demand.' The EU is close to achieving its renewable energy targets, with a remaining 'ambition gap' of 1.5 percentage points to reach the goal of 42.5% renewable energy in the energy mix. By 2050, the EU aims to be completely climate-neutral.

**Germany Achieves 2024 Climate Goal, but Experts Warn of Future Challenges**
Germany has officially achieved its 2024 climate goal, according to a report by the independent Expert Council for Climate Research. However, the council warns that the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions was partly due to the mild winter and the economic downturn, which led to reduced energy consumption. The council is skeptical about the announced measures in the coalition agreement between the Union and SPD, stating that they will likely have a neutral or even slightly increasing effect on emissions. The council concludes that 'there is no significant positive impulse for achieving the 2030 goal from the announced measures.' The government, on the other hand, points out that a special fund of 500 billion euros, financed by new debt, will also be used for climate protection projects, which is expected to provide impulses. The largest contribution to reducing emissions came from the energy industry, particularly through the decommissioning of coal-fired power plants. The council confirms previous calculations by the Federal Environment Agency, which showed that the country's greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 were around 649 million tons of CO2-equivalent, a decrease of 3.4% compared to 2023. However, the decline is significantly lower than in 2023. The council emphasizes that a 'significant part of the emission reduction' in 2024 was achieved through structural developments, such as the expansion of renewable energy and the decommissioning of coal-fired power plants. The council is critical of the current projections, which suggest that Germany will likely miss its 2030 climate goal, with emissions expected to decrease by only 63% compared to 1990, short of the 65% target set in the Climate Protection Act. The council does not see an immediate need for action, as the emissions budget for 2030 will still be met, but emphasizes that the new government must submit a climate protection program by the end of March 2026, which should address the expected failure to meet the 2040 climate goal and the annual reduction targets.

**Kemfert: Germany Unlikely to Meet Climate Goals**
Climate economist Claudia Kemfert expressed pessimism about reaching climate goals, citing the current economic situation as a major factor. According to Kemfert, the 'not so good' economic situation is leading to lower energy demand. While there have been successes in expanding renewable energy and reducing coal use, Kemfert noted that there have been 'not so big' successes in the building and transportation sectors. As a result, the Expertenrat (Expert Council) is warning that it is unlikely that climate goals for 2030 and 2045 will be met.

**Germany on Track to Meet Emissions Targets by 2030, but Challenges Ahead**
The German government has been relieved of the immediate pressure to meet its climate goals, according to the Expertenrat für Klimafragen (Expert Council for Climate Questions). The council's report states that Germany is on track to meet its emissions targets by 2030. However, the council emphasizes that the real challenge lies ahead, particularly in the sectors of transportation and buildings, where CO2 emissions are still high. The council praises the progress made in the energy sector, particularly in the expansion of wind and solar power, which has led to a reduction in coal-fired power plants. However, the council notes that the current economic downturn has led to a decrease in industrial production and transportation, resulting in lower CO2 emissions than expected. The council recommends that the government focus on the long-term perspective and develop a climate protection program to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. The new government is expected to take a more nuanced approach to climate policy, with a focus on cost-effectiveness and a shift away from detailed regulations. The council also emphasizes the importance of the European Emissions Trading System, which will be expanded to include the sectors of buildings and transportation from 2027. According to the council, those who cause greenhouse gas emissions will have to pay a higher price for it in the future, which will accelerate the technological transition to sustainability. 'We must now focus on the years after 2030,' said the council. 'Then, we will face new challenges, including the poor state of the forests, which will not contribute positively to the CO2 balance.' The council also criticized the coalition agreement for being too vague and lacking concrete positive impulses. 'The new government is obligated to submit a climate protection program within a year to show the further measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,' said the council. 'We recommend that this program be oriented towards the long-term perspective to answer the question of how Germany will actually become climate-neutral by 2045.'

**Germany's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Decrease, but 2030 Climate Targets at Risk**
Germany has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 3.4% in 2023 compared to the previous year, according to the Climate Change Experts Council. The country has achieved its 2024 climate target, but experts warn that it may not meet its 2030 climate targets. The council's report states that the decrease in emissions was partly due to a mild winter and a weak economy, which led to lower energy consumption. The energy sector made the largest contribution to reducing emissions by decommissioning coal-fired power plants. However, the transportation sector failed to meet its emission targets. The government's climate measures are also under scrutiny, with the council expressing concerns that the new coalition agreement does not provide sufficient detail on climate policies. The council's vice-president, Brigitte Knopf, stated, 'The current coalition agreement will not provide a significant positive momentum for reaching the 2030 target. Therefore, there is a risk that neither the 2030 target nor the climate neutrality target by 2045 will be achieved.'

**Germany Meets 2024 Climate Goal, But Experts Warn Against Excessive Optimism**
Germany has achieved its 2024 climate goal by reducing CO₂ emissions by 3.4% in 2024 compared to 2023, producing approximately 649 million tons of CO₂. The energy sector played a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through the decommissioning of coal-fired power plants. However, experts caution against excessive optimism, as the decrease is also attributed to a mild winter and a weak economy. Germany is currently at risk of missing its 2030 climate goal.

**Renewed concern over direction of EU climate policy**
Climate campaigners are expressing concern that the EU executive may introduce loopholes to meet the 2040 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. Despite the EU's promise to 'stay the course' on climate action, recent signals suggest the executive is considering allowing governments to use carbon credits from outside the bloc to meet the target. Michael Sicaud-Clyet, a climate policy specialist at WWF EU, said, 'If the European Commission is only going to propose 90%, already less than what's needed, it should never be looking into loopholes like buying offsets from other countries.' Green MEP Michael Bloss called for a binding climate target of at least a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with clear phase-out paths for coal, oil, and gas. Environmental groups are skeptical about offsetting schemes, with Carbon Market Watch saying that relying on international carbon credits risks increasing global emissions. The incoming German grand coalition is pushing for flexibilities, or loopholes, that the environmentalists are worried about, including allowing governments to use carbon credits to cover up to three percentage points of the required emissions reduction.

**Government Admits: No Measurable Climate Benefit from Coal Exit**
The German government has admitted that the coal exit has not led to a measurable reduction in CO2 emissions. Despite massive investments of 4.35 billion euros from the Climate and Transformation Fund, there has been no noticeable improvement. The Ministry of Economics has failed to achieve a sustainable reduction in CO2 emissions. According to a response to a request from the FDP faction, many CO2 emission certificates are still available on the market and can be used by other participants, which means that a real reduction in emissions does not occur. The EU Commission has rejected the Ministry's calculation method, and the government plans to renotify the certificate deletion for the 2022 decommissioned power plants by May 31, 2025. The Federal Audit Office had already criticized in 2023 that the shutdown of power plants had no noticeable climate effect. FDP faction vice Lukas Köhler criticizes the government's handling of the coal exit, saying, 'Instead of ideological actionism, the government could have used the funds more sensibly - for example, to buy and delete emissions certificates.'

**Lausitz Compensation Deal at Risk of Failing, Says Economic State Secretary**
Economic State Secretary Michael Kellner (Greens) expressed concerns that the negotiations over the billion-dollar compensation for the exit from lignite-fired power generation in the Lausitz may fail. 'I increasingly feel that EPH is deliberately delaying or torpedoing the contract conclusion,' Kellner said to the 'Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland' (Saturday editions). 'Whoever wants to reach an agreement does not negotiate like this.' Kellner fears that the deal may ultimately fail, which would be disastrous for the region. 'Both the employees and the Lausitz are dependent on the compensation flowing in,' he emphasized. The German government and LEAG had reached a basic agreement with the EU Commission in June 2024 on a compensation for the shutdown of the lignite-fired power plants. A staged payment procedure was agreed upon, with 1.2 billion euros guaranteed to flow in and fixed costs for social agreements and changes to the mining plan to be covered. A remaining sum of up to 550 million euros would only be paid out if the operation of the power plants would be economically viable beyond the statutory shutdown date. The details were to be clarified in the contract negotiations, which have now stalled. 'EPH will not be able to get a better deal with the EU Commission than this,' Kellner said. EPH owner Daniel Kretinsky must fulfill his responsibility and clear the way for the future of the Lausitz, he demanded. 'If there is an attempt to make as much money as possible with coal for as long as possible, and then disappear without taking responsibility for social costs and mining consequences, we will prevent it,' Kellner added.

**Germany Must Abandon Coal to Meet Climate Goals, Says Climate Researcher Mojib Latif**
According to climate researcher Mojib Latif, Germany can only achieve its climate goals by abandoning coal. 'Coal is the fossil fuel that produces the most CO2 per energy unit, alongside oil and gas,' Latif explained. The world is currently heading towards a 3°C global warming, exceeding the 1.5°C target agreed upon at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference. Latif warned that a 3°C world would be 'one we don't know.' Although Germany's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is only about 2%, Latif emphasized that the problem is global and cannot be solved nationally. 'We need pioneers,' he said, 'and Germany is still one of them.' If all countries behaved like Germany, it might be possible to still meet the 2°C target, Latif noted.
