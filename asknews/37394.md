**Who is the Richest Man in the World in 2025?**
According to Forbes, Elon Musk is the richest man in the world in 2025, with a fortune valued at $386.5 billion. His leadership in the electric vehicle market, space exploration, and artificial intelligence has contributed to his success. Musk's net worth increased by $46 billion in April, solidifying his position as the leader in these sectors. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, comes in second with a fortune of $201.6 billion, despite a $5.3 billion loss due to a 4% decline in Amazon's stock price. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, ranks third with a net worth of $190 billion, despite a $9.3 billion decline in his fortune due to a 5% drop in Meta's stock price. Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, comes in fourth with a net worth of $176.9 billion, thanks to the growth of Oracle and his participation in the Proyecto Stargate. Warren Buffett, who announced that he will leave the direction of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of 2025, ranks fifth with a net worth of $166.4 billion. Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, ranks sixth with a net worth of $146.5 billion, despite a 14.6 billion decline in his fortune due to a 15% drop in LVMH's stock price. The ranking of the world's richest people is not just about accumulated wealth, but also about their ability to adapt to a changing economic environment. The recovery of Tesla was essential for Musk, and he has taken advantage of opportunities in the technology sector. Other individuals, such as Bezos, Arnault, and Ellison, have also increased their wealth during this period. Despite market volatility, most of the billionaires have managed to maintain or increase their wealth, suggesting that certain sectors continue to thrive. The diversification of investments and innovation in their respective fields have been key to their success.

**Biotech IPO Market to Recover in 2026, Experts Say**
According to Bloomberg, the decline in interest of biotech companies to go public in the US will continue until 2026. In 2025, only five biotech companies went public and raised over $50 million, compared to 18 in 2024. Since 2020, 150 biotech companies have gone public, but those that went public in 2020 and 2021 have lost an average of over 40% of their stock value. All biotech companies, except for four that raised over $50 million in 2024, are trading below their initial prices. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has decreased by 4% in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has decreased by 0.7% during the same period. The decline in interest is attributed to the plans of the Trump administration to reduce the budget and personnel of the FDA, as well as the skeptical attitude of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. towards vaccines and obesity treatments. Jason Fenton, co-head of Cantor Fitzgerald, said that many biotech companies that went public during the pandemic lacked maturity or a convincing investment thesis. However, Fenton believes that long-term favorable factors will lead to a more active IPO market in the next year. 'At some point, probably in 2026, we will have a normal IPO market in biotech,' Fenton said. He noted that large pharmaceutical companies will start to seek funding or acquire companies with reliable clinical data as they face the need to replace tens of billions of dollars in revenue from drugs with expiring patents. The increase in contract research costs also means that the biotech sector will need capital. 'Investors are much more discerning and pay attention not only to what the data tells us today, but also to the path of development in the future,' said Seth Rubin, head of global ECM at Stifel Financial Corp. According to Rubin, investors are looking at companies at later stages of development, where they can get some idea of the business.

**US Stock Indexes Rise Ahead of Major Tech Earnings Reports**
US stock indexes are rising in anticipation of major technology sector company earnings reports, according to trading data and analyst comments. As of 19:18 MSK, the industrial index Dow Jones increased by 1.5% to 42,227.87 points, the high-tech index Nasdaq Composite by 2.21% to 19,150.48 points, and the broad market index S&amp;P 500 by 1.76% to 5,904.70 points. Investors are expecting the release of financial reports from companies Nvidia and HP Inc this week. Analysts believe these data will serve as a 'litmus test' for evaluating the potential financial performance of other technology companies. 'The next Nvidia profit report will be crucial in determining whether the company's shares can break out of their relatively limited trading range, which they have been in for the past 10 months,' said Robert Ruggirello, an analyst at Brave Eagle Wealth Management, to Bloomberg. He added that the shares 'need a catalyst to reach new record highs.' Before the earnings reports, shares of technology companies are rising in value. For example, Nvidia shares are up by over 3%, Apple and Intel by more than 2%, Microsoft by 1.8%, and HP Inc by almost 1%. Additionally, Salesforce shares are rising by over 1% after the company announced the acquisition of Informatica for approximately $8 billion. Investors are also paying attention to economic statistics, which have exceeded expectations. According to data from the Conference Board, the US consumer confidence index increased to 98 points in May, up from the revised April figure of 85.7 points. Analysts had forecasted a rise to only 87 points from the initial value of the previous month at 86 points. Markets are also watching the development of the situation around US tariffs on EU goods. On Sunday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had spoken by phone with US President Donald Trump, and that the EU would need time until July 9 to reach a trade deal with the US. Experts consider this a positive signal for the market. 'The EU's delay on tariffs until July 9 is an important step in resolving the trade situation, as it increases the chances that trade deals will continue, which is exactly the signal the market is looking for,' said Ruggirello.

**Stocks Jump on Consumer Confidence, Trade Talks: Markets Wrap**
US stocks surged on Monday, with the S&P 500 rising over 1.6%, as consumer confidence rebounded and trade talks between the US and the European Union accelerated. The rally was also fueled by a global bond rally, with the 30-year yield falling below 5%. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about the trade talks, saying 'The EU tariff reprieve until July 9 is an important step in the overall resolution of this trade situation, as it increases the chances that trade deals will continue to come to fruition, which is the exact messaging that the market is hoping for,' according to Robert Ruggirello at Brave Eagle Wealth Management. The Nasdaq 100 added around 2%, while Apple Inc. halted its longest selloff in over three years. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell, and the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4%.

**Stocks Climb on Trade Talks as Bond Yields Slide: Markets Wrap**
Wall Street stocks rose on the first day of trading after a long holiday weekend, driven by optimism about trade negotiations between the US and the European Union. The S&P 500 index gained 1.2%, with megacaps such as Nvidia and Apple Inc. leading the way. The 30-year US Treasury yield fell below 5% and the dollar strengthened against its developed-market peers. According to Robert Ruggirello at Brave Eagle Wealth Management, 'The EU tariff reprieve until July 9 is an important step in the overall resolution of this trade situation, as it increases the chances that trade deals will continue to come to fruition, which is the exact messaging that the market is hoping for.' The rally in bonds was also fueled by Japanese authorities' consideration of adjusting their debt plan, which has driven long-term borrowing costs to historic highs.

The list is based on the net worth of each individual, which is calculated using a combination of financial data, market valuations, and public records.

Bezos' net worth is largely due to his ownership of Amazon, which he started in 1994. Zuckerberg's net worth is largely due to his ownership of Facebook, which he started in 2004. The list also includes other notable billionaires such as Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, and Carlos Slim Helu. According to Forbes, the net worth of the top 20 richest people in the world is over $2.5 trillion.

**S&P 500 Expected to End Year at Current Levels**
The S&P 500 index is expected to end the year at around its current levels, according to a Reuters survey of 51 strategists, analysts, brokers, and portfolio managers. The survey, conducted between May 15 and 28, found that the median forecast for the end-of-year target for the S&P 500 is 5,900, down from 6,500 in February. Samer Samana, director of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said, 'It's clear that earnings will be affected by what's happening with tariffs (...) we believe that tariffs are a tax and that a combination of US consumers and companies, along with international producers and companies, will pay the tax. In essence, that type of wealth transfer comes, to some extent, from earnings.' The survey found that the S&P 500 is expected to grow by 8.4% in 2025, compared to 12.1% in 2024. However, the estimate for 2025 is much lower than the 14% growth estimated on January 1. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial, said, 'It's very difficult to make predictions given the tariff uncertainty and the changing dynamics that seem to occur daily.' He added that, 'We need to apply a higher risk premium to stocks, and that will accompany us for the rest of the year.' Some strategists have recently increased their forecasts for the S&P 500. David Lefkowitz, director of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote last week that the firm was increasing its year-end target to 6,000 from 5,800 partly due to a 'solid first-quarter earnings season.' The concern over the US debt burden has contributed to recent nervousness and the trend of some investors to 'sell the US.' Moody's downgraded its credit rating for the US on May 16, and the US House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, passed a broad tax-cutting bill by Trump last week. The bill will soon be reviewed by the US Senate, where investors fear that spending cuts will gradually increase the deficit.

**Wall Street rises on commercial truce between US and EU**
The New York Stock Exchange ended in the green on Tuesday, driven by investors' appetite for risk, after US President Donald Trump withdrew his threat of a 50% tariff on European Union products, allowing for commercial negotiations between Washington and Brussels to reach a trade agreement. The 'Seven Wonders' of Wall Street contributed to the significant gains of the Nasdaq, while the S&P-500 returned to 5% of its closing record of February 19 after falling in the wake of the reciprocal taxes announced by Donald Trump in early April. 'When the American president pulled out the big guns on April 2, the market thought it was the end of the world,' said Paul Nolte, strategist at Murphy and Sylvest in Illinois. 'The decline was so significant and so rapid that we expected a rebound, and this rebound was clear and rapid,' he added. Investors will likely wonder about the 'terrain' that awaits them, he said, as Donald Trump has multiplied commercial announcements and reversals since his return to power in January. The president's latest statement confirms the previously granted suspension until July 9 for commercial negotiations. Investor appetite for risk also benefited from a report showing that American consumer confidence rose more than expected in May. Additionally, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin told Bloomberg that economic data does not indicate increased pressure on prices or unemployment, comments illustrating the opinion of many American central bank officials. It is expected that the Fed will not change its interest rates until it has observed the full impact of the Trump administration's commercial policy. The Fed's monetary policy report is expected on Wednesday. All major sectors of the S&P-500 ended the session in the green, with discretionary consumption and technology leading the way. Among the values, semiconductor stocks rose ahead of the highly anticipated quarterly results of Nvidia NVDA.O. US Treasury bond yields fell.

**World's Richest People See Record $304 Billion Increase in Wealth**
The combined wealth of the world's richest people has increased by a record $304 billion after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day delay in raising import tariffs. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, the decision led to a surge in the value of stocks, with Elon Musk's wealth increasing by $36 billion after Tesla's stock price rose by 23%. Mark Zuckerberg's wealth grew by $26 billion, and Jensen Huang's by $15.5 billion. The $304 billion increase in the collective net worth of the world's richest people is a record for the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, surpassing the previous record of $233 billion set in March 2022 after the US Federal Reserve raised its base interest rate. Trump announced the tariffs on April 2, targeting 185 countries and territories, with Russia excluded. The universal 10% tariffs took effect on April 5, while individual tariffs took effect on April 9. The US administration also imposed a 25% tariff on all imported cars starting April 3. After the announcement, companies in the S&P 500 index lost a combined $5 trillion in market capitalization over two days, a record since the COVID-19 crash in March 2020. Trump then announced on April 9 that he would delay the tariff increase for 90 days for countries willing to negotiate, with 10% tariffs still in effect. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bentsen emphasized that the delay applies to Canada and Mexico, while Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%.

In contrast, Donald Trump's personal wealth decreased by approximately $500 million due to the tariffs he introduced, while his allies in the billionaire club also suffered significant losses. Musk led the list of super billionaires, which includes 24 individuals from around the world, at the end of February.

**World's Richest People Lose $208 Billion Following Trump's Tariff Announcement**
The world's 500 richest people lost a total of $208 billion on Thursday due to the decline in stock markets following US President Donald Trump's announcement of significant trade tariffs, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This represents the largest decline in the index's 13-year history and the largest since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The average decline for more than half of the billionaires tracked by the index was 3.3%. American billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, were among the hardest hit, with their net worth declining by $17.9 billion and $15.9 billion, respectively. Elon Musk's net worth also decreased by $11 billion. However, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim was one of the few who benefited from the decline, as his net worth increased by 4% due to the tariffs not affecting Mexico and the country's stock market rising by 0.5%.

**Billionaires Who Flanked Trump at Inauguration See Fortunes Slump**
Since Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025, the combined wealth of billionaires who attended his swearing-in ceremony has decreased by approximately $200 billion, according to calculations by financial news agency Bloomberg. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been particularly affected, with his wealth decreasing by a third, from $450 billion to $300 billion. The weeks leading up to the new US president's inauguration were a golden time for investors, with the S&P 500 index reaching unprecedented highs. However, the CEOs of Meta, Amazon, Google, and Tesla, who were beaming with pride on the front row during Trump's inauguration, are likely now regretting their smiles as the stock markets take a hit. As Bloomberg's calculations show, the collective wealth of the attending billionaires has decreased by approximately $200 billion.
