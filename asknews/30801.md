**US Senate Prepares 500% Tariff Bill to Isolate Russia and Stop Its War Machine**
The US Senate has prepared a bill to impose a 500% tariff on countries that continue to buy Russian energy resources, aiming to isolate Russia and stop its war machine. If Russia does not provide a real plan for peace in the coming days, the United States promises decisive economic action. The bill, supported by 81 senators, aims to impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries that continue to buy Russian energy resources, including oil, gas, uranium, and other critical products. This unprecedented level of tariffs will not only have an economic impact but also a serious political message that cooperation with an aggressor will come at a high cost. The bill specifically targets China, which, according to the authors, is keeping Putin's war machine alive by buying cheap oil through a shadow fleet. The senators believe that if Russia is deprived of this critical financial flow, its ability to continue the war will be severely reduced. The sanctions will have both primary and secondary effects, targeting not only Russia but also third countries that help circumvent restrictions or continue economic interaction. This principle of collective responsibility has been applied multiple times in US policy towards Iran, North Korea, and other violators of the international market. The senators also emphasized that they are giving Russia a few days to provide an official list of conditions for a ceasefire. If the document does not contain a clear signal of readiness for genuine peace negotiations, Congress will take 'decisive action.' They have also criticized Trump's statement after his conversation with Putin, which informed European leaders of Russia's agreement to negotiate, but without any specificity regarding peace or sanctions. 'We are giving Russia a few days to provide a real plan for peace,' said Senator Richard Blumenthal. 'If we don't see a clear signal of readiness for genuine peace negotiations, we will take decisive action.'

**Global Tariffs: Implications for the Aviation Industry**
The Trump administration's tariff policy implemented in April 2025 has significant implications for the aviation industry. U.S. manufacturers and airlines will face increased costs on importing aircraft and related parts and components. This may lead to higher prices and market values for new U.S.-manufactured aircraft. Key airlines, including Ryanair, are reconsidering their procurement pipelines and order books with manufacturers in the United States. The introduction of a baseline tariff on Chinese imports of 145% led to a Chinese airline refusing delivery of new Boeing aircraft, but the tariff has since been reduced to 30% for a 90-day period. The EU is considering imposing a tariff on Boeing imports if the United States persists with its 10% tariff on EU-manufactured aircraft. The recently announced UK-US trade deal has exempted Rolls-Royce engines from U.S. tariffs, allowing them to enter the United States tariff-free. If tariffs persist, the increased costs of flying will be absorbed by consumers.

**US States Sue Trump Over 'Liberation Day' Tariff Policy**
Twelve US states, led by Democratic attorneys general from New York, Illinois, and Oregon, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's 'Liberation Day' tariff policy, arguing that Trump's invocation of the 'national emergency' to impose tariffs exceeded his presidential authority. The lawsuit claims that Trump misused the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as a basis for tariffs, which is intended to address 'unusual and extraordinary' national security threats, not adjust trade policies. The case will be heard by a three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade in Manhattan. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield stated, 'The tariffs have led to increased costs for families and small businesses, with an average annual increase of $3,800 per household.' He criticized Trump for imposing tariffs without congressional approval, lacking public review and oversight, and claimed that the court has no authority to review, 'This is an abuse of emergency power.' The US Department of Justice argued that the states' claims are 'speculative economic losses' and that only Congress has the authority to challenge Trump's declaration of a national emergency under IEEPA, not states or courts. The Department of Justice spokesperson stated that the government will continue to defend Trump's policies to address unfair trade. The court's decision can be appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., and ultimately to the US Supreme Court. Trump has imposed tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada since February, and on all imported goods since April, with higher rates on countries with the largest trade deficits, particularly China. However, tariffs on some countries were suspended a week later, and tariffs on China have been temporarily reduced to negotiate a long-term trade agreement. Trump emphasized that the tariff policy is a key means to restore American manufacturing capacity.

**US Senator Lindsey Graham Prepares Bill to Impose 500% Tariff on Russia**
After US President Donald Trump refused to impose new sanctions on Russia, Western 'hawks' have pinned their hopes on Senator Lindsey Graham. The long-time critic of Moscow in Congress is preparing a bill that would impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy energy resources from Russia. The bill has a chance of being passed, but it depends on Trump's approval. Graham and his co-author, Democrat Richard Blumenthal, have a history of proposing extreme bills, including recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism in 2022. They argue that Russia is delaying peace talks, but experts say the bill is more of a diplomatic tool to pressure Russia. Without Trump's support, the bill is unlikely to be passed. Graham's career is closely tied to Trump's, and he has been known to change his stance on issues to avoid the President's disapproval.

**Republicans want tax cuts to save the economy from Trump's tariffs. Not so fast, experts say**
House Republicans are pushing to pass a domestic policy bill that includes tax cuts, but experts say the benefits will be canceled out by the negative impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The bill, which is expected to face united Democratic opposition, would renew tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year, including a larger child tax credit and doubled standard deduction for families. However, an analysis from the Tax Foundation found that the tariffs would shave off an equal percentage of GDP as the tax legislation would boost, making them a 'wash' on the GDP side. Additionally, the tariffs would disproportionately affect the poorest 20% of taxpayers, who are more likely to spend their income. Goldman Sachs also noted that the negative effect of the tariffs would outweigh the pro-growth elements of the tax package, and that the tariffs would serve as a drag on the economy in 2026. 'On the GDP side, they're basically a wash,' said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation. 'The hit to growth from tariffs will more than offset the boost to growth from the fiscal package,' added Goldman chief economist Jan Hatzius.

**Trump Pressures Republican Lawmakers to Pass Tax Cut Bill Amid Fiscal Crisis**
US President Donald Trump is pressuring Republican lawmakers to pass his tax cut bill, which would exacerbate the country's fiscal crisis. Trump campaigned on extending tax cuts and making tips tax-free. The tax cuts are the second major pillar of his economic policy, following the tariffs that have weighed on the US economy, creating uncertainty and distortions for economic agents. Trump has had to partially reverse his measures, which threatened to plunge the US into recession. However, the tariffs still in effect are slowing down economic activity and fueling inflation, although Trump has resorted to intimidation and threats against companies to prevent them from raising prices. According to Moody's, the US economy contracted in the first quarter, growing by 2.8% in 2024. Inflation has decreased, but at least 7.6 million people could lose their health insurance. 'They are literally trying to take away healthcare from millions of Americans right now, in the middle of the night,' said Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives. Trump also claimed that the Republican Party is very united. He believes that representatives concerned about the deficit will give in and support the 1,116-page bill. Conservative Republicans argue that the new spending and tax cuts are concentrated at the beginning, while the measures to compensate for the cost are left for the end. They also want to accelerate the new labor requirements for Medicaid participants who are able to work. 'If this legislation is designed to improve the life of the American people, can someone explain to me why they are holding a session to pass the bill at 1 am?' Jeffries added. Trump concluded after the meeting, 'I think we're going to get everything we want,' while some Republicans continued to demand changes. If the bill passes in the House of Representatives this week, it will go to the Senate, where Republicans are also considering changes. The amended bill would then return to the lower chamber for final approval.

**Fed Official Suggests Possible Rate Cut if Tariffs Settle at 10%**
Federal Reserve (Fed) member Waller stated that if the Trump administration's tariffs on US trade partners ultimately settle around 10%, the Fed could lower interest rates in the second half of the year. Waller said, 'If we can get tariffs down to around 10% and get it settled, and implement it around July, then we'll be in an ideal situation for rate cuts in the second half.' Fed officials have been cautious this year due to the overall economy's resilience and uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policy. Economists widely expect Trump's trade policy to drag on economic growth and stimulate inflation, but Waller reiterated that he expects the inflation brought by tariffs to be temporary. Waller also stated that if the Trump administration returns to higher tariff levels, 'it would bring a bigger impact on inflation, making us more constrained in our short-term interest rate decisions.' When asked about the potential selling pressure on US bonds, Waller replied that it might be because market participants thought the Republican tax reform bill would strengthen fiscal discipline, but in fact, it did not.

**US Senators Introduce Bill to Impose 500% Tariffs on Countries Buying Russian Energy**
US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Lindsey Graham have introduced a bill to impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue to buy Russian energy resources, including oil, gas, uranium, and other critical products. The bill has gained support from 81 senators, indicating a broad bipartisan agreement to isolate Russia. The legislation aims to cut off Russia's financial lifeline by targeting countries that help sustain its war machine, such as China, which buys cheap oil through a shadow fleet. If Russia fails to provide a real plan for peace within the next few days, the US promises 'decisive economic action.' The bill also emphasizes the importance of collective responsibility, as seen in previous US policies against Iran, North Korea, and other market violators. Senators have given Russia a few days to provide a clear list of conditions for a ceasefire, and if it fails to do so, Congress will take 'decisive actions.' They have also criticized Trump's statement after his conversation with Putin, which claimed Russia's agreement to negotiations without any specifics on peace or sanctions.

**IMF Urges US to Reduce Fiscal Deficit and Address Growing Debt Burden**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the US to reduce its fiscal deficit and address the growing debt burden, amid concerns over President Donald Trump's plans to implement drastic tax cuts. IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath warned that the US's fiscal deficits are 'too large and need to be reduced.' She also noted that the country still faces a 'very high' level of uncertainty in trade policy, despite 'positive developments' such as the reduction of tariffs on China by the Trump administration. Gopinath's comments came after Moody's downgraded the US's credit rating to AAA due to concerns over the country's growing debt. Trump's proposal to extend his 2017 tax cuts beyond this year has increased those concerns and sparked anxiety among investors. The administration claims that the cuts, combined with deregulation, will be offset by increased growth, but neither Moody's nor financial markets are convinced. The agency announced last week that the proposed legislation, which Trump calls 'the great and beautiful bill,' would increase the US's deficit from 6.4% of last year's GDP to nearly 9% by 2035. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that Moody's downgrade was 'a lagging indicator' and blamed the fiscal situation on the Biden administration. He added that the government was 'committed to reducing spending and promoting economic growth.' Bessent had previously said that he would reduce the deficit to 3% by the end of Trump's term. Gopinath noted that the US's debt-to-GDP ratio is increasing and added that 'we should have a fiscal policy in the US that is consistent with the gradual reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio.' The US public debt rose to 98% of GDP in the 2024 fiscal year, compared to 73% in the previous decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Although the IMF declared last month that it expected the US's fiscal deficit to decline this year as tariffs increased revenue, those projections did not take into account Trump's fiscal bill, which is being considered in Congress. Gopinath added that Bessent has been right to make a clear call for reducing fiscal deficits. Trump is pressuring Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives, where he has a narrow majority, to support the legislation, arguing that if they don't, it will increase the tax burden on voters. The concern over the deficit and Moody's credit rating downgrade has depreciated the dollar, driven down prices, and increased bond yields in the US Treasury market. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 5.04% on Monday, its highest level since 2023. A larger deficit means the government will have to sell more debt at a time when foreign and domestic investors are starting to question the stability of the US market. In April, the IMF reduced its growth forecast for the US by nearly a percentage point, to 1.8% in 2025, while reducing its global growth forecast to 2.8%, incorporating the impact of Trump's tariffs. Since then, Trump has announced drastic cuts to US tariffs. In fact, China and the US agreed to reduce their respective tariffs by 115 percentage points over 90 days. 'The tariff truce with China is a positive development,' Gopinath said, also celebrating the agreement between the US and the UK. However, she insisted that the US tariff remained very high compared to last year and that the high tariffs on China had only been frozen. Gopinath recalled that the first-quarter GDP figures had been adjusted to the IMF's expectations and added that the data were still difficult to interpret because companies had rushed to stock up on supplies before the introduction of Trump's tariffs. 'It will take time before the effects of all these events are reflected in the data. It's very positive to have lower tariffs than we assumed in April, but there is a high level of uncertainty, and we have to see what the new tariffs will be,' she concluded.

**US Bill Proposes Intercepting Russian Oil Tankers, Expert Warns of Global Consequences**
A US Congress bill proposes creating a $150 million fund in 2025 to monitor and intercept tankers carrying Russian oil, in violation of US sanctions. The confiscated oil would be sold, with the proceeds used to pay off the US national debt. According to Vladimir Vasilev, a leading expert at the Institute of the US and Canada, the bill is likely ordered by the executive branch and may be linked to the defense budget bill or passed separately. 'This is in line with the Trump administration's approach, using such threats as leverage to influence Russia's position, particularly to conclude some deals or ceasefires, at least on Ukraine,' Vasilev said. He believes that the bill will be considered only if the Trump administration gives the green light, but in the context of a tariff war, he does not see a high chance of passing such a law. 'This is a means of economic warfare. Everyone understands that today it's against Russia and Iran, tomorrow it's against China, and the day after tomorrow it's against another country. This can have a very negative impact on global trust in the United States,' Vasilev noted. He added that no one is thinking about the technical details of this 'interception,' but rather about the phases of using the threat as a 'carrot and stick' strategy. 'This is a strategy of carrot and stick. Now we offer you a carrot, but if something goes wrong, we'll replace the carrot with a stick. The stick looks like this: it's not worth much, in my opinion,' Vasilev emphasized.

**Republican Lawmakers Question Trump's High Tariffs Policy**
US President Donald Trump's high tariffs policy has sparked concerns among Republican lawmakers, who are questioning the policy's effectiveness and potential impact on American consumers. In a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Senator Thom Tillis (North Carolina) expressed his concerns, saying 'I think we're starting a full-scale trade war.' He also asked US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, 'If this policy fails and Americans are burdened with high prices and low growth, who's neck will we wring?' Lighthizer responded that 50 countries are already at the negotiating table and that Trump has made it clear that there will be no exceptions in the short term. Other Republican senators expressed their concerns in a more subtle manner, with Senator Steve Daines (Montana) saying 'I hope we can avoid a full-scale trade war' and Senator James Lankford (Oklahoma) questioning the fairness of the new tariffs on Vietnam. Senator Ron Johnson (Wisconsin) also expressed his confusion over Trump's strategy, saying 'I don't understand the strategy. I don't think anyone understands it.' The US Congress is also moving to limit Trump's trade policy, with Senator Chuck Grassley (Iowa) introducing a bill that would require Trump to notify Congress 48 hours before implementing new tariffs and to receive congressional approval within 60 days. However, the bill's chances of passing are uncertain, given the opposition from many Republican lawmakers. The White House has announced that Trump will veto the bill if it passes.

**US Congress Considers Bill to Limit Trump's Tariff Power**
The US Congress is considering a bill to limit President Trump's power to impose tariffs without congressional approval. The bill, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of imposing new tariffs or raising existing ones, and to explain the reasons and potential impact on American businesses and consumers. The bill's core goal is to restrict the President's ability to unilaterally decide major trade measures without congressional approval. 7 Republican senators have joined the bill, including Mitch McConnell, Jerry Moran, and Todd Young, showing growing concern within the Republican Party about Trump's tariff policy. The bill has also gained support from Democratic senators, including Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner. However, the White House has strongly opposed the bill, warning that it would 'severely limit' the President's ability to respond to national emergencies and external threats. The White House has stated that if the bill is presented to the President, he will veto it.

**White House Threatens to Veto Bill Giving Congress More Oversight of Tariff Authority**
The White House has threatened to veto a bill passed by the Senate that would give Congress more oversight of the President's tariff authority. The bill, known as the 'Trade Review Act of 2025', was introduced by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, and would require the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of imposing new tariffs or raising existing ones, and to provide a justification for the move. The bill would also automatically sunset new tariffs or increased tariffs after 60 days, unless Congress passes a joint resolution to approve them. Grassley said, 'For too long, Congress has delegated its authority over interstate and foreign trade to the executive branch. It's time to reestablish Congress's constitutional role in trade policy.' The bill's goal is to limit the President's power to unilaterally impose major trade measures without Congressional approval. Republican Representative Don Bacon has announced plans to introduce a House version of the bill. Last week, President Trump's announcement of new tariffs led to a stock market downturn, and there are concerns that the US economy may continue to decline. Trump has denied considering a 90-day pause on tariffs, saying, 'There are many countries that want to negotiate with us, and these deals will be fair. In some cases, they will pay a lot of tariffs. This will be a fair deal.' The White House has strongly opposed the bill and warned that the President would veto it if it passes. The White House said, 'If S.1272 is presented to the President, he will veto the bill.' Despite the White House's opposition, the bill has gained support from both parties in Congress. Seven Republican Senators have joined the bill's co-sponsors, indicating growing concerns within the Republican Party about Trump's tariff policy. These Senators include Mitch McConnell, Jerry Moran, and Todd Young. The bill has also gained support from Democratic Senators, showing that both parties share similar concerns on this issue. These Senators include Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner. House Speaker Mike Johnson emphasized that giving Trump more time to address the country's trade imbalance is the current priority, and said Trump's policy is working. When asked if he would support a bill to limit Trump's tariff authority, Johnson said Congress would 'weigh the options' but would work with the White House.

**Trump Threatens to Block Congress From Taking Control of Tariffs**
President Donald Trump has threatened to veto a bipartisan bill that would limit his authority to impose tariffs. The 'Trade Review Act of 2025' would require Trump to notify Congress within 48 hours of implementing a tariff and obtain approval within 60 days for it to become permanent. Trump's administration argues that the bill would 'dangerously hamper the President's authority and duty to determine our foreign policy and protect our national security.' Senators Rand Paul and Maria Cantwell have proposed alternative bills to control tariffs, with Paul stating, 'The rallying cry of 'no taxation without representation' sparked a revolution -- and it's just as relevant today.' Trump's veto threat has sparked concerns about the potential for a recession and the erosion of the system of checks and balances.

**Morgan Stanley: Trump's Promises Will Be Implemented More Slowly Than Expected**
Morgan Stanley analysts predict that President Trump's policies will be implemented more slowly than expected, which may affect sectors such as healthcare and energy. This may increase uncertainty for investors in 2025. Most individual tax rules will be extended. Key provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed by President Trump in 2017, which affect individuals, are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include changes to tax rates for individuals, the standard deduction, personal exemptions, the alternative minimum tax, and estate taxes. If these provisions expire, taxes are expected to increase for about 62% of taxpayers. 'Tax policy will be a central element of President Trump's agenda in his first year in office. It is expected that Congress will extend most of the expiring provisions in a bipartisan manner, and lawmakers may include other tax incentives that could stimulate the economy. These could include increasing (or even repealing) the current $10,000 limit on state and local tax (SALT) deductions, as well as limited-time tax holidays for tips and overtime - writes Monica Herrerra, head of policy at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Daniel Cohen, US strategy specialist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The corporate tax rate may be limited. During his first presidential term, Trump reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to a permanent rate of 21%. Although he proposed further reductions, a growing federal deficit and potential need to offset other tax cuts may lead Congress to keep the current corporate tax rate at 21%, noted in MS. 'Unchanged or increasing corporate tax rates may disappoint financial markets, which had hoped for corporate tax cuts. However, any possible tax increase is likely to be limited, for example, for US multinational corporations to encourage them to 'return' operations to the US - is noted in the report. Tariffs are likely to increase the risk associated with specific inventories. During the 2024 presidential campaign, President Trump proposed introducing aggressive tariffs on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican goods. Although we expect this proposal to be used as a negotiating tactic, if tariffs are introduced, they are likely to increase inflation in the US and negatively impact productivity. 'Even the threat of tariffs can affect stock prices. For example, the Morgan Stanley index of stocks exposed to tariffs rose based on good results from former Vice President Kamala Harris in the debates last fall in anticipation of her victory. However, the index immediately sold off after President Trump's victory in November in anticipation of higher tariffs - noted Monica Herrerra and Daniel Cohen. Clean energy may surpass traditional energy. MS warned that, although the new administration's policy may create obstacles for the industry, about 80% of the funds allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act went to states and counties controlled by the Republican Party, which may reduce Congress's willingness to repeal incentives for clean energy. Additionally, new policy aimed at increasing oil drilling volumes may lead to lower prices for traditional energy sources in the face of already high supply. 'Given that two rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are expected in 2025, stocks of companies involved in clean energy may rise in value - forecast analysts. Changes in policy may harm the healthcare sector. Healthcare is likely to be a priority for the new administration, as pharmaceutical companies, beneficiaries of medical insurance programs, and other insurance companies may be harmed by possible weakening of vaccination requirements, which will reduce demand, as well as further weakening of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related subsidies. 'It is expected that Congress will allow expanded ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, which may significantly increase insurance premiums for some policyholders - noted in MS. Immigration restrictions may slow the economy. Restrictive immigration policy under the new administration may include more aggressive deportation plans, expansion of the border wall, increased funding for the Department of Homeland Security, repeal of programs such as DACA, and review of visa issuance and asylum programs. Such changes may significantly reduce immigration by mid-2025. According to Oxford Economics, a return to the 'Stay in Mexico' policy for asylum seekers may reduce net migration from 1.1 million people to about 800,000 per year, resulting in a 0.5 percentage point decline in GDP over the first five years. Additional immigration restrictions may further reduce consumer spending and productivity, especially given the aging US population and declining birth rates. '
