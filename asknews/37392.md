V. Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic Adviser, Government of India, delivered the keynote address at the Data User's conference, organised at the Indian School of Business (ISB) on May 27. He said, 'right now India's macroeconomic numbers paint a very promising picture.'

The growth estimates are healthy in all three crucial sectors: industries, services, and agriculture, which is expected to rebound to 4.6 per cent in 2024-25. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) is expected to register a good growth of 7.6 per cent during 2024-25, with private consumption as a share of nominal GDP increasing from 60.2 per cent to 61.5 per cent, the highest share since 2003-04. Nageswaran emphasized the importance of granular data in policy reform, saying, 'For the era that we are in conviction for policy reform will be sustained by the pulse of granular data.'

**Coahuila, Chihuahua, and Baja California Show Moderate Growth Amid Economic Warnings**
Despite economic warnings for at least 10 states in Mexico, Coahuila, Chihuahua, and Baja California are showing moderate growth, according to Banamex. The economic research department of Banamex predicts that the national GDP will stagnate by the end of 2025, but these three states, being highly export-oriented, may benefit from US manufacturing in the second half of the year, despite tariffs. Guillermina Rodríguez, director of Economic Studies at Banamex, warned that the decline in public spending, high interest rates, slowing employment and wages, and political uncertainty will lead to reduced consumption and investment. She predicts that 10 states will be most affected by this situation, with Tabasco experiencing a -3.5% decline, Campeche at -2.9%, and Quintana Roo at -0.7%. Baja California Sur is expected to have the highest growth in the country, but at a rate of only 0.7% this year, while the State of Mexico will see a 0.5% increase. Rodríguez added, 'There are other entities that we are placing with moderate growth, such as Baja California, Coahuila, and Chihuahua, which are highly export-oriented.' These states, she said, could benefit from the recovery of US manufacturing in the second half of the year, despite tariffs. For 2026, Rodríguez predicts a national growth rate of 1.7%, driven by a more favorable economic environment and reduced uncertainty, which is a major factor affecting investment.

**Today's Lowest Mortgage Rates by State - May 27, 2025**
The states with the lowest 30-year mortgage rates on Friday, May 23, were New York, California, Washington, North Carolina, Texas, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey, with averages ranging from 6.94% to 7.10%. In contrast, the states with the highest rates were Alaska, West Virginia, Washington, D.C., Iowa, Hawaii, New Mexico, and South Dakota, with averages between 7.17% and 7.31%. Mortgage rates vary by state due to differences in credit score, loan size, and regulations, and it's recommended to shop around for the best mortgage option and compare rates regularly. Rates on 30-year new purchase mortgages decreased by 3 basis points to 7.12% on Friday, following a Thursday high of 7.15%, which was the highest level since May 2024. However, rates were lower in March, at 6.50%, and in September, at a two-year low of 5.89%.

**Russian State Duma Passes Budget Amendments for 2025**
The Russian State Duma has passed the first reading of amendments to the federal budget for 2025. The changes are based on new economic forecasts, which include increased revenue from internal excise taxes, taxes, and other payments. As a result, funding for 38 government programs, including social ones, will increase. Additionally, around 300 billion rubles will be allocated for preferential mortgages, and the maternity capital will also be affected. According to Boris Kovalchuk, chairman of the Russian Audit Chamber, 'The monetary and credit conditions will continue to be tight in the next year, with the key interest rate expected to exceed inflation. The GDP growth rate is expected to remain at 2.5% as forecasted in the autumn forecast.' The budget deficit will increase, but it will remain at a very low level, especially compared to other leading world economies.

**India Looks Set To Be Primary Engine Of Growth In 2025, 2026: World Economic Forum Report**
A new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) found that chief economists are optimistic about South Asia's growth prospects, with India expected to be the primary engine of growth in 2025 and 2026. The survey, however, also warned of global growth coming under strain from trade policy shocks and AI disruption. A majority of surveyed economists saw the current US economic policy as having a lasting global impact, with 87 per cent expecting it to delay strategic business decisions and heighten recession risks. The global growth outlook was divided, with weak prospects in North America, resilience in Asia-Pacific and cautious optimism in Europe. According to the WEF, policymakers and business leaders must respond to heightened uncertainty and trade tensions with greater coordination, strategic agility and investment in transformative technologies like AI. 'Policymakers and business leaders must respond to heightened uncertainty and trade tensions with greater coordination, strategic agility and investment in the growth potential of transformative technologies like artificial intelligence,' WEF Managing Director Saadia Zahidi said. 'These steps are essential for navigating today's economic headwinds and securing long-term resilience and growth,' she added. The survey found that AI was poised to drive the next wave of economic transformation, unlocking significant growth potential but also introducing serious risks. Nearly half (46 per cent) of chief economists expected AI to deliver a modest global real GDP boost of 0-5 percentage points over the next decade, with a further 35 per cent projecting gains of 5-10 points. Despite its potential, concerns persisted as 47 per cent expect net job losses over the next decade, compared to just 19 per cent who expect gains.

**New York State Sees 6.2% Growth in Total Housing Units Over the Past Decade**
The U.S. has underinvested in new residential construction since the 2008 housing market crash, with the seasonally adjusted annual rate of new housing starts standing at 1.37 million as of January 2025, roughly 25% below the recent peak of 1.83 million observed in April 2022. However, some states have managed to add homes faster than others, with the Mountain West and Sun Belt regions experiencing the most housing growth. Utah leads the nation with a 25.1% increase in housing units, followed by Texas at 20.9%. In contrast, West Virginia is the only state to experience a net decline in housing stock, decreasing by 1.8%. Measuring housing supply growth alone does not fully capture how well a location is meeting current and future housing needs. Some counties, such as those in Tennessee, Texas, and Utah, have added housing stock faster than they have added people, which helps maintain affordability and prepares these markets to accommodate future residents. Conversely, in parts of Florida, South Carolina, and Montana, population growth has outstripped the pace of new housing construction, increasing competition for available homes. New York State has seen a 6.2% growth in total housing units over the past decade, with a percentage change in housing units (2013-2023) of 6.2%, a percentage change in population (2013-2023) of 4.5%, and a percentage change in median home price (2013-2023) of 24.1%.

**Tamil Nadu achieves record 9.69% economic growth, leading India's states in 2024-25 | Mint**
Tamil Nadu achieved a record 9.69% economic growth rate in 2024-25, the highest among Indian states. The state's GDP rose to ₹17.23 lakh crore, a significant increase from ₹15.71 crore in the previous fiscal year. The real economic growth rate was the highest in the last 10 years, and the nominal growth rate was 14.02%. The growth was driven by the tertiary sector, particularly professional services, which contributed 13.6% growth, and the secondary sector, with manufacturing and construction growing 8% and 10.6% respectively. Dr. Shanmugam, former director of the Madras School of Economics, predicted that if all sectors grow 0.5 percentage points higher, the state's growth will be around 10.7% in 2025-26, saying, 'If all sectors grow 0.5 percentage point higher than what they did in 2024-25, the State's growth will be around 10.7% in 2025-26.'

**NY Fed Pres Williams Says 'Uncertainty Is High,' Sees Slower GDP Growth**
New York Federal Reserve President John Williams warned that the future of the U.S. economy is uncertain, but he suspects lower economic growth is more likely this year. Williams stated that the latest forecasts of real gross domestic product growth seem 'completely plausible' to him, with a revised median forecast for real GDP growth in 2025 at 1.7%. He noted that trade policy may play a role in this, but other factors will be bigger drivers in weighing down momentum.

**State of the State 2025: Tariffs, trade policies cloud 2025 economic outlooks**
The U.S. and Arkansas economies are expected to experience moderate growth in 2025, with the U.S. GDP growing at a rate of 2.4% in 2024, down from 2.9% in 2023. Arkansas' third quarter real GDP grew at an annual rate of 6.9%, the highest among all U.S. states. The state's job market also showed improvement, with an estimated 1,368,644 people employed in December, up 34,626 jobs from the previous year. However, economists are uncertain about the impact of proposed policies, including tariffs, on the economy. Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, expects U.S. growth at 2.8% and global growth at 3.1% in 2025, but notes that trade wars will have a slowing effect on the economy. Dr. Michael Pakko, chief economist at the Arkansas Economic Development Institute, predicts a slower pace of economic growth in 2025, with employment growth expected to slow and the U.S. GDP falling below 2%.

**REPORT: Texas could eclipse California as most populous state by 2045**
According to Realtor.com's 2025 Texas State of Real Estate report, Texas is predicted to surpass California as the most populous state by 2045, with an estimated 42 million residents. The report found that Texas had the highest population growth between 2014 and 2024, with 3.9 million new residents, while California ranked sixth with 803,700 new residents. The majority of new residents moving to Texas are coming from California, with over 781,000 people leaving the west coast for the Lone Star State between 2009 and 2023. The report notes that while cheaper housing has been a boon to Texas, rising prices and rents may impact the state's growth longevity. Additionally, climate concerns, such as hurricane wind damage and extreme heat, pose risks to the state's growth.

**Brazilian States with Highest Growth Rate in 2025**
According to the Resenha Econômica Regional do Banco do Brasil, the Brazilian states with the highest growth rate of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in 2025 are Mato Grosso do Sul (4.2%), Rio Grande do Sul (4%), and Mato Grosso (3.7%), followed by the MATOPIBA region (Mato Grosso, Tocantins, and Piauí). The Centro-Oeste region, which includes two of the top three states, is expected to grow due to agriculture and agropecuarity. The region is expected to produce a record crop in 2025, with an estimated 322.25 million tons, according to the Conab. The La Niña phenomenon is expected to bring more precipitation to the region, compensating for the 6.1% recession in 2024. The report also expects an increase in trade between Brazil and China due to the 'escalation in commercial war' with the US, which 'may increase demand for Brazilian products, especially primary ones', according to the document. Additionally, the report highlights the conclusion of the agreement between Mercosul and the European Union, which is expected to be positive for exports. The state of Pará is expected to grow 3.5% in 2025, driven by the development of the Amazonian Bioeconomy, with a focus on 'ecosystem services, carbon credits' and 'the growth of its natural vocations' (with emphasis on agriculture and mining).
