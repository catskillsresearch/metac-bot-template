**Insecurity in Peru: A Major Obstacle to Economic Recovery**
The president of the Chamber of Commerce of Lima, Roberto De La Tore, stated that insecurity is the main problem affecting the country, and has become 'one of the main enemies' of economic recovery and the fight against poverty. According to the Central Reserve Bank, Peru loses 2.2% of its GDP to security, approximately $5,800 million. De La Tore also mentioned that 85% of the population feels insecure, and 27.5% of people over 15 have been victims of a crime. The Chamber of Commerce proposes solutions such as redesigning the Mariano Santos plan, which aimed to strengthen and modernize the Peruvian National Police, and creating a single observatory to gather information from the Police, Prosecution, and Judiciary. Julio Corcuera, a security expert, stated that extortion has become a 'pandemic post-pandemic' due to its rapid growth in incidence, especially in regions like La Libertad. He also mentioned that the rate of extortion in Peru is 65 per 100,000 inhabitants, while in La Libertad it reaches 241 per 100,000 inhabitants. Corcuera emphasized that the problem has 'two facets' regarding the responsible parties: organized crime groups and 'adventurers', young people who pose as members of these groups to extort small businesses.

**Peru's Economy Shows Signs of Recovery in April 2025**
Peru's economy showed signs of recovery in April 2025, driven by the mining sector's growth of 8.55% compared to the same month last year, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI). The mining sector's performance was led by the metal mining subsector, which saw a 10.64% increase in production. The INEI reported that copper production rose 8.4%, zinc production increased by 49.4%, silver production grew by 18.5%, and gold production rose by 2.9%. In contrast, the oil and gas subsector declined by 4.38% due to lower extraction of natural gas and liquid natural gas, despite a 26.5% increase in crude oil production. The electricity subsector also grew by 2.78%, with notable contributions from eolic-solar generation (34.56%). Additionally, there was an increase in mortgage credits (6.01%) and imports, which totaled $4,658 million (2.41%), with notable increases in consumer and capital goods. However, internal cement consumption, a key indicator of construction, declined by 0.08%, reflecting lower private sector project execution. These data show uneven growth between sectors, but mining remains the key driver of monthly economic progress.

**Public Investment in Peru Falls for First Time in 2025**
Public investment in Peru has fallen for the first time this year, according to data from the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). In May, the three levels of government (national, local, and regional) invested S/ 4,232.8 million in projects, a 9.1% decrease compared to the same month last year. This is the first negative figure in 2025. The decline is attributed to subnational governments, including municipalities and regions. Local governments, for example, executed S/ 1,468.1 million in May, 28.5% below the S/ 2,052.5 million achieved in May 2024. This is the second consecutive month of decline. Regions also saw a 7.2% decrease in investment compared to May last year, with S/ 1,069.4 million executed. In contrast, the national government, specifically the ministries, has maintained continuous growth, with S/ 1,695.3 million executed in May, a 16.6% increase. As of May, the three levels of government have executed S/ 19,373.3 million, representing 29.8% of their modified institutional budget (PIM). The national government has executed 34.4% of its budget, while regional governments have executed 30% and local governments have executed 25.1%.

**Copper Demand to Grow by Over 40% by 2040, Report Says**
The Center for Information and Decision Support at the Council of Ministers has released a report on the future of copper, highlighting the growth in global production and consumption, as well as the increasing demand for the metal due to the growing need for renewable energy and digital technologies. The report notes that the global copper production is divided into two main categories: primary production from mines and secondary production from recycling. Primary production has increased significantly over the past few decades, with a growth rate of 142% between 1990 and 2023. Secondary production has also increased, with a growth rate of 145% between 1990 and 2023. The report highlights the importance of recycling in meeting the growing demand for copper, with the International Copper Study Group estimating that around 30% of global copper consumption in 2023 came from recycled sources. The report also notes that the top five countries with the largest copper reserves are Chile, Australia, Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Russia, which together account for around 50% of the world's copper reserves. The report concludes that the growing demand for copper will require significant investments in new mining projects, with an estimated 80 new mines needed to meet the demand by 2030, at a cost of around $250 billion. Additionally, the report highlights the importance of recycling in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability, with the recycling of copper being a key factor in the transition to a circular economy.

**Peru's Exchange Rate Projections for 2025-2027**
The Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP) conducts a monthly survey of macroeconomic expectations, which includes projections for inflation, GDP growth, exchange rate, and interest rate. According to the survey, the exchange rate is expected to close at S/ 3.75 per dollar in 2025, and remain within the range of S/ 3.75 to S/ 3.78 per dollar in 2026. For 2027, a slight variability is anticipated, with an estimated exchange rate between S/ 3.75 and S/ 3.80 per dollar. Additionally, expectations for the next 12 months also show a slight downward correction, as the average of analysts and the financial system adjusted their forecast from S/ 3.76 per dollar in February to S/ 3.75 in March, according to BCRP's Weekly Note Summary.

**Peru's Inflation Rate Rises to 1.72% in May**
Peru's inflation rate rose to 1.72% in May, up 0.08 percentage points from the previous year, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI). The Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased by 0.05% in May, but increased by 1.05% in the first five months of the year. The decrease was mainly due to lower prices in three categories: Food and Beverages (-0.40%), Transportation (-0.31%), and Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Fuels (-0.18%). On the other hand, nine categories showed a higher growth rate than the national average: Communications (0.01%), Education (0.06%), Health (0.07%), Clothing and Footwear (0.08%), Recreation and Culture (0.15%), Furniture, Household Items, and Home Maintenance (0.23%), Miscellaneous Goods and Services (0.23%), Restaurants and Hotels (0.29%), and Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco (0.59%). The decrease in prices was driven by lower prices for chicken and beef, eggs, vegetables, and fruits, as well as lower transportation costs. In May 2025, prices increased in 11 cities, with the highest increase in Iquitos (0.33%), followed by Cuzco (0.14%), Pucallpa (0.13%), Cajamarca (0.12%), and Moyobamba (0.12%). 'The reduction in prices was mainly due to the decrease in prices of various products, especially chicken and beef, eggs, vegetables, and fruits,' said the INEI. 'Additionally, transportation costs decreased due to the low season.'

**Savings Grow, But Are Peruvians Really Earning from Them?**
According to the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP), private sector deposits grew 8% in the first four months of 2025 compared to the same period last year. Scotiabank attributes this growth to the current macroeconomic conditions, which include a low inflation rate of 1.7% in March, a GDP growth of 3.9% in the first quarter, and a recovery in employment. However, the growth in deposits is mainly driven by simple savings accounts, which offer 0% interest rates or rates very close to it. These accounts expanded 18% annually by April, far exceeding deposits at sight or time deposits. Edmundo Lizarzaburu, a professor at the Universidad Esan, noted that people are saving, but also have expenses to cover, which is why deposits are not growing as quickly as in previous years. He added that people are now preferring to keep their money in easily accessible accounts with low interest rates, rather than investing in other assets. 'With the multiple alternatives of easy access that the Peruvian market offers today, people are looking for where to invest their money or accumulating minimum tickets to enter other assets with more attractive returns,' he said. Additionally, he pointed out that with the upcoming election period, Peruvians prefer to be in cash, having liquidity due to the uncertainty generated by the entry of a new president. 'With a list of almost 40 candidates and without clear new proposals, it is natural that people do not feel secure,' he concluded.

**Peru's Economic Situation: A Mixed Picture**
Peru is finally with a new airport, but three out of four young Peruvians would only use it for a one-way flight. According to a 2024 Ipsos survey, 75% of people between 18 and 25 years old would leave the country if they could. Beyond economic opportunities and professional development abroad, the advancement of crime and urban insecurity could justify a significant part of the potential youth exodus. However, despite the many flights leaving the new terminal for other regional countries, Peru's economic situation is not as bad as it seems. Many investors see Peru as a more attractive space to bring in capital compared to other Latin American countries. Ecuador is the most violent country in Latin America, with a homicide rate six times higher than Peru's. Venezuela is not an option due to obvious reasons. Chile is a more mature market with lower predictability, making it harder to find business opportunities with good returns. Argentina is doing well, but there is still uncertainty about the country's future due to the government's reforms. Bolivia is suffering from a state-led and irresponsible economic model that has led to its worst macroeconomic crisis since the 1980s. Analysts speculate that the real crisis has yet to begin. Uruguay and Paraguay offer stability and good growth rates, but their economies are much smaller than Peru's. In this context, Peru and Colombia appear better positioned, despite their problems. Peru has indicators such as low inflation, solid international reserves, a stable exchange rate, and low public debt. However, the Executive and Congress have been irresponsible with public finances in recent years. The majority of economic indicators for the end of 2024 and early 2025 point to a dynamic economy. The private investment, business and family confidence, and other indicators suggest that Peru is doing better than expected. The country should be growing more, but in the regional context, it appears among the best performers. It is worth considering other points of comparison beyond Latin America, as the region is one of the least dynamic in the world. According to the IMF, the average GDP growth rate for emerging markets is 3.7% this year and 3.9% next year, while Latin America and the Caribbean will see expansions of only 2% and 2.4%, respectively. The author suggests that Peru should set more ambitious goals and learn from successful experiences in other countries, such as Korea's civil service reforms, India's digital ecosystems, and Israel's water management. It is not enough to be among the best in the region, as the rest of the world will not wait for Latin America or Peru. The region has been lagging behind for decades, and it is time to look beyond the region and learn from others.

**Despite GDP growth, India's per capita income abysmally low**
India's GDP has grown to $4.187 trillion, surpassing Japan's, and is expected to reach $5.584 billion by 2028, overtaking Germany. However, India's per capita GDP is abysmally low, equivalent to Japan's in the 1950s, and would take 22 years to reach their level. Experts say India needs to diversify its export basket and leverage global value chains to reach its $1 trillion merchandise exports goal by 2030. To boost growth, India can harness its global trade potential by increasing exports in textiles, apparel, and footwear sectors, as well as electronics and green technology products. Economists project India's economic growth to average around 6.5 percent over the next few years, making it likely to maintain its status as the fastest-growing major economy globally. However, Indian citizens are demanding reforms and policies that will boost GDP per capita by improving wages for India's working class. Four potential ways to boost GDP per capita include allowing farmers to sell their products to the highest bidder, spending money on building and repairing roads and bridges, urbanization, and increasing competitiveness in sectors such as electronics, chemicals, textiles, auto goods, and pharmaceuticals.

**Colombia's Bipolar Economy: A House of Cards**
Colombia appears to be trapped in a state of bipolarity, with a weak economic boom masked by a structural abyss created by the government. The country's GDP grew 2.7% in the first quarter of 2025, with projections of 3% for the year and 3.5% for 2026. However, this growth is an illusion, driven by global post-pandemic cycles that Colombia has failed to capitalize on. Meanwhile, other Latin American countries have harnessed the boom with pragmatism. Argentina, with a projected growth rate of 5% in 2025, achieved a primary surplus of 2% of GDP and attracted $15 billion in foreign direct investment in 2024, doubling Colombia's flows. Chile, growing at 2.6%, captured $11.76 billion in foreign investment, driven by mining and renewable energy. Peru, growing at 3.3%, increased its foreign investment by 65% through public-private partnerships in infrastructure. In contrast, Colombia saw its private investment decline by 18% in 2024, to 15% of GDP, while national savings plummeted to 14% of GDP, down from 21% in 2019. This 'bipolar economic' reality (coyuntural euphoria versus structural collapse) seems more like a chronic death sentence. The fiscal deficit reached 6.8% of GDP in 2024, with public spending growing at 22% annually, while revenue grew at 4%. As a result, public debt will be the highest in Colombian history in relation to GDP, bond prices have risen by over 25%, and the IMF credit line has been suspended. The country's oil production, which accounts for 5.6% of GDP, fell by 5% due to ideological government decisions, while the Brent price at $60 exacerbates the deficit. Insecurity, with 300,000 hectares of illicit crops, and tensions with the US are driving away capital, with a 22% decline in manufacturing investment. The energy sector, with tariff increases (for many over 30%) and gas shortages, anticipate more inflation. Education is suffering from the decline of ICETEX, and housing, due to the elimination of VIS and non-VIS subsidies, is hindering construction. Meanwhile, Mexico and Brazil are capturing 60% of regional nearshoring, while Colombia relies on an inflated bureaucracy (public employment grew 7% in 2024) and games of chance, reducing its potential growth to 2.5% compared to Peru's 3.5%.

**Peru at Risk of Perpetuating Insufficient Growth: CPC Report**
The Private Council of Competitiveness (CPC) presented its Competitiveness Report 2024-2025, which diagnoses the current situation in Peru and serves as a roadmap for the country's economy and society. According to the report, Peru's real GDP per capita grew at an average of 1.0% per year from the early 20th century to 1990. However, the advances of the last three decades do not guarantee future progress, especially in light of the deceleration of the last decade and growing uncertainties. The report highlights the main concerns of citizens, such as crime (26%), unemployment and low incomes (28%), corruption (18%), and the cost of living (14%), which tend to worsen without dynamic and inclusive growth. The report also notes that the advancement of illegal activities, such as illegal mining, erodes the formal economy and leads to an escalation of violence. Additionally, the country faces a fragmented political scenario, with over 40 anticipated presidential candidates for 2026, reflecting the dispersion of politics and institutional weakness. Peru is at risk of perpetuating insufficient growth to close social gaps and reduce structural informality. The fiscal situation also shows a deterioration, with continuous deficits since 2014, reaching 3.5% of GDP in 2024, exceeding the target and the highest in the last millennium, excluding 2020. This has led rating agencies to lower the country's credit rating. The report emphasizes that there is no time to lose, and that maintaining a path of inclusive and sustainable growth will require political decision-making, bold reforms, and a renewed commitment from all actors: the State, businesses, academia, and civil society. The report also highlights the importance of retaking fiscal strength, which requires retaking structural reforms that promote productivity, correcting tax distortions, improving fiscal administration, and containing public spending growth. Fostering potential growth implies reforms to improve productivity and market efficiency, a path that the State has not followed in the last decade, introducing distortions and bureaucratic obstacles.

**Peru Presents National Roadmap for a Circular Economy by 2030**
Peru has presented its National Roadmap for a Circular Economy by 2030 (HRNEC), a plan to promote sustainable development, optimize resource use, and strengthen the country's competitiveness. The HRNEC is part of the National Plan for Competitiveness and Productivity 2024-2030 and aims to increase the country's GDP by 2%, creating over 306,000 jobs in sustainable production sectors. The plan also seeks to reduce material consumption by over 75 million tons, promoting economic growth without compromising the availability of raw materials or environmental balance. The HRNEC was developed through a collaborative process involving public, private, academic, and civil society sectors, with international support from the EU and AECID. According to Juan Carlos Castro, Minister of the Environment, the plan's implementation could increase Peru's GDP by 2%, equivalent to around 14,000 million soles. 'We have taken a step forward in consolidating a more sustainable Peru. Its implementation will boost economic growth, job creation, and development that benefits future generations,' said Roberto De La Tore, President of the Lima Chamber of Commerce. Narcisa Vladulescu, EU Chargé d'Affaires in Peru, highlighted the importance of global cooperation in this effort, stating that 'the EU seeks to be carbon neutral by 2050 and has launched the European Green Pact in 2019, with the circular economy as a key axis. Recognizing the need for global cooperation, it has supported Peru in this transition.' The success of the HRNEC will depend on effective articulation between all actors involved in the value chain, as emphasized by Ana Moreno, Director of Projects at GIZ Peru.

**BBVA Research Raises Peru's Growth Projection to 3.1% this Year**
BBVA Research has revised its growth projection for Peru to 3.1% this year, up from 2.7% initially. According to the report, the Peruvian economy is experiencing an acceleration in the last quarter of 2024, which is expected to continue in the current quarter. Hugo Perea, chief economist, notes that the favorable environment for the economy is driven by the growth of non-primary sectors, particularly construction and services. He also expects private investment to grow 4.4% this year and public investment to grow above 7%. The fiscal accounts are expected to improve in the next two years, with the deficit reducing from 3.5% to 2.4% this year due to improved tax revenues. In the medium term, the deficit is estimated to be around 2.0%. 'The government's efforts to consolidate the fiscal process will require not only an improvement in tax revenues, but also a moderation of public spending, which will need political support', Perea said. 'We expect the public debt to reach 36.3% of GDP by 2030, which will remain a moderate level', he added. 'Locally, the base scenario assumes relatively normal climatic conditions, while politically and socially, it is assumed that the relative calm will be maintained, but also that the uncertainty that usually appears in electoral processes will become more visible towards the end of this year or the beginning of 2026', the report states.

**Peru Aims to Double GDP and Reach Developed Country Status by 2050**
Peru believes it is 'totally feasible' to double its GDP by 2050, a goal that could allow it to reach the level of life of European countries like Poland, Greece, or Portugal, according to Giofianni Peirano, president of the National Strategic Planning Center (Ceplan). 'The plan is designed to achieve, on average, 4.7 to 5 points of annual growth, to reach a developed country condition by 2050,' Peirano said in statements published by the official newspaper El Peruano. Peru's GDP per capita reached $7,906 in 2023, up from $1,945 in 2000, according to the official medium. Peirano noted that if the goal set in the 'National Development Plan 2050' is achieved, Peru will reach 'the quartile of developed countries in 25 years.' He recalled that in the 1980s, Peru was a 'low-income and poor country,' and today it is 'a middle-income and middle-income country in the world.' 'We are halfway up the table in the world,' he added. Peirano also stated that Peru has led economic growth in the region over the past 20 years and aims to become 'an economically more stable society.' 'We won't be Singapore, but Poland, Greece, or Portugal. That's the goal we aspire to,' he said.

**Peru Aims to Double GDP by 2050 with Strategic Planning**
The National Center for Strategic Planning (Ceplan) aims to double Peru's GDP by 2050 through the Strategic Plan for National Development to 2050. According to its president, Giofianni Peirano, this goal is 'totally feasible' and is based on a projection model supported by the country's economic growth in recent years. Peru's GDP has shown significant growth in recent decades, increasing from $51.7 billion in 2000 to $267.6 billion in 2023. However, the country still faces significant infrastructure and public services gaps. To close this gap and improve competitiveness, strategic planning is key to consolidating economic growth and improving the quality of life for the population. 'The challenge of the Plan 2050 is to double the GDP. Is it feasible or ideological? Totally feasible,' said Peirano. The Ceplan estimates that Peru has a potential annual growth rate of 6% to 6.5%, supported by the development of strategic sectors. If the country can channel its political stability and ensure a favorable environment for investments, it could grow at six points annually. 'The plan is designed to achieve a condition of a developed country by 2050, with an average annual growth rate of 4.7 to 5 points. We would be in the quartile of developed countries in 25 years. Remember that in the 1980s we were a low-income country and poor. Today we are a middle-income country and have a medium level of income in the world. We are halfway up the table in the world,' explained Peirano.

**Peru Aims to Double GDP by 2050 through Strategic Planning**
Peru aims to double its GDP by 2050 through strategic planning. The country's current GDP is $267.6 billion, up from $51.7 billion in 2000. The president of the National Center for Strategic Planning (Ceplan), Giofianni Peirano, says that doubling the GDP is 'totally feasible.' The plan has four main objectives, including increasing productivity. 'If we accompany the political support from all levels of government, from the parties, because the entrepreneur is expecting the result of the 2026 elections, we could grow at six points,' Peirano said. The plan aims to achieve a growth rate of 4.7 to 5 points per year, which would make Peru a developed country by 2050. 'We would be in the quartile of developed countries in 25 years,' Peirano explained. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with a GDP per capita of $7,906 in 2023, up from $1,945 in 2000. Peru has also increased its access to electricity, with 96.2% of the population having access to electricity in 2022, up from 72.5% in 2000. The country's exports have also increased, with $74.664 million in exports in 2024, up from $7.028 million in 2000.

**Peru Aims to Double GDP by 2050 through Strategic Planning**
Peru aims to double its GDP by 2050 through strategic planning, according to Giofianni Peirano, president of the National Center for Strategic Planning (Ceplan). The country has already shown impressive economic growth, with its GDP increasing from $51.7 billion in 2000 to $267.6 billion in 2023. However, there is still a significant infrastructure gap, estimated at $150 billion, which needs to be closed to improve the country's competitiveness and provide public services. The plan aims to achieve a GDP growth rate of 4.7-5% per year, which would make Peru a developed country by 2050. This would put the country in the top quartile of developed countries in 25 years. Peirano also highlighted the importance of aligning the efforts of the public and private sectors, as well as international cooperation, to achieve the plan's objectives. Ceplan is working intensively to disseminate the plan and provide technical assistance to public entities and training to their officials for the development of strategic development plans. The plan also includes the development of science, technology, innovation, and digital transformation, making it unique in Latin America. 'The plan is totally feasible,' said Peirano, 'because it uses a model of projection based on retrospective behavior.' The country's GDP has increased by 7-9 times in the last 32 years, and the potential for growth is between 6-6.5% per year. 'If we channel the political accompaniment from all the powers of the state, from the parties, because the entrepreneur is expecting the result of the 2026 elections, we could grow to six points,' emphasized Peirano.
