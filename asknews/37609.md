**Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly announces run for Florida governor**
Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Florida governor, citing the state's affordability crisis as a major issue. Jolly stated, 'We have an affordability crisis in Florida driven by an insurance crisis that continues to worsen in the face of complete neglect by Tallahassee. We have abandoned public education, and we've allowed corruption to run rampant. It's time for a change.' Despite the long odds, Jolly will face competition from other candidates, including Southwest Florida Congressman Byron Donalds, who has already launched his campaign for the GOP nomination, and Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, who is considering a run. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.

**'Radical Leftist': Byron Donalds Laughs Off Never Trumper Ex-GOP Rep Running For FL Gov As Dem**
Former Republican Rep. David Jolly announced his candidacy for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race as a Democrat. Jolly, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, stated that Florida is in crisis and needs a change. Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-endorsed frontrunner, referred to Jolly as 'an anti-Trump, radical leftist' and said he is 'completely out of touch with Florida's voters and our values.' Donalds added that he will fight side by side with Trump to protect Florida families and Make America Great Again. The Florida Republican Party also criticized Jolly, calling him a 'flip-flopping political relic' and stating that Floridians won't be swayed by his candidacy.

**Republican turncoat announces Democrat bid for Florida governor's seat | Blaze Media**
Former Republican David Jolly, who represented the Tampa Bay area in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2014 to 2017, has announced his bid for the Florida governor's seat in 2026 as a Democrat. Jolly, who was an independent until recently, stated that he brings a different value set to the Democratic Party, including support for marriage equality, gun control, climate science, and campaign finance reform. According to Jolly, 'The actual registration as a Democrat wasn't a pivot. It was a kind of formality.' He believes the Democratic Party is the right 'vessel' to help him address the 'affordability crisis' in Florida, which he attributes to an insurance crisis, neglected public education, and corruption. Jolly's challenge to the Republican stronghold in Florida comes at a time when the Democratic Party faces uncertainty, with a reported 1.2-1.3 million more registered Republicans than Democrats in the state.

**What Pinellas' David Jolly brings to Florida's governor race | Column**
David Jolly, a former congressman from Pinellas County, has announced his candidacy for Florida governor in 2026. Jolly, who switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party in April, is running on a moderate agenda that focuses on affordability, education, and economic growth. He has proposed reforms such as creating a state catastrophic fund to ease insurance premiums and giving Florida students better access to state colleges and universities. Jolly's appeal lies in his ability to work across the aisle and build a coalition to address concerns across a broad front. However, his biggest challenge is his own party, as registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in Florida. Jolly will need to break through the new mediascape and convince Democrats that he is genuinely one with them. As Jolly said, 'I've been out of politics long enough to tell the truth. Some of our leaders escalate problems instead of de-escalating them. We have to de-escalate division.'

**Former Republican congressman-turned-Democrat launches bid for governor in push to flip red-state Florida**
Former Republican congressman David Jolly has announced his candidacy for governor in Florida as a Democrat, aiming to end the party's losing streak in the state. Jolly, who won election and re-election to Congress as a Republican a decade ago, pointed to the state's affordability crisis as a key issue, saying, 'It's been even longer since we had an affordability crisis like we're experiencing right now. That's how.' He argued that the crisis has 'largely been caused by Republican neglect that I don't believe Republicans will address and that our campaign will.' Jolly acknowledged the GOP's voter registration advantage in Florida but said, 'Let's be honest about the math... There aren't enough Democratic votes in Florida for a Democratic governor to just win with their own party. We have to build a coalition that includes independents and commonsense Republicans.' He highlighted his own transition from Republican to Democrat, saying, 'David Jolley left the party... I've grown. I've changed.' Florida Republicans predict Jolly will become the latest in a line of defeated Democrat gubernatorial candidates.

**New York Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado Challenges Governor Kathy Hochul in 2026 Democratic Primary**
New York Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado announced on June 2 that he will run for governor in the 2026 Democratic primary, challenging incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul. Delgado released a campaign video, calling for 'decisive and transformative leadership' in New York. He stated, 'Those with power have their own advocates. I'm running to be your advocate.' Although he did not mention Hochul by name, he told The New York Times that 'people are suffering, and New York deserves better leadership.' Hochul appointed Delgado as lieutenant governor in May 2022, replacing Benjamin who resigned due to allegations of campaign finance fraud. However, Delgado announced in February that he would not continue as Hochul's running mate, sparking speculation about his potential candidacy. The two have recently disagreed on major issues, including Delgado's call for President Biden to drop out of the 2024 re-election campaign and for Mayor Adams to resign. Delgado was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018, representing the competitive Hudson Valley district. He won the primary after a surprise upset and defeated Republican incumbent John Faso. Delgado will face a strong opponent in Hochul, who has a significant fundraising advantage, with over $15.5 million in her campaign account as of January 15. The Democratic Governors Association has also expressed support for Hochul, calling her a 'champion for New York' who has 'built a winning machine' to take on Republicans in 2026.

**Hochul lieutenant Antonio Delgado to run against New York governor in 2026 Democratic primary**
New York Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado announced his run to unseat Governor Kathy Hochul in the 2026 Democratic primary. Delgado criticized Hochul's leadership, saying 'People are hurting and New York deserves better leadership.' He also bashed her lack of vision and decisive leadership, stating 'I haven't seen a vision... I haven't seen a decisive leadership that is clear-eyed.' Delgado's campaign focuses on social issues such as housing policy, child care, and healthcare, and he has been at odds with Hochul over the past year, including breaking with her support for President Joe Biden and calling for New York Mayor Eric Adams to resign. Despite being viewed as a rising Democratic star, Delgado's primary challenge is seen as an uphill battle, with a recent Siena College poll showing him losing to Hochul 46% to 12%.

**Tommy Tuberville announces 2026 bid for Alabama governor**
Republican U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville announced his bid for Alabama governor in 2026, stating, 'Today, I will announce that I will be the future governor of the great state of Alabama.' Tuberville, a former head football coach at Auburn and three other major college programs, plans to improve education and bring manufacturing to the state while stopping illegal immigration. He emphasized the importance of K-12 schools and praised the state's new school voucher program, but said it 'can be better.' Tuberville has been a close ally of President Donald Trump and has been criticized for his blockage on military promotions and verbal fumbles. His former opponent, Doug Jones, called him an 'embarrassment' for the state. Tuberville's presence in the gubernatorial race is expected to make other would-be candidates 'think twice' about jumping in, according to Bill Armistead, the former chairman of the Alabama Republican Party. Tuberville has faced questions about his residency in the past, but claims Auburn as his home, despite owning a home in Florida.

**Jason Pizzo Announces Candidacy for Florida Governor, Running as Independent**
Florida's political landscape for the 2026 general elections is taking shape, with state senator Jason Pizzo announcing his candidacy for governor to succeed Ron DeSantis. Pizzo, who left the Democratic Party last month, will run as an independent. 'We need someone who knows how to balance a budget, who understands finance, not just economic theory; who cares about infrastructure, the environment, education, and all those things that are priorities for people who are just trying to keep a roof over their heads, clothe and educate their children,' Pizzo said. Pizzo's candidacy is notable because he will be running without party affiliation, a move that has been criticized by his former party. Byron Donalds, a Republican, has also announced his candidacy for governor, with the support of President Donald Trump. According to a poll conducted by The James Madison Institute in April 2025, Pizzo led the Democratic primary with 42%, followed by Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava with 32%. In the general election, Donalds was projected to win 40%, while Levine Cava and Pizzo were expected to win 34% and 5%, respectively.

Byron Donalds, a Republican U.S. Rep. from Southwest Florida, has begun his campaign for governor, despite already being endorsed by Donald Trump.

He stated, 'The fight this last November was not in Florida. The fight was across America.' Donalds outlined his plans for governor, including fixing the property insurance situation, expanding roads, and making Florida's economy the number one in the nation. He is the only major declared Republican candidate in the race, although other potential candidates, including First Lady Casey DeSantis and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, are still considering entering the contest.

Former Miami mayor Francis Suarez is not ruling out a bid to replace term-limited Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in Florida. Suarez said, 'I'm not saying I'm completely not considering it.

He added, 'One thing that would be interesting is looking at an ecosystem like the state of Florida, potentially running for governor. It's something that I would consider, for sure.' Suarez highlighted his record on taxes, crime, and the economy during his speech, fueling speculation about a potential GOP primary challenge to DeSantis. The governor and Suarez have a history of tension, with DeSantis criticizing Suarez's lack of involvement in conservative accomplishments. Meanwhile, speculation has also mounted about a possible entry into the race by Florida first lady Casey DeSantis, who said, 'We'll see' when asked about the issue in March.

**The 2026 governor's race  --  is this the best the Republican Party has to offer?**
The 2026 Florida governor's race is heating up, with several candidates vying for the top spot. Byron Donalds, a congressman from southwest Florida, is a leading candidate, but his views on Jim Crow-era America have been criticized. Donalds has expressed nostalgia for the past, saying 'the Black family was together' and Black people voted conservative, but this is 'nonsense' as Black people were largely disenfranchised back then. Casey DeSantis, the wife of current Governor Ron DeSantis, is also a strong contender, with a recent poll showing her leading the pack. However, she has been accused of being 'paranoid' and 'ruthless' in her campaign tactics. Other candidates include Matt Gaetz, who has been credibly accused of 'prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress'; Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson; and Jeannette NuÃ±ez, who is currently the president of FAU. The article also mentions several other candidates, including Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, and Don Jr., who has Thoughts About Government. The article concludes that with this 'rich cornucopia of political geniuses,' Florida can't go wrong.
