**Taiwan Gold Card tops 13,000 issued | Taiwan News | May. 26, 2025 11:50**
Taiwan's Employment Gold Card program has issued over 13,000 cards to citizens of 101 countries, with the US being the top source country, accounting for 25% of all Gold Card holders. The program, launched in 2018, aims to attract professionals in various fields, including technology, economics, and arts. The issuance rate has steadily increased, with 1,945 cards issued in 2020 and 13,191 as of May 2025. The National Development Council has drafted amendments to the Foreign Professionals Act to enhance the program, which are expected to be implemented by the end of this year. 'The Gold Card program gained widespread recognition through word of mouth during the pandemic,' said National Development Council officials. 'Many second- or third-generation Taiwanese Americans are applying for Gold Cards,' they added. 'Taiwan has identified Bangalore as a key recruitment target,' officials said, citing India's robust tech and software capabilities.

**Tsai Ing-wen: Joining WHO is an Unchanged Idea**
Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen met with the World Health Organization (WHO) Action Group and stated that joining the WHO is an unchanged idea, despite not being able to participate in the 78th World Health Assembly this year. She emphasized that the idea of joining the WHO and participating in the World Health Assembly is not a changeable concept, and that Taiwan will not give up on this goal. Tsai Ing-wen pointed out that the WHO's emphasis on not leaving anyone behind is particularly relevant to Taiwan's 23 million people, who are currently excluded from the organization. She also expressed her gratitude to the 26 member states and the European Union, which have publicly expressed their support for Taiwan's participation in the WHO. Tsai Ing-wen stated that health is a universal concern, and that Taiwan will continue to push for its participation in the WHO, despite not being a member state. She also emphasized that Taiwan's health rights and the global health and well-being are not negotiable. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the international community has shown increased support for Taiwan's participation in the WHO, and that Taiwan's efforts to join the organization are widely recognized as legitimate and necessary. The ministry also pointed out that 15 countries and the European Union have publicly expressed their support for Taiwan's participation in the WHO, and that Japan, the UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, New Zealand, Estonia, Luxembourg, Latvia, Israel, the Netherlands, and Sweden have all spoken out in support of Taiwan's participation.

**Taiwan's Invention Patent Applications Decrease by 0.1% in 2024**
The Intellectual Property Office under the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced that in 2024, a total of 72,742 patent applications were received, including 58,230 invention patents, which decreased by 0.1% compared to the previous year. The number of invention patents submitted by domestic individuals decreased by 0.2%, while that submitted by foreign individuals increased by 0.1%. According to officials, this decrease is a normal fluctuation due to the unstable global economic environment and the cautious approach of some domestic companies in patent applications. Additionally, officials pointed out that some high-tech industries, such as semiconductors, are choosing to protect their research results through trade secrets or other means rather than patent applications. In 2024, the top five countries for invention patent applications in Taiwan were Japan (12,000+), the United States (6,817), China (3,472), South Korea (3,365), and Germany (1,035).

**WHA again rejects Taiwan province proposal**
The World Health Assembly (WHA) has again rejected a proposal to include Taiwan province as an observer in the annual assembly. This is the ninth consecutive year that the global health agency has rejected such a proposal. Chen Xu, China's permanent representative to the UN, said the proposal challenges the authority of the UN and the postwar international order. He emphasized that Taiwan's return to China is an integral part of the outcomes of World War II and the postwar international order. The Chinese central government has approved the participation of 12 health experts from Taiwan province in WHO technical activities and has enabled Taiwan to access health emergencies information from the WHO. Chen stated, 'The one-China principle is a consensus of the international community, with 183 countries having established diplomatic relations with China on this basis.'

**UNGA Resolution 2758 Q&A Series: Question 4**
The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council is releasing a Q&A series to explain the core implications of UNGA Resolution 2758, which restored the representation and seat of China, including Taiwan, to the government of the People's Republic of China. The resolution embodies the one-China principle, stating that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of China. The UN, its specialized agencies, and other international organizations have strictly followed this resolution in handling Taiwan-related issues, referring to Taiwan as 'Taiwan province of China' and emphasizing that Taiwan has no independent status. The resolution has solidified the one-China principle as a universal consensus of the international community, with 183 countries establishing diplomatic relations with China based on this principle by March 2025. As stated by the Taiwan Affairs Office, 'Resolution 2758 reinforces the global adherence to the one-China framework, and the one-China principle is in line with the greater good and the prevailing trend of the world.'

**Will China Follow Russia's Example in Ukraine and Invade Taiwan in 2025?**
Taiwan's fate may be decided in Ukraine, as President Tsai Ing-Wen said in 2023. Despite China's military maneuvers around the island, she urged the US to focus more on Ukraine to prevent Russia from winning. Analysts believe that if a similar scenario were to occur in Taiwan, China would 'take action' to 'recover' the island. In 2022, President Joe Biden stated that the US would defend Taiwan if China were to invade. This firm response was 'taken into account' by the Chinese regime. China has more legitimacy to invade Taiwan than Russia did in Ukraine. Taiwan was part of China before the nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek established a republic on the island in 1949. Until 1970, the two Chinas coexisted at the UN, with Taiwan recognized by most nations, including African countries, as the 'official' China. However, in 1971, the People's Republic of China (PRC) won the battle to be recognized as the sole representative of the Chinese people, leading to Taiwan's isolation. Today, the PRC's economic and demographic weight is so great that few countries dare to defy it and maintain official relations with Taiwan, including European countries. Only 12 countries recognize Taiwan, with most being small, unimportant countries or islands. Taiwan has a cutting-edge industry, being one of the world's top producers of semi-conductors and microprocessors. As a member of the WTO and the largest foreign investor in China, Taiwan is a key player in the region.

**Taiwan Joins 'Anti-Corruption Alliance' and Signs UNCAC Review Transparency Pledge**
Taiwan has become the first non-signatory country to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) to sign the UNCAC Review Transparency Pledge, a commitment to transparent review and participation of civil society. The pledge was signed by Taiwan's Minister of Justice, Zheng Ming-qian, and the head of the Anti-Corruption Agency, Feng Cheng, in the presence of Vice Premier Zheng Li-jun and the President of Transparency International, François Valérian. Taiwan is the only non-signatory country to have signed and implemented the pledge, demonstrating its commitment to transparency and citizen participation in the review process. The UNCAC Coalition, a global network of over 400 civil society organizations, aims to promote the approval, implementation, and supervision of the UNCAC, and has called on countries to sign the transparency pledge. As of February 2025, 40 countries have signed the pledge, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the US, France, and Germany. The pledge includes six key commitments, including the publication of review schedules, the sharing of information on review institutions and coordinators, and the public release of self-assessment lists and national reports. Taiwan has a strong track record of transparency in its review process, having published its national reports and international review conclusions in 2018 and 2022, and has engaged in dialogue with academia, industry, and civil society throughout the process. Taiwan's efforts have been recognized by the international review committee, which has praised the country's unique interaction with academia and civil society, resulting in successful anti-corruption cases. Taiwan's clear ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index has risen to 25th place in 2024, and the country has been actively promoting anti-corruption work, seeking to synchronize with democratic countries and demonstrate its commitment to transparency and citizen participation.

**China's diplomatic coup against Taiwan pushes Trump into a corner**
China's diplomatic efforts have gained significant traction, with 89 countries, including 53 in Africa, supporting its bid to 'reunify' with Taiwan. This represents nearly half of the UN membership, a testament to China's Belt and Road investment scheme. Analysts question whether US President Trump would defend Taiwan from a Chinese assault, citing his willingness to reverse US foreign policy on Ukraine. The stakes are high, with the South China Sea being the world's most dangerous flashpoint. Jack Burnham, an analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, 'The growing trend of countries supporting all measures for unification represents Beijing's efforts to embed its preferences into international law.' Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te has vowed to 'resist annexation or encroachment.' China's diplomatic gains would help it dodge UN sanctions in response to any invasion of Taiwan. Western officials would struggle to impose trade curbs against Beijing, as seen with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. China has ramped up its military activities around Taiwan, with President Xi Jinping reportedly asking his generals to prepare to retake the island by 2027.

**Exclusive | Bipartisan leaders in Congress introduce bill reaffirming US support...**
Bipartisan leaders in Congress have introduced a resolution reaffirming US support for Taiwan and countering China's pressure to assume complete sovereignty over the island. The bill, co-sponsored by Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), argues that China has improperly used a 1971 United Nations resolution to lay claim to Taiwan. The lawmakers claim that China has 'weaponized' the resolution to isolate Taiwan and prevent its participation in international groups. The resolution condemns China's use of the 'One China Principle' to coerce countries to accept its claims over Taiwan and reaffirms support for Taiwan's membership in international organizations. Sen. Risch stated, 'Let me make one thing very clear: America does not recognize China's claim over Taiwan.' The resolution does not take a final position on Taiwan's status, but acknowledges a degree of Chinese control. At least 10 nations have cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan after being induced or pressured by China's mischaracterization of the 1971 UN order.

**China Secures Support of 70 Countries for Possible Military Action Against Taiwan**
China has secured the support of 70 countries for a possible military action against Taiwan, according to The Economist. This support is necessary for China, as after an attack on the democratic island nation, Taiwan's allies would likely bring a resolution to the United Nations condemning the military action. With the collected support, such a resolution would likely have much lower chances of a majority. Xi Jinping, China's leader, has made the annexation of Taiwan a main goal of his presidency since 2013 and has increasingly confirmed this in word and deed. The 70 countries with a pro-Chinese language regulation span across Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America, with 97% of them located in the 'global South'. China has secured access to important natural resources through its Belt and Road infrastructure program and has funded ports and other transport projects. This gives Beijing sufficient leverage to force these countries to comply with its line. After China's diplomatic offensive, a total of 89 countries in the United Nations would agree that China can use 'all means' against Taiwan. In total, 119 countries, 62% of UN member states, accept China's territorial claim over Taiwan, albeit with a less martial tone. Given these numbers, Taiwan's hopes for membership in the United Nations are no longer materializing. Only 12 countries in the UN General Assembly still diplomatically recognize Taiwan. The successful isolation of Taiwan shows that Xi Jinping has learned from Putin's mistakes in the Ukraine invasion. With the unity of the Western world, which condemned and condemned the invasion in the UN arena, the Kremlin dictator had not expected. With a majority of UN states behind him, Xi can expect that a condemnation of his attack on the island near his coast will not find a majority and the People's Republic, unlike Russia, may not be subject to sanctions.

**China Gains Ground in Diplomatic Struggle Over Taiwan**
China is gaining ground in the diplomatic struggle over Taiwan. A study by the Australian think tank Lowy Institute found that 119 countries (62% of UN member states) recognize China's sovereignty over Taiwan at the end of last year. More than 70 countries also acknowledge China's right to 'make all possible efforts' for reunification, without specifying that these efforts must be peaceful. This shift in language is largely due to a Chinese diplomatic offensive, which has included significant investments in the Belt and Road Initiative. Even Malaysia, which has been involved in a territorial dispute with China, has shifted its stance to align with China's position. In a statement in June 2024, Malaysia referred to Taiwan as 'Chinese territory', and did not mention the legitimacy of 'all efforts towards reunification'. China has also won a significant victory in September, when 53 African governments signed a joint statement during a summit in Beijing, stating that Taiwan is Chinese territory. The influence of China in the global south is increasing, despite China's reduced foreign lending and many countries' difficulties in repaying their Chinese loans. The US and its allies are struggling to persuade countries in the global south to resist Chinese pressure. However, former US President Donald Trump was able to force Panama to reconsider its position, after it had switched its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2017. China's diplomatic efforts are aimed at shielding itself against Western sanctions in the event of a crisis over Taiwan. US officials claim that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has ordered his generals to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027. By winning over a significant portion of the world, China aims to make it more difficult for the US to impose sanctions or disapproval in the event of an invasion.

**China gaining global support for claim over Taiwan | Taiwan News | Feb. 10, 2025 16:07**
China is gaining global support for its claim over Taiwan, with 70 countries backing its authority and efforts to achieve unification. Many of these countries have joined China's Belt Road Initiative in exchange for access to natural resources and key ports. China scored a major win in September when 53 African nations signed a statement recognizing Taiwan as Chinese territory. The Economist reports that this growing number of countries could 'play a decisive role' in assessing the legitimacy of any act of aggression towards Taiwan, potentially rendering the US's demands at the UN to impose sanctions ineffective. Taiwan has identified this move as part of Beijing's misinformation campaign to undermine its sovereignty, and is urging democracies to work together to counter expanding Chinese authoritarianism.

**China's Diplomatic Efforts: A Shift in Global Opinion on Taiwan**
The Economist has warned that China has gained the support of 70 countries to take 'any action' to seize Taiwan, without specifying that the efforts must be peaceful. This shift in global opinion is a result of China's new diplomatic efforts, which have been underway for 18 months. The report suggests that China may use tactics such as threatening to impose quarantine or inspection measures on Taiwan, or even a full-scale invasion. The US has expressed concerns that China's leader, Xi Jinping, has ordered his generals to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027. The report also notes that China's influence in the global south is increasing, despite a decrease in overseas lending and difficulties in debt repayment by many developing countries. The US and its allies have failed to persuade poor countries to resist China's pressure on Taiwan. China is likely to seek support from the UN, while the US and its allies will urge member states to condemn and sanction China.
