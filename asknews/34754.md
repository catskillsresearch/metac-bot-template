GPT-5 will integrate technologies from the o3 model and other innovations, such as voice, canvas mode, search capabilities, Deep Research, and more. Users of ChatGPT will have unlimited access to GPT-5 in standard mode on the free tier, while subscribers will be able to use the model's advanced features with a higher level of intelligence. According to Sam Altman, the release is expected in weeks or months, not years, suggesting that the updates are planned for 2025, likely in the first half of the year.

**The best AI chatbots of 2025: ChatGPT, Copilot, and notable alternatives**
ZDNET has compiled a list of the best AI chatbots of 2025, including ChatGPT, Copilot, and notable alternatives. The list highlights the features, pros, and cons of each chatbot, as well as their pricing and usage limits. ChatGPT is considered the best AI chatbot overall, with its ability to write code, generate art, and create Excel formulas. However, it has some limitations, such as its reliance on GPT-4 and its tendency to 'boot' free users down to GPT-4-mini when at capacity. Copilot is a strong alternative, with its ability to access the internet, link back to sources, and use OpenAI's LLM. However, it is grounded in Bing and not as strong as ChatGPT. Other notable chatbots include Claude, Perplexity, Jasper, You.com, Writesonic, and Socratic. Each chatbot has its unique features and strengths, and the list provides a comprehensive overview of the best AI chatbots on the market.
