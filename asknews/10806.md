**Greenpeace removes wax statue of Macron over French trade with Russia | Business**
Greenpeace activists removed a wax statue of French President Emmanuel Macron from the Grevin Museum in Paris and placed it in front of the Russian embassy to protest against French business ties with Russia and lack of stronger climate action. Greenpeace stated that Macron 'does not deserve to be exhibited in this world-renowned cultural institution until he has terminated French contracts with Russia and driven an ambitious and sustainable ecological transition across Europe.' The activists entered the museum as regular visitors, took the statue, and exited without confrontation. Greenpeace France director Jean-Francois Julliard said, 'We do not deny the political, diplomatic, and financial support of France and Europe for Ukraine, but we cannot continue to import massive amounts of gas, chemical fertilisers, and uranium while supporting Ukraine.' The European Union is working to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, but some imports are tied to long-term contracts lasting up to 2041.

**Ukraine Joins EU's Single Roaming Area, Benefiting Ukrainians and Europeans Alike**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a document allowing Ukraine to join the European Union's (EU) single roaming area. According to the Ministry of Digital Transformation, this will enable Ukrainians to use their mobile operators' tariffs in 27 EU countries without incurring additional charges, and vice versa for EU citizens in Ukraine. As the Ministry noted, 'This is a significant step, as no country outside the EU has previously joined the Roam like at Home (RLAH) policy. It confirms Ukraine's importance as a digital player on the European stage.' The process began in February 2023, when the European Commission proposed including Ukraine in the single roaming zone, and was approved by the EU-Ukraine Association Committee in April 2023. In June 2024, Zelensky signed the main law implementing EU roaming norms, and in July 2024, the EU extended a one-year agreement between 22 European and 7 Ukrainian operators, allowing Ukrainian refugees to stay connected abroad at Ukrainian operator rates.

**Ukraine Signs Law to Join EU's Single Roaming Space**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a law that brings Ukraine closer to joining the European Union's single roaming space. According to 'Glavkom', this was announced by Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov. As a result, Ukrainians will be able to use mobile communication in the EU without additional roaming tariffs. Fedorov stated, 'The signing of the law has brought Ukraine closer to the Single Digital Market of the EU and strengthened the chances of joining the RLAH policy. In addition to roaming, the law allows for more effective interaction between Ukrainian and European companies; it also strengthens the regulator's (NKEC) powers to protect user rights and ensure high-quality communication.' The law was previously adopted by the Verkhovna Rada in its entirety, which brings Ukraine closer to negotiations with the European Union on inclusion in the Roam like at Home (RLAH) initiative. This means that Ukrainians will be able to use their operator's tariffs and not pay additional fees for mobile communication and internet in 27 EU countries and after the end of the war.

**Rheinland-Pfalz Businesses and Trade Unions Call for Climate Protection Law Revision**
Businesses and trade unions in Rheinland-Pfalz are calling for the climate protection law to be revised. They argue that the current proposal would put the region's economic growth and jobs at risk. The main criticism is that the data used to calculate the law's targets is outdated, particularly in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The law aims to make Rheinland-Pfalz carbon neutral by 2040, five years earlier than the federal government's target and ten years earlier than the EU's. However, the businesses and trade unions argue that this goal is unrealistic and that the law lacks concrete instruments and measures to achieve it. They are calling for a realistic review of the data and an independent assessment of the law's legal risks, with their input. As they stated, 'We acknowledge the ambitious climate protection goals, but they must be based on solid assumptions, economically viable, and provide a stable framework for businesses and employees.'

**Russia-Ukraine Negotiations: Second Round Set to Begin in Istanbul**
Russia's Vladimir Medinsky, a presidential advisor, stated on RT television that Ukraine presented its vision for ending the crisis in two languages: Ukrainian and English. However, he did not reveal if the Russian delegation had transmitted its vision to the Ukrainian negotiators. The second round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine is set to begin in Istanbul today at 13:00 (10:00 in Lisbon). Russia's delegation will meet with the Ukrainian team, led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, as confirmed by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Ukraine accepted Moscow's proposal to hold the talks in Istanbul, despite Russia's refusal to provide the memorandum of understanding and list of conditions for a ceasefire in advance. The Kremlin stated that making demands 'is not constructive', while Kiev insists that a commitment to exchange documents before the second round of talks was agreed upon. Russia is reportedly demanding that NATO commit in writing to not expanding towards its borders, effectively rejecting Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova as members. In contrast, Kiev is pushing for a lasting ceasefire and its right to join the European Union and NATO. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and incorporated the Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporijia regions in September 2022, seven months after the war began. Moscow also rejects the unconditional ceasefire demanded by Ukraine, the United States, and European allies.

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**EU Adopts White Book of Security: A New Era for European Defense?**
European politicians have adopted the White Book of Security, which includes two sections on cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, including the creation of a joint military-industrial complex and the accumulation of 800 billion euros by 2030 for defense purposes. However, according to political scientist Oleksiy Buriachenko, the EU's bureaucratic nature is a significant obstacle. Buriachenko noted that the EU was not created as a security union, but rather as an economically horizontal confederation. He emphasized that the EU should not try to solve all of Ukraine's security and arms supply issues, as this is not its purpose. Instead, the EU should focus on its own security, which should be guaranteed by the US through NATO. Buriachenko believes that the EU has finally realized that a reset in relations with the US is inevitable. He warned that the EU's attempt to scale up arms production will require significant state orders, which may come at the expense of other programs, such as migrant support or social welfare. 'This is money that needs to be taken from somewhere,' Buriachenko said. 'For example, from programs supporting migrants, social or humanitarian spheres. If this is done, right-wing and ultra-right forces will immediately start playing on the fact that Russia is not their threat.' Buriachenko emphasized that Ukraine and Europe need to find a common system of coordinates and come to a realization that only together can they guarantee their own security without a third player. He suggested that the 'Coalition of the Willing' format, which includes countries such as the UK, Norway, and Turkey, could become a united Europe, and NATO could transform into the EU's army.

**We are at War: The Fragmentation of Reality and the European Union's Military Plans**
In a world of increasing geopolitical polarization, the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will be a reflection of the fragmentation of our reality, which we will witness as spectators over the next two decades, looking towards the Far East. The author, a professor, has announced to their students that we are at war, just like they did in February 2022, when the drums of war were first heard. This time, the European Union is taking steps towards a possible war in five years, as announced in the Joint White Paper 'Rearm Europe 2030', which aims to prepare the European defense. The plan will cost an additional 800 billion euros over the next four years, on top of the general budget. As the author says, 'we are giving the enemy day and hour'.

**Ukrainian Business Associations Call for Immediate Action to Postpone Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism**
Business associations in Ukraine have called on the government to immediately address the European Union to postpone the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). The Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (UUIE) stated that the implementation of CBAM without considering the war situation is 'a direct blow to the competitiveness of Ukrainian exports.' The Federation of Employers of Ukraine (FEU) predicts that the introduction of the carbon tax in 2026 will reduce Ukraine's export of goods subject to CBAM by $1.8 billion. The Ukrainian Cement Association, the National Association of Extractive Industry of Ukraine, Energy Club, the European Business Association, and other industry organizations have also joined the call, demanding the activation of negotiations with the European Commission and the initiation of a postponement of CBAM for Ukraine during the war and recovery period. Ukrainian lawmakers have also joined the call, with the Parliamentary Committee on Economic Development officially addressing the government on May 28 to initiate the necessary actions to obtain a postponement. According to MP Musa Magomedov, the process should involve the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada, and business. An official request to the European Commission has not yet been submitted, although it is a prerequisite for activating Article 30.7 of the CBAM regulation, which allows for exclusion for countries in force majeure conditions. Experts emphasize that due to lengthy bureaucratic procedures, it is crucial to send the request as soon as possible, ideally within the next few weeks, to avoid disruptions in trade with the EU. According to GMK Center estimates, 14.5% of Ukraine's exports to the EU in 2024 will be subject to CBAM, including metal, energy, cement, and chemical products. Total export losses in 2026-2030 may reach $4.7 billion, with investments totaling $2.7 billion.

**Lithuania's Kestutis Budris: Ukraine Can Join EU Before 2030**
Lithuania's Foreign Minister Kestutis Budris believes that Ukraine can join the European Union before 2030, with 2030 being the 'ultimate deadline'. According to Budris, setting this deadline will help establish a timeline for other important decisions that need to be made. However, he also expressed confidence that Ukraine can achieve this goal sooner. 'We believe you will be able to do it by 2030. That's why we are so committed to this, because you inspire us with your dedication and motivation,' Budris said.

**Nauseda: Ukraine May Join EU Before Western Balkan Countries by 2030**
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda stated that Ukraine may join the European Union before Western Balkan countries, potentially becoming a member by 2030. Nauseda made this statement upon arriving at the European Union summit in Brussels on Thursday, March 20. According to 24 Kanal, citing Politico, Nauseda said, 'If Ukraine can complete all the necessary requirements before 2030, and Western Balkan countries are lagging behind, then everything is possible. It depends on the will, it depends on the benevolence, and we see that the benevolence of our Ukrainian friends is very high.' Nauseda also mentioned that Lithuania is preparing for a possible Russian attack on NATO countries by 2030, planning to create a national division with necessary infrastructure. He stated that Lithuania and other NATO member countries will actively develop divisions to counter potential armed aggression over the next 4-5 years, and that lifting sanctions against Moscow could shorten the preparation time.

**Von der Leyen says Ukraine may join EU before 2030**
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on February 24 that Ukraine may join the European Union before 2030 if it continues to maintain its current pace of reform. Von der Leyen expressed her appreciation for Ukraine's 'political will' and stated that if Ukraine 'continues to develop at this speed and quality, it may be able to join the EU before 2030.' European Council President Antonio Costa added that joining the EU would be Ukraine's most important security guarantee in the future. Ukraine submitted its membership application in February 2022 and became an EU candidate in June of the same year. The European Council decided to launch EU-Ukraine accession talks in December 2023, and the two sides held their first ministerial-level government-to-government meeting in June 2024, marking the formal start of accession talks. However, even with talks underway, becoming an official EU member state will still require a long process. For example, Turkey obtained candidate status in 1999 and started accession talks in 2005, but talks have yet to make significant progress. Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said on February 18 that joining the EU is Ukraine's sovereign right, but Russia opposes Ukraine's accession to the military alliance. Russia has long opposed Ukraine's accession to NATO.
