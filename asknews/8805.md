**Yankees save face by punching back at Dodgers to avoid sweep**
The New York Yankees bounced back from a tough weekend against the Los Angeles Dodgers, winning 7-3 on Sunday to avoid a sweep. The series was a rematch of the World Series, and the Yankees' win was impressive, with Ben Rice hitting a tie-breaking, two-run homer and Ryan Yarbrough making an excellent start. However, the Yankees did suffer a concern, as rookie leftfielder Jasson Dominguez was pinch-hit for in the sixth inning after suffering a left thumb concussion. The Yankees' win was a much-needed boost after they were blown out 18-2 on Saturday, but they still lost the series. Manager Aaron Boone said, 'It's baseball and it's a long season. We know we're really good team and we just got handed it to us, especially (Saturday).' The Yankees will face the Cleveland Guardians next, with a three-game series starting on Tuesday.

**Yankees clearly still have long way to go to reach Dodgers' level**
The New York Yankees' recent performance against the Los Angeles Dodgers has shown that they still have a long way to go to reach the Dodgers' level. The Dodgers dominated the Yankees, pummeling them worse than their 2024 World Series beatdown. The Yankees' nine-game winning streak seemed distant after the loss, and the team's performance was described as 'disheartening' and 'disastrous'. As one might expect, the Dodgers' confidence in their ability to beat the Yankees has been reaffirmed. Dodgers superstar Mookie Betts was initially ruled out of the game due to a minor injury, but the Yankees were the ones who ultimately 'stubbed their toe' in this matchup.

**Dave Roberts Admitted World Series Would've Gone a Lot Different Without One Huge Hit**
Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman's walk-off grand slam in Game 1 of the 2024 World Series against the New York Yankees had a significant impact on the outcome of the series. According to manager Dave Roberts, 'If we lose Game 1, I think the series goes seven games.' Yankees catcher Austin Wells and pitcher Nestor Cortes agreed, with Wells saying, 'It changed the whole World Series. As simple as that.' The Dodgers went on to win the series in five games, but it could have gone much differently without the dramatic finish to Game 1. Freeman himself said, 'I would like to say we'd still win the series because we had a really good team and we were playing really good baseball. But you don't know.'

**Infamous Yankees Pitcher Has Asinine Take on 2024 World Series vs Dodgers**
Nestor Cortes, a former New York Yankees pitcher, has made a surprising claim about the 2024 World Series. Cortes, who was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers this offseason, believes that the Yankees were the better team in the series, despite losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. 'We had done enough to win that game,' Cortes said. 'They can talk whatever they want to talk, but we win Game 1 -- which we should have -- we lost 2 and 3, we win Game 4 and we should have won Game 5. Then we go back to LA up 3 to 2.'

**Former Yankees pitcher has petty comments about World Series loss**
Former New York Yankees pitcher Nestor Cortes believes the Yankees were the better team in the 2024 World Series, despite losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games.
