**Iran Rules Out Any Agreement That Would Deprive It of Its 'Peaceful Activities'**
Iranian nuclear program: Tehran rules out any agreement that would deprive it of its 'peaceful activities'. Ahead of a tripartite meeting in Cairo with Egyptian and Iranian diplomats, Badr Abdelatty and Abbas Araghchi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, called on Iran to 'increase transparency' over its nuclear activities. On Saturday, Iran said it had received 'elements' of a US proposal for a new agreement on its nuclear program after five rounds of negotiations mediated by Oman. 'If the goal of the negotiations is to ensure that Iran is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, then a deal seems possible,' Araghchi said in Cairo, before the tripartite meeting. But if 'the goal is to deprive Iran of its peaceful activities, then there will certainly be no agreement,' he added. In view of a possible agreement, 'we want guarantees that sanctions will be lifted,' said Esmaïl Baghaï, the Iranian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson, pointing out that 'so far, the US side has not clarified this question.' The US proposal, described as a series of bullet points rather than a complete agreement by the New York Times, calls on Iran to stop enriching uranium and advocates for the creation of a regional group to produce nuclear energy. Neither Iran nor the US has confirmed the content of the proposal. The White House has said that the US proposal is 'acceptable' and in the 'best interest' of Tehran. The Western powers, led by the US, and Israel, Iran's sworn enemy and considered by experts as the only nuclear power in the Middle East, suspect Tehran of wanting to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran denies having such military ambitions but insists on its right to nuclear energy, particularly for energy purposes, in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (TNP) of which it is a signatory. - 'Nothing to hide' - PHOTO AFP / ATTA KENARE After the disclosure on Saturday of an IAEA report showing that Iran has intensified its production of enriched uranium at 60% - a level close to the 90% needed to make atomic bombs - Araghchi also said in Cairo that his country had 'nothing to hide' about its 'peaceful nuclear program.' 'We need more transparency - it's very, very clear - in Iran, and nothing will give us this confidence (except) complete explanations of a number of activities,' Grossi had said. He defended the 'impartial' report of his agency, which Iran had rejected, calling its conclusions 'political' and based on 'unreliable and misleading information.' PHOTO AFP / Tupac POINTU, Sabrina BLANCHARD The IAEA has released this report before holding a Council of Governors from June 9 to 13 in Vienna (Austria), an important quarterly meeting during which the nuclear activities of Iran will be reviewed. Denouncing 'pressures exercised on the Agency by certain European countries,' Aragchi had threatened on Sunday to respond proportionately to Iran, if they wanted 'to exploit this political report further.' France, the UK, and Germany are with Russia and China members of the agreement to regulate Iran's nuclear program concluded with the Islamic Republic in 2015, from which the US withdrew unilaterally three years later during the first term of Donald Trump. Egyptian Foreign Minister has called for a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue, emphasizing that 'the region has had enough of crises and security challenges.' 'We totally reject any escalation and any incitement to choose the military option' in order to avoid 'a harmful chaos from which no one will come out unscathed,' he added.

**Iran Denies Nuclear Ambitions, Calls for Transparency**
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated, 'Iran has a peaceful nuclear program and we are fully convinced of this. We have nothing to hide about this.' Araghchi made the statement before a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director Rafael Grossi. Grossi had previously called on Iran to be 'more transparent' about its nuclear activities. Iran received a proposal from the US for a new agreement on its nuclear program, after five rounds of negotiations mediated by Oman. Araghchi stated, 'If the objective of the negotiations is to ensure that Iran does not intend to acquire nuclear weapons, then a deal seems possible.' However, if 'the objective is to deprive Iran of peaceful activities, then there will certainly be no agreement.' Iran wants guarantees from the US that it will lift sanctions against Tehran. 'Until now, the American side has not clarified this issue,' said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghai. The US proposal, according to the New York Times, asks Iran to stop all uranium enrichment and proposes the creation of a regional group to produce nuclear energy. Neither Iran nor the US has confirmed the content of the proposal revealed by the newspaper. The West, led by the US, and Israel, a declared enemy of Iran and considered by experts as the only nuclear power in the Middle East, suspect that Tehran intends to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran denies such military ambitions, but insists on its right to nuclear energy for civilian purposes, under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), of which it is a signatory. A recent IAEA report revealed that Iran increased uranium enrichment production to 60%, a level close to the 90% needed to produce nuclear weapons. 'We need more transparency - that is very, very clear - in Iran and nothing will give us that confidence, except complete explanations about a certain number of activities,' said Grossi.

**Iran Demands US Guarantees on Sanctions Before Nuclear Talks**
Iran has called on the United States to provide formal guarantees that it will lift sanctions in the ongoing nuclear talks with Iran, according to various media outlets. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Bakhai said, 'We need a formal guarantee that the sanctions will be lifted effectively.' He added, 'So far, the American side has not been willing to clarify this issue.' This comes after a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) showed that Iran has increased its enriched uranium production by up to 60%, which is close to the 90% level required for nuclear weapons. US envoy Stephen Wittkoff said last month that the Trump administration would oppose any enrichment program. He stated, 'There can never be a nuclear enrichment program in Iran again. That's our red line. No enrichment.' Iran has pledged to continue enriching uranium 'with or without an agreement' on its nuclear program. US media reported on Saturday that the US has sent a proposal to Iran on a nuclear agreement, which the White House described as 'acceptable' and 'in its interest.' The New York Times quoted informed diplomats as saying that the proposal calls for Iran to stop all enrichment activities and proposes the establishment of a regional assembly for nuclear energy production. Iran has held five rounds of talks with the US in an effort to reach a new agreement to replace the 2015 nuclear deal, which was withdrawn by Trump during his first term in 2018.

**Khamenei and Netanyahu Face the Real Test: Nuclear Agreement or 'Mother of All Wars'**
According to a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran's nuclear activities in recent months have shown that the country is close to having a nuclear arsenal. This contradicts statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who claimed that Israel had won against the Iranian axis. The report shows that at the beginning of the war on Gaza in October 2023, Iran had 128.3 kg of uranium enriched to 60%, which increased by more than three times, and Iran now has 408.6 kg of uranium enriched to 60%. Iran needs a single enrichment level to reach 90% to convert the fissile material into ten nuclear bombs. The head of Haaretz, Aluf Benn, believes that Iran exploited the war on Gaza to develop its nuclear program, and that it started on December 5, 2023, to collect as much enriched uranium as possible, which it then enriched to 60% at a rate seven times faster than before, moving the 'nuclear threshold' to the point of no return. Benn also believes that Iran has the capability and infrastructure to produce nuclear bombs, and that it only needs a few months to produce the necessary materials. Netanyahu's boasts about his victory in the war and the severe blow he dealt to Iran are now in the shadow of the strategic facts presented by Iranian leader Ali Khamenei, who chose to continue the fight and risk launching missiles on Israel, despite the opportunity to stop the war and save the situation. Khamenei's move has led to the collapse of Iran's military capabilities, but this is not a coincidence, as Iran has been focusing on its nuclear power. Now, Khamenei and Netanyahu are facing the real test, which will determine the outcome of the war and the balance of power in the Middle East. According to Benn, Iran believes that Israel is not capable of destroying its nuclear program, either due to a lack of suitable ammunition or due to Trump's opposition, and that a new nuclear agreement is in the works.

**Iran Rejects UN Report on Nuclear Program, Denies Seeking Nuclear Weapons**
Iran rejected a UN report stating that the country is seeking nuclear weapons. The report claimed that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of nearly weapons-grade uranium over the past three months, enough to fuel around 10 nuclear bombs. Additionally, it was stated that Tehran has not reported nuclear materials and activities in three undeclared locations. The report concluded that Tehran cannot 'provide guarantees that the nuclear program for peace will have an exclusively peaceful character'. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi rejected the report's findings, stating that it is based on 'fabricated data provided by the Zionist regime'. He also called the conclusions 'unjustified accusations' intended for 'political exploitation against Iran'. Gharibabadi said, 'Iran does not seek to create nuclear weapons and does not possess any undeclared nuclear materials or activities. As long as the country's nuclear activity is under the control of the IAEA, there is no reason for concern.' Following the report, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi met with IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi on Saturday, urging him to 'reflect reality'. Aragchi also warned that Tehran will 'respond accordingly to any unjust actions by European parties.' The UN Security Council is set to hold a meeting in late June, where the report may serve as the basis for a resolution condemning Iran for violating its nuclear obligations.

**US Proposal on the Table for Iran as Nuclear Talks Loom**
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed that his Omani counterpart conveyed the details of a US proposal to reach a nuclear agreement between Tehran and Washington during a short visit to Tehran on Saturday. The White House spokesperson Caroline Leavit later said that US Special Envoy Stephen Biegun 'sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian system, and it's in their interest to accept it.' Araghchi stated on the XAN platform that Iran 'will respond to the US proposal in line with national principles, interests, and the rights of the Iranian people.' This comes before a sixth round of expected talks between Washington and Tehran to resolve the decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear program. The talks' date and location have not been announced yet. Leavit stated in a statement: 'President Trump has made it clear that Iran can never have a nuclear bomb,' confirming that the US proposal has been sent to Iran. Trump said on Friday that an agreement with Iran is possible in the 'near future.' Before that, Trump told reporters that he warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against taking actions that could disrupt nuclear talks with Iran. The comments suggest that the US is concerned about the possibility of Israel launching a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities amid ongoing diplomatic efforts. Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomacy fails to reach an agreement. One of the main sticking points in the talks between US and Iranian officials is the US insistence that Iran give up its uranium enrichment facilities, which Iran refuses to do. Trump, who reimposed 'maximum pressure' on Iran since February, had withdrawn from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers in 2018 and reimposed severe sanctions on Iran. Since then, Iran has consistently exceeded the limits set by the 2015 agreement on its nuclear program, which aims to increase the difficulties in developing a nuclear bomb, while denying Tehran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon.

**Iran very close to nuclear bomb, closes its airspace, increases stock of weapon-grade uranium, could potentially make...**
Iran is reportedly close to developing a nuclear bomb, having increased its stockpile of weapon-grade uranium. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concerns over Iran's restrictions on monitoring equipment, making it difficult to verify the authenticity of its nuclear program. Iran claims its intention is for energy and medical purposes, but the US Secretary of State has threatened strict sanctions if it does not disclose its program. Israel has labeled Iran a threat to its existence and discussed military options. According to an IAEA report, Iran's 60% enriched uranium is 'very close' to weapon-grade, and could potentially be converted to weapon-grade in a few weeks, posing a significant threat to regional and global security.

**Iran has secretly amassed near weapons-grade levels of uranium and could soon have enough for NINE ATOM BOMBS**
The UN's nuclear watchdog has warned that Iran has secretly increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, which could be used to make at least nine atomic bombs. According to the report, Iran has amassed 408.6 kgs of uranium enriched up to 60 per cent, a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent. Rafael Grossi, the Director General for the IAEA, warned that the regime is 'not far away' from completing a successful nuclear test aimed at military use. The report also estimates that Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium stood at 9,247.6kgs, an increase of 953.2kgs since February. US intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but is in a position to produce a nuclear weapon if it wishes to. Israel has accused Iran of being determined to acquire nuclear weapons, and has warned that a nuclear blast from Iran could have disastrous consequences for the Middle East and beyond.

**Iranian Foreign Minister: Nuclear Weapons 'Unacceptable'**
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has described nuclear weapons as 'unacceptable'. He stated, 'If the problem is nuclear weapons, then we also consider this type of weapon unacceptable.' The US and Iran have been negotiating a new nuclear agreement since April. The US demands that Iran completely abandon uranium enrichment, but Iran refuses, citing its right to nuclear capabilities for civilian use, particularly for energy production. The fifth round of talks took place in Rome last Friday, mediated by Oman. According to US sources, the talks were 'constructive', and another meeting has been agreed upon, but no date has been set. The Iranian government summoned the Austrian diplomat Michaela Pacher after an Austrian intelligence report was released, which stated that Iran's nuclear program is 'far advanced' and aims to develop nuclear weapons to make the Iranian government 'unassailable' and to strengthen its dominance in the region. The Iranian Foreign Ministry strongly rejected the report, calling it 'media hype' against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Austrian government stated that the current constitution protection report reflects the situation in 2024, when the Austrian constitution protection agency concluded that Iran's nuclear program was 'far advanced', but there was no evidence that Iran had made a decision to build a nuclear weapon. The IAEA reported that Iran now has nearly 409 kilograms of uranium with a purity of 60%, which is almost enough for a nuclear weapon if further enriched to 90%. Iran has deliberately hidden its activities, according to IAEA chief Rafael Grossi. The IAEA also reported that Iran had hidden nuclear activities and materials at three facilities from the agency in the past, and that the agency's investigations were hindered. Araqchi stated that he is 'not sure' if an agreement between Iran and the US will be reached soon, while US President Donald Trump said that Iran and the US are 'close to a solution'.

**Iran dismisses Austrian intelligence claim on nuclear weapons as ‘fake’**
Iran has dismissed as 'fake' a claim made in an Austrian intelligence report that Tehran is pursuing nuclear weapons. The report, published by Austria's domestic intelligence agency, stated that Iran's 'nuclear weapons development programme is well advanced'. Iran maintains that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that Iran enriches uranium up to 60 percent, above the 3.67 percent cap set under the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran's foreign ministry denounced the claims as 'fake information' and demanded clarification from the Austrian government. Diplomatic talks with the US remain uncertain, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying he was 'not sure' a deal was close, following a recent meeting in Rome.

**Iran's Nuclear Activities: A Threat to Regional Security**
According to an Austrian intelligence agency report, Iran is actively pursuing nuclear activities that could be used to launch long-range missiles. The report states that Iranian intelligence agencies are trying to infiltrate European companies and factories to learn new technologies and transfer them to Iran. The report contradicts the US intelligence community's assessment, as reported by Fox News. The Austrian intelligence agency's report states that Iran is seeking to rearm itself with a comprehensive nuclear program, using nuclear weapons to secure its position in the region and beyond. The report also mentions that Iran is using shell companies to acquire sensitive technologies and materials, including dual-use goods, to support its nuclear program. The report further states that Iran has been increasing its influence in regional conflicts through arms supplies, particularly in Syria and Palestine. The report's findings may complicate US-Iran nuclear negotiations, as it suggests that Iran will not give up its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The report also highlights the presence of Iranian intelligence officers in Austria, who are hiding under diplomatic cover. The Austrian intelligence agency has stated that Iranian intelligence services are experienced in developing and implementing strategies to obtain sensitive military equipment and technologies. In 2021, a Belgian court convicted an Iranian diplomat, Assadollah Assadi, of planning a bomb attack on a Iranian opposition meeting in Paris in 2018. The report's findings are consistent with German and British assessments, which have also suggested that the US intelligence community's assessment of Iran's nuclear program was incorrect. The report states that the German intelligence agency's assessment came from the head of the German Federal Intelligence Service in Washington, while the British information came from a senior official in the field of nuclear non-proliferation who was having dinner with him in 2007. The report also mentions that the Germans said that the US was misinterpreting the data available to them all.

**Iran and the Nuclear Bomb: 2025, the Year of Diplomacy... or War?**
The West, led by the US, has long suspected Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons. An international agreement was reached on July 14, 2015, to limit Iran's nuclear program. However, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran currently possesses 275 kg of uranium enriched to 60%, exceeding the 2015 agreement's limit by more than 41 times. 'The Iranian nuclear program has never been as advanced,' warns Naysan Rafati, a specialist on Iranian nuclear issues at the International Crisis Group. Experts believe Iran may be just weeks away from having a nuclear bomb. This scenario is concerning, as Iran could use the bomb as a deterrent or to attack its enemies, including Israel. According to Frédéric Encel, a professor of geopolitics, it could also prompt neighboring countries, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey, to develop their own nuclear capabilities. To prevent this scenario, new negotiations are underway. Will it be an agreement or war? Our new video analysis explores the two possibilities.

**Iran’s Nuclear Power Dream: From Fantasy to Reality - Iran Focus**
Iran's nuclear power program has been a costly and ineffective endeavor, contributing only 1% to the country's electricity supply. Despite plans to increase nuclear power generation capacity to 20 gigawatts by 2041, the current Bushehr nuclear power plant, with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts, has only produced 70 terawatt-hours of electricity since its commissioning in 2011. The regime's nuclear program has led to extensive international sanctions, causing between $2 to $3 trillion in direct economic losses. Iran has a high potential for developing solar and wind energy, but these renewable sources account for only 1% of the country's electricity generation. The regime's pursuit of uranium enrichment up to 60% and continuation of its nuclear activities under harsh sanctions suggest that deterrence and boosting its bargaining power in foreign policy outweigh economic and developmental interests. The regime's massive investments in a program with minimal economic return and negligible contribution to electricity production indicate that decision-makers in Tehran are more focused on regime survival and external deterrence than on actual energy goals. The Iranian regime sees nuclear weapons as essential to its survival and to suppress the growing domestic unrest, and Western governments must realize that the only effective way to confront this regime and its destructive and terrorist policies in the region is through firmness.

**Iran's Nuclear Program: A Complex and Controversial Issue**
Iran is not a nuclear power, but there are concerns that the Islamic Republic is close to creating a nuclear bomb or already has one. Iran has signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), but 'young' nuclear powers like Israel, India, and Pakistan have not. The country has also signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), but it has not entered into force. In 2015, Iran agreed to a 10-year deal on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions. However, the US withdrew from the deal in 2018, and Iran reduced its participation to a minimum in 2020. In January 2025, Iran threatened to withdraw from the NPT if the West initiates the resumption of international sanctions in the UN Security Council. Iran's nuclear program is officially for peaceful purposes, and the country has a fatwa from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei prohibiting the development of nuclear weapons. However, in April 2025, Khamenei's advisor stated that US actions could force Iran to develop a nuclear bomb for self-defense. The US believes that Iran currently has the potential to create six nuclear warheads, based on its stockpile of highly enriched uranium. Iran's nuclear program was launched in the 1950s, and the country received nuclear technology from the US for peaceful use. Today, the program includes two uranium mines, three uranium enrichment plants, research facilities, including a reactor, and one nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has identified around 20 declared nuclear facilities in Iran. These include the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), the Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF), the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP), and the Arak Heavy Water Production Plant (FFEP).

**Iran Announces Entry into 'Third Phase' of Nuclear Program Development**
Iran has officially entered the 'third phase' of developing its nuclear program, announcing 6 new nuclear achievements and considering it a 'national responsibility'. According to Mohammad Islam, the deputy president and head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Iran has become one of the world's leading countries in producing radioactive medicines, despite being under sanctions. He stated that Iran has achieved 150 projects over the past three years, with 68 of them being evaluated and classified, but only 6 were revealed during the recent celebration. Islam emphasized that Iran is not part of any international cooperation networks due to the sanctions, but has achieved significant progress in producing helium gas, which was previously imported at a high cost. He also mentioned that Iran's nuclear power plant in Bushehr has produced 72 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, with 7 billion of them produced last year, and aims to reach 20,000 megawatts of nuclear electricity by 2041. Islam also announced that the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, is expected to visit Tehran in April. He stated that there are two possible paths for cooperation with the agency: the first is based on the agreement on guarantees and the non-proliferation treaty, and the second is based on UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Iran has 120 inspectors accredited by the agency, and regular inspections are being conducted. The president of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, announced the launch of 6 new products in the nuclear industry, including a new cancer treatment, a new type of radioactive medicine, a new type of cream for skin cancer, a new type of lamp for drilling wells, a new type of methanol, and a new type of acid. He emphasized that Iran will not give up its nuclear achievements and will not compromise on them, and will not allow any party to prevent it from innovating and creating. He also stated that the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has allowed for indirect negotiations because Iran does not trust the other side, and that Khamenei does not oppose American investment in Iran, but rather opposes Washington's 'wrong policies'. Raisi emphasized that Iran is ready to provide guarantees that it is not seeking to acquire a nuclear bomb, and that it supports peace, but will not surrender and will follow a policy of dialogue with dignity and pride. The Iranian parliament's committee on national security and foreign policy issued a statement, emphasizing that Iran has the right to possess a peaceful nuclear industry in all fields, according to Article 4 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and warned that any interference or threat to Iran's nuclear program 'will be met with a severe and destructive response'. The Iranian foreign ministry stated that Iran's nuclear program is a symbol of national will and a result of the people's efforts to achieve nuclear knowledge, and that protecting and preserving the achievements in the field of peaceful nuclear energy is a national responsibility. The ministry also stated that it will use all its power to defend the rights of the Iranian people in the field of nuclear energy.

He also mentioned that Iran has achieved significant progress in producing helium gas, which was previously imported at a high cost. Regarding nuclear electricity, Islam stated that the Bushehr nuclear power plant has produced 72 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 7 billion of which were produced last year, and aims to reach 20,000 megawatts by 2041. He also announced that the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit Tehran in April. Islam stated that there are two different paths being discussed for cooperation with the agency, and that Iran has 120 inspectors accredited by the agency, who conduct regular inspections. He also mentioned that the resolution 2231 will expire at the end of the 10th year of the nuclear agreement, and that some parties, such as Israel and some European countries, are trying to prevent Iran from benefiting from this achievement. The Iranian President, Ebrahim Raisi, emphasized that his country will not give up its nuclear achievements and will not compromise on them, and will not allow any party to prevent it from innovating and creating. He also stated that the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has allowed for indirect negotiations because Iran does not trust the other side, and that Khamenei does not oppose American companies investing in Iran, but rather opposes Washington's 'wrong policies'. Raisi also emphasized that Iran is ready to provide guarantees that it is not seeking to acquire a nuclear bomb, despite having previously proven this, and that it supports peace but will not surrender and follow a policy of dialogue with 'pride and dignity'. The Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee issued a statement emphasizing that Iran has the right to have a peaceful nuclear industry in all fields, according to Article 4 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and warned that any interference or threat to Iran's nuclear program 'will be met with a severe and destructive response'. The Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that Iran's peaceful nuclear program is a symbol of national will and a result of the people's efforts to achieve nuclear knowledge, and that protecting and preserving the achievements in the field of peaceful nuclear energy is a national responsibility. The Ministry also stated that it will use all its power to defend the rights of the Iranian people in the field of nuclear energy.

**Iranian Military Leaders Urge Khamenei to Revoke Fatwa on Nuclear Weapons**
Several senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran have asked Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to revoke the fatwa prohibiting the development of nuclear weapons, according to The Telegraph. The commanders made the request after the election of US President Donald Trump, saying, 'We have never been so vulnerable, maybe this is our last chance to get it before it's too late.' The fatwa, issued in 2005, prohibits the production of all types of weapons of mass destruction. The commanders argue that the fatwa is the only obstacle to Iran's ability to produce nuclear weapons, which they believe is necessary for the regime's survival. In recent months, there has been increased pressure on Khamenei to harden Iran's foreign policy, with dozens of Iranian lawmakers calling for a review of the country's nuclear policy in 2024. 'We now have the necessary capabilities to produce nuclear weapons, and the only obstacle is the fatwa that prohibits it,' said Kamal Kharazi, head of Iran's strategic council on international relations, in November. The Iranian opposition suspects that the fatwa may be interpreted as advisory rather than legally binding in the future. In December 2024, the IAEA warned that Iran is close to being able to produce nuclear weapons. According to the agency's criteria, Iran already has enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear bomb if it continues to process its fuel. A secret group of Iranian scientists is working on finding ways to quickly convert the increased stockpiles of nuclear fuel into a bomb in case the government demands it.

**IRGC Commanders Demand Reversal of Fatwa Banning Nuclear Weapons**
High-ranking commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are calling on Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to revoke the fatwa banning the development of nuclear weapons. They believe possessing a nuclear bomb is necessary for protecting the country from 'existential threats' from the West, according to The Daily Telegraph. One IRGC representative stated, 'We've never been so vulnerable, and this might be our last chance to get it (the bomb) before it's too late.' The fatwa, created in 2005, prohibits nuclear weapons as 'absolutely haram' (forbidden in Islam). However, changes in the geopolitical landscape have led some conservative supporters in Iran to question this ban. 'The existential threat we're facing now has convinced several senior commanders who previously insisted on following the Supreme Leader's orders to push for the creation of nuclear weapons,' said an Iranian official in Tehran. The pressure on Khamenei from hardline supporters has increased significantly in recent months, with dozens of Iranian parliament members demanding a review of the country's nuclear strategy in 2024.

**Iranian Commanders Propose Lifting Fatwa Banning Nuclear Weapons**
Several senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran have proposed to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, to lift the fatwa banning the development of nuclear weapons, according to The Telegraph. The commanders made this proposal after the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. 'We have never been so vulnerable, maybe this is our last chance to get it before it's too late', said one of the officials. The fatwa, a religious decree, was issued by Khamenei in 2005, banning the production of all types of weapons of mass destruction. An official noted that the Supreme Leader has banned both negotiations with the US and the creation of nuclear weapons, which 'were the only ways for the regime to survive', and therefore 'he is leading the regime to its downfall'. In recent months, there has been increased pressure on Khamenei to harden the country's foreign policy, with dozens of Iranian lawmakers calling for a review of the country's nuclear policy in 2024. 'We now have the necessary capabilities to produce nuclear weapons, and the only obstacle is the fatwa that bans it', said Kamal Kharazi, head of Iran's strategic council on international relations, in November. No one is allowed to violate the fatwa, which is mandatory for all government agencies, emphasized Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, last summer. As Iran International noted, the Iranian opposition suspects that the fatwa may be interpreted as advisory in the future, rather than a legally binding document. In December, the IAEA warned that Iran is approaching the possibility of creating nuclear weapons. According to the agency's criteria, Iran already has enough material enriched to 60% to create a nuclear weapon if it continues to process the fuel.
