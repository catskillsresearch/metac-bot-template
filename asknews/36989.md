**Joe Rogan makes staggering claim about Jesus' resurrection on his podcast as fans left stunned**
Joe Rogan made a surprising claim on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, stating that he believes in the resurrection of Jesus Christ over the Big Bang theory. Rogan, a self-proclaimed curious and open-minded individual, quoted Terence McKenna and said, 'The difference between science and religion is that science only asks you to believe in one miracle: the Big Bang.' He then added, 'I'm sticking with Jesus on that one. Jesus makes more sense.' This statement has left listeners stunned, given Rogan's history of discussing science and scientific thinking on his podcast. Despite his interest in science, Rogan's views on faith and belief are highly personal and have sparked controversy in the past.

**Joe Rogan says Poilievre's team stopped him from going on his podcast during election campaign - LifeSite**
Joe Rogan revealed that Conservative Party of Canada leader Pierre Poilievre's handlers prevented him from appearing on his podcast during the election campaign. Rogan said, '[Poilievre's advisors] thought it was too problematic or whatever,' and that he 'offered to have that Pierre guy come on the podcast' but was told not to. This decision was allegedly made due to mainstream media blowback, despite Rogan's policy of respecting guests' wishes not to discuss certain topics. Poilievre has yet to comment on Rogan's claims, but has declined interviews with other prominent personalities in the past.

**Cracks in the Rogansphere? Inner circle revolts as Joe Rogan's Elon Musk obsession and political leanings spark backlash**
Joe Rogan's podcast, 'The Joe Rogan Experience,' has seen a decline in Spotify rankings since November. The podcast, which was once the most popular, has fallen behind shows like 'The Shawn Ryan Show,' 'MeidasTouch,' and 'Good Hang.' Rogan's shift towards more political content and his support for Elon Musk have caused discomfort among some guests, including neuroscientist Sam Harris, who said, 'He's in over his head on so many topics of great consequence.' Harris criticized Rogan for not pushing back against misinformation, citing examples of guests who spread false information, such as Holocaust deniers and liars like Trump and Tucker Carlson. Despite a 25% jump in downloads in February, Rogan's podcast has lost ground to other shows, with MeidasTouch reaching 57.5 million downloads, a 109% jump from the previous month.

**Michelle Obama humiliated amid dismal ratings for podcast**
Michelle Obama's new podcast, IMO [In My Opinion] with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson, has failed to meet expectations after its launch in early March. The podcast, which features the sibling duo discussing current events and interviewing special guests, has underperformed on the charts, ranking 34th on Spotify and 19th on Apple Podcasts. In comparison, other recently released podcasts like Good Hang with Amy Poehler have outperformed, ranking second on Apple Podcasts and third on Spotify. Michelle Obama's YouTube account has only 67,000 subscribers, a far cry from popular podcasts like The Joe Rogan Experience with 19.6 million subscribers. The disappointing numbers come as Democrats strategize to find a 'Joe Rogan of the left' to appeal to the younger generation. A recent study revealed that conservative podcasts and pundits dominate the alternative media space, with left-leaning shows paling in comparison.

**American Best-Selling Author Beats Joe Rogan’s $250M Spotify Podcast for a 4th Consecutive Top Spot**
Mel Robbins, a NYT best-selling author and self-improvement guru, has taken the top spot on Spotify's US rankings, surpassing Joe Rogan's The Joe Rogan Experience. According to Jed I. Goodman's tweets, Robbins' self-help-packed show has outpaced Rogan's in terms of listeners. Robbins' podcast, which started as a birthday project in 2022, offers tactical advice, motivational nuggets, and relatable stories, a departure from Rogan's deep dives with controversial figures. Robbins' success shows that people may prefer life advice over other types of content. However, Rogan has been here before, and it's possible that he could reclaim the top spot. Spotify recently renewed his deal for $250 million, ensuring that his podcast will be available on multiple platforms.
