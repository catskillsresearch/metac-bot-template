**Elon Musk Urges Congress to Remove Restrictions on Autonomous Vehicles**
Billionaire Elon Musk is actively lobbying US lawmakers to remove restrictions on autonomous vehicles. He has been personally meeting with members of Congress to promote the idea of simplifying regulatory laws for self-driving cars. According to Bloomberg, Musk and his team are pushing for changes to a bill introduced on May 15, which aims to establish a foundation for future legislation on the use of autonomous vehicles on roads. 'The document is based on long-standing recommendations from the Department of Transportation and aims to create conditions for the launch of autonomous transportation systems in commercial use,' explained Joe Jackson, senior advisor to Senator Cynthia Lummis. Tesla is preparing to launch a self-driving taxi service in Austin on June 12, which will initially use existing Model Y vehicles and later plans to introduce specially designed Cybercab vehicles. However, federal rules currently limit the use of such machines to only 2,500 test units without steering wheels or pedals. Musk has repeatedly called for a unified national regulatory framework, saying, 'It would be good if autonomous driving were regulated by a single standard, not 50 different laws in each state.'

Billionaire Elon Musk is actively urging American lawmakers to remove restrictions on the development of autonomous vehicles in the US. He has been personally meeting with members of Congress to promote the idea of simplifying regulatory oversight for self-driving cars. According to Bloomberg, Musk and his team are lobbying for changes to a bill introduced on May 15, which would lay the groundwork for a future legislative framework for the use of autonomous vehicles on the roads. 'The document is based on old recommendations from the Department of Transportation and aims to create conditions for the launch of autonomous transportation vehicles in commercial use,' explained Joe Jackson, senior advisor to Senator Cynthia Lummis. Tesla is actively preparing to launch a self-driving taxi service in Austin, which is expected to start on June 12. The company plans to use existing Model Y vehicles in the first phase and later introduce specially designed Cybercab vehicles. However, federal regulations currently limit the use of such vehicles to only 2,500 test units without steering wheels and pedals. Musk has repeatedly called for the creation of a single national regulatory framework. 'It would be good if autonomous driving were regulated by a single standard, not 50 different laws in each state,' he said during a visit by US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to Tesla's facilities. Currently, only a few states, such as Texas, allow the widespread use of autonomous vehicles, treating them as ordinary vehicles.

**5 safest cars for beginner drivers**
For beginner drivers, safety is the top priority. Many modern cars come equipped with features like forward collision warning (FCW) and lane departure warning (LDW) systems, which help prevent accidents before they happen. According to Slash Gear, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that automatic emergency braking (AEB) has reduced rear-end collisions by half. Mazda has not only passed IIHS and NHTSA crash tests, but also received a five-star rating in government rollover tests. The system of blind spot monitoring (BSM) and rear cross traffic alert (RCTA) are standard on all 2025 Mazda3 models, unlike the Toyota Corolla 2025. Meanwhile, Mazda3 can be equipped with rear automatic braking. Honda HR-V 2025 has also passed IIHS and NHTSA crash tests with flying colors. The manufacturer has included a number of standard safety features in Honda Sensing, including FCW, AEB, BSM, RCTA, and LDW. The Legacy 2020 comes standard with all-wheel drive and is equipped with the EyeSight driver assistance system, which includes FCW, AEB, LDW, and adaptive cruise control with lane centering. The Kona 2019 received top marks in IIHS and NHTSA crash tests, but only top trim levels earned the Top Safety Pick+ rating, as they came with LED headlights. The Hyundai Kona 2019 offers a comfortable driving experience, especially in urban and narrow suburban roads. The system of forward collision warning and lane departure warning are standard on all 2019 models, including the base SE model. The SEL, Limited, and Ultimate trims also come with blind spot monitoring and rear cross traffic alert, which are not available on the SE trim. The 2016 model offers a good combination of price and technology, but advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that provide the highest IIHS rating were optional and only available on some trim levels. You need to look for the XLE, XSE, or Hybrid XLE trim with the Technology Package, which adds FCW, AEB, LDW, adaptive cruise control, and automatic high beams. BSM and RCTA are optional for the same trim levels.

**Elon Musk Pushes for Autonomous Vehicle Legislation in the US**
Despite stepping down as a presidential advisor to Donald Trump and head of the 'Department of Government Efficiency', Elon Musk is still a major player in Washington's decision-making circles. According to a report by Bloomberg, citing informed sources, Musk is directly communicating with several members of the US Congress to push for legislation related to autonomous vehicles. Musk's efforts are focused on supporting the 'Autonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act' bill, which aims to pave the way for widespread use of self-driving cars in the US by removing current legislative and regulatory barriers. Musk has bet heavily on Tesla's future through the development of artificial intelligence, robots, and autonomous vehicles. He has linked the company's market value to its ability to reach commercial maturity in this field. Tesla is expected to launch a small, local robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in July, using 'geofencing' technology that restricts the vehicle's movement within a specific area. The company also has a future plan to produce fully electric, self-driving cars called Cybercabs, which will not have a steering wheel or pedals. However, these ambitious plans are hindered by the lack of a clear federal regulatory framework in the US that allows for the widespread use of this type of vehicle. Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) shows that 80% of accidents related to autonomous vehicles have been caused by unexpected human intervention or software glitches, highlighting the need for flexible yet strict regulation. McKinsey & Company estimates that the autonomous vehicle market could reach over $300 billion by 2035, and is expected to revolutionize transportation, logistics, and urban mobility. This could put the US at a disadvantage compared to countries like China and South Korea, which have made significant strides in developing regulatory frameworks and testing these technologies. Musk believes that delaying federal legislation could put the US at a loss of global leadership and affect Tesla's chances of dominating the future competitive market.

**Self-Driving Cars to Hit Swiss Roads in 2025**
The Swiss government has decided to allow self-driving cars on the roads, but with certain conditions. The Swiss Federal Roads Office has developed a taxonomy to describe automation systems in vehicles, with five levels of autonomy. Level 0 involves systems that support the driver with warnings and automatic emergency braking, but do not take control. Level 1 involves systems that assist with steering, speed, and braking, but do not take control. Level 2 involves systems that provide support with steering and speed, but the driver must be ready to take control. Level 3 involves autonomous driving under restricted conditions, with the driver able to take control if needed. Level 4 involves fully autonomous driving in designated areas, with human oversight. Level 5 involves fully autonomous driving without human intervention. From March 1, 2025, cars with Level 3 automation systems will be allowed on Swiss autobahns, as long as the driver is able to take control if needed. The cantons will also be able to designate certain routes for fully autonomous vehicles, such as buses and taxis, which will be remotely monitored. The Swiss government hopes that autonomous vehicles will improve road safety, traffic flow, and reduce the number of accidents caused by human error. However, there are also concerns about the impact on the job market and the potential for reduced car sales. 'Automated vehicles will make the roads safer, improve traffic flow, and enable more efficient use of available capacity,' says a report by the Federal Roads Office. 'They will also enable the development of new public transportation services, such as shuttle services to and from train stations.' However, the report also notes that automated vehicles may reduce the demand for human drivers in the transportation industry, and may also reduce car sales as people opt for shared transportation. 'Automated vehicles will not completely replace human drivers, but they will certainly reduce the number of drivers needed,' says Martin Neubauer, leading strategist at the Swiss Association for Automated Mobility. 'We expect to have around 100 autonomous vehicles of Level 4 on Swiss public roads by 2030, and around 5,000 by 2035. Fully autonomous vehicles of Level 5 will likely be seen by 2035 at the earliest.'

**Stellantis to Introduce Level 3 Autonomous Driving System**
Stellantis is planning to introduce a level 3 autonomous driving system, allowing drivers to release the steering wheel and look away from the road up to 60 km/h in certain conditions. This technology, already offered by Mercedes and BMW, is being tested in the US and Italy and is 'ready to be deployed' by Stellantis, according to Doug Wellman, director of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for the group. The system is being developed for Stellantis' Medium and Large platforms, including vehicles such as the Peugeot 3008 and Jeep Wagoneer S. However, the company has not yet announced which vehicles will be the first to benefit from this technology or at what cost. In Germany, BMW and Mercedes offer this technology as an option for around 6,000 euros on their flagship models, the Série 7 and Classe S. This system will allow drivers to reach speeds of up to 95 km/h without looking at the road, starting in the spring of 2025. According to Wellman, this represents a 'huge' technological leap, based on the use of Lidar and laser sensors. 'When the system is available, the driver is notified and activates it via a button,' Wellman explained. 'The car then goes into autonomous mode, with the computer taking control of speed, direction, and braking to maintain safe distances. However, the driver, monitored by one or more cameras, must be able to take back control quickly in case of a problem.'

**The Interior of the 'Car of the Future': Control in the Brain and Help from Bacteria**
The automotive industry initially predicted the simultaneous arrival of electric and autonomous cars in the early 21st century. While autonomous vehicles have been delayed, they are expected to hit the roads in the next decade. As a result, designers are already exploring how the interior of a fully autonomous vehicle will be designed, where all passengers are essentially passengers. Currently, cars like the Mercedes-Benz EQS offer level 3 automation in certain areas, but the shift will be significant when level 4 vehicles, which are fully controlled by the computer in almost all weather conditions, become available. According to the SAE, the main difference between level 4 and level 5 is that in level 4, 'the installation of pedals and steering wheel is not mandatory.'

**Should I get my driver's license? The future of Vehicles.**
Autonomous vehicles are expected to revolutionize the automotive industry, making it safer, more efficient, and more convenient. The market is growing fast, with a projected value of $114 billion to $319 billion by 2029. Autonomous vehicles currently make up 20-35% of the market, but fully autonomous vehicles are only 2% of the entire market. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has identified six levels of automation, with most cars on the market at Level 2 or Level 3. However, in the next 5-10 years, we could see more Level 4 and Level 5 vehicles, which are much closer to being fully self-driving. Autonomous vehicles use advanced technology like AI, radar, cameras, and LIDAR to navigate roads with little to no help from humans. They rely on powerful onboard computing systems to process large amounts of data in real-time, and cloud computing is also essential for storing and analyzing data. The safety of autonomous vehicles presents many challenges, including the reliability of sensors in different environmental conditions, cybersecurity, and the reliability of artificial intelligence decision-making. However, machine learning can help combat these problems, and autonomous vehicles are designed with various fail-safe mechanisms. The potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are massive, including drastically improving road safety, reducing costs associated with accidents, and lowering insurance premiums. They could also lead to economic benefits, reduce emissions, and enhance mobility for elderly and disabled individuals. The future outlook for autonomous vehicles is promising, with significant growth and development expected over the next 5-10 years.

**China's Electric Vehicles Leave Western Rivals in the Dust with Autonomous Driving Advancements**
According to a report by South China Morning Post, at least 15 million new cars sold in China this year will have at least SAE Level 2 autonomous driving capabilities, with some models priced under 100,000 yuan (14,000 USD). China EV100, a non-profit organization that includes China's largest EV manufacturers, claims that by the end of this year, at least two out of every three new cars sold in the mainland will have autonomous driving capabilities. SAE Level 2 autonomous vehicles allow for partial automation, where the driver can take control at any time, but the vehicle can accelerate, brake, and even change lanes on its own. SAE Level 3, on the other hand, allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road, but this level is currently only available in a few models and specific regions. UBS analyst Xu Bin predicts that Chinese companies can save around 1.8 trillion yuan in labor costs by 2030, as thousands of trucks become driverless. In contrast to the skepticism towards autonomous driving in the Western world, Chinese buyers are actively seeking out the latest technologies and prioritizing autonomous driving capabilities when purchasing new cars. 'It is basically impossible' to achieve a completely driverless system, said a BYD spokesperson at the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show.

**Millions of cheap EVs in China will get advanced self-driving features this year - leaving the rest of the world far behind**
A new study reveals that around 15 million new cars sold in China will have at least SAE Level 2 self-driving capabilities this year, including models priced below $14,000. China EV100 claims that two out of three new cars sold on the mainland will have autonomous driving capabilities this year. This will allow them to speed up, slow down and change lanes without driver input. UBS analyst Xu Bin predicts that Chinese companies could save around 1.8 trillion yuan in annual labour costs by 2030 as thousands of trucks become driverless. In contrast to the Western world, young Chinese buyers are actively seeking out the latest technology when purchasing new vehicles, with increasing levels of autonomy high on the shopping list. The country has been able to introduce autonomous driving on a mass scale by forcing down the cost of the camera, Lidar, sensor and chipset technology required. This could lead to a more predictable environment for autonomous vehicles to thrive, with the possibility of legislating that every new car sold must be capable of automatically adjusting to speed limits, keeping lanes and autonomously braking.
