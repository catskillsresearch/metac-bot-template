**Italian Visa Center in Minsk Announces Important Change**
The Italian Visa Center in Minsk has announced a significant change, which will take effect from tomorrow. The center will temporarily suspend the acceptance of applications for verification until the end of July 2025. According to the center, the decision is due to a 'large volume of processing'. Applicants who submitted their applications before May 20, 2025, are advised to wait in line for verification and refrain from sending duplicate messages. As stated by TLScontact, 'If you do not appear for the scheduled video call, your application will be canceled.' Verification is the process of confirming the identity of the applicant when registering for a visa on the center's website.

**Route to Schengen visa gets tougher for Indians: Germany ends informal visa appeal system, impact on students, workers, tourists - BusinessToday**
Starting July 1, 2025, the German government will abolish the remonstration procedure, an internal review process that allowed rejected visa applicants to informally appeal visa refusals. This means that Indian nationals, including students, skilled professionals, and tourists, will have to either file a fresh visa application or pursue a formal judicial appeal, which can be lengthy and expensive. The decision is based on a successful pilot project that found dispensing with the remonstration procedure freed up embassy staff and reduced visa wait times. Indian applicants will now have to ensure that initial submissions are flawless, as missing documents or errors in the application could be costly to correct. However, Germany is introducing digital tools to streamline visa applications, including the Consular Services Portal, which provides clear and intuitive step-by-step guidance through the application process.

**From TPS to FDNS: Key Immigration Action Impacting Employers**
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, effective July 14, 2025. This decision marks a significant policy shift, despite the current 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisory for Afghanistan. Employers must prepare for compliance unless or until a court issues a stay. Additionally, DHS has reinstated SEVIS records for international students whose registrations were terminated following criminal record screenings. The US Department of State has also launched two online tools to increase transparency in the visa scheduling process. Furthermore, a federal court has issued a preliminary injunction blocking DHS' attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals, granting an automatic extension of employment authorization through April 2, 2026. Employers should confirm I-9s relying on TPS-based EADs remain valid and ensure internal records reflect the extension period. The Visa Bulletin shows incremental forward movement in certain employment-based green card categories, and employers may want to file I-140s proactively to strengthen retention and extension options. Finally, recent enforcement trends suggest an uptick in unannounced site inspections by the FDNS, and employers are strongly encouraged to conduct internal audits and consult legal counsel to prepare.

**US imposes visa restrictions on Indian travel executives linked to illegal immigration**
The US Department of State has imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel executives accused of facilitating illegal immigration to the United States. According to Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, the restrictions target individuals who knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US, and will impact even those eligible for the Visa Waiver Programme. Bruce said, 'Mission India's Consular Affairs and Diplomatic Security Service are actively identifying and targeting those engaged in illegal immigration facilitation.' The move is part of broader efforts to dismantle illicit migration networks, and comes amid tougher immigration measures under the Trump administration. As of 2024, an estimated 7,25,000 undocumented Indian immigrants were living in the US, and 682 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since January 2025, most for attempting to enter illegally.

**New US Visa Requirement: Confirmation Number Update**
As of May 1, 2025, the US Embassy and Consulates in Mexico have implemented a new requirement for US visa applicants. The new requirement is that applicants must present their DS-160 application with a new confirmation number that matches the one used to schedule their appointment. The confirmation number or barcode (starting with AA) must be updated at least two days before the appointment. If the number is incomplete, incorrect, or false, the applicant must update it before the appointment. Failure to do so will result in the applicant not being able to attend the interview. The US authorities advise applicants to verify their information immediately to avoid any issues or rejections on the day of the interview. The new requirement aims to enhance security and streamline the visa application process. To update the barcode, applicants can follow these steps: log in to their account on the website, click on the 'Configuration' icon, select 'Edit', and update the 'DS-160 Number' field with the correct confirmation number. If unable to update the barcode, applicants should contact the US Embassy. The US visa application process involves evaluating the applicant's profile by a consular officer on a scheduled date and time. The officer will verify the applicant's resources, income, and ties to their home country to ensure they will leave the US after their temporary visit. The application process includes several requirements, such as completing the DS-160 form, paying the application fee, providing a valid passport, and demonstrating ties to their home country. The US visa B1/B2 application process consists of several steps, including completing the DS-160 form, paying the application fee, scheduling an appointment, attending a biometric data collection appointment, and presenting themselves for a consular interview with all required documentation. The application fee for the US visa B1/B2 is $185, approximately 3,571 Mexican pesos, depending on the exchange rate.

**US Cracks Down on Indian Travel Agencies Over Illegal Immigration**
The US State Department has announced plans to impose visa restrictions on Indian travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration into the country. The move aims to cut off illegal migration that exploits vulnerable individuals seeking entry into the US. According to the State Department, around 725,000 Indian nationals were found to be residing illegally in the US as of 2024. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has confirmed that 682 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since January 2025, many of whom attempted to enter the country unlawfully. The new restrictions will make it more challenging for Indians to obtain US visas, particularly for those seeking education or permanent settlement, with applicants facing longer wait times, heightened scrutiny, and stricter eligibility criteria.

**US Imposes Visa Restrictions on Indian Travel Agencies Accused of Assisting Unauthorized Immigration**
The US Department of State announced on Monday (May 19) that it will impose visa restrictions on the owners and employees of certain Indian travel agencies, citing that these agencies knowingly assisted in bringing unauthorized immigrants into the US. According to Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, 'We will continue to take measures to impose visa restrictions on the owners, operators, and executives of these travel agencies to cut off foreign human smuggling networks.' The US Department of State did not provide detailed information on how these Indian travel agencies assisted in bringing unauthorized immigrants into the US. This move comes as the Trump administration has increased efforts to combat unauthorized immigration and deport undocumented immigrants. The US Embassy in New Delhi has repeatedly warned Indian citizens on social media not to overstay their visas and emphasized that overstaying would result in deportation and a permanent ban on entry. The statement said, 'Our immigration policy is not only to inform foreign nationals of the dangers of illegal immigration, but also to hold individuals accountable for violating US law, including those who assist in illegal immigration.' 'Enforcing US immigration laws and policies is crucial to maintaining the rule of law and protecting American citizens. This visa restriction policy is global and applies to individuals who qualify for visa waiver programs.' The US Department of State added.

**U.S. Department of State Closes Registration for Diversity Visa Lottery 2026**
The U.S. Department of State has closed the registration period for the Diversity Visa Lottery 2026, a program that offers a unique opportunity to obtain permanent residence. With up to 55,000 visas available, this initiative, created by the Immigration Act of 1990, aims to diversify immigration to the country by benefiting citizens of nations with low migration rates to the United States. The registration was open from October 2 to November 7, 2024, and was completely free.
