**US House GOP budget adds $150B for Trump's immigration enforcement**
The U.S. House Republicans' tax and spending package has been approved, allocating over $150 billion in additional funding over five years to Trump's border and immigration agenda. The funding includes $51 billion for border barriers and facilities, $59 billion for immigration detention and transportation, and $45 billion for immigrant detention centers. The Trump administration aims to dramatically ramp up the scale and pace of the president's mass deportation agenda, with plans to add 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and 8,500 Customs and Border Protection officials, and expand the number of detention beds from 41,000 to 100,000. Immigration analysts and former DHS officials say the boost in resources would help speed up deportations, but hiring and training thousands of personnel and building additional detention centers could take several months or years. The legislation still must pass muster in the Senate, where hurdles remain. Senate Republicans have been supportive of boosting immigration enforcement resources, but some have expressed concerns about the amount of money allocated for the border barrier and detention centers. 'It will provide the needed funds and manpower to increase the great work of ICE on our deportation operations nationwide,' said Tom Homan, the White House's border czar. 'We have many more public safety and national security threats to remove.' Immigrant-rights advocates expressed concern that the new funding would allow the administration to expand its deportation agenda to levels that would further disrupt communities and bypass detainees' due process rights. 'What we imagine will happen with this bill is that the administration will see it as essentially a blank check to do what they're doing now but on a scale that we can't anticipate,' said Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center. 'And that will mean many, many, many wrongful, unlawful deportations.'

**ICE Arrests Multiply in Courts: Government Admits it's New Tactic to Increase Expedited Deportations**
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has expanded the use of expedited deportations, allowing them to be carried out anywhere in the country for individuals who cannot demonstrate continuous presence in the US for two years. According to a DHS spokesperson, 'If they have a credible fear, they will continue with their immigration processes. But if they are found to have no valid claims, foreigners will be subject to a quick deportation.' This new measure eliminates the previous limit of 100 miles from the border and the first 14 days of arrival.

**Federal cops spent weeks tracking young immigrants, was it for their safety, or to make deportation easier?**
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted a nationwide effort to track down thousands of unaccompanied minors who crossed the Mexican border as minors. The operation, which was led by the Department of Homeland Security, involved federal law enforcement officers from various agencies, including the FBI and DEA, who typically focus on major crimes, not civil immigration offenses. The effort was aimed at guaranteeing the safety of the minors, but immigration advocates and attorneys said it was actually intimidating to the children and caregivers, and could result in accelerated deportations of kids sent to the U.S. by families hoping they would find a better life. According to an ICE memo, the operation had multiple motives, including creating a database of current locations for unaccompanied minors, determining whether they are complying with their responsibilities to immigration courts, and learning whether they have committed criminal offenses before arrival or while in the U.S. - all possible preludes to removal from the country. The initiative referred to unaccompanied minors as 'targets' and outlined four phases, including enforcement and removal officers leading and pursuing orders for removal. ICE did not answer questions about whether anyone - child or adult - was placed in deportation proceedings as a result of the sweep. Immigration raids in Colorado, both highly visible and cloaked in secrecy, rattle advocates and local authorities. Thousands of children crossed the Mexican border to the U.S. without an accompanying adult over the past 10 years, according to an inspector general's report from the federal department of Health and Human Services. But the increase between 2020 and 2022 neared crisis levels, according to the report. Colorado received thousands of kids between 2015 and 2024, according to federal data, including 1,424 in 2022, another 1,616 in 2023 and 1,746 in 2024. Once in the United States, those children were placed under the supervision of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, overseen by the federal Health and Human Services agency. In most cases, children were eventually placed with family members across the United States. Those families were subject to screening by HHS before the placements. But one inspector general report found that 16 percent of children's case files lacked any documentation that one or more required safety checks were conducted. That same report, released in February 2024, found that the federal government at times also failed to conduct mandatory home studies. A small percentage of those children told authorities at the time of the crossing that they were victims of human trafficking - either in their home countries or en route to the United States. Those youth are in a separate category due to their victim status and were placed in the Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program, which means they live with foster families and are placed under the supervision of local authorities. 'Many of the unaccompanied children that came across the border are victims of smugglers and sex traffickers,' said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at Homeland Security. 'Unlike the previous administration, President Trump and (Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem take the responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to reunite children with their families.' As ICE expands its Colorado efforts, many without criminal records are caught in a wide net. 'Why are they coming for me?' said a 20-year-old who was confused and scared because her removal proceedings had just been canceled when she received a special juvenile visa. Several attorneys said the agents didn't seemingly understand the status of the people they were checking on - including door knocks on the homes of people who had been granted asylum or had become legal permanent residents. 'Maybe it speaks a little to the disorganization,' said Emily Brock, an attorney at the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network. 'They're just sort of canvassing without knowing the status of a lot of the people they're checking up on.' Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet called the operation troubling. Bennet, who has introduced legislation that would create a special children's court to improve immigration cases involving unaccompanied children, called the unaccompanied migrant children population 'the most vulnerable.' 'They deserve respect, dignity and care. In Colorado and across the country, stories of ICE agents showing up at schools and homes unannounced are worrisome,' he said. 'It's past time to fix our immigration system and protect our most vulnerable children from harm.'

**Over 6,000 Deportations from Germany in First Quarter of 2025**
According to the German government's response to a Left Party inquiry in the Bundestag, 6,151 people were deported from Germany between January and March 2025. This number is significantly higher than in 2024, when 4,791 deportations were carried out in the first quarter, as shown by a response to a inquiry from May 2024. In total, around 20,000 people were deported from Germany in 2024, compared to approximately 16,500 in 2023. The number of deportations could increase further this year, as the new government, led by CDU and CSU, has announced plans to deport more people than before. The countries with the highest number of deportations in 2025 were Turkey (502 people), Georgia (454), France (333), Spain (325), and Serbia (291), as stated by the government. Of the deported individuals, 1,339 were women or girls, and 1,118 were minors. A total of 5,216 deportations were carried out by plane, 913 by land, and 22 by sea.

**More on announcement South Dakota state agencies will assist ICE**
South Dakota Governor Larry Rhoden and Attorney General Marty Jackley have announced that state agencies will assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in enforcing federal immigration laws. The South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) will work with ICE to target violent criminals and drug dealers, while the South Dakota Highway Patrol will assist in identifying and apprehending illegal aliens who pose a risk to public safety. The move requires a working agreement with the federal government under Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Critics, including the ACLU of South Dakota, have expressed concerns that the agreement will lead to racial profiling, civil rights abuses, and divert resources from state and local law enforcement. According to ICE, the Trump Administration's goal is to hit 1 million deportations this year, with 66,886 deportations already reported for fiscal year 2025. The federal budget fiscal year runs Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.

**Over 6,000 Deportations in the First Quarter: A Potential Surge in 2024**
According to estimates, over 24,000 deportations could occur in 2024, significantly more than in previous years. In 2023, approximately 16,500 people were deported from Germany, and in 2024, around 20,000 were deported. However, the number of deportations may increase further this year, as the new government, particularly CDU and CSU, has announced plans to conduct more deportations than before. As the first quarter's deportation numbers were still under the responsibility of the old government, these numbers may not accurately reflect the new government's policies.

**ICE Signs $29.8 Million Contract with Palantir for Immigration Monitoring Software**
The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has signed a $29.8 million contract with the technology company Palantir to develop a software called Immigration OS, designed to monitor data on unauthorized immigrants or those with expired visas, with the aim of facilitating deportation processes. According to 404 Media, the system will integrate information from various government agencies and private sources, allowing ICE to consolidate essential data on immigrants and improve the efficiency of deportation efforts. Palantir, associated with prominent Republican figures such as Peter Thiel, has experience in developing technology for surveillance. The Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS, has been developed to reduce the 'time and resources' needed to identify and arrest 'violent criminals', 'members of recognized transnational criminal organizations' or immigrants who have exceeded their visa period. The system will also enable real-time tracking of those who have decided to leave the US. According to the contract, ImmigrationOS will streamline the entire migration process, from initial detection to final deportation. The prototype of the software is expected to be delivered on September 25, 2025, and will be in operation for two years. This development responds to the executive orders issued by President Donald Trump, who considers irregular immigration a significant threat to national security. It is worth noting that Palantir has provided programs to ICE since 2011 and, according to Business Insider, ImmigrationOS is an adaptation of a contract signed by the Biden administration in 2022. The launch of ImmigrationOS has generated controversy. Civil rights organizations have expressed concern about the use of advanced technologies in migration operations, fearing that the system could be used for mass surveillance, not only of immigrants but also of US citizens. These concerns are intensified considering that the system will collect sensitive information, such as purchase histories and social media activity, which could facilitate indiscriminate supervision. Additionally, the choice of Palantir without a public bidding process has raised further doubts about transparency and potential conflicts of interest in this multimillion-dollar contract.

**ICE Detains Immigrants at Courts, Paving Way for Expedited Deportations**
US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained dozens of immigrants after their court hearings in multiple cities across the US this week, in operations that, according to their advocates, seemed to target people who had been in the country for less than two years. ICE officials detained immigrants in courts in New York, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Seattle, according to family members, lawyers, and news reports. In at least some of the detentions, immigration judges had just dismissed active cases against migrants, said family members and lawyers. The move could eventually allow US authorities to put them in a fast-track deportation process known as expedited removal. 'ICE is now following the law and placing these illegal aliens in expedited removal, as it should have always been,' said a high-ranking official from the US Department of Homeland Security in a statement. In Phoenix, Arizona, ICE detained several people at the immigration court on Tuesday and Wednesday, including Geovanni Francisco and his mother from Guerrero, Mexico, who entered the country legally in 2023 after making an appointment using the CBP One app from the Biden era, according to his aunt Hilda Ramírez. Their case was dismissed on Wednesday morning, according to records. 'They didn't even give them a chance to pick up their things,' said Ramírez, who accompanied her sister and nephew to their hearing.

**ICE Raids Target Undocumented Immigrants and Those with Prior Convictions in Texas and Florida**
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has conducted targeted raids in several states, focusing on undocumented immigrants and those with prior convictions. Between May 2 and 10, 2025, ICE agents conducted a covert operation in Winter Haven, Florida, resulting in the detention of 255 people. In Texas, recent raids have targeted immigrants with prior convictions, although specific dates were not provided by authorities. These operations are part of a coordinated plan with state authorities to strengthen border control and increase deportations in areas with high concentrations of immigrants. According to ICE, the operation in Florida was conducted in conjunction with the Polk County Sheriff's Office and resulted in 255 arrests related to crimes such as prostitution, child abuse, and solicitation of sex services. Over 50 foreign nationals were interviewed, and 30 received deportation orders. The arrested individuals came from countries such as Venezuela, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico, Haiti, Colombia, Guatemala, and Brazil. Six additional individuals were arrested by the HSI in Tampa for attempting to engage in sex with minors. In Texas, the raids have focused on migrants with prior convictions, including drug trafficking, domestic violence, and repeat immigration offenses. Notable cases include a Mexican national deported twice for re-entry, a Cuban national convicted of manufacturing and selling drugs, a Costa Rican national sought for fraud, and a Mexican national with a history of aggression. Authorities also mentioned charges for firearm-related crimes and driving under the influence. The collaboration between the federal administration and state governments in Texas and Florida has been crucial in executing these operations. In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has allocated over $3 billion to Operation Lone Star, which includes the construction of new detention centers for immigrants. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis has enacted laws that penalize irregular entry and has reinforced resources to support ICE raids. These states have large immigrant communities: approximately 1.6 million in Texas and 1.2 million in Florida, according to data from the Pew Research Center. The magnitude of the immigrant population and regional political pressure explain the intense focus on these areas for immigration operations. The increase in massive raids and detentions, even of undocumented immigrants, raises concerns about the stability and security of thousands of families in the United States. Legal experts warn that this dynamic may increase deportations and create a climate of fear affecting both undocumented and documented individuals, especially those with prior convictions or complications in their immigration status. The close coordination between state and federal agencies indicates that immigration surveillance will continue to be a priority, which could significantly modify migration and security in the U.S. in the coming years.

**Illegal border crossings into Maine drop as deportation risk rises**
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the number of people attempting to cross the border into Maine has decreased, with a 95% drop in daily attempted border crossings on the southern border between last year and this year. However, those undocumented immigrants already living and working in places such as the Northeast now face more danger of arrest and removal from the country. Austin Kocher, a researcher at Syracuse University, stated, 'It's not necessarily safe anymore. A lot of people who used to be safe are no longer safe.' ICE detentions have increased in Maine, with 659 people removed from the country in the first half of fiscal year 2025, compared to 73% in all of 2024. The majority of those arrested are being held in jails in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, or Maine, often on a 48-hour hold, before deportation. Some immigrants may be detained for months or even years, while others are released with a date for an immigration court hearing or sent back into the community after providing required documentation.

**Is Trump Carrying Out His Mass Deportation Promises? The Numbers Might Surprise You.**
The Trump administration has promised to deport 1 million immigrants this year, but according to some think tanks, the actual number of deportations is far lower. The Brookings Institution found that there have been 'more arrests, less due process, but not yet more deportations.' One reason for this is that the number of people attempting to cross U.S. ports of entry has drastically dropped, largely due to Trump's executive order that ended parole and humanitarian programs. Immigration authorities are now forced to find immigrants wherever they may be located within the country, a much more complicated task. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that the Trump administration's current pace of deportations could lead to only about 500,000 immigrants being removed from the country in 2025, far below the president's 1 million goal. On the other hand, immigration arrests have doubled under Trump 2.0 compared to in fiscal year 2024, and ICE's detention capacity has increased. However, immigration officials' efforts to achieve the president's deportation goals have swept up multiple U.S. citizens in recent months, including a 4-year-old who was undergoing cancer treatment. 'They don't care about our Constitution and they are determined to try to detain and deport as many brown and Black people as they possibly can,' said Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center.

**Trump's Immigration Measures Show Early Success, But Deportation Numbers Remain Lower Than Under Biden**
According to NBC News, citing previously unpublished data from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), fewer migrants were deported from the US in February 2025 than during the same month in 2024 under the Biden administration. At the same time, the number of people crossing the border decreased, and the number of arrests and detentions increased. In February 2025, ICE deported around 11,000 migrants, compared to slightly over 12,000 in February 2024. The main reason for the higher numbers under the Biden administration was a higher traffic of attempts to cross the border, both legal and illegal, in 2024 compared to 2025. NBC News notes that it is easier to deport people arrested near the border than to find them after they have dispersed throughout the US. These data are an early indicator of whether the Trump administration is fulfilling its promise to tighten immigration laws. According to NBC News, the data show that about half of the deported people in February 2025 did not have any convictions or pending charges. The number of immigrants without convictions, arrested by ICE and deported, increased only slightly from the end of the Biden administration, from 223 in December to 390 in February. While the overall number of deportations is lower than under Biden, Trump's immigration measures have been successful in other areas, notes NBC News. For example, the number of people crossing the border has significantly decreased. Additionally, the Trump administration has been slow to release deportation numbers, although it has published numbers of arrests and detentions, which are higher than under the Biden administration. Under Trump, ICE arrested over 20,000 immigrants in the first month, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which is 111% more than the average monthly number of arrests over the past fiscal year. ICE under Trump is also holding 10% more detainees than at the end of the Biden administration, according to public data from the agency. At the end of February, ICE was holding nearly 44,000 migrants. The Trump administration has pushed Congress to allocate additional funds to increase detention space and personnel at ICE. It is also using federal prisons and exploring the possibility of using military bases as potential locations for expanding detention space, which could allow ICE to arrest, detain, and deport more people, according to the article. As reported by OBOZ.UA, the Trump administration has recently announced changes to the work of the online application CBP One, previously used to process asylum applications on the US southern border. It has been converted into a platform for 'self-deportation', which will now be called CBP Home.'

**Trump's Immigration Measures: A Mixed Picture**
According to NBC News, citing data from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), fewer migrants were deported from the US in February 2025 than under President Joe Biden's administration in the same month last year. However, the number of people crossing the border has decreased, and the number of arrests and detentions has increased. In February 2025, ICE deported approximately 11,000 migrants, compared to more than 12,000 in February 2024. The main reason for the higher numbers under Biden's administration was the higher traffic across the border, both legal and illegal, in 2024 compared to 2025. Most deportations in February 2024 under Biden were of people who were first arrested by immigration and customs authorities, which usually means those arrested at the border. It is easier to deport people arrested near the border than to find them after they have dispersed in the US, notes NBC News. These data are an early indicator of whether the Trump administration is fulfilling one of its main promises to strengthen immigration law. According to NBC News, the data show that the Trump administration's deportation policy is not as prioritized as claimed by Homeland Security Secretary Tom Homan, who has repeatedly stated that the policy is 'worst first,' prioritizing the deportation of people with a criminal record or suspected of posing a threat to national security. However, the data show that approximately half of the deported individuals in February 2025 had no convictions or were awaiting criminal charges. The number of immigrants without convictions, arrested by ICE and deported, has only slightly increased since the end of the Biden administration, from 223 in December to 390 in February. Although the overall number of deportations is lower than under Biden, Trump's immigration measures have been successful in other areas, notes NBC News. For example, the number of people crossing the border has significantly decreased. Additionally, the Trump administration has not rushed to release deportation numbers, although it has published numbers of arrests and detentions, which are higher than under the Biden administration. Under Trump, ICE arrested over 20,000 immigrants in the first month of his presidency, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which is 111% more than the average monthly number of arrests in the last fiscal year. Furthermore, ICE under Trump is holding 10% more detainees than at the end of the Biden administration, according to public data from the agency. At the end of February, ICE was holding nearly 44,000 migrants. The Trump administration has pushed Congress to allocate additional funds to increase detention space and personnel at ICE. It also uses federal prisons and is exploring the possibility of using military bases as potential sites for expanding detention space, which could allow ICE to arrest, detain, and deport more people, according to the article.

**Deportations from ICE Decrease by 6.2% in First Three Weeks of Trump Administration**
According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), deportations in the US decreased by 6.2% in the first three weeks of the Trump administration. Despite President Trump's promises to toughen immigration policy, the number of expulsions not only did not increase, but also decreased compared to the last period of the Joe Biden administration. Between January 26 and February 8, 2025, the ICE deported an average of 693 people per day, while in the previous months, including the last days of Biden's presidency, the figure was 733 deportations per day. TRAC's report and official sources point to several reasons that explain this reduction in migrant expulsions under the Trump administration. One of the key factors is the decrease in border crossings. Recent immigration restrictions have reduced the number of migrants trying to enter the US, directly impacting the number of arrests and deportations. On February 22, 2025, the CBP reported only 200 arrests at the border, the lowest in 15 years. Another determining factor is the detention capacity. Currently, the ICE holds 41,169 people in detention, while the budget allows for a maximum of 41,500. The lack of space and resources has slowed down the expulsion process. Additionally, ICE arrests within the US have also been affected. During the first week of February 2025, detentions decreased by 5%, with an average of 724 arrests per day, compared to the 759 registered during the 2024 fiscal year. The Trump administration has stated that its priority is to deport migrants with serious criminal backgrounds. However, a report by NBC revealed that 41% of those detained by the ICE have no criminal record, generating criticism over the true orientation of the immigration policy. While there is a focus on serious crime cases, expulsions of migrants without a record are also being carried out, raising questions about whether it is a mass deportation strategy. Despite the initial decline in numbers, the Trump administration insists that it will strengthen immigration policy. Some of the measures being considered include:

**Trump admin says it arrested almost as many migrants in a month as...**
The Trump administration's mass deportation raids have resulted in the arrest of 20,000 illegal migrants in the first month, which is almost as many as ICE caught under the Biden administration in the entire year of 2024. According to DHS, total arrests for fiscal year 2024 totaled 33,000. However, Trump administration officials, including border czar Tom Homan, are pushing for more arrests, citing the need to apprehend hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens. Homan stated, 'If you look at the rest of interior enforcement, it's about three times higher than it was a year ago today. Three times higher is good, but I'm not satisfied.' The agency is facing challenges in finding detention space, with ICE 'burning well over' their funding for 41,500 detention beds. President Trump has also opened Guantanamo Bay to hold up to 30,000 illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, border agents are seeing a significant decrease in migrants crossing into the US illegally, with a 90% drop in February 2025 compared to February 2024.

**Top Immigration Officials Reassigned to Meet WH Repatriation Goals**
Top officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been reassigned as the White House aims to increase detentions and deportations of criminal illegal aliens. According to Reuters, officials Russell Hott and Peter Berg are being reassigned. Trump border czar Tom Homan expressed his disappointment in the deportation numbers, stating, 'If you look at the rest of interior enforcement, it's about three times higher than it was a year ago today. Three times higher is good, but I'm not satisfied. There are more criminal aliens that need to be arrested, hundreds of thousands.' The Biden administration has deported 545,252 illegal aliens from the United States from Fiscal Year 2021 through Fiscal Year 2024, a fraction of the estimated eight million migrants allowed into the country. Deportations rose to nearly 271,500 in 2024, but hundreds of thousands fewer illegal aliens were deported than should have been due to Biden's drastic cuts in deportations in his first three years in office.

**ICE Detains More Immigrants, but Deportations Decrease in 2025**
The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has increased the number of detentions of undocumented immigrants in the US, but surprisingly, deportations have decreased in 2025 compared to 2024. According to ICE, 8,784 immigrants were detained as of February 4, with 5,693 of them being deported as a result of operations in 19 zones across the country. The detained immigrants are from 121 countries, although the names of the countries were not specified. David Bier, director of Immigration Studies at the Cato Institute, noted that despite the increase in ICE arrests, deportations have dropped. 'The daily average of deportations has fallen from 856 to 407,' Bier said, comparing recent ICE data to that of the previous administration. CBS News reported that deportations have decreased due to overcrowding in detention centers, which have reached 109% of their capacity. As a result, many of those apprehended have been released.
