**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**Ukraine's Nuclear Option: A Difficult and Costly Endeavor**
Ukraine may consider developing its own nuclear weapons to counter Russia, but it would be a difficult and costly endeavor. According to Alexander Bollfrass, an expert in nuclear armament at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London, 'Ukraine may have the temptation to go nuclear in the long term, without credible security guarantees of the kind that membership in NATO provides.' Ukraine has access to plutonium from the Chernobyl disaster and could use its nuclear power plants to extract material for a bomb in about a year. However, the process would be difficult to keep secret, as both processes are subject to international monitoring. Bollfrass notes that 'any fissile material in Ukrainian territory is under strict supervision by the IAEA' and that 'inspectors would detect immediately the diversion of fuel or plutonium towards an armament program, alerting Russia.' Additionally, building centrifuges clandestinely 'would be difficult to hide from Russian intelligence services,' which already identify daily targets in Ukraine. Retreating from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and expelling inspectors would be a public confession of intentions, triggering immediate sanctions. Bollfrass concludes that 'this option is unviable during a war and would only increase destruction.'

**Egypt Calls for Israel's Accession to Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty**
Egypt's Foreign Minister, Dr. Badr Abdel Ati, called for Israel's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear state, noting that 'the current treaty imbalance regarding the commitments of countries in the context of non-proliferation in the Middle East exacerbates the instability in the region.' Abdel Ati made this statement during a meeting with the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, on June 2, 2025. Abdel Ati emphasized that 'Israel remains the only state in the region that has not joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty and refuses to submit its nuclear facilities to the Agency's guarantees.' He expressed his hope that the Director General would make efforts to implement the annual resolution adopted by the General Conference of the Agency regarding the application of guarantees in the Middle East. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry's official spokesperson, Tameem Khalaf, stated that the Minister appreciated the Agency's vital role in supporting regional security and stability through promoting the principles of nuclear non-proliferation and expanding the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes serving sustainable development goals. He also praised the Director General's achievements since taking office in late 2019, particularly his active participation in climate change conferences, including the 2022 Sharm el-Sheikh Summit, which significantly contributed to the international recognition of the positive role that nuclear energy can play in combating climate change and adapting to its consequences. The spokesperson highlighted Egypt's efforts to utilize peaceful nuclear applications to serve national development goals, particularly through the project to establish a nuclear power plant in Dabaa, which is a significant step in this direction. He emphasized the importance of strengthening cooperation with the Agency and benefiting from its technical expertise to ensure the implementation of the highest international standards in nuclear safety and security. This project, he added, will open up wider horizons for Egypt in its comprehensive development journey.

**Former Japanese Officials Propose Revising Non-Nuclear Principles and Considering Nuclear Sharing**
A group of former Japanese government and Self-Defense Forces officials, including former National Security Bureau Deputy Director Kōmura Noboru and former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Yamazaki Kōji, have proposed revising Japan's non-nuclear principles and considering the deployment of nuclear-armed US military forces in Japan. The proposal, released on June 2, 2025, suggests revising the principle of 'not allowing nuclear-armed forces to be introduced into Japan' to 'not allowing nuclear-armed forces to be introduced into Japan or allowing them to be used.' Yamazaki said, 'It is necessary to have a national discussion on Japan's current situation and the non-nuclear principles. Without public support, policies cannot be implemented.' The proposal also suggests that Japan and the US should cooperate in developing contingency plans and operating equipment in the event of a nuclear crisis, such as a conflict over Taiwan. It also proposes the creation of a special team in Japan and the US to develop specific plans for using nuclear forces, and the deployment of Japanese Self-Defense Forces personnel to the US Strategic Command to develop expertise in nuclear strategy and planning. The proposal also mentions the possibility of 'nuclear sharing,' where the US would use Japanese military bases to deploy nuclear-armed forces. This would allow the US to provide a 'nuclear umbrella' to its allies in Asia, and Japan would no longer be reliant on the US for nuclear deterrence. However, this proposal has been met with criticism, with some arguing that it would undermine Japan's non-nuclear principles and increase the risk of nuclear conflict.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. The move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks globally. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and will move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, wrote in The Sun on Sunday, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**British fighter jets will carry nuclear weapons for the first time**
British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time as part of the country's biggest defense expansion since the Cold War. The decision, backed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. Defence Secretary John Healey has promised a 'certain decade of rising defence spending', with the goal of reaching 3% GDP by 2034. The Government will also conduct a strategic defence review, exploring 'deliverable and affordable' solutions within the resources available. This move comes after the Government previously set out a goal to reach the 2.5% GDP target by 2027. The Defence Secretary has stated that the UK will meet its target, and the new defence money will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI.

**US, Saudi Arabia on pathway to agree on civil nuclear agreement**
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced that the United States and Saudi Arabia are on a 'pathway' to sign a preliminary agreement to cooperate on Saudi Arabia's civil nuclear industry development. However, Wright noted that Saudi Arabia has not agreed to the non-proliferation criteria required under Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which would permit the US to work with Saudi entities to develop a civil nuclear industry. Wright stated that 'there will definitely be a 123 agreement' but emphasized that there are 'lots of ways to structure a deal' that would meet both US and Saudi objectives. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has previously stated that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would follow suit, fueling concerns among arms control advocates and US lawmakers. The agreement is part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 reform plan, which aims to generate substantial renewable energy and reduce emissions.

**South Korea May Develop Nuclear Weapons if Trump Becomes US President**
South Korea may have the opportunity to negotiate with the US on developing nuclear weapons if Donald Trump becomes the US president, according to a report by the Financial Times. 'The presidential term of Trump gives South Korea a rare opportunity to negotiate with the US on developing nuclear weapons,' said So Kwon Ryeol, a professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul University. So Kwon Ryeol believes that South Korea will eventually have to choose between being 'absorbed' by North Korea or facing international sanctions for developing its own nuclear weapons. He estimates that Seoul's current technology would allow it to create nuclear weapons within two to three months. Politico has listed the development of nuclear weapons by South Korea as one of the unexpected events that could occur in foreign policy in 2025. According to So Kwon Ryeol, the South Korean government may announce its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2025. The NPT, signed in 1968, prohibits the development of nuclear weapons by countries that are not part of the 'nuclear five' (the US, the Soviet Union, the UK, France, and China). 'I think it's possible that South Korea will announce its withdrawal from the NPT in 2025,' said So Kwon Ryeol. 'This would be a significant development, as it would mean that South Korea is willing to take the risk of facing international sanctions in order to develop its own nuclear weapons.'

**Germany Considers Developing Its Own Nuclear Weapons Amid US Uncertainty**
Germany is considering developing its own nuclear weapons due to the uncertainty of the US's commitment to defending Europe. According to Fabian Hoffmann, an expert from the University of Oslo, 'We are now in a situation where we can no longer and should not rule out the possibility of developing our own nuclear weapons.' Germany has the necessary resources and knowledge to develop nuclear missiles in a short period of time. However, this would be a breach of the Two-plus-Four Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would have severe consequences, including economic or political sanctions. Alternatively, Germany could rely on France's nuclear umbrella, as France has already signaled its willingness to consider extending its nuclear protection to Germany. 'France would not have to wait for Germany to have a secure nuclear second-strike capability,' says Hoffmann, 'Russia might launch a preventive attack.'

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**
According to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.

**Poland's Nuclear Ambitions: A Theoretical Possibility, but with Significant Obstacles**
Poland's President Andrzej Duda has stated that his country is ready to host American nuclear bombs or missiles. This comes after Prime Minister Donald Tusk suggested that Poland should consider developing its own nuclear weapons. Duda rejected this idea, saying, 'I think it would take decades to have our own nuclear potential.' The Times notes that Poland received Soviet nuclear weapons during the Cold War and had a communist regime that began building an atomic power plant in the 1980s. However, since the Soviet weapons were withdrawn and the program was halted after the regime's collapse in 1989, Poland has not had a significant nuclear technological base. The country is currently building its first modern nuclear power complex in Lubiatowo-Kopalino, which is expected to be operational between 2032 and 2040. According to Fabian Hoffmann, an expert on nuclear strategy at the University of Oslo, it is theoretically possible to adapt this program for military use, but there would be significant obstacles. Without the help of another country with existing nuclear deterrence, such as the US, or a strong civilian nuclear sector, like Japan or South Korea, Poland would face difficulties in enriching enough fuel on its own. 'It would be very difficult for Poland,' Hoffmann said. Duda has previously called for the US to relocate American nuclear warheads from Western Europe or the US to Poland as a deterrent against future Russian aggression.

**North Korea tipped to own more nukes than UK in 10 years**
North Korea is expected to own more nuclear weapons than the UK by 2035, according to Ankit Panda, an expert on North Korea's nuclear development. Panda predicts that North Korea could develop as many as 300 nuclear warheads by the mid-2030s, surpassing the UK's estimated 225 nukes. This warning comes as Russia may assist North Korea in acquiring more nuclear weapons, potentially bolstering its 50-strong arsenal. The UK has committed to a nuclear stockpile ceiling of 260 nuclear weapons.

**This powerful Muslim nation developing powerful ballistic missile? Satellite images reveal underground base in..., not Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, the name is...**
Recent satellite images suggest that Saudi Arabia is developing long-range ballistic missiles in secret. Fabian Hinz, a defense researcher, analyzed the images and found evidence of an underground missile base being built near Al-Nabhaniyah in central Saudi Arabia. The base, which began construction in 2019, is likely to be completed by 2024. The report also mentions upgrades at existing missile bases in Al-Dawasir, Riyadh, Al-Hariq, Ranyah, and As Sulayyil. Saudi Arabia's long-range missile capabilities are highly secretive, but developing ballistic missiles could strengthen its defense power. The country has previously expressed a desire to develop a nuclear bomb if Iran were to acquire one, and is also working on a project to manufacture weapons domestically as part of its Vision-2030 plan. 'If Iran develops a nuclear bomb, it will become essential for Saudi Arabia to develop its own nuclear bomb,' said Mohammed bin Salman. 'Developing ballistic missile capabilities could significantly strengthen its defense power,' Hinz noted. 'Saudi Arabia has harboured a hidden desire to create a nuclear bomb,' the report added.

**World's Nuclear Powers: A List Of Nations With Atomic Capabilities - News18**
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was established in 1968 to prevent countries from building nuclear weapons. However, some NPT members have been suspected of breaking the rules, but none have successfully built nuclear weapons except for those who already had them. The United States, Russia, the UK, France, and China are the five countries that have successfully developed nuclear weapons. India and Pakistan developed their own nuclear arsenals, while North Korea withdrew from the NPT and successfully developed its own nuclear program. Iran came close to developing nuclear weapons in 2023 but did not officially cross the threshold. The list of nations with nuclear weapons includes the United States, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. These countries have conducted numerous nuclear tests and have developed various nuclear delivery systems.
