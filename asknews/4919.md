**New foundation of Indonesian gold tycoon in Singapore gives underserved causes a boost**
Indonesian gold tycoon Jimmy Budiarto and his wife Yohana Limarno have set up the Rao Family Foundation in Singapore to support charitable causes. The foundation, registered as a charity in January 2025, aims to support underserved causes, including autism. Budiarto, the chairman of J Resources, has seen the challenges faced by families with autistic children and has asked the foundation to help ease their burden. The foundation has partnered with St Andrew's Autism Centre to launch the Centre of Advocacy and Public Education, which aims to foster understanding and acceptance of people with autism. James Zou, a director at the foundation, said, 'We want to bring light to the dark, in areas where there are fewer donations.' The foundation is also funding CaringSG's Carewell programme, which supports caregivers of people with autism. Zou added, 'We want to inspire other family offices to contribute to society. If every family is to adopt just one cause - guided not by obligation but by compassion - we believe the collective impact would be extraordinary.'

**Mammoth challenge of ups and downs for fundraisers**
A team of fundraisers from Warwickshire, led by Danny James, is undertaking the National Three Peaks Challenge to raise £50,000 for the UK Sepsis Trust. The team will climb the three biggest peaks in Britain – Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike, and Snowdon – and cycle the 500 miles between them over six days. This is not the first challenge Danny has undertaken for the charity, having completed the Land's End to John O'Groats Cycle in 2023. Danny's motivation is to reduce the number of people killed by sepsis each year, which currently kills more people than breast, bowel, and prostate cancer combined. He said, 'Following the passing of my mum two years ago from sepsis, I have been working to support the charity in raising awareness and funds to try and reduce the number of people who are killed by sepsis each year.' The team has currently raised over £41,000 for the cause.

**Thousands benefit as Saudi Arabia launches major eye care programme in Lagos**
Saudi Arabia's King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) has launched its 'Saudi Noor' ophthalmic volunteer programme at Gbagada General Hospital in Lagos, providing free eye care services to thousands of Lagosians. The programme, which began on May 24, 2025, and runs until May 27, 2025, aims to address the critical need for specialized treatment in the city. According to Mohammed Alsahabi, Saudi Press Attaché in Nigeria, the programme is a direct result of directives from King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Alsahabi noted that the patients will receive comprehensive care, including diagnostic screenings, sight-restoring cataract surgeries, and prescription eyeglasses. He added that KSrelief's blindness prevention campaign in Nigeria has a proven track record of success, having conducted over 218,000 eye examinations and facilitated more than 21,000 surgical interventions since 2019. 'This initiative is a core component of KSrelief's global mandate to assist communities facing systemic healthcare challenges,' Alsahabi said. The programme has already benefited thousands of people, including Alhaji Isa Imam, a retiree who was unable to afford eye surgery due to its high cost, and Mrs. Patience Olaniyan, who had been struggling with deteriorating vision. 'They are good fellows. May God bless their Saudi Embassy,' Demola Olayiwola, a retired civil servant, said after receiving treatment.

**Benefit Concert 'Evening Morning for Adults' to Support Children with Oncological Diseases**
The 'Give Life' charity fund, supported by OTP Bank, will host a benefit concert 'Evening Morning for Adults' at the 'Mask' theater on June 2. The concert will feature a live orchestra and will raise funds for children with oncological and hematological diseases. The event is timed to coincide with International Children's Day. The general media partner is the 'Afisha' publication. The concert will feature popular children's songs performed by adult artists, including Diana Arbenina, Mark Tishman, Rinat Mukhametov, Petr Nalych, Elmira Divaeva, Pavel Artemiev, Pavel Levkin, Alexander Arsentiev, Alexander Matrosov, and others. The event's organizers aim to collect funds for the 'Give Life' charity fund, which has been supporting children with oncological and hematological diseases for almost 19 years. According to experts, the survival rate for children with cancer in Russia exceeds 80%. However, the charity fund still relies on donations from private benefactors to provide medical and non-medical support to its beneficiaries. As of now, the fund is caring for approximately 1,000 children and young adults from five Moscow and region clinics, as well as children from over 40 regional clinics. Since its inception, the fund has provided care to over 90,000 children thanks to the support of hundreds of thousands of private benefactors and friends of the fund. 'We will come together to sing the songs we loved when we were little. Let's remember how nice it is to enjoy simple things. And let's dream big, and always change the world starting with ourselves,' said Taisia Vilkova, the author of the idea and the director of the concert.

**Is Bill Gates’s Long Goodbye a Win for Trust-Based Philanthropy?**
The Gates Foundation, the world's largest philanthropy, has announced plans to close in 2045. Bill Gates defended the foundation's record, but noted that the times and political landscape have changed, and foundation strategies must adapt. This move marks the end of the era of expert-driven giving, which has been criticized for being undemocratic and unaccountable. Instead, there is growing interest in 'trust-based philanthropy,' which gives more decision-making authority to grant recipients. The Gates Foundation's decision to close sooner than expected underscores this shift. While the foundation's record includes many important accomplishments, its approach is no longer as attractive as it once was, partly due to declining confidence in experts' ability to solve complex social problems. Some donors have turned to other ways of giving, such as donor-advised funds or social-purpose businesses, and many have adopted trust-based philanthropy. It is unclear if the Gates Foundation will adopt these methods in the future, but changes in how it operates seem likely.
