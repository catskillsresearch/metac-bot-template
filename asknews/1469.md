**The far side of the Moon may soon host the world's most sensitive telescope, shielded from earthly interference**
NASA is planning to build the Lunar Crater Radio Telescope (LCRT) on the far side of the Moon, a location shielded from Earth's increasing satellite interference. The telescope will be a massive wire mesh reflector within a lunar crater, suspended by cables using advanced robotics. The project aims to preserve and expand humanity's ability to explore the cosmos, which is threatened by the growing number of satellites in Earth's orbit. Federico Di Vruno, an astronomer, warned that radio astronomy on Earth may become impossible due to interference, 'artificially closing 'windows' to observe our universe.' The LCRT is estimated to cost over $2.6 billion and could be operational in the 2030s. Gaurangi Gupta, a research scientist, explained that the telescope will enable the study of ultra-long radio waves, which are essential for investigating the universe's 'cosmic dark ages.' 'Observations of the dark ages have the potential to revolutionize physics and cosmology by improving our understanding of fundamental particle physics, dark matter, dark energy and cosmic inflation,' she said.

**Collision between Milky Way and Andromeda: A New Simulation Challenges the Assumption**
A new simulation published in 'Nature Astronomy' challenges a long-held assumption in astronomy: the collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may not be inevitable. For decades, the most widely accepted narrative in astronomy predicted that the two galaxies would collide in about five billion years, giving rise to a new elliptical galaxy called 'Milkomeda'. However, a recent study led by Till Sawala and published in Nature Astronomy has overturned this scenario: including updated data from the Gaia and Hubble telescopes, and taking into account the gravitational influence of galaxies like the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Triangulum (M33), the study found that the probability of collision is only 50% in the next 10 billion years. The study uses an innovative approach: instead of a simple two-body simulation (Milky Way and Andromeda), Sawala and colleagues modeled the evolution of the entire Local Group (LG) with four-body simulations, including M33 and the LMC. The study's key points include: Using 50,000 Monte Carlo simulations, the study explored the possible galactic trajectories. The results show a bifurcated future: The evolution of the future depends on: The study also showed that even using the best estimates available today, it is not possible to determine with certainty the fate of our galaxy. Future versions of the Gaia catalog and new observational campaigns will be crucial for refining the measurements of proper motions, masses, and dark matter distributions. Contrary to what was believed for years, the collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda is not guaranteed. Our galaxy may only merge with the Large Magellanic Cloud, while Andromeda may remain a distant neighbor. Galactic cosmology is still full of surprises.

**NASA's Lunar Crater Radio Telescope: A New Era in Radio Astronomy**
NASA is working on a concept for a radio telescope called Lunar Crater Radio Telescope (LCRT), which will be placed in a lunar crater on the far side of the moon. The telescope will be a massive network of wires suspended in the crater by cables, with a diameter of approximately 350 meters. LCRT will be the first structure of its kind to be fully assembled by robotic systems. According to scientists, the main reason for developing LCRT is the growing threat of 'megastar clusters' of satellites, which are causing an increase in radio noise that can make radio astronomy from Earth almost impossible. LCRT will allow for stable conditions for observations, but researchers warn that even with this telescope, the possibilities will be limited compared to a global network of ground-based observatories. LCRT will also allow researchers to study 'super-long waves' - radio signals with lengths over 10 meters that do not pass through the Earth's atmosphere. These signals contain information about the earliest stages of the universe's existence - the 'dark ages' when the cosmos was not yet filled with stars, but was dominated by neutral hydrogen, photons, and dark matter. According to researchers, such observations could fundamentally change our understanding of fundamental physics, dark matter, energy, and cosmic inflation. The project was first proposed in 2020 and has passed two phases of funding from NASA. The team from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is now preparing to submit a proposal for the third phase. If approved, the construction of the telescope could begin in the 2030s, with an estimated cost of around $2.6 billion.

**Japanese Researchers Challenge Hawking Radiation Theory, Suggesting Smaller Black Holes May Have Survived**
Astronomers have suggested that the first black holes in the universe may be significantly larger than previously thought, or alternatively, they may be smaller but have survived to the present day. Japanese researchers have challenged the widely-held theory that black holes with masses less than a billion kilograms would have long since disappeared due to Hawking radiation. The idea that dark matter could be composed of primary black holes is not new, but it was previously thought that only large black holes could have survived to the present day. The Japanese scientists, based on the hypothesis of Georgian physicist Gia Dvali, propose that Hawking radiation could be suppressed by a unique mechanism known as 'memory jamming', where the information absorbed by the black hole prevents its evaporation. This means that in the modern universe, there may exist black holes with masses as low as 10 million kilograms. If this theory is confirmed, it could radically change our understanding of the nature of dark matter, which remains one of the biggest mysteries of modern cosmology. The key to testing this hypothesis is future gravitational-wave observatories, such as LISA and DECIGO, which will be able to detect the merger of such black holes, providing direct evidence of their existence. The new findings not only propose an alternative nature of dark matter but also challenge established views on Hawking radiation. If the scientists' assumption is correct, the history of the universe will have to be rewritten once again.

**Challenging the Concept of Dark Energy with NUE**
Baldevkrishan Sharma, a scientist and lead researcher at the Astrogenesis Research Foundation, has introduced a new theory called Natural Universe Expansion (NUE) that challenges the concept of dark energy. According to Sharma, dark energy is an 'invisible, unknown force' that constitutes nearly 70% of the universe, but his theory eliminates the need for this hypothetical force. The NUE theory proposes a time-dependent equation, the Nu Constant, which dynamically adjusts for the accelerating expansion of the universe. This new equation allows for a precise understanding of recessional velocities and mass increases in celestial bodies without invoking 'dark energy' or 'dark matter.' Sharma's theory also proposes the Living Organic Universe (LOU) Model, where the universe behaves like a living system, expanding naturally and maintaining stable ratios in temperature and density. If the NUE Law holds true, it would mean that the entire paradigm of dark energy is unnecessary, paving the way for a more logical and observable understanding of the universe.

**NVIDIA's Vera Rubin Supercomputer: A Time Machine for Science**
NVIDIA has announced the Vera Rubin supercomputer, named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, who pioneered the study of dark matter. The system, dubbed 'Doudna', is a collaborative platform that integrates simulation, data processing, and AI technology. It is designed to accelerate breakthroughs in various fields, including nuclear fusion, materials science, and genomics. Doudna is expected to be 10 times more powerful than its predecessor, Perlmutter, while using only 2-3 times the energy. This represents a 3-5 times increase in performance per watt. The system is expected to be operational in 2026 and will be used by researchers across the US to tackle some of the world's most pressing challenges. According to NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, Doudna is 'a time machine for the scientific community', allowing researchers to compress years of research into days and unlock new discoveries. 'We're not just building a faster computer, we're building a system that helps researchers think more broadly and find answers faster,' said Nick Wright, chief architect of Doudna.

**The Enigma of Dark Matter: A Journey Through the History of Astronomy**
Harald Lesch takes us on a fascinating journey through the history of astronomy, exploring the concept of dark matter. Despite not being visible or tangible, dark matter seems to have a significant presence in the universe. Scientists estimate that it may have five times the mass of all visible matter, and its effects are felt throughout the cosmos, leaving many unanswered questions. Lesch notes that the idea of dark matter is not unlike the long-discredited notion of a universal 'Äther' that was once thought to fill the universe.

**The Universe Is Becoming More Complex, Cosmological Data Reveals**
Recent research led by Joshua Kim and Mathew Madhavacheril suggests that the universe has become more complex over its 13.8 billion-year history, with subtle discrepancies in how matter is distributed across the cosmos. By cross-referencing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the team found that the universe is less clumpy than predicted by standard models. Madhavacheril explained, 'This research is like a cosmic CT scan, enabling a deeper understanding of how matter has evolved over billions of years.' The findings raise questions about the role of dark energy, the mysterious force driving the universe's accelerating expansion, and may indicate that it influences cosmic structure formation more than previously understood. To refine these findings, scientists plan to utilize next-generation telescopes like the Simons Observatory.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Claims that "the Universe will end sooner than expected" are false**
A recent paper suggested that Hawking-like radiation isn't just for black holes, and therefore, everything will eventually decay. However, a deeper examination reveals that the idea is fundamentally flawed. The key ingredient necessary for this type of radiation to physically exist is the presence of a horizon, either a cosmological horizon or an event horizon. Without a horizon, objects cannot radiate via the Hawking (or Unruh) mechanism, and therefore, they will not have a finite lifetime or spontaneously decay. This was pointed out in the peer-reviewed literature as a follow-up to the original paper in a comment in November 2024 and in an independent paper at precisely the same time. As a result, only objects with horizons, such as black holes, will radiate and decay, while other massive objects, from protons to stars to stellar and planetary corpses to dark matter halos, will remain stable against decay via Hawking radiation infinitely far into the future.

**End of the Universe: New Study Reveals Surprising Timeline**
A recent study by researchers Falcke, Wondrak, and Suijlekom has revealed a surprising timeline for the end of the universe. According to their findings, the era of mass and energy sources will end much earlier than previously thought, with the 'Big Freeze' scenario occurring many orders of magnitude sooner. This is due to the rapid decay of stellar remnants such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and even stellar black holes. As a result, the universe will enter a dark, cold phase much sooner than expected, with the transition to the 'Dark Era' being accelerated. The study also raises questions about the limits of stable matter and the existence of hypothetical, extremely dense objects. As these objects would have already decayed above a certain density threshold, models of cyclic or string-theoretic universes lose plausibility. The discussion about the end of the universe is shifting from the classical heat-death theory to a quantum-mechanically motivated disappearance of all matter - long before the universe itself dies. As Dr. Falcke said, 'The universe will end in a quantum-mechanical 'Big Freeze', where all matter will disappear before the universe dies itself.'

**The Universe and the Big Bang: What We Know and What Remains a Mystery**
The universe has been expanding since the Big Bang. However, many questions remain unanswered. Where did the Big Bang occur? What was before it? And what is dark matter and dark energy? This article provides an overview of what we know and what remains a mystery. The Big Bang marked the beginning of our universe, not within a space, but as the emergence of space and time itself. Despite many advances, fundamental questions remain: where did the Big Bang occur? What was before it? And what is dark matter and dark energy? The article explains the current understanding of the universe and its mysteries, including the concept of dark energy and dark matter, and the idea of a multiverse. According to the current understanding, the universe began with a singularity, an infinitely hot and dense point, around 13.8 billion years ago. This singularity expanded rapidly, and as it did, it cooled and formed subatomic particles, atoms, and eventually the stars and galaxies we see today. However, there are still many unanswered questions, such as what caused the Big Bang, what existed before it, and what is the nature of dark energy and dark matter. Some theories suggest that the universe underwent a cycle of expansion and contraction, with our universe being just one of many in a vast multiverse. Other theories propose that the universe is made up of multiple dimensions, with our universe being just one of many bubbles in a vast multidimensional space. The article also discusses the concept of temporal singularities, which propose that the universe is made up of a series of rapid, punctual energy releases, rather than a single Big Bang. These singularities could be responsible for the observed behavior of the universe, including its expansion and the presence of dark matter and dark energy. However, these ideas are still highly speculative and require further research to be confirmed. The article concludes by noting that the mystery of the universe's origins remains one of the greatest unsolved puzzles of modern science.

**Dark Matter May Be Older Than the Universe—And It Might Live Forever**
A study suggests that dark matter, the mysterious and invisible substance making up 27% of the universe, may have existed before the universe itself. According to the research, dark matter could have emerged from processes in a pre-universe era, potentially leading to a new understanding of time and space. If true, this would mean that dark matter is immortal, existing before the Big Bang and potentially remaining as the only detectable substance in the universe's distant future. This raises intriguing questions about the role of dark matter in the early universe and its potential contribution to the conditions that sparked the Big Bang. As one might say, 'dark matter is indeed immortal'.

**This Mysterious Cosmic Substance May Be Older Than the Universe Itself -- And It Just Might Be Immortal**
A mysterious substance, dark matter, drives the movements of stars and galaxies, but its nature and origins remain unknown. New research suggests that dark matter may have been born before the universe as we know it, and could be immortal. According to some theories, dark matter was created during the inflationary epoch, when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old. Other models propose that dark matter can decay into other particles, but recent observations of nearby dwarf galaxies have put an upper limit on its interaction efficiency, suggesting that dark matter's lifetime is at least 10 million times longer than the current age of the universe. This means that dark matter may have existed since the beginning of time and will continue to exist long after the universe ceases to exist. As Katherine Freese said, 'Hopefully we'll have uncovered its secrets long before then.'

**Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists search for elusive dark matter throughout the universe**
Scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory are searching for dark matter, an invisible form of matter that is thought to make up approximately 27% of the universe. Using data from near-Earth asteroids, such as Bennu and Apophis, researchers are trying to detect the gravitational effects of dark matter. According to Yu-Dai Tsai, Research Physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, 'We know that dark matter should have a gravitational effect, but we don't know any of the detailed particle property or any of the detailed wavelike property that dark matter should have.' The 2023 NASA Osiris-Rex mission collected samples from the asteroid Bennu, which could help fundamentally change our understanding of the standard model of physics. Tsai hopes that this research will not only further enhance LANL's research into dark matter, but also make the planet safer in our celestial neighborhood. 'Those are very important for our future survival,' said Tsai. 'Whether we, if we know some place is going to be hit by asteroid, we need to evacuate or we need to deflect the asteroid. There are many things we can do, but we need to know beforehand.'

**Scientists Discover What Existed Before the Big Bang**
American scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery that could reveal what existed before the Big Bang. The 'Big Bang Sombre' theory, proposed by Katherine Freese and Martin Winkler, suggests that dark matter could have originated from a distinct event separate from the conventional Big Bang. This second Big Bang would have generated dark matter through the decay of a trapped quantum field in a false vacuum state. The implications of this theory are far-reaching, potentially changing our understanding of the universe's evolution, from the formation of the first galaxies to the large-scale structure of the universe. The detection of gravitational waves could confirm this new theory of dark matter. The United States has unveiled a technology that could enable interstellar travel at astonishing speeds, which is explored in a related article. This discovery has the potential to not only expand our understanding of dark matter but also revolutionize our conception of cosmic evolution.

**Dark Matter May Be Weakening, Suggesting a Paradigm Shift in Our Understanding of the Universe**
Recent discoveries suggest that dark matter, the mysterious force driving the universe's expansion, may be weakening, leaving scientists intrigued. This finding could imply a paradigm shift in our understanding of the universe, suggesting that instead of a 'big freeze', the universe may end with a 'big crunch'. Dark matter is estimated to comprise about 70% of the cosmos and is responsible for the expansion of the universe. The discovery of dark matter was made in the late 1990s when astronomers used distant supernovae explosions to investigate how the cosmic expansion rate changed over time. The expectation was that after the Big Bang, the universe's expansion would slow down due to gravity, but instead, scientists found that the expansion was accelerating, driven by an unknown force called dark matter. This dark matter was assumed to be a constant force, which, according to the scientific community, would mean that the universe would continue to expand indefinitely, eventually reaching a point where everything would be so distant that not even light could fill the void between galaxies - a scenario known as the 'big freeze'. However, recent discoveries threaten to upend this theory. Studies by the DESI team at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona suggest that dark matter may not be constant and is actually weakening. The results show that dark matter reached a peak of force millions of years ago and is now about 10% weaker. This means that if dark matter continues to decrease until it becomes negative, the end of the universe will be in a scenario similar to a 'big bang reversal', known as a 'big crunch'. 'We're discovering that, yes, there's something pushing galaxies apart, but it's not constant. It's decelerating,' said Professor Carlos Frenk, cosmologist at the University of Durham, UK, and member of the DESI collaboration, cited by The Guardian. 'The evidence is stronger now than it was before,' said Professor Seshadri Nadathur, of the University of Portsmouth, to the BBC. 'We've also done many additional tests compared to the first year, and they leave us confident that the results are not motivated by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't considered,' he added. The scientific community is intrigued and divided by the discovery. If it's true, the discovery could be one of the biggest in the world of astronomy and would dethrone the standard cosmological model of astronomers. Many of them have changed their opinion in recent months, moving from a position of skepticism to supporting the discovery. 'I looked at the data carefully. For me, this is a robust result. We're witnessing the dethroning of the old paradigm and the emergence of a new paradigm,' said Frenk. 'Dark energy seems to be even stranger than we thought,' said Professor Catherine Heymans, of the University of Edinburgh, to the BBC. 'In 2024, the data were new, nobody was sure about them, and people thought it was necessary to do more studies. But now there are more data and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, although there is still a possibility that the 'error' disappears, there is also the possibility that we are approaching a really big discovery,' she said. Others remain more cautious and say that more data are needed. 'My conclusion from this analysis is that the calculations still do not provide decisive evidence for the evolution of dark matter. They may show as DESI gathers more data,' said George Efstathiou, professor at the University of Cambridge. 'It's a dramatic moment,' said the professor to the BBC, considering that 'we may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the universe.' 'It's fair to say that we have no idea what dark matter or dark energy is,' said the professor to The Guardian. 'But you can also look at this in a more positive way. For 20 years, we were stuck with dark matter. Now, physicists have new questions,' he asserted.

**Dark Matter: A New Approach to Detection in Space**
For nearly a century, scientists have been intrigued and baffled by dark matter, which represents about 85% of the universe's total mass but remains invisible and undetectable. A new approach, using the space as a testing ground, may revolutionize our understanding of the universe. Scientists have been trying to detect dark matter using terrestrial technology, but to no avail. However, a team from the University of Southampton has turned its attention to space, using a novel method to detect dark matter. The team's approach involves using a device that levitates graphite between magnets in space, measuring minute movements caused by the pressure exerted by dark matter on the graphite particles. According to physicist Tim Fuchs, 'If a sufficient density of dark matter is present, it could generate a pressure that destabilizes the particles, and we could measure these movements with unprecedented precision.' The mission, called Jovian-1, will be launched in early 2025 and will carry the experiment into low Earth orbit for two years. If successful, this mission could change our understanding of the cosmos and open up new avenues for scientific research.

**Scientists Edge Closer to Solving One of the Universe's Greatest Mysteries: Dark Matter**
Physicist Tim Fuchs from Southampton University explains the importance of this study: 'Dark matter is one of the fundamental components that determine the structure of our universe, but it has yet to be directly detected. So far, no experiment has been able to detect it.' Scientists have noticed a significant discrepancy between the amount of normal matter visible in the universe and the gravitational force it exerts. The rotation speeds of the outer parts of galaxies and the way space-time is curved around massive objects indicate that there is approximately six times more dark matter than normal matter. However, the nature of dark matter remains unknown. Scientists are continuing to explore all possibilities to detect this mysterious, invisible, and light-emitting matter, which only affects the universe through gravity. Fuchs and his team are preparing to conduct an experiment to detect dark matter using the Jovian-1 satellite, which will be launched in 2026. The satellite will orbit the Earth for two years, searching for signs of dark matter. In the experiment, graphite plates will be suspended in a magnetic field in the air. Fuchs explains the working principle of the experiment: 'Our experiment is unlike any previous one. In a micro-gravity environment, graphite particles suspended between magnets will be extremely sensitive to even the smallest forces. If dark matter has a certain density, an invisible 'dark wind' will gently push these particles, creating a measurable movement.' Jovian-1 will carry several experiments designed by students from Southampton University, Portsmouth University, and Surrey University. Although it may take several years to obtain the results, the experiment could provide one of the strongest clues about dark matter. Fuchs also shares some theories about why large dark matter detectors on Earth have not yet produced conclusive results: 'Some theories suggest that the interaction rate of dark matter may be so high that it can pass through our atmosphere or the detectors built into the mountains. This could explain why ground-based experiments have not been able to detect any clear signals.'
