**Over 1.67 Million Earning Opportunities Created Through PYEI by March 2025 | Law-Order**
Deputy Minister in the Presidency, Nonceba Mhlauli, has announced that over 1.67 million earning opportunities have been facilitated for young people in South Africa through the Presidential Youth Employment Intervention (PYEI) by March 2025. The PYEI has also enrolled over 5,400 participants in its Jobs Boost Outcomes Fund, with more than 3,000 young people placed into durable and promising jobs. Mhlauli emphasized the progress made in scaling meaningful, sustained employment pathways for youth and highlighted the growing strength of the National Pathway Management Network (NPMN), which now boasts over 4.78 million registered young people. 'These jobs are not just temporary placements,' Mhlauli explained. 'They are defined by duration, income level, and growth potential.' The initiative continues to enjoy strong backing from the private sector, development agencies, and civil society organisations, who work in partnership with the government to design and implement scalable, high-impact employment programmes.

**Fake Doctor Saga: NPP MPs take on media house for giving 'Dr Daly' platform to host health programme**
The Minority Caucus of Parliament has criticized Accra-based GHOne TV for hosting Dr Ann Sansa Daly, whose appointment to the NHIA Governing Board was revoked, on their health programme. The NPP MPs questioned the media house's due diligence on Dr Daly's qualifications, citing reports from the Ghana Medical and Dental Council that she is not a registered or licensed medical practitioner. The MPs asked GHOne TV to provide answers on their verification process, potential misinformation, and steps to address the issue. 'The media house had serious questions to answer following reports from the Ghana Medical and Dental Council,' the MPs stated.

**Patch economy, mend bilaterals, soothe citizens**
Sri Lanka's National People's Power (NPP) government has secured a majority of seats in local elections, but its popularity has taken a hit. The NPP secured 43.26% of the vote, a dent in its popularity, and the fragmented nature of votes at the local level is reflective of the public's growing discontent. The government has been criticized for its lack of policy coherence and failure to address the country's economic woes. The NPP has been accused of making the economic situation appear like a management problem, rather than explaining the severity of the situation. The public still trusts the government to have integrity, but questions its ability to fix the economy without passing further burden on to them. As one observer noted, the May 6 vote can be considered a 'quiet reprimand' from the people, impatient with the slow delivery of solutions. 'The government has a five-year term, but it still needs to manage public expectations and prevent public outrage,' said a source. 'The NPP needs to mend its bilaterals, soothe citizens, and patch its economy to move forward.'

**GH¢50m bail not too much for NPP - Prof. Gyampo calls out party's hesitation to bail Wontumi**
Prof. Ransford Gyampo, Acting CEO of the Ghana Shippers Authority, has questioned the New Patriotic Party's (NPP) hesitation to bail Chairman Wontumi, who was arrested over alleged offences including fraud, money laundering, and connections to international organized crime. Gyampo dismissed claims that the GH¢50 million bail is excessive, saying 'They are just afraid of using their properties to bail Wontumi. They think we don't know what they have?' He added that members of the NPP have the means to meet the bail conditions but are unwilling to commit their personal assets. Gyampo's comments challenge the party's position and raise questions about internal party dynamics.

**Quantitative prediction of optical static refractive index in complex oxides - npj Computational Materials**
Researchers have established a predictive model for the optical static refractive index in complex oxides. The model uses physical parameters such as crystallographic information, electron configuration, and elemental composition to predict the refractive index. The model takes into account the effects of temperature and impurities on the refractive index, and has been validated using experimental data from 41 complex oxides. The model has been shown to be more accurate than existing predictive models, and can be used to optimize the optical static refractive index through doping engineering. The researchers have also demonstrated the predictive capability of the model for various doping systems, and have shown that it can accurately capture the role of temperature and doping effects on the refractive index. Furthermore, the model has been experimentally validated using the common and representative pyrochlore GdZrO with La element dopant. The results show that the model can accurately predict the optical static refractive index of complex oxides, and has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including materials science and optics.

**The NPP Government & Its Philistine Detractors - Colombo Telegraph**
The NPP government in Sri Lanka has been criticized by some commentators who are concerned that it may pave the way for the return of the Rajapaksas, led by Namal Rajapaksa. However, the NPP has shown consistent commitment to honesty, decency, and transparency, and has transformed itself from its violent past. The government's critics often allude to Marxism, but this is a code for recalling the JVP's violent past. The JVP/NPP government has come to power through the electoral process and has no incentive to change the system. In fact, the government is committed to curing Sri Lanka of the presidential system, which has been a debilitating illness. The experience of the Indian states of Kerala and West Bengal, where the Indian Communists have won power through the electoral process and have acquitted themselves well in government, is more comparable to Sri Lanka's situation. The NPP government has completed only six months in office, but its critics are insistent on seeing results, ignoring the fact that the present government's predecessors did little in the first six months after elections in 2010, 2015, and 2019.

**NPP, local elections and Sri Lanka’s democratic transition**
The recent local government elections in Sri Lanka were a significant victory for the National Liberation Front (JVP), a working-class party that has built a coalition with popular support. The elections sent a clear signal that voters do not trust the parties of the ruling elites that have dominated representative politics since independence in 1948. The JVP's effort towards a social democratic agenda is restrained by its commitment to an IMF-driven debt restructuring strategy. The party's Sinhala-Buddhist nationalism and social welfare policies have been criticized by the Frontline Socialist Party, which gained 16 seats in different local governments. The PSA remains the main critical voice demanding that the NPP stick to the promise of a democratic transition. The critique of the NPP from mainstream parties is aimed at establishing the previous form of elite rule, entrenched in corruption and authoritarian politics. The NPP's democratic transition is also constrained by its compromises with the IMF, as well as the opposition elitist ruling class parties' efforts to undermine the NPP. Meanwhile, the escalation of armed conflict between India and Pakistan is likely to reinforce militarisation and patriarchal ethno-nationalist authoritarian forces within the region.

**Mad Hatter Mathematics | What If P = NP?**
The question of whether P = NP is one of the most profound unsolved problems in theoretical computer science and mathematics. If proven true, it would fundamentally transform our understanding of what is computationally feasible. Researchers believe P = NP could be true due to the lack of proof otherwise, the possibility of natural algorithms being hidden, and the success of real-world approximation in solving 'hard' problems. The implications for science would be vast and far-reaching, affecting fields such as cryptography, artificial intelligence, drug discovery, and mathematics. However, even if P = NP is true, the constructive proof may result in impractical algorithms, and the discovery would bring ethical and social challenges. The possibility that P = NP remains one of the most important open questions in science.

**How a Biochemist Used Entropy to Tackle the P vs NP Problem**
A biochemist, who wishes to remain anonymous, has made a breakthrough in tackling the P vs NP problem, a famous open problem in computer science. The biochemist, who has a PhD in biochemistry, used the concept of entropy to develop a new constructive approach to separating P from NP. The approach, which the biochemist calls the 'entropic firewall', shows that P algorithms can see the surface of a problem, but not what lies beyond it. The biochemist has published a formal proof of this result on Zenodo and a more accessible breakdown on GitHub. The proof avoids common barriers in complexity theory and opens up a new line of reasoning: what if the problem isn't about what algorithms can do, but what information can't do without help? The biochemist is seeking feedback from the computer science and information theory communities and is open to independent review.

**NPP Criticizes KMT-PFP Summit as Political Mobilization to Cover Up Signature Forgery**
The New Power Party (NPP) criticized the recent 'independent leader summit' held by the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) as a political mobilization to cover up the forgery of signatures. They stated, 'Taiwan needs a normal opposition party that can make mistakes without being too hard on itself.' The NPP pointed out that the true source of the 'independent leader summit' is the KMT's massive forgery of signatures, which led to the investigation and social backlash. The NPP criticized that this political move is not about democracy, livelihoods, or tariffs, but rather a mobilization to face their own mistakes. They emphasized that if the KMT could sincerely face the democratic process, genuinely collect signatures on the street, and not abuse personal data or forge signature lists, there would be no need for the investigation and prosecution actions. In fact, the summit took place because the KMT ignored the legislative process, pushed through bills, and triggered a recall movement in Taiwan. When faced with the people's counter-reaction, the KMT chose to use illegal means to forge signatures on a large scale and try to justify their actions by calling it a 'large recall.' The NPP stressed that a political party should be a public instrument for people to express their political will, and if a party makes mistakes, it should face the truth, be brave enough to take responsibility, and not manipulate public opinion or interfere with the judiciary. They also criticized the PFP, led by Huang Kuo-chang, for its agreement with the KMT, which is leading the opposition into a dead end of hatred and mobilization. The NPP urged any party that wants to play the role of an opposition watchdog to return to rational governance and procedural justice. If a party is unable to govern and supervise, but only knows how to manipulate opposition and distort facts, it will eventually be eliminated by history and weaken the actual supervision power of Taiwanese society over the ruling party.

**Huang Kuo-chang: NPP Will Not Stand Idly By as Government Targets Opposition Lawmakers**
The chairman of the People First Party (PFP), Yu Li-ren, and the chairman of the New Power Party (NPP), Huang Kuo-chang, held a 'Return Democracy to Taiwan - Inaugural Meeting of the Opposition Leaders' on April 22. Huang stated that the NPP will not stand idly by as the government uses the recall mechanism to target opposition lawmakers. He emphasized that the recall mechanism is meant to hold accountable lawmakers who are not doing their job, such as those who are absent from work or meetings, and those who prioritize protecting the government over representing the people. Huang questioned when the recall mechanism became a tool for the losing presidential candidate to exact revenge. He warned that if the recall mechanism is used to target opposition lawmakers, it will lead to a return to one-party rule in Taiwan. Huang emphasized that the NPP will not allow the government to act with impunity.

**Developing a Custom MCP for Mathematical Expression Calculation**
A user developed a custom MCP (Message Command Protocol) for mathematical expression calculation, addressing the limitations of large models in mathematical computation. The project, called 'cal-mcp', is a lightweight and efficient calculation tool that supports basic mathematical operations and built-in constants. It uses the 'expr-eval' library to parse and calculate user input mathematical expressions, and interacts with the outside world through standard input/output (stdio). The project is available on npm, but has a bug that prevents it from running with 'npx', although it can be run locally with a compiled JavaScript file.

**A Potential Approach for NP-Completeness: Using Katětov-Urysohn to Tackle the Traveling Salesman...**
A potential approach to solving the NP-complete Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been proposed, using the Katětov-Urysohn metric completion to tackle the problem. The method involves constructing a partial-distance metric space, where distances between cities are represented as intervals rather than exact values. The system is feasible if it is free of contradictions, such as triangle violations or more advanced metric contradictions. The approach encodes the presence or absence of arcs without enumerating all subsets, and the total cost is enforced by expansions that prevent summations of arc distances from surpassing a threshold. The method has been tested on various TSP instances, from small to moderate or large, and has shown polynomial scaling, typically culminating in an answer 'YES' or 'NO' within times that are well below what one would anticipate from a combinatorial blowup approach. However, advanced mathematical questions remain unresolved, such as guaranteeing that no hidden exponential phenomena appear in specially tailored instances, and whether every partial-dist solution indeed corresponds to a valid Hamiltonian cycle.

**New Power Party Unveils New Emblem and Platform**
The New Power Party (NPP) held a press conference to announce its new party emblem and platform. Party Chairperson Wang Wan-yu stated that the party has been working on a 'second founding' project since last year's election, reviewing its past and revising its system. The new emblem and platform are meant to demonstrate the party's renewed commitment to its values. According to Wang, the new emblem represents the power of the people, with the letter 'P' symbolizing 'people,' 'point,' and 'power.' She explained that when individuals come together, they form a collective force that can be harnessed for the greater good. Wang also emphasized the need for the party to clearly articulate its vision and values, which include pursuing sovereignty, human rights, and social justice, as well as defending sovereignty and promoting equality and democracy. The party's new platform aims to present a clear vision for the future of Taiwan and address the challenges it faces.

**Exploring Quantum Computing: Computational Complexity Theory and Complexity Classes**
Complexity classes are collections of problems that share similar computational requirements. The P class includes problems that can be solved in a reasonable amount of time by a classical computer, while the NP class includes problems where a proof can be verified quickly. The PP class includes problems where randomness can be used to get an answer with high probability. The EXPTIME class includes problems that can be solved by a classical computer, but the time required grows exponentially with the input size. The IP class represents problems that can be solved through an interactive question-and-answer process. Understanding these complexity classes is important for understanding what quantum computers can do best and where they might provide advantages over classical computers.

**P vs NP: Explain Like I'm 6**
The P vs NP problem is a complex puzzle in math and computer science that has yet to be solved. It's a mystery that has been puzzling some of the smartest people on the planet for years, and solving it could earn you one million dollars. The problem is essentially asking if there's a secret trick that makes all hard puzzles as easy as the easy ones. If P = NP, computers could solve everything ridiculously fast, but most experts believe that P ≠ NP, meaning some puzzles are just meant to be hard and can't be solved quickly. The problem is like trying to find a treasure, but instead of digging everywhere, a map with an 'X' marking the location would make it easy to find. However, no one has been able to find this map, and the problem remains unsolved.

**UK national parking app to be shut down?**
The National Parking Platform (NPP), a government-funded parking app, may be shut down due to funding withdrawal. The app, developed by the Department for Transport (DfT), aims to connect 'potentially thousands' of private and council parking sites into a single app. However, transport minister Lilian Greenwood stated that the Labour government supports the NPP concept but believes it can be delivered without public funding. The RAC disagrees, saying that without government funding, further progress is unlikely. Simon Williams, RAC head of policy, said, 'Many people were overwhelmed by the multitude of apps they had to use, when in reality you want one that you like and you’re happy using and that you can use everywhere.' The DfT claims to support the NPP and is working with the parking sector to achieve its delivery without taxpayer funding.

**National Pension Scheme: How To Open NPS Account Online, Step-By-Step Guide**
The National Pension Scheme (NPS) is a retirement savings account that offers tax benefits and flexibility in contribution. It is open to Indian citizens aged 18-70 and is designed on a Defined Contribution basis. The scheme encourages people to invest in a pension account at regular intervals during their employment. After retirement, the subscribers can take out a certain percentage of the corpus. The NPS scheme is highly beneficial for individuals employed in the private sector seeking a consistent pension post-retirement. It offers portability across various jobs and locations, accompanied by tax benefits under Section 80C and Section 80CCD. The NPS account can be opened online or offline, and there are two types of accounts: Tier I and Tier II. Tier I account is mandatory, and the subscriber has the option to opt for Tier II account opening and operation. The NPS scheme offers several benefits, including tax benefits, long-term wealth creation, flexibility in contribution, professional management, and choice of investment options. However, it also has some limitations, such as a lock-in period and market-linked returns. The NPS scheme is regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), and the operations are overseen by the CRA. The NPS account can be operated from anywhere in the country, and the subscriber can shift from one sector to another or from one location to another. The NPS scheme also offers tax benefits to the employer, and the employee's contribution is eligible for tax deduction up to 10% of salary. The employer's contribution is also eligible for tax deduction up to 10% of salary. The NPS scheme is a good fit for long-term investors, disciplined savers, and those without employer pension plans. The NPS account can be opened online or offline, and the subscriber can select a scheme and pension fund either at the corporate level or the subscriber level. The funds contributed by the subscribers are invested by the PFRDA-registered pension funds as per the investment guidelines provided by PFRDA. The investment guidelines are framed in such a manner that there is minimal impact on the subscribers' contributions even if there is a market downturn by a judicious mix of investment instruments like Government securities, corporate bonds, and Equities. At present, there are 8 pension funds that manage the subscriber funds at the option of the subscriber. The pension fund can be changed once in a financial year, and the subscriber can have a different pension fund and investment option for their Tier I and Tier II accounts. When an employee leaves the job, they can shift the corpus to a new employer with the same PRAN account if the new employer is already a registered entity under NPS. However, if not, then the employee can continue the PRAN account under the All Citizen Model. The employer contributions cannot be forfeited under NPS. There is no provision for loan or advances under NPS, and no lien can be marked on the NPS account. The income tax implications on withdrawals/exit from NPS are that partial withdrawals are tax-exempted, and the amount utilized for purchase of annuity (minimum 40% mandatory) on maturity/exit is not treated as income. Goods and Service Tax is not applicable on annuity purchases by NPS subscribers. 40% of the total corpus received as lumpsum by subscribers on exit/maturity is not treated as income. KYC compliance is mandatory for the registration of employees as well as employers.
