**Google Search in trouble**
Google's parent company Alphabet is facing increasing competition from AI-powered search services, particularly from Apple's Safari browser, which saw a decline in searches for the first time last month. According to Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, searches on Safari fell for the first time last month. This has led to concerns that Alphabet may lose its cash cow, with shares ending the week down nearly 7% and erasing $138 billion in market value. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, said, 'The basic issue is, will Alphabet lose its cash cow?' However, some analysts remain bullish on Alphabet, with more than 80% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg having buy ratings. Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney advised clients to buy shares in the wake of the drop, citing consistent revenue expansion despite slowed search volume growth. However, some are getting more cautious, with Melius analyst Ben Reitzes warning that current estimates calling for 2025 net income of $115 billion could be overly optimistic.

**Will AI Really Disrupt Google's Search Empire?**
Google's stock dropped 7.5% on May 7th, 2025, following a Bloomberg report that Apple's services head Eddy Cue believes AI-powered search engines will eventually replace traditional ones like Google. This market reaction highlights investor concerns about potential disruption to Google's core business model. Search remains Google's dominant revenue source, accounting for 57% of total revenues last year. However, Google possesses substantial strategic advantages that will likely enable it to maintain search dominance through the AI revolution, including its vast historical search data, sophisticated algorithms, and global infrastructure. The company is pursuing a comprehensive approach to evolve its search capabilities by enhancing its core search with AI features and developing entirely new AI-native search experiences. Despite legitimate concerns, Google's valuation is estimated to be $205 per share, reflecting over 30% upside.

**Google vs Perplexity: AI chatbots drew just 2.96% of search traffic in 2024, new study finds**
A new study by OneLittleWeb found that AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek, accounted for only 2.96% of search engine traffic in 2024, despite witnessing an 80.92% growth in traffic year-over-year. In contrast, traditional search engines like Google, Microsoft Bing, and Yahoo saw a 0.51% decline in visits. The study noted that even in March 2025, daily average visits for search engines reached 5.5 billion, while chatbots only saw 233.1 million, creating an almost 24X gap in user engagement. Google has responded to the study by stating that it continues to see overall query growth in Search, and that people are seeing Google Search as more useful for more of their queries. However, the rise of AI in search is likely to have ripple effects that could disrupt entire industries, and may lead to a decline in search engine usage, which could have significant impacts on SEO professionals, content creators, and marketers.

**Google's Search Engine Market Share Drops Below 90% for the First Time in 15 Years**
Google's share of the search engine market has dropped below 90% for the first time in 15 years, and continues to decline. This is a significant moment, according to Michał Sadowski, founder and CEO of Brand24, a company that analyzes opinions about brands on social media. Google is a platform for promoting products for his company and millions of others. The change occurred at the end of last year, but according to Statcounter Global Stats, Google's share of the search engine market was still 89.66% in April. Google's competitors still have a significant gap to close. Bing's (Microsoft) share was 3.88%, Yandex's (owned by a consortium of Russian investors) was 2.53%, Yahoo!'s (owned by Apollo Global Management) was 1.32%, DuckDuckGo!'s (founded in the US by Daniel Weinberg) was 0.84%, and Baidu's (owned by various investors, originating from China) was 0.72%. The reason for Google's decline in market share is the growing popularity of the AI-powered chatbot, Chat GPT, created by Open AI. Microsoft, the owner of Bing, was the first to integrate it with its search engine, allowing users to access it. This move, especially in the US, has given Microsoft's search engine a significant boost in popularity, challenging Google's stable position for years.

**The tech that defined the modern internet is changing, and Silicon Valley is finally admitting it**
Tech giants Apple, Google, and Meta are facing pressure as consumers shift away from their core products. Google search queries on Apple devices have decreased for the first time, and Meta's Facebook is seeing a decline in users sharing content with friends. Instead, users are turning to direct messages and AI chatbots. Apple's iPhone may also be at risk of losing favor in the next decade, according to an executive. The companies are adapting by investing in new technologies like smart glasses and AI, which they believe will be the next step in computing. 'The amount that people are sharing with friends on Facebook has been declining,' Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during an antitrust trial. 'Even the amount of new friends that people add... I think has been declining. But I don't know the exact numbers.' Google said it continues to see overall query growth in search, but market research firm Gartner estimated that search engine volume will drop 25% by 2026 as consumers gravitate toward AI tools.

**Google's Search Engine Sees Decline in Usage Amid AI Competition**
Google's search engine has seen a decline in usage over the past two months, according to Apple's Senior Vice President of Services, Eddie Cue. This is a significant drop, as it has not happened in over 20 years. The decline is attributed to the increased use of AI services such as ChatGPT and Perplexity. Google has taken a hit, with Alphabet's stock price falling by over 7% on the day the news was reported. Alphabet's market capitalization dropped by approximately $250 billion. Apple's stock price also fell by over 1%. Google's search traffic, which is a significant revenue stream for Apple, has been a key partnership for the two companies, with Apple receiving over $20 billion in payments from Google annually. This news comes as Google has lost two antitrust lawsuits in the past nine months, and Eddie Cue's statement has added to the uncertainty surrounding Google's future. The government's argument is that Google's dominance in the search market makes it difficult for competitors like Microsoft to enter the market.

**Google Faces Unprecedented Crisis as Search Empire Declines Amid AI Challenge**
Google's search engine market share has declined for the first time in 20 years, according to Apple's senior vice president Eddie Cue. Cue attributed the decline to the increasing use of AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity. Google's parent company Alphabet's stock price plummeted over 7% after the news, wiping out around $25 billion in market value. Apple's stock price also fell over 1% due to the potential loss of revenue from Google's partnership with Safari. Google currently faces a federal antitrust lawsuit, with the US government arguing that its dominant position in the search engine market makes it difficult for competitors like Microsoft to enter the market. According to Statcounter, Google still holds a 89.7% market share, while Microsoft's Bing has 3.9%. The decline in Google's market share is a challenge for the company, but it may also become a strong argument against forced breakup. Although Google's profits are still far ahead of AI, the company's stock price has fallen nearly 12% over the past 12 months, with a market value of 16 times its earnings per share, a level not seen in 12 years.

**Google Chrome Remains the Leader in Desktop Browsers, Microsoft Edge Lags Behind**
Google Chrome continues to dominate the global desktop browser market with a 65.02% market share in April 2025, according to Statcounter. This is a slight decrease from the previous month's 65.64%, but its lead remains solid. Microsoft Edge, which is included by default in Windows 10 and 11, has a market share of 13.29% in May 2025, a minimal annual growth of 0.32% compared to last year. However, the trend is negative in the short term, with a 0.08% decline in April. Edge reached its historical high of 13.9% in February 2025, but has since lost ground. Microsoft's strategies, often perceived as too insistent, have not convinced users to leave Chrome. Even the difficulty of easily removing Edge from Windows devices has not pushed more people towards it. The picture changes slightly when looking at individual countries. In the UK, for example, Edge has a significantly higher market share of 21.78%, while Chrome drops to 52.45%. In India, the imbalance is even greater, with Chrome at 86.22% and Edge at 5.65%. Other browsers are trying to carve out a space, with Safari at 7.95%, Firefox at 6.14%, and Opera at 3.04%.

**Alphabet Inc , at cycle lows. Tariffs or not, it remains a hot pick.**
Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, is at a cycle low. Despite concerns about tariffs, the company remains a hot pick. Google's main revenue source is Google Services, which generated $304.93 billion in 2024, accounting for 87% of total revenue. The company's market share in digital advertising is around 35%, but Meta's ad revenue grew by 21% in 2024, suggesting a possible shift in advertising dollars. Alphabet expects a revenue increase of 13.87% in 2025, with expected earnings growth of 11.23%. The company has a strong balance sheet, with an operating margin of 28% and a debt-to-equity ratio of 8.66%. The author believes that Alphabet is a resilient company that can remain competitive amid market changes. The fair value of GOOG shares is estimated to be around $155 per share, with a trailing P/E ratio of 20.3x and a forward P/E ratio of 17.94x. The author sees three possibilities: Alphabet shares are interesting from a technical perspective, the company's EPS decline could trigger a significant drop in share price, or markets may be overestimating the negative impact on Google.

**Google's Dominance in Search Market Shaken as Share Falls Below 90%**
Google's dominance in the search market has been shaken, with its share falling below 90% for the first time in ten years. According to Statcounter, Google's share in the global search traffic was 89.71% in March 2025, a decline that began in October 2024. This is the first time Google has experienced such a drop since 2015. The decline is more pronounced in the PC segment, where Google's share fell to 79.10% in March 2025, a record low. In the European region, Google's share has also decreased, from 87.08% in May 2023 to 77.78% in March 2025. With Google's massive user base, each percentage point lost corresponds to over 50 million users. Some experts believe that users are increasingly concerned about privacy, with Ecosia, a German search engine, reporting a 250% growth in audience since the end of 2024. Last year, a US federal court officially recognized Google as a monopoly in the search engine market, and the company was found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices, including paying partners like Apple and Mozilla to set Google as the default search engine in their products. European authorities are also cracking down on tech giants, with Apple and Meta being fined €500 million and €200 million respectively for failing to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act. Google and social network X may be next in line for scrutiny.

**Google's Vulnerability In Search Is Growing**
For the first time since 2015, Google's global share of the search market fell below 90% in the last quarter of 2024, according to Statcounter. This trend has continued through 2025, with the exception of February, where Google's share was 90.15%. Noam Dorros, a Gartner director analyst, said, 'This drop may feel like a small percentage, but given the consistency of months it is clearly a trend.' Google still dominates the search market with 5 trillion searches annually, but AI-native rivals like Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT Search are challenging the search status quo. Meanwhile, publishers are wary of Google's AI-powered search experience, AI Overview, which may cannibalize their traffic. Rivals like Perplexity and OpenAI have inked revenue-sharing deals with select publishers to ease similar concerns.

**Google's Market Share Drops Below 90% for the First Time in Years**
Google's market share in the search engine market has dropped below 90% for the first time in years, according to recent statistics. This decline is attributed to the growing dissatisfaction with the quality of search results, both subjectively and objectively. Google has dominated the market for over two and a half decades, with a market share of over 90% worldwide. However, in 2024, the company's market share has decreased to 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.73% in December. Microsoft Bing and other search engines, such as Baidu, have gained market share at Google's expense. This decline may seem small, but it translates to millions of users and billions of dollars in lost revenue. Google's quality control issues are becoming increasingly apparent, and the company's market share is likely to continue to decline. As the company faces increasing competition and regulatory scrutiny, Google's market share drop is a cause for concern.

**Google's Search Traffic Falls Below 90% for the First Time in 10 Years**
Google's search traffic has fallen to its lowest level in the last 10 years, below 90%. According to Statcounter, Google's global search market share dropped to below 90% in the fourth quarter of 2024. This decline is the lowest level seen since 2015. Google's market share was 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.73% in December. The decline in Google's market share is parallel to the growth of its competitors, such as Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex. These search engines are gradually taking over the share that Google has lost. Several factors are contributing to Google's decline, including the rise of artificial intelligence-based search engines like Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT. Additionally, users who prioritize privacy are turning to alternative search engines, and TikTok is becoming a popular information search tool among young users. The increasing competition between new search engines and social media platforms may force Google to re-evaluate its future strategies.

**Google's Market Share Drops Below 90% for the First Time Since 2015**
Google's market share in the global search engine market has dropped below 90% for the first time since 2015, according to a report by StatCounter. This decline reflects the increasing challenges Google faces in maintaining its dominance. Google's market share has been decreasing over the past three months of 2024, reaching 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.73% in December. This is the first time Google's market share has dropped below 90% since March 2015, when it was 89.52%. The decline is not just a temporary phenomenon, but may indicate a new trend in the market. The increased competition, particularly from new AI-powered search services like Perplexity and ChatGPT, has contributed to this decline. Additionally, there is a shift towards search engines that prioritize privacy, such as DuckDuckGo, which has led some users to abandon Google. Furthermore, TikTok has become a preferred platform for search among younger generations, with many using it as an alternative to traditional search engines. Google has even integrated its search results into TikTok, further solidifying its position as a non-traditional search tool.

**Google's Market Share Drops Below 90%: A Shift in the Search Engine Landscape**
Google's market share in search has dropped to below 90% in the fourth quarter of 2023, the lowest level in the past decade. This decline is due to the growing strength of competitors and the decline in the quality of Google's search results. According to StatCounter, Google's market share has dropped to below 90% in the past three months, a level similar to that of 2015. The decline in Google's market share is parallel to the growth of competitors such as Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex. Several factors are contributing to the decline in Google's market share, including the rise of artificial intelligence-based search engines, the increasing popularity of alternatives such as Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT, and the shift of privacy-focused users to other search engines. Additionally, TikTok's growing popularity as a search tool among young users is also a notable trend. The decline in Google's market share may require the company to re-examine its strategy in the face of increasing competition from new search engines and social media platforms.

According to StatCounter, Google's search market share has dropped below 90% for the first time in 9 years, reaching a new low in October 2024.

**Google's Market Share Falls Below 90% for the First Time Since 2015**
Google's market share in global internet searches has shown signs of weakening. Recent data from StatCounter reveals that Google's market share has fallen below 90% for the first time since 2015, marking a concerning trend for the search giant. The last time the company recorded similar numbers was nearly a decade ago. StatCounter, which monitors millions of websites to identify usage trends, confirms this significant drop in Google's participation. New competitors, such as Perplexity and ChatGPT from OpenAI, driven by generative artificial intelligence, are contributing to this reduction. Traditional competitors like Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex have shown discreet growth during the period when Google's market share declined, although with some fluctuations. A particularly interesting phenomenon is the change in behavior among younger users, who have increasingly used TikTok as a tool for searching for information. The situation is so significant that TikTok has even tested links directing to Google Search on its app, while Google has started including TikTok content in its search results since the beginning of 2024. Experts point out that the decline in market share may also be related to growing user concerns about privacy, leading many to opt for alternative search engines. The deterioration of Google's search quality has also been cited as a contributing factor, with users reporting increasing dissatisfaction with the relevance of the results presented. Despite the decline, Google maintains a dominant position in the market, but the trend of decline suggests that the era of almost absolute monopoly in searches may be coming to an end.

**Google gets less than 90% of search traffic for the first time in 10 years**
Google's global search market share dropped below 90% for the first time in 10 years, according to statistics from Statcounter. The search engine's market share was 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.73% in December. This trend change is a significant shift, as Google had held a 90% market share for the last decade. While ChatGPT is not the primary beneficiary of this trend, traditional search engine competitors such as Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo! have seen a slight boost in market share. Bing was second in terms of market share in December, with just under 4% of online searches. This development could add weight to Google's argument in its ongoing antitrust case, as it suggests that users have a choice and are free to exercise it.

Google's search engine market share has dropped to a near 10-year low, falling below 90% for the first time since 2015. According to Statcounter, Google's market share in the last three months of 2024 has been below 90%, sparking concerns about its dominance. The data shows that Google's market share has been declining, with other search engines like Microsoft Bing seeing an increase in their market share. Microsoft Bing has even been accused of trying to confuse users by displaying a fake Google homepage. Google's vice president, Parisa Tabriz, criticized the move, saying it was 'not a good idea.' The rise of AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT Search and Perplexity is also changing the market landscape, and their influence is expected to grow in the future.
