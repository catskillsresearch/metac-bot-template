**Pierre Poilievre's Quest for Transformation: A Risky Gamble**
Despite a failed campaign, a loss in his own riding, and the Liberals' fourth consecutive win, Pierre Poilievre has no intention of stepping down as leader of the Conservative Party. However, the reality of his situation may soon catch up with him. Poilievre has lost a 20-point lead over the Liberals, partly due to a significant portion of NDP and Bloc Québécois voters seeing Mark Carney as their best bet to negotiate with Donald Trump. However, these same voters also did not want Poilievre as Prime Minister. Beyond his electoral base, Poilievre's dogmatic conservative profile, abrasive methods, repetitive slogans, and image as a 'mini-Trump' are deeply off-putting. His inability to adapt his campaign to the new question of the ballot and the lack of a visible future government team around him have also drawn harsh criticism within the Conservative Party. Poilievre's decision not to step down is risky, both for him and his party. He claims to want to 'change', to be less aggressive, to listen more to his caucus, and to surround himself with more MPs. However, this is a tall order, and the question remains: how far can a party leader go in changing his image for personal ambition? Can Poilievre truly transform himself into a more respectful and inclusive leader, or will he be seen as insincere?

**Senior Minister: Poilievre's New Policy Will Improve Relations with Alberta and Saskatchewan**
Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Dominic LeBlanc stated that Prime Minister Pierre Poilievre's policies will bring 'significant changes' in relations with the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, compared to the previous government led by Justin Trudeau. LeBlanc said that Poilievre is having 'ongoing dialogue' with the two provincial premiers, Danielle Smith of Alberta and Scott Moe of Saskatchewan, and that his policy of 'one project, one review' will avoid duplicate work with the provinces, which is different from Trudeau's policy. Poilievre has promised to keep two contentious policies introduced by Trudeau: a cap on oil and gas emissions and the C-69 bill, which many Conservative Party members call the 'No More Pipelines Act'. LeBlanc, as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, emphasized that Poilievre's positive attitude towards Western resources and their importance to the Canadian economy is a contrast to the previous government. Poilievre has committed to eliminating inter-provincial trade barriers and making Canada an 'energy superpower' since taking office in mid-March, especially in the context of the current trade war with the US. Danielle Smith praised Poilievre's meeting with US President Trump, calling it 'successful', but still wants to reshape the relationship between the federal government and the provinces and questions whether Poilievre will continue Trudeau's environmental policies. The Liberal Party won only 3 seats in the two provinces in the federal election on April 28. LeBlanc acknowledged that policy adjustments take time, and that some changes are still to be implemented, two weeks after the election. Poilievre's new policies will test his commitment to the environment and the economic needs of the West.

**Canada's New Government to Improve Relations with Alberta and Saskatchewan**
Canadian Federal Government Senior Minister Dominic LeBlanc stated that the new policy of Prime Minister Pierre Poilievre will bring a 'significant change' in the relationship with the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, compared to the previous government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. LeBlanc mentioned that Poilievre is having 'continuous dialogue' with the provincial premiers, including Danielle Smith of Alberta and Scott Moe of Saskatchewan. He noted that while Poilievre has retained the controversial C-69 bill and the oil and gas industry's emission cap policy, his 'one project, one review' large project approval process reform will avoid duplicated work with provincial governments, which is different from Trudeau's policy. LeBlanc, as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, is responsible for federal-provincial relations. He pointed out that Poilievre's positive attitude towards Western resources, emphasizing their importance to the Canadian economy, is in contrast to the previous government.

**Pierre Poilievre to be Sworn in as Canadian Prime Minister on May 13**
Canadian Prime Minister-elect Justin Trudeau's successor, Pierre Poilievre, will be sworn in on Tuesday, May 13, at Rideau Hall, and will officially announce his new cabinet lineup. According to CTV, the ceremony is expected to start at 10:30 am, with Governor General Mary Simon presiding. Poilievre will introduce his cabinet members and outline his government's plans, including eliminating interprovincial trade barriers and introducing the 'Canada Strong Pass' (Un Canada fort). He has promised to maintain the gender equality principle set by his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, ensuring a balanced male-female ratio in the cabinet. Poilievre's new cabinet is expected to be slightly larger than his initial transition cabinet, but still lean. He is considering a tiered structure, with a core group of senior ministers and a group of junior ministers. The new cabinet is expected to include former Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, former Quebec Finance Minister Carlos Leitão, and gun control advocate Nathalie Provost. Poilievre faces challenges in balancing gender, regional representation, and new and old members. Political analyst Scott Reid said that Poilievre needs to find a balance between introducing new faces and retaining experienced ministers, such as Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne. The Canadian Parliament will reconvene two weeks later, on May 26, with MPs returning to the House of Commons, a record 21-day wait since the 1988 federal election. Poilievre has been Prime Minister since March 14, but was not elected to the House of Commons until April 28. He has promised to quickly process a series of files, and will be busy after the Parliament reconvenes. Canada will also host the G7 summit in June and the Liberal Party has promised to break down interprovincial trade barriers by July 1, putting Poilievre's efficiency promises to the test.

**Pierre Poilievre to Unveil New Cabinet on May 13**
Canadian Prime Minister-elect Justin Trudeau's successor, Pierre Poilievre, will be sworn in on Tuesday, May 13, at Rideau Hall, and officially announce his new cabinet list. According to CTV, the ceremony is expected to start at 10:30 am, with Governor General Mary Simon presiding. Poilievre will introduce his cabinet members and outline his government's plans, including eliminating interprovincial trade barriers and introducing the 'Canada Strong Pass' (Un Canada fort), as well as providing free museum and railway services to people under 17. Poilievre has promised to maintain the gender equality principle set by Trudeau, ensuring a balanced male-female ratio in the cabinet. His first cabinet, formed in March, consisted of 13 men and 11 women. The new cabinet is expected to be slightly larger than the initial transition cabinet, but still be streamlined. Three Liberal Party sources told CBC that Poilievre is considering a tiered cabinet structure, with a core group of senior ministers and a group of junior ministers. 'It was a great day,' said Poilievre, 'when we can introduce a new cabinet and start working on our promises.'

**EDITORIAL: No winners election has left plenty of questions**
The recent federal election has left more questions than answers, with the Liberals retaining government but without a strong majority mandate. Prime Minister-elect Mark Carney faces challenges in coming up with a new deal for Canadians that all regions can accept, and a weaker position in renegotiating the USMCA free trade agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump. The NDP was severely impacted, losing seats and its leader, but may still hold the balance of power in Ottawa. The Conservatives, who picked up more seats and expanded their support, failed to form government and saw leader Pierre Poilievre lose his seat. As the new government takes shape, the NDP will likely wait for a year or so before pushing for change, and the Conservatives will focus on a byelection in rural Alberta. The election can be viewed as the 'no winners election,' reflecting the polarizing times and Canadians' frustration with the national political process.

**Carney says he won't make a pact with NDP, confirms King Charles to launch Parliament**
Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that King Charles will visit Ottawa to deliver the speech from the throne at the end of this month, a show of support for Canadian sovereignty. Carney also outlined his legislative priorities, including a middle-class tax cut, an expansion of the dental-care program, and measures to tackle the housing shortage. He confirmed that he will not enter into a formal pact with the NDP to maintain the minority government. Carney will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House next week to discuss a new security and economic deal between the countries. He also plans to use the G7 leaders' summit next month in Alberta to advance Canadian interests on the world stage. Carney said he had constructive conversations with Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet, and that he will call a byelection in Alberta when the Conservatives ask for it. 'In order to do what we need to do as a country … we will need to work in partnership with all the provinces, with Indigenous Peoples,' he said. 'This is an historic honour which matches the weight of our times,' Carney said about King Charles' visit. 'We will strengthen our relationships with reliable trading partners and allies,' he added. 'Canada has what the world needs, and we uphold the values the world respects.'

**Canadian Prime Minister-elect Pierre Poilievre to Meet with US President Trump**
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's successor, Pierre Poilievre, has confirmed that he will meet with US President Donald Trump on Tuesday in Washington. Poilievre stated that he had a 'very constructive' phone call with Trump and decided to meet in person. He emphasized that his government will strive for the best possible agreement for Canada. Poilievre also highlighted the importance of addressing current trade pressures and the future economic and security relationship between the two sovereign nations. He added that he will continue to strengthen ties with reliable trade partners and allies. Furthermore, Poilievre plans to reduce or eliminate inter-provincial tariffs before July next year, aiming to establish a single Canadian economy rather than 13 separate ones. Poilievre confirmed that British King Charles III will personally deliver the throne speech in Ottawa on May 27, a rare occurrence in Canadian history. He also pledged to work with the opposition party, promising to hold a by-election as soon as possible to allow Pierre Poilievre to regain the title of leader of the opposition. Poilievre stated, 'There will be no government games.' He also announced that he will not form a coalition with the New Democratic Party, instead opting for a partnership-style governance. He expressed his willingness to work with the Conservative Party, saying, 'I will hold a by-election as soon as possible, which is equivalent to extending an olive branch to the Conservative Party.'

**Pierre Poilievre Canada election 2025 results: Conservative Party leader, who was once predicted to become Prime Minister, now faces defeat in polls**
In the 2025 Canadian federal election, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre lost his seat in Parliament, representing his Ottawa district. This loss comes after a decline in fortunes for Poilievre, who was once predicted to become Prime Minister. The Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, won the election, with polls projecting they will win more than 172 seats, securing an outright majority. Carney's victory speech emphasized the importance of Canadian unity in the face of threats from the US, and stated that the mutually beneficial system between Canada and the US had ended. According to Carney, the American president's attacks on Canada's economy and sovereignty, including a suggestion that Canada should become the 51st state, infuriated Canadians and helped the Liberals win a fourth-straight term in power.

**Liberals Win Canadian Elections Amid Trump's Threats**
The Liberal Party won the Canadian legislative elections on Tuesday (28), following a campaign marked by threats from US President Donald Trump, which led Prime Minister Mark Carney to ask Canadians not to forget the 'betrayal' of the neighboring country. The public CBC and CTV News channels projected that the Liberals will form the next Canadian government, and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre acknowledged the defeat. Trump's trade war and threats to annex Canada, which he repeated on election day, sparked outrage among Canadians and made the issue of dealing with the United States a priority for the country. Carney, the favorite in polls ahead of Poilievre, anchored his campaign on a speech against Trump. In a speech after the victory, Carney described Trump's actions as 'betrayal'. 'We will win this trade war,' Carney declared to thousands of voters in Ottawa, where he warned of 'challenging days' due to Trump's actions. 'We have overcome the shock of American betrayal, but we must never forget the lessons,' he added. Poilievre acknowledged the defeat and promised to work with the Liberals to counterbalance Trump's trade war. 'We will always put Canada first,' Poilievre declared to voters in Ottawa. 'Conservatives will work with the Prime Minister and all parties for the common goal of defending Canada's interests and achieving a new trade agreement that leaves tariffs behind,' he expressed. Trump entered the neighboring country's campaign with his statements on Canada's sovereignty. 'Choose the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half and increase your military power,' he wrote on his Truth Social network. 'Zero tariffs or taxes if Canada becomes the 51st state of the United States,' he added. Carney responded. 'This is Canada and we decide what happens here,' he published on X, the 60-year-old politician, who has never held an elected position, but who took over as prime minister a month ago to replace Justin Trudeau. In Ottawa, where the Liberals gathered to follow the results, the first projections generated applause and enthusiastic shouts.

**Unofficial ‘Student Vote’ would have elected Conservative minority**
In the 2025 Student Vote, over 900,000 students across Canada chose a Conservative minority government. According to the results, Pierre Poilievre would have been elected as the next prime minister, with the Conservative Party of Canada winning 165 seats and 36.4% of the popular vote. This outcome mirrors the actual 2025 Canadian federal election, where a Conservative minority government was elected.

**Who is Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader at the heart of Canada's election battle as Trump stokes tensions**
Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, is challenging the Liberal establishment in the 2025 federal election. He promises to make life affordable again by slashing deficits, auditing the Bank of Canada, and eliminating the 'inflation tax.' Poilievre's campaign centres on a populist message of 'freedom over control,' appealing to working and middle-class Canadians. He has pledged to increase resources for law enforcement, target organised crime, and implement stricter immigration screening measures. Critics argue that such policies could marginalise vulnerable groups, but Poilievre believes they are essential for restoring order and safeguarding Canadian values. As Donald Trump's threats of annexation have jolted the political landscape, Poilievre's battle for Canada's future has taken on new urgency. 'President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,' Poilievre stated firmly in response to Trump's comments. 'Elbows up, Canada. #Never51,' Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney posted in response to Trump's threats, using a hockey term to rally Canadians against annexation.

**Canada Election 2025: Mark Carney vs Pierre Poilievre - Who Will Win?**
Canada is set to hold its general election today (April 28). The country's citizens are voting for a new Prime Minister. In this election, Prime Minister Mark Carney and the opposition leader Pierre Poilievre are facing off. Mark Carney was elected as Prime Minister in March 2025 after Justin Trudeau's resignation. The election was originally scheduled for October, but it has been brought forward. So far, Pierre Poilievre has maintained a lead in the polls. This election is being held amidst growing discontent with Justin Trudeau, who had to resign due to a long period of political turmoil. If Mark Carney does not receive public support, he will be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history. The main contenders in this election are: Mark Carney (Liberal Party), Pierre Poilievre (Conservative Party), Jagmeet Singh (New Democratic Party), Yves-François Blanchet (Bloc Québécois), Elizabeth May (Green Party). Each of these candidates has their own vision for Canada's future, with Mark Carney focusing on economic stability and green energy, Pierre Poilievre advocating for tax cuts and housing construction, Jagmeet Singh supporting workers and healthcare, Yves-François Blanchet prioritizing Quebec's autonomy and local interests, and Elizabeth May pushing for climate action.

**Pierre Poilievre's rise from humble beginnings to Canada's Prime Ministerial contender**
Pierre Poilievre, the 45-year-old leader of the Conservative Party, is a prominent contender in the 2025 Canadian federal elections. Born to a 16-year-old high school student, Poilievre was adopted by two schoolteachers and went on to develop a passion for politics. He began his career in 2004, representing the Ottawa-area riding of Nepean-Carleton, and rose through the ranks under Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Poilievre's campaign focuses on addressing the rising cost of living, reforming energy policies, and fiscal conservatism. He has garnered significant support and attention, but his alignment with right-wing populism and criticism of the Liberal government's handling of foreign relations have led some to question his approach. Despite this, his promises have resonated with many Canadian voters, solidifying his position as a strong Prime Ministerial candidate. As he said, 'I am the antidote to the Liberal Party's failed attempt to address the upliftment of ordinary Canadians.'

**Canada elections 2025: Carney vs Poilievre in a high-stakes battle for power. A look at the contenders**
The Canadian election on April 28 is a high-stakes battle between Liberal leader Mark Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre for the prime minister position. Carney, a financial expert with no prior political experience, has promised to use government intervention to drive housing development and counter economic threats from the US. Poilievre, a veteran MP, has positioned himself as a champion for Canadians frustrated by the high cost of living and housing shortages, and has promised to lower taxes, build more homes, and clamp down on crime. Despite recent polls showing the Liberals ahead, the Conservatives have slipped in the polls after months of strong leads. Other parties, including the NDP and Bloc Québécois, are also contesting the election, but their chances of forming government are slim. Carney has said, 'Canada will never become the 51st US state' and has promised retaliation against tariffs, while Poilievre has sought to distance himself from Donald Trump, saying, 'I have a completely different story from Donald Trump.'

**Economic fears and US threats loom over Canada's election day**
Canadians are voting in a closely watched election on Monday, with the country's relationship with the United States and economic stability at the forefront of the campaign. Interim Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former central banker, is seeking a full four-year mandate, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is vowing to slash taxes, reduce government spending, and boost resource development. Carney has maintained retaliatory tariffs against the US and sought to position himself as a steady hand during economic volatility, saying, 'I understand how the world works.' Early voter turnout has hit a record high, with 7.3 million people voting ahead of election day, up 25% from 2021. Carney has also stated, 'I reject any attempts to weaken Canada, to wear us down, to break us so that America can own us. We are masters in our own home.'

**Our View: Voters will want solutions**
The 2025 Canadian federal election is expected to be one of the most divisive and hard-fought campaigns in recent history. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney are already engaging in personal attacks, with Poilievre accusing Carney of making Canada weaker and poorer while working for Trudeau, and Carney accusing Poilievre of being enamoured with Donald Trump. However, voters are looking for concrete solutions to the country's challenges, including the cost-of-living crisis, funding shortfalls, and employment and housing shortages. As Carney said, 'Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered because a person who worships at the alter of Donald Trump will kneel before him and not stand up to him.' Voters will want the election campaign to focus on finding solutions, not hurling insults.
