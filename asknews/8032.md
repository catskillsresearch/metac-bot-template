**Balochistan Engages Religious Scholars To Promote ‘Family Planning’ Efforts - Daily Parliament Times**
The Balochistan government has launched a new initiative to promote family planning efforts by engaging 150 religious scholars across 31 districts. These scholars, designated as Family Planning Assistants, receive honorariums and Islamic literature emphasizing the Islamic legitimacy of responsible family planning, reproductive health, parental responsibility, and child welfare. Maulana Mula Dad, one of the scholars, says, 'We deliver our message through the lens of Islamic values – that every individual is entitled to a healthy life, proper education, and financial stability.' The initiative aims to promote healthier families and create a sustainable balance between population growth and available resources. The province's population has grown from 1.2 million in the early 1950s to 14.8 million in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 3.2%. If this trajectory persists, the population could double by 2045, placing unsustainable pressure on employment, housing, education, and healthcare services. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns that if growth remains above 2%, the province will require 6.5 million new employment opportunities, one million homes, and over 7,000 educational institutions by 2040.

Azizi also confirmed Afghanistan's commitment to promoting poetry and literature, stating that the government does not aim to suppress literature, but rather supports poets and organizes poetry festivals. 'The Islamic Emirate does not aim to restrict or suppress literary expression. On the contrary, we actively work to support poets and organize more effective poetry festivals. In accordance with the directive of the Supreme Leader of Afghanistan, the Ministry of Information and Culture is authorized to annually evaluate the work of poets, their contribution to national literature, and award those who have made significant contributions,' Azizi emphasized.

**A New Two Pillar Policy in the Persian Gulf? • Stimson Center**
The Stimson Center reports that Saudi Arabia's policy reversal is driven by the weakening of Iran's regional position. Iran's Axis of Resistance has been weakened, and the country is facing water shortages, economic sanctions, and a need for foreign investment. This shift in Iran's fortunes has created an opportunity for Riyadh, which is now more likely to accept a Saudi-led regional framework, as stated by Barbara Slavin, 'What shifts in geopolitics and national interests’ calculations have driven Riyadh’s dramatic policy reversal?' The weakening of Iran's position has made it less assertive, paving the way for a Saudi-led regional framework. According to Slavin, Iran's Vision 2030 has been impacted by its weakened position, with the country watching its neighbors with envy. The U.S. economic sanctions have also contributed to Iran's struggles, making it more likely to accept a Saudi-led framework.

**Shaheen: Delaying Recognition of Islamic Emirate No Longer Logical**
Suhail Shaheen, the ambassador of the Islamic Emirate in Qatar, stated that regional countries have begun engaging with the caretaker government in Afghanistan due to the 'current reality' of the Islamic Emirate.

**Race Against Time: Kabul's Groundwater May Run Dry by 2030**
According to a report by The Japan Times, Kabul's groundwater is at risk of running dry by 2030 due to population growth, climate change, and unregulated water extraction. Experts estimate that up to 80% of Kabul's groundwater is contaminated, and more than 100,000 unregulated wells extract water in the city, resulting in a 76-million-cubic-meter annual deficit. The Islamic Emirate's Ministry of Energy and Water has proposed a plan to transfer water from the Panjshir River, which would require a budget of $300 to $400 million. As The Japan Times notes, 'the situation in Kabul is clearly deteriorating' and urgent action is needed to address the water shortage.

**Amir Khan Muttaqi Set to Visit China and Iran in the Coming Days**
Amir Khan Muttaqi, the acting foreign minister of Afghanistan, is set to visit China and Iran in the coming days, according to a senior official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Muttaqi has received official invitations from both countries and is expected to participate in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit and the Tehran Dialogue Forum. Political analysts view these trips as part of the Islamic Emirate's efforts to gain recognition on regional and international levels, saying that participation in diplomatic gatherings allows them to share their views directly with the Islamic Emirate. As one analyst noted, 'Countries have their own interests, but the Islamic Emirate should act wisely to make the most of Afghanistan's security, geography, and weak economy through the support of countries like China, Russia, and Iran.' Despite some improvement in Afghanistan's relations with regional and global players, no country has yet officially recognized the interim government of Afghanistan.

**Report: 2.2 Million Afghan Girls Barred from Education Since 2022**
According to a report by Data Friendly Space, 2.2 million Afghan girls have been barred from education since the ban on girls' education beyond the sixth grade was imposed in March 2022. The report notes that the education system in Afghanistan is severely strained, with limited public schools and learning spaces, particularly affecting girls' education. If the ban continues until 2030, it could deny more than 4 million girls the right to secondary education. Marwa, one of the girls barred from attending school, said, 'Our demand is for schools to be reopened because we are facing an uncertain future.' Tafsir Siyahpoush, a women's rights activist, stated, 'Wherever women are needed to work, restrictions are increasing. We hope the Islamic Emirate and the international community stand honestly with the people of Afghanistan, especially women.' Zakiullah Mohammadi, a university lecturer, said, 'This is a fundamental need for the progress and development of Afghanistan. If schools and universities remain closed to our sisters, we will not have a bright future.'

**Fake Somaliland Recognition Video from the Nonexistent Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Misleads...**
A recent video claiming the Taliban-led Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has recognized Somaliland is entirely baseless, relying on fake impersonations of the nonexistent Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, deceptive visuals, and psychological propaganda. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was a Western-backed regime that ruled from 2004 until its collapse in 2021, following the Taliban's swift takeover. The Taliban has never recognized Somaliland and will never do so, as it contradicts their stance on the Palestinian struggle against Zionist occupation and would threaten the maritime movement of Muslim-majority countries. The Taliban shares strong ties with Iran and Yemen, and recognizing Somaliland would support the fragmentation efforts backed by the West and Gulf countries in the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea, thereby directly opposing the strategic interests of Iran and Yemen. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan's flag, adopted in 2021, is the only legitimate flag today, rendering the false recognition claim by Somaliland. Somaliland's pursuit of recognition is driven by opportunism, as they resort to fabricating diplomatic victories while vainly attempting to sell off Somalia's sovereign territories.

**Taliban-led Government Claims Year of Significant Achievements Despite Isolation**
The Taliban-led government of the 'Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan' (IEA) considers the outgoing 1403rd solar year (March 21, 2024 - March 20, 2025) to be a year of significant achievements. Despite being another year of political isolation and non-recognition, the IEA claims to have strengthened ties and expanded interaction with many countries in the region and worldwide. According to the IEA, the relationships that many countries have with Afghanistan are equivalent to recognition of the Islamic Emirate. Throughout the year, high-level delegations from other countries continued to visit Afghanistan, while IEA delegations visited neighboring countries and the region. In a notable development, the Iranian Foreign Minister led a high-level delegation to Kabul and met with the Prime Minister and other senior officials, marking the beginning of a new chapter in relations between Kabul and Tehran. Former government officials, lawyers, and some politicians who fled Afghanistan after the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government continued to return home. IEA leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, visiting northern provinces of the country for the first time since August 2021, urged local officials to serve the people honestly. Vice-Premier for Economy Abdul Ghani Baradar Akhund stated at a recent gathering of the Shia community in Kabul that the Islamic Emirate respects ethnic diversity and considers it a symbol of unity in the country. Against this backdrop, the IEA leadership continues to emphasize that it has fulfilled all the conditions of a legitimate state, but the United Nations justifies its refusal to transfer Afghanistan's seat to the IEA representative. 'We have strengthened our ties and expanded our interaction with many countries in the region and worldwide,' said the IEA. 'The relationships that many countries have with Afghanistan are equivalent to recognition of the Islamic Emirate,' they added.

**IEA Refuses to Recognize ICC Jurisdiction, Emphasizes Realistic Engagement**
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) has refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC), citing a lack of respect for mutual principles. The IEA also criticized the ICC for remaining silent on injustices. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) emphasized the importance of realistic engagement with Afghanistan, avoiding selective behavior. Pakistan announced it would expel Afghan refugees from Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The foreign ministers of 17 countries expressed concern over restrictions on women in Afghanistan, with the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) chief warning that curbs on women's education and work would result in long-term harm. Meanwhile, imports from Afghanistan to India surged, but exports declined since the IEA's takeover. Iran underlined support to Afghan investors, saying they could obtain residency in the country's free trade zones. 'We deal with Afghanistan based on realities,' said Tariq Ali Bakhit, the special representative of the OIC for Afghanistan. 'Pressure tactics not only failed to facilitate engagement but also drove nations and countries further apart,' said Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs. 'Afghanistan is part of the world and the Islamic Emirate is fully prepared for positive engagement with all based on national and Islamic interests,' said Maulvi Mohammad Yaqoob Mujahid, the acting minister of defence.
