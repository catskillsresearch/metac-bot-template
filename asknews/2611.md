**Countdown to 2030: Achieving global targets on disaster displacement**
A new report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) reveals that disasters triggered 264.8 million forced movements of people across 210 countries and territories between 2015 and 2024. In 2024 alone, disasters forced people to flee their homes nearly 45.8 million times, the highest annual figure on record. IDMC director Alexandra Bilak said, 'Disaster displacement is not a future problem. It's happening now, it's happening more often, and it can happen anywhere, although it is hitting the poorest the hardest.' The report highlights that while climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense, lack of preparedness, inadequate infrastructure, and high exposure to risks are also major factors in disaster displacement. The IDMC warns that displacement risk is likely to grow, with 100 million people globally at risk of internal displacement caused by disasters in any given year under a pessimistic warming scenario. Bilak added, 'Our window to act is closing. It's time to turn what we've learned from the data into political solutions and financial commitments.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**Trump cuts will reverse progress on AIDS**
The global AIDS epidemic is at risk of spiraling out of control due to the Trump administration's cuts to foreign assistance and recommitment to funding global health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of new HIV infections in 2023 was still more than three times the 2025 target of 370,000 or fewer new infections. If this trend continues, the target of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 will not be reached. UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima warned that the Trump funding freeze 'means that overnight one in every three dollars for fighting disease, preventing pandemics, has halted.' This has led to real-world consequences, including clinics shutting down and HIV, TB, and malaria efforts grinding to a halt. Byanyima estimated that 5,800 people are now being infected every day, up from 3,500, and that if the U.S. global health funding cuts become permanent, there will be an additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths globally by 2029. 'All the progress made over the last 25 years would be gone,' Byanyima warned. 'It would be a disaster for those countries with the highest HIV burden in Africa. But it would also be an unmitigated crisis for global health with devastating consequences too for rich countries.'

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**Japan Develops Artificial Blood for Emergency Care**
Scientists in Japan are developing a revolutionary medical experiment: artificial blood. This breakthrough could transform emergency care and save thousands of lives worldwide. The research, led by Professor Hiromi Sakai at the University of Medical Sciences in Nara, involves extracting hemoglobin from blood and encapsulating it in a synthetic membrane to protect it from oxidation and infection. The result is artificial cells that do not contain blood group antigens, making them universally compatible. This is a significant improvement over traditional blood transfusions, which require compatibility between donor and recipient. The artificial blood can be used in any patient, regardless of their blood type. Professor Teruyuki Komatsu, of Chuo University, is working on a complementary line of research: oxygen transporters based on human albumin, also encapsulated with hemoglobin. Studies with animals have shown that these solutions can stabilize blood pressure and treat critical conditions such as hemorrhages and strokes. The scientific community is now waiting for human clinical trials to begin. The artificial blood has a purple color, a result of the treatment applied to the hemoglobin. Initial tests in 2022 showed that the vesicles of hemoglobin were safe and capable of transporting oxygen in controlled conditions. A clinical trial with healthy humans is set to begin in 2025, with participants receiving between 100 and 400 milliliters of the artificial blood. If the results are favorable, further phases will be implemented, with the goal of achieving clinical implementation by 2030. The artificial blood is also durable, with a shelf life of up to two years at room temperature and up to five years if refrigerated. This would reduce blood waste and facilitate rapid access to transfusions in remote areas or during large-scale emergencies.

**New Antibiotic Enters Final Stage of Human Testing Against Deadly Bacterium**
A new antibiotic, zosurabalpin, developed by Roche against a widespread bacterium that causes severe clinical infections such as pneumonia and sepsis, has entered the final stage of human testing. The antibiotic, developed in collaboration with Harvard University, will be tested against the Acinetobacter baumannii bacterium, which has been identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an 'immediate threat'. Roche announced that its phase 3 trial will be a single, pivotal study involving approximately 400 patients from around the world who will be randomly assigned to receive zosurabalpin or standard treatment. According to Michael Lobritz, Roche's global head of infectious diseases, 'Our goal is to contribute to new innovations that help overcome antimicrobial resistance, one of the biggest public health problems worldwide.' Larry Tsai, senior vice president and global head of immunology and product development at Genentech, a unit of Roche, stated that 'the innovative biology in this study has the potential to reveal new information about the structure of bacterial membranes and may lead to the discovery of new antibiotics in the future.' It is expected that the drug will be approved by 2030. Sepsis is estimated to cause the deaths of approximately 11 million people worldwide each year, while community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is responsible for 3 to 4 million deaths annually, with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among the elderly.

**Concerns over the Accessibility of Biological Weapons Technology**
The increasing accessibility of AI and synthetic biology technologies may lead to a greater risk of misuse. For example, China's 'DeepSick' AI model was able to answer potentially hazardous questions about creating biological weapons without filtering them. This shows that ordinary people can easily access the methods of making weapons. Synthetic biology, which allows users to assemble genes like LEGO blocks, can also be easily accessed by the general public, who can purchase genetic components online and try to assemble them. Kim Hyun-soo, a policy developer at the National Center for Policy Research on Life Sciences, stated, 'As the barrier to entry for these technologies decreases, we are seeing a trend of deskillification. It is essential to spread ethical principles to enable ordinary people to use these technologies responsibly.'

**US Air Force Study Reveals Synthetic Viruses as Biological Weapons**
The US Air Force's Jason group has been studying synthetic recombinant viruses, including SARS-Cov-2 with HIV sequences, which are considered biological weapons. According to a confidential report, these viruses are more devastating than natural viruses and have the potential to be as destructive as atomic bombs. The studies on synthetic viruses conducted by the Pentagon remain classified, but a microbiologist, Ralph Baric, has revealed the 'recipe' for creating a dangerous coronavirus in a laboratory. The report also mentions a global vaccination plan by Bill Gates and a 2010 US Air Force document that explains the danger of chimera viruses like SARS infected with a HIV plasmid. The presence of HIV sequences in SARS-Cov-2 has raised concerns, and an expert, Francis Boyle, has warned about the use of genetic therapy as a biological weapon. The Jason group has increased its research on synthetic viruses, including the use of graphene oxide nanotubes in genetic vaccines, 8 months before the COVID-19 pandemic.

**NASA warns '100mn people in blast zone' as risk of asteroid hitting Earth increases**
NASA has warned that a 'city-killer' asteroid, 2024YR4, has an increased risk of hitting Earth, with 100 million people in the blast zone. The asteroid, measuring between 40 and 90 meters long, is currently moving away from Earth but is expected to loop around and return by 2032. Scientists estimate that the asteroid could pack a punch equivalent to around 500 atomic bombs. According to NASA's latest assessment, the probability of impact has increased from 2.2% to 2.6%, translating to a roughly one-in-38 chance of impact, as stated by NASA. '100 million people in the blast zone' is a stark reminder of the potential consequences of an asteroid impact.

**One in five girls born in 2030 will live to 100**
According to new research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), one in five girls born in 2030 is projected to live until at least 100 years old, rising to almost one in four for those born in 2047. For boys, the projections are less dramatic, with more than one in eight males born in 2030 expected to reach 100, increasing to about one in six by 2047. The figures are based on past trends in annual death registrations and assume improved mortality rates among elderly people. Kerry Gadsdon of the ONS said, 'The gap between male and female cohort life expectancy at birth has fallen over the past four decades. This is likely due to improvements in lifestyle, for example reduction in smoking rates and the working conditions of men over several decades, as well as advances in healthcare, for example the prevention and treatment of heart disease.' The ONS published the data to 'allow us to understand the size of the projected population at older ages, which is important for policy making and service planning.'

**Cancer Cases Projected to Reach 30 Million by 2040, with Latin America at High Risk**
The International Union for Cancer Control (UICC) estimates that there could be over 30 million new cancer cases worldwide by 2040, with one in five people developing the disease. In 2022, there were over 19.9 million new cases. The UICC and Amgen Mexico have joined the 'Unidos por lo Único' campaign, which aims to reduce the global cancer burden and provide person-centered care by 2027. Dr. Máx Saráchaga, medical director of Amgen Mexico, said, 'Attention centered on people promotes equity and inclusion and aims to provide higher-quality care to patients.' He also emphasized the importance of early detection and prevention, citing the high incidence of breast cancer in Mexico, particularly in women over 50. Amgen is working on biotechnological treatments that can modify the course of the disease and improve patient quality of life. 'These treatments use biology and the body's capabilities to inhibit the reproduction of malignant cells or contain the disease's domino effect,' Dr. Saráchaga explained.
