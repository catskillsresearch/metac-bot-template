**US House Committee Includes Provision to Ban State AI Regulations**
The US House Energy and Commerce Committee has included a provision in a comprehensive tax and spending bill that would ban states from regulating artificial intelligence (AI) for 10 years. If passed, this would benefit many US tech giants and AI companies. Open AI, Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google, and others have argued that state-level AI regulations would hinder technological progress. Meta, in a letter to the White House in April, noted that state regulations would increase compliance costs for AI companies. The proposed bill would prohibit the creation of any laws or regulations related to AI models, systems, and automated decision-making systems for 10 years. However, this provision may not make it into the final bill as it is not related to the budget. Despite this, the inclusion of this provision in the bill within a month of AI company executives calling for federal legislation to ban state AI regulations suggests that the Republican leadership is supportive of this measure. Critics, including AI safety groups and experts critical of tech giants, warn that this provision would hinder states' efforts to promote safe and ethical AI use.

**House Committee Aims to Ban States From Regulating AI | PYMNTS.com**
The House Energy and Commerce Committee is drafting a bill to prevent states from regulating artificial intelligence, according to Bloomberg. The proposed bill would place a 10-year moratorium on state regulation in the AI field. However, the language is unlikely to be included in the tax bill due to parliamentary procedures. The move will show where key Republicans stand on AI regulation, with tech executives encouraging federal legislation to prohibit states from creating their own rules. Proponents of state-level regulation argue that state lawmakers should be free to pass laws promoting AI safety and preventing misuse. Tech companies, such as Meta, Uber, and J.P. Morgan Chase, have expressed concerns about fragmented state laws, citing increased costs and stifled innovation. Colorado's AI law, set to take effect in 2026, has faced backlash from industry groups and consumer advocates.

**Colorado Officials Seek Delay in AI Regulations Start Date | PYMNTS.com**
Colorado's Artificial Intelligence Act, signed into law in May 2024, is the first comprehensive AI regulations in the US. The law imposes a general duty of care to protect individuals from AI-driven differentiated treatment. However, businesses and consumer groups have criticized the law as too rigid and vague, while consumer advocates argue it doesn't go far enough. Despite negotiations, lawmakers ran out of time to make changes before the current legislative session ended. The regulations are set to take effect on February 1, 2026, but a special session may be needed to delay or make changes. Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez introduced a compromise bill to loosen regulations and delay implementation, but it was later killed after facing complaints from businesses and consumer groups.

**Reconciliation text includes $500 million for modernization and AI at Commerce**
The House Energy and Commerce Committee included $500 million for federal IT modernization and artificial intelligence in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill text. This will allow the Commerce Department to replace or update legacy business systems and deploy AI through 2035. The text also includes a prohibition on state-level enforcement of AI laws and regulations for the next decade. According to Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the R Street Institute, 'A moratorium on new AI regulations will give this market time to grow and ensure American AI innovators can invest and compete against China and the rest of the world.'

**Illinois Anti-Discrimination Law to Address AI Goes Into Effect on 1 January 2026**
Illinois House Bill 3773 (HB 3773) amends the Illinois Human Rights Act to prohibit employers from using artificial intelligence (AI) that has a discriminatory effect on employees. Effective 1 January 2026, Illinois employers cannot use AI that has a discriminatory effect on employees, '[w]ith respect to recruitment, hiring, promotion, renewal of employment, selection for training or apprenticeship, discharge, discipline, tenure, or the terms, privileges, or conditions of employment.' Employers must also notify employees and applicants when using AI during these processes and explain their use of AI tools in a way that is easily understandable. Illinois employers should consider working with counsel to prepare these mandatory disclosures to ensure compliance with HB 3773 by 1 January 2026.

**State AI Regulation Ban Tucked Into Republican Tax, Fiscal Bill**
A powerful House committee has included language in the President's tax and spending bill that would prevent states from regulating artificial intelligence. This move would benefit many of the US's largest tech and AI companies, including Meta, which has argued that state AI regulations would raise compliance costs. According to Meta's April comments to the White House, state-level rules would be 'hamstringing' to the burgeoning technology.

**The Blogs: Chaos in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policies**
The US Department of Commerce has announced that the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion ('AI Diffusion Rule') will be replaced by a 'much simpler rule.' The original regulation, issued by President Biden in January, was set to take effect on May 15, 2025, but its complexity and potential impact on US companies caused significant turmoil. The new rule's timing may be related to President Trump's planned trip to the Middle East, where countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE were placed in 'Tier 2' and were concerned about the limitations imposed by the AI Diffusion Rule. The US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) will be responsible for enforcing the new rule, and the proposed budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 increases BIS funding by more than 50% to 'protect the Nation's technological competitiveness and counter threats from China.' However, the budget also introduces significant cuts to other agencies and programs, including the National Science Foundation. The key question now is whether maintaining current funding levels for AI basic research is sufficient for the US to retain its global leadership.

**Tech execs give Congress AI wish list**
Tech executives from Microsoft, OpenAI, and Advanced Micro Devices appeared before Congress on May 8, 2025, urging looser regulation and heavier investment in energy to support the growth of artificial intelligence. The executives, including Microsoft President Brad Smith and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, expressed concerns about the US's ability to compete with China in the AI race. Smith said, 'The country must recruit and train skilled labor like electricians and pipe fitters that are in short supply.' He also noted that the US's federal wetlands permit process is a major challenge for building out AI infrastructure, taking 18-24 months to complete. The executives also discussed the need for an export strategy for AI and the development of industry standards. While Smith, Intrator, and Su supported the development of standards by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Altman said, 'I don't think we need it,' but added, 'It can be helpful.'

**Is Colorado Getting Cold Feet About AI Regulation? New Bill Would Loosen Groundbreaking Law Set to Take Effect Next Year**
A new bill, SB 318, has been introduced in the Colorado state legislature to delay and soften the state's groundbreaking AI regulation law. The law, set to take effect on February 1, 2026, prohibits employers from using AI to discriminate against workers and requires companies to take measures to avoid algorithmic discrimination. SB 318 would push the enforcement date back to January 1, 2027, and exempt startups and small developers with less than $10 million in outside investment and under $5 million in annual revenue. It would also limit the rules around AI in hiring and raise the bar for individuals to contest decisions where AI was a factor. Governor Polis had expressed concerns about the law's potential impact on innovation and competitiveness, and an Artificial Intelligence Impact Task Force had recommended revising the law before it takes effect.

**Korean Lawmaker Proposes 3-Year Delay for AI Regulation**
Democratic Party of Korea representative Hwang Jeong-a has proposed a bill to delay the regulation of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Basic Act for three years. The bill aims to exclude the industry promotion regulation from the regulation and postpone the business operator's obligation regulation for a certain period. This is to prevent excessive regulation from stifling technological progress. The bill targets the transparency, stability, and high-impact AI-related clauses for a three-year delay. If the bill passes, the AI Basic Act will be enforced from January 22, 2026, but the regulation-related clauses will be enforced from January 22, 2029. The bill has sparked attention as major presidential hopefuls from the Democratic Party have also proposed AI promotion-related pledges. However, the bill's passage is uncertain due to conflicting opinions in the parliamentary committee.

**Artificial Intelligence: A Regulatory Storm Brewing in 2025**
The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is expected to see significant regulatory activity in 2025, particularly in the United States, according to Mark Wiedeworth, a policy and regulation expert. In 2023, California passed 18 new AI laws, but tech companies are pushing back against these regulations, according to TechCrunch. Wiedeworth, a former chief information security officer for California and Colorado, and a former deputy assistant secretary for cybersecurity under President Barack Obama, said, 'In California alone, 12 new AI-related laws have been signed into effect in the past two months.' Wiedeworth emphasized the growing concerns about cybersecurity, saying, 'There are huge concerns about the security of AI.' Hani Friedman, a former dean of the University of California, Berkeley's College of Information and a vocal advocate for AI regulation, said, 'The pressure from big American companies on AI regulations in Western countries is intense. They're trying to kill any legislation or write it to their advantage. It's a ruthless move.' On the other hand, outside the West, companies like Meta and OpenAI have received warm welcomes from many politicians eager to invest in AI. Akrit Vashistha, a senior advisor to the Indian government's AI initiative, said, 'Regulation is not even a conversation.' Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, told the US Senate in 2023, 'New technologies often bring new challenges, and companies must ensure we build and deploy products responsibly.' Zuckerberg advocated for self-regulation in AI, citing 'we can build in safeguards in these systems.' Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said during a visit to New Delhi, 'Self-regulation is important.' However, he also warned that 'the world shouldn't be left entirely in the hands of companies, given the power of this technology.'

**What Does The 2025 Artificial Intelligence Legislative And Regulatory Landscape Look Like For Employers?**
In the absence of federal regulation, several states have passed or are considering legislation to mitigate the risk of algorithmic discrimination in employment decisions made by AI systems. These laws impose a duty of reasonable care on employers to mitigate and assess the risk of algorithmic discrimination. Key provisions include direct notifications to individuals who are the subject of a decision made by an AI system, the chance to correct data input into the AI system, and appeal adverse consequential decisions. Many of the bills include impact or risk assessment requirements to check for bias against protected groups. Notable enacted laws include the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, which takes effect on February 1, 2026, and the Illinois Human Rights Act, which amends the Illinois Human Rights Act to protect employees against discrimination from, and require transparency about, the use of AI in employment-related decisions. Pending bills and regulations include the California Privacy Protection Agency's draft regulations on the use of AI and automated decision-making technology, and the Texas Responsible AI Governance Act, which would establish obligations for developers, deployers, and distributors of 'high-risk AI systems'.

**Artificial Intelligence - 2024 Year in Review**
In 2024, there were significant developments in the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI). Three states passed comprehensive AI legislation, while others passed laws regulating specific AI uses. Sector-specific regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Department of Justice (DOJ), continued enforcement efforts under existing laws and regulations. The SEC fined two investment advisers for misrepresenting AI use, while the FTC issued warnings about making false or unsubstantiated claims about AI. States took varying approaches to AI regulation, with Colorado passing a law to prevent algorithmic discrimination and Utah requiring transparency in AI use. The DOJ updated its guidance on corporate compliance programs to include a focus on AI, and the New York Department of Financial Services released guidance on AI cybersecurity risks. Internationally, the European Commission signed the first binding international AI treaty, and the United Nations adopted a resolution promoting 'safe, secure and trustworthy' AI systems.

**Japanese Government to Investigate and Guide Businesses on AI Development**
The Japanese government has revealed the full contents of a bill on artificial intelligence (AI) that will be submitted to the regular Diet session on January 24. The bill aims to allow the government to investigate and guide businesses if there is a risk of developing or using AI for criminal or other malicious purposes. However, the bill does not include any provisions for penalties. The rapid spread of generative AI, which can create various content using large amounts of learned data, has prompted many countries to create regulations. The European Union (EU) has already implemented the world's first comprehensive AI regulation law, which will take effect in August 2024. The Japanese government has been working on its own AI regulations, and this bill is a key step in that process.

**Artificial Intelligence | UK Regulatory Outlook January 2025**
The UK government is expected to introduce its first artificial intelligence (AI) legislation in 2025, focusing on AI safety, particularly for 'frontier models'. The bill will require developers to share these models for testing before public release and put existing voluntary commitments onto a statutory footing. The government hopes the law will 'reduce regulatory uncertainty for AI developers, strengthen public trust and boost business confidence.' The AI Opportunities Action Plan, released on January 13, 2025, outlines 50 recommendations for the government, including the importance of data in underpinning AI development and the need to urgently reform UK intellectual property law on text and data mining. The government has said it will 'take forward' the plan's proposals. The EU's AI Act, which affects a wider range of businesses, will continue to set the tone for AI regulation. The UK's consultation on changes to copyright law, including an 'opt-out' text and data mining exception, is open until February 25, 2025. The interplay between AI and IP will be considered by the English courts in several cases, including Getty Images v Stability AI and the Emotional Perception patent case.
