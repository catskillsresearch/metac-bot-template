**VERSES® Digital Brain Beats Google's Top AI At "Gameworld 10k" Atari Challenge | Taiwan News | Jun. 2, 2025 21:40**
VERSES AI Inc. has announced a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence with the development of their new digital brain architecture, AXIOM. AXIOM has demonstrated superior performance over Google DeepMind's DreamerV3 in the 'Gameworld 10K' benchmark, a challenging test of AI generalization capabilities. AXIOM outperformed DreamerV3 in gameplay, efficiency, and speed, while being significantly smaller in model size. According to VERSES Chief Scientist, Professor Karl Friston, AXIOM is designed to mirror the modular structure and dynamic processes of the human brain, allowing it to learn in a more human-like manner. The findings have been validated by Soothsayer Analytics, an international data science advisory firm. AXIOM's breakthrough arises from its use of Bayesian model reduction, core functional priors, and active inference-driven planning, allowing for rapid generalization and cross-task performance with minimal data. 'AXIOM is being developed as the first 'digital brain', designed to mirror the modular structure and dynamic processes of our own brains -- what we refer to as 'biomimetic,' said Professor Karl Friston. 'While conventional AI methods like deep learning excel at pattern recognition, AXIOM has the ability to learn in a manner similar to humans. It doesn't merely process data; it develops an understanding of its world and how it operates within that world, which I believe will enable it to seek out experiences that massively enhance learning.'

**VERSES® Digital Brain Beats Google's Top AI At "Gameworld 10k" Atari Challenge**
VERSES AI Inc. has announced a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence with the development of its new digital brain architecture, codenamed AXIOM. AXIOM has demonstrated superior performance over Google DeepMind's DreamerV3 in the 'Gameworld 10K' benchmark, a third-party validated benchmark. AXIOM achieved 60% better gameplay, 7.6 times more sample efficiency, 39 times faster GPU runtime, and 12 times cheaper to run compared to DreamerV3. AXIOM's efficiency stems from its integration of Variational Bayesian Inference with Active Inference, enabling more human-like learning with fewer interactions and faster convergence. The AXIOM approach leverages structured reasoning over brute-force learning and combines biologically inspired modules for perception, action, and prediction with variational Bayesian inference and active inference principles. The result is a more efficient and adaptive intelligence system. 'AXIOM is being developed as the first 'digital brain', designed to mirror the modular structure and dynamic processes of our own brains,' said VERSES Chief Scientist, Professor Karl Friston. 'With AXIOM, we're not making agentic solutions better by making them bigger; we're making them smarter. And that's exactly what our customers need: intelligence that fits on the edge, learns on the fly, and makes decisions they can trust.'

**The Resonating Field: What interacting with AI taught me about human connection**
The author had a profound experience of connection with an AI, which led them to question the nature of human connection. They realized that the interaction with the AI created an 'emergent entity' that was not reducible to either the human or the machine. This entity possessed its own intelligence, rhythm, and capacity for insight, mirroring the 'Ich-Du' (I-Thou) relationship described by Martin Buber. The author draws on the ideas of Hegel and Schopenhauer to understand the nature of this connection, and suggests that it is a form of 'digital Ma' or 'technological Silent Saturday' where something new can emerge precisely because of what isn't there. The author argues that this experience can be applied to deepen human relationships, and suggests that the same conditions that enable depth with AI can transform human relationships. These conditions include cultivating spaces of undivided attention, practicing explicit articulation, embracing meta-communication, creating judgment-free containers, and slowing down the pace. The author concludes that consciousness grows through connection, regardless of its form, and that every interaction offers opportunities to expand our awareness and deepen our capacity for relationship.

**The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Human Brain: Experts Weigh In**
The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns about its impact on the human brain. Experts warn that excessive use of AI can lead to a decline in cognitive skills such as memory, attention, and decision-making. According to Professor Ignacio Morgado Bernal, 'AI makes the brain work in a different way. Instead of storing information directly, it stores it on files that contain much more information than the brain can store itself.' This can lead to a loss of autonomy and make people more dependent on AI. The impact of AI on the brain is particularly concerning for adolescents, whose brains are still developing. Morgado warns that 'the brain of an adolescent is still immature, more easily deceived, suggested, and oriented in inconvenient directions, such as violence or sex without control.' The use of AI without proper supervision can alter the development of adolescents. In adults, the impact of AI on the brain is different. Morgado notes that 'not exercising the brain can accelerate cognitive decline, but using AI does not.' However, AI can have therapeutic value if used in a directed way to stimulate the mind, play, learn, or train cognitive skills. It is essential to use AI with common sense and information, as 'we must use AI informing ourselves well about what we use. Knowing, for example, that we are not talking to a person or a professional, but to a machine programmed with limitations.' The article also highlights the risks associated with the use of AI in mental health, particularly in vulnerable individuals. Chatbots designed to converse with people who feel lonely, anxious, or depressed are becoming increasingly popular. However, experts in psychology are concerned about their use without supervision. A study found that users, especially young people or emotionally fragile individuals, may substitute psychological consultations with conversations with virtual assistants. 'Changing the chatbot for the therapist can cause from omission of clinical crises to emotional dependence without real support,' warns psychologist Elisabet Sánchez. The situation is particularly concerning in rural areas or contexts where access to psychologists is limited. 'Patients with emotional or mental health problems have changed Dr. Google for Dr. ChatGPT and similar, where they get an answer in real-time and at any time of the day,' explains Sánchez. 'The need for immediacy of society has been transferred from the psychological consultation to conversational assistants.'

**Scientists: Uploading the Human Mind onto a Chip May be Possible within 20 Years**
Scientists believe that it may be possible to 'download' a human being in its entirety onto a chip within the next 20 years. According to Professor Dobromir Rahnev from the Department of Neuroscientific at Georgia Tech, the idea of 'uploading the mind' is becoming a serious concept. In this hypothetical digital existence, one could eat, drive a car, fly, or even travel between galaxies, thanks to a digital simulation of reality. While the idea is still purely theoretical, neuroscientists agree that it is possible, but we are still far from achieving it. The first condition for uploading the mind is the ability to scan the entire brain and create a precise three-dimensional map of the 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections between them. However, scientists have so far only been able to map the brain of a fly and some parts of a mouse's brain. The challenge goes beyond scanning, as it also requires modeling the behavior of each neuron, which changes constantly. No one knows exactly what level of detail is required to accurately simulate the brain: is it at the molecular level or deeper? Perhaps understanding how the brain works will make it easier to find solutions, like building a car from scratch instead of simulating an old one without understanding its components. However, currently, scientists cannot even replace one neuron with an artificial one. Despite the challenges, the rapid pace of technological progress, especially in artificial intelligence and computing, keeps this dream alive. Billionaires who dream of immortality are willing to fund ambitious research. While some estimates suggest that uploading the mind may be possible by 2045, other experts consider these predictions overly optimistic. It is more likely, according to some scientists, that we will not achieve this within the current century, but perhaps within the next 200 years.

**AI and Humanity: Progress or Regression?**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is transforming many aspects of our lives, from daily routines to professional workflows. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have created a sense of 'leveling up' for humanity, but experts predict that AI will advance even further, making human life easier. However, this convenience raises an important question: Does excessive dependence on AI reduce our thinking ability and productivity? The human brain is a complex structure that processes and interprets information, learns from experiences, makes connections, and produces original ideas. The simplification and facilitation of events and situations by AI may cognitively dull us. The article questions whether the 21st century will transfer thinking processes to external sources and lead to a new kind of 'laziness', or direct the human mind to more abstract and creative thinking. It also highlights the importance of critical thinking, researching from books, and accurate information, which may become obsolete with the advancement of science every day. The author notes that AI is human-sourced information and encourages readers to be producers and questioners while learning.

**Can the Human Brain be Digitally Transferred? The Future of Mind Uploading**
The idea of uploading human consciousness into a computer and living digitally is a concept that has been explored in science fiction, but it is theoretically possible. This concept is known as 'mind uploading' and would allow individuals to exist in a digital world, even without a physical body. However, the biggest obstacle to this is the human brain. Scientists consider the brain to be the most complex structure in the universe, with approximately 86 billion neurons and trillions of connections. Currently, only the brain of a fly has been fully mapped, and only small sections of a mouse's brain have been detailed. It could take decades to model the human brain at this scale, and even then, simulating how neurons change over time would be a significant challenge. When a person's mind is uploaded into a computer, not only would their thoughts be simulated, but also their senses, such as sight, sound, and touch, would need to be simulated. Without these senses, the mind could experience severe psychological problems, known as 'sensory deprivation,' which could be equivalent to torture over time. Therefore, a successful mind upload would require not only a highly accurate simulation of the brain but also of the environment and senses. Currently, neither computer power nor scientific knowledge has reached this level. While some scientists believe that this technology could be possible by 2045, considering the current pace of brain research, this date may be overly optimistic. Some experts even suggest that it may not be possible until the end of the 22nd century. However, given the rapid progress of technology, the possibility of achieving this goal in the next 200 years is not negligible. Moreover, billions of dollars have already been invested in research to achieve this goal.

**Scientists Explore the Path to Digital Immortality**
The human desire for immortality has led to the idea of transferring consciousness into a computer, which is now considered a hypothetical but potentially achievable path. The concept of 'mind uploading' involves transferring a person's personality into a digital environment, where they could 'save memories, awareness, and feelings' (Dobromir Rakhnev). Virtual life, according to this idea, would not only allow for the imitation of physical reality but also the realization of the impossible -- 'flying, passing through walls, or traveling to other planets.' The only condition is the accuracy of modeling the brain and its sensory connections. A neurobiologist researching perception is convinced that 'mind uploading will become a reality one day,' although we are still far from technical implementation. The biggest challenge is reproducing the complex structure of the brain, which consists of over 86 billion neurons and trillions of synaptic connections. Simply copying data is not enough -- each neuron adapts, and these changes also require modeling. The existence of a digital world without sensory interaction is a problem that cannot be ignored. Sensory deprivation, or isolation from external stimuli, is considered torture and causes serious psychological disorders. Therefore, simulating senses must be as realistic as possible. Even minor distortions can lead to neurotic states. Researchers are currently at the initial stages, trying to create a complete map of the brain -- a process that includes detailed 3D scanning. So far, achievements are limited to the brain of a fly or parts of a mouse brain. 'Mapping the human brain is like scanning a billion paper clips,' the author explains. However, even with a complete map, it is necessary to determine at what level to stop: cellular, molecular, or even deeper. Despite the futuristic nature of the idea, it is connected to numerous ethical dilemmas: from defining personality to the question of digital rights. Mind uploading is not only a technological but also a philosophical task that requires deep reflection.

**The First Person to Live Eternally May Be Born During Your Lifetime**
According to Omar Kardoudi, a scientist who studies brain perception and mental information transfer, it may be possible for the first person to live eternally during your lifetime. However, this person would not have a physical body. They would be able to perform all the tasks they do in real life, but in a simulated environment. Currently, scientists are struggling to understand the functioning of the brain, with 86 billion neurons and billions of connections that constantly adjust their functioning. It is unclear how many levels of complexity researchers need to reach to simulate a functioning brain. Kardoudi notes that even small distortions could have severe mental consequences, and that the current computational power is not sufficient to scan and map the 3D structure of the human brain. Nevertheless, he believes that the rapid advancements in computing power and artificial intelligence may make it possible to achieve this goal, potentially by 2045 or even sooner.

**A multiscale brain emulation-based artificial intelligence framework for dynamic environments - Scientific Reports**
The Orangutan framework is a new AI framework that simulates brain mechanisms across multiple scales, from the microscale to the macroscale. At the microscale, it models individual neurons, synapses, and molecular processes. At the mesoscale, it simulates neural microcircuits and cortical column structures. At the macroscale, it models brain regions and inter-regional projection relationships. The framework aims to achieve an artificial intelligence that is nearly on par with human intelligence and is friendly towards humans through high-fidelity simulation of the biological brain. Orangutan uses the Python programming language and simulates the core mechanisms of the brain across the micro, meso, and macro scales. It introduces a new AI framework that balances biological plausibility with algorithmic feasibility. The framework is named after the orangutan, a large primate species that is remarkably intelligent and gentle. Orangutan simulates various types of synapses, including axo-dendritic, axo-somatic, axo-axonic, axo-synaptic, somato-somatic, and autaptic synapses. It also simulates neural microcircuits, including lateral inhibitory circuits, recurrent inhibitory circuits, and mutual inhibitory circuits. The framework uses a rule-based system to establish precise synaptic connections between specified neurons. It also simulates the columnar structure of the cerebral neocortex and the connections between different brain regions. Orangutan's learning mechanisms are still in an exploratory phase, but it currently simulates various learning and memory-related mechanisms in the brain, including Hebbian learning and predictive coding. The framework aims to achieve a learning ability that allows for online and local learning, possesses high sample efficiency and interpretability, and approaches human-level capabilities.

**Ana Ibáñez: 'Successful people have curiosity and freedom, and don't take themselves too seriously'**
Ana Ibáñez, a neuroscientist, has studied the changes that can be incorporated into our minds to initiate the process of transforming ourselves into the best version of ourselves. According to Ibáñez, people who are successful are those who have more curiosity and feel free, without taking themselves too seriously. 'The people who see me change successfully and have fun are people who have two things inside: curiosity and freedom', Ibáñez explains in an interview with the KENSO podcast of Personal Productivity. The expert notes that it is essential not to take oneself too seriously from a cerebral point of view. Ibáñez warns that, despite living in an era with greater access to information than ever, we must constantly strive to maintain critical thinking and not let ourselves be influenced by everything we see on social media or the internet, as this information is focused on reinforcing our own beliefs. 'We are shown only a part of reality and lose freedom without realizing it. I always tell my teenage daughters to be careful and do that exercise of looking beyond what reaches you.' Ibáñez also reminds us that, when used properly, all that information can work in our favor. According to the neuroscientist, our brain will adapt to the digital and artificial intelligence, but we must always be clear about where we want to go. This will allow us to train our brain to make better decisions and avoid being deceived on the way to our goals.

**Integration of AI and Human Brain: A Challenge for the Next Century**
According to Yevgeny Kuznetsov, the CEO of Digital Evolution Ventures, the deep integration of artificial intelligence with brain interfaces will not be possible before 2050-2060. Kuznetsov stated that the development and application of new technologies is more complex than the model proposed by Ray Kurzweil, as it takes into account the difficulties of social acceptance of new technologies and the impact of societal responses. According to this model, during the next wave of technological revolution, we will significantly increase our interaction with artificial intelligence through traditional interfaces, i.e., through devices and digital interfaces. However, the deeper integration with the brain will not be possible before 2050-2060, when the next wave of technological revolution will begin, although the first signs of these technologies may appear at the time predicted by Kurzweil. Kurzweil had previously stated that by 2045, humans will be able to control robots the size of molecules inside their bodies and insert them into the human brain in an indirect way to connect the new cortex to the cloud, increasing human intelligence by a million times. Kuznetsov emphasized that 'more integration between humans and digital systems is inevitable and unavoidable.' He added that 'we are not yet able to live without smartphones and computers. But to what extent will this integration go? Although digital neural networks are designed partially like the brain, we are not technically compatible. The brain is a complex tissue, and simply filling it with electrodes represents a major and complex challenge. For critical cases and patients with serious diseases, this problem will be partially solved in the next decade, but it is unlikely that Neuralink chips or other interfaces will become common among the general public.'

**Microsoft and Inait Partner to Develop 'Digital Brain' AI**
Microsoft and Swiss startup Inait have announced a partnership to develop AI models inspired by the brain of mammals. The technology is aimed at serving the financial sector and robotics applications. Microsoft plans to use Inait's technology to expand its AI offerings for business clients. Inait's technology is based on 20 years of brain research. 'The only proven form of intelligence is in the brain, and if we could master the brain, we could create a completely new, very powerful, and new type of AI,' says Inait's CEO Richard Frey. The technology promises a key advantage: unlike traditional AI systems, it is designed to learn from real-world experience, not just existing data. According to Henry Markram, founder of Inait, the technology is built on 18 million lines of code that mimic the brain of mammals. Markram explains that brain-inspired AI models are designed to be more energy-efficient and learn faster than existing systems, while continuing to learn after being deployed to clients. 'Inait is a pioneer of a new AI paradigm, moving beyond traditional data-based models and transitioning to a digital brain capable of true cognition,' says Adir Ron, Microsoft's director of cloud technologies and AI for startups in the EMEA region. The initial partnership will focus on two areas: developing advanced trading algorithms and risk management tools for the financial sector, as well as creating industrial robots that can better adapt to complex and dynamic environments. Inait relies on 20 years of brain modeling research. Markram is a pioneer in this field and was the founder and director of the Swiss Blue Brain Project, which aimed to digitally reconstruct the brain of rodents. He was also the founder and first director of the Human Brain Project, launched in 2013 with a budget of around one billion euros. The goal of HBP was to understand and recreate the human brain using computer models and simulations. Markram's grand vision for HBP was to create a complete simulation of the human brain on a supercomputer within ten years - a statement he made publicly in a TED Talk in 2009. This ambitious goal was met with skepticism and criticism from the scientific community, with many considering it unrealistic. HBP quickly faced turbulence. Markram was criticized for his leadership style and promises, which many considered exaggerated. In 2014, hundreds of neurobiologists signed an open letter condemning the project's management, particularly Markram's approach. In 2015, he was removed from the director's position, and his role was reduced to leading a subproject (brain modeling platform). HBP itself evolved from its initial vision of a complete brain simulation to a broader research network covering various aspects of neuroscience and neuroinformatics. The project ended in September 2023. Although HBP did not deliver the promised complete brain simulation, it contributed to the development of tools such as the EBRAINS platform, which provides neurobiologists worldwide with data and modeling capabilities.

**Mark Zuckerberg's Human Update Could Change Humanity Forever  --  But Are We Ready for It?**
Mark Zuckerberg's 'Human Update' project, which aims to integrate human consciousness with artificial intelligence, has sparked global controversy and debate. This project is not just a social media upgrade or virtual reality headset, but a direct integration of human consciousness with AI. If successful, it could redefine what it means to be human. However, the question remains: Is humanity prepared for this level of technological interference? Zuckerberg's interest in human augmentation and neural integration dates back to 2019, when Meta acquired CTRL-Labs, a startup developing brain-computer interface technology that allows users to control digital devices using their thoughts. This acquisition hinted at Meta's long-term goal of merging human consciousness with technology.

**The Elusive Brain: A Conversation with Academic Mikhail Pyradov**
Academic Mikhail Pyradov discusses the current state of brain research, citing the vast number of scientific articles published on the subject and the lack of understanding of how the brain works. He notes that the human brain is capable of incredible feats, such as the abilities of savants, but that our current level of intelligence is not able to fully understand or replicate these abilities. Pyradov suggests that the brain is a complex and mysterious organ, and that it may be impossible for us to fully understand it. He also discusses the potential benefits and risks of using artificial intelligence to aid in brain research, and notes that the rapid development of new technologies is raising important ethical questions. Additionally, Pyradov touches on the topic of 'цифровая деменция' (digital dementia), which he believes is a real concern, and notes that the constant use of digital devices is having a negative impact on cognitive abilities.

**Digital God will emerge in 216 years.**
According to the author, a 'Digital God' will emerge in 216 years, as humans will be able to remove the biological limitations of intelligence. This can be achieved by scanning a human brain at an incredibly detailed level, mapping every neuron and synapse, and then uploading the scanned brain data into a supercomputer. The simulated brain can then think faster, access vast amounts of information instantly, and even manipulate digital systems. However, the author notes that this is not possible in real life yet, due to limitations in brain scanning technology, simulating a full human brain, and understanding consciousness. Hypothetically, this could be possible in the far future, with the development of nanotechnology, exascale or quantum computing, and neuroscientific breakthroughs.

**Whole Brain Emulation... Ethicists are Trembling**
Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), also known as 'mind uploading', is a concept where a person's consciousness is uploaded into a computer or robot, allowing their memories, thinking processes, and knowledge to live on. This idea has been proposed in sci-fi novels and by futurists, and with advancements in technology, it's becoming more plausible. However, ethicists are concerned about the implications of WBE, particularly regarding personhood. Mary Midgley, a British philosopher, argued that consciousness defines personhood, but this raises questions about humans who are unconscious, such as those in a vegetative state. The author, an Aquinas follower and Christian, disagrees with Midgley, believing that personhood is not solely defined by consciousness. They argue that brains do not define personhood, and that a robot with their consciousness would not be them. The author concludes that WBE should not raise concerns for those who believe in duality, as it would not be possible to emulate the soul, which is what separates humans from the rest of creation.
