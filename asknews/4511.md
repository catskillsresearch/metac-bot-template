**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**AI on Humanity: Indian Professor Warns of a Bleak Future**
Indian-origin computer science professor Subhash Kak has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) could replace humans in almost all jobs in the future. According to him, 'even if robots are not fully conscious, they will be able to perform most of our roles, from office decisions to everyday tasks.' Professor Kak predicts that AI will lead to such high unemployment that people will be reluctant to have children, resulting in a population decline to 100 million by 2300 or 2380, which is roughly the same as the current population of the UK. He also believes that cities like New York and London will become ghost towns. Professor Kak's warning is in line with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's previous statements about AI and declining birth rates being a threat to humanity. Musk has suggested that humans should colonize space to ensure the survival of the human species in case of a crisis on Earth. Professor Kak has also discussed these dangers in his book The Age of Artificial Intelligence, where he explains how AI is no longer limited to business but is being used by ordinary people, which could impact job opportunities in the future. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has downplayed these fears, saying that technology does not eliminate jobs but changes their nature. History has shown that every technological revolution has created new types of employment.

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Will AI Wipe Out Humanity? Indian-Origin Expert Issues Apocalyptic Warning**
Indian-origin computer science professor Subhash Kak has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to a dystopian future where the world population shrinks to 100 million by 2300 or 2380. Kak, who works at Oklahoma State University, predicts that AI will replace most jobs, making it difficult for people to raise children due to a shortage of employment opportunities. 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced. Literally everything, even decision-making in offices, will be replaced,' he said. This could lead to a collapse in birth rates, with people reluctant to have children who would grow up to be unemployed. Kak's prediction echoes that of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has long warned about the dangers of AI and declining birth rates. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reassured global leaders that history has shown that work does not disappear due to technology, but its nature changes and new types of jobs are created.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Professor Subhash Kak, a computer science expert, warns that AI could lead to a devastating impact on the human population, potentially shrinking it to 100 million by 2300. He attributes this to AI replacing jobs, making it difficult for people to have children who will grow up with employment opportunities. Kak points to AI as the culprit, saying it will replace 'everything', including decision-making in offices. He notes that demographers suggest the world population could collapse, and he agrees, stating that the world will be devastated. Kak also mentions that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who may be unemployed in the future. He refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential for humanity to go extinct.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, including decision-making in offices, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that demographers are predicting a population collapse due to AI, and that the great cities of the world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to 100 million. He also notes that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, and suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing space may be a viable option to ensure humanity's survival.

**The World's Population: A Complex Tapestry of Human Experience**
The world's population has reached over 8 billion people, with a total of around 107 billion people having lived on Earth throughout history. The first billion was reached in 1800, the second in the early 20th century, and the sixth in the year 2000. According to the UN, the population is expected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050. To put this number into perspective, if all people were lined up in a row, the line would be over 3.5 million kilometers long. The author of the article came across a website that displays real-time statistics, including the current population, births, and deaths, as well as the number of people doing various activities such as sleeping, working, eating, and using the internet. The author reflects on the diversity of human experiences and the fact that people are doing different things at the same time, from falling in love to experiencing pain and loss. The article concludes that every moment is important and that statistics can reveal the complexities of human life.

**Demographers Predict Global Population Decline After Reaching 10 Billion**
Demographers predict a decline in the world's population after reaching 10 billion people. The global population is growing at a record rate over the past 100 years, and the peak population is expected to be around 10 billion in the 2080s, followed by a stable decline by 2100, according to Die Welt. The decline in fertility rates is observed in most regions, except for Africa south of the Sahara, where the average number of children per woman is four, often due to unplanned pregnancies. In other parts of the world, women have fewer than two children, leading to a decline in population, despite family support measures that do not provide long-term effects. Experts link the decline in fertility to increased education levels, access to contraception, and women's status in society. In developed countries, such as Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, and China, the birth rate is consistently below the natural replacement rate. Immigration partially compensates for the decline in population, but this process is accompanied by aging of the population and challenges for pension and healthcare systems. It is predicted that in the US and European countries, population growth will depend mainly on migrants. 'Illegal immigrants not only make up about 5% of the workforce, but they are also significantly younger than the aging American population. The average age in the US increased from 28 years in 1970 to just under 39 years. It is expected that by 2050, people over 65 will make up over a quarter of the US population,' according to a quote from InoSMI. Experts believe that religious traditions, which once influenced fertility even in countries like Iran and Poland, are losing relevance and impact. 'It's interesting to think what would happen if a pop icon like Taylor Swift, with almost 300 million followers on social media, suddenly became a mother,' said demographer Ralph Ulrich from Bielefeld, who thinks that young people now have different goals. African countries face a dilemma between population growth and its consequences for the economy and education. China and India demonstrate opposite demographic trends: India's young population is increasing, while China's population is declining. Specialists predict that in the future, competition for qualified migrants will intensify, and with the decrease in the number of young people, the labor market will also shrink. The Serbian Minister of Family and Demography, Milica Djuric-Stamenkovski, stated that Europe has lost Christian values, expressed in the 'demographic winter' and the prevalence of individualism over family traditions. According to her, 'there is nothing to weave on a rotten canvas.' Russian MP Igor Antropenko previously proposed reducing the working day for women by one hour while maintaining their salary, so they could devote more time to personal life and family.

**The Human Population: A Reevaluation of the Numbers**
In November 2022, the UN celebrated the estimated 8 billion people on Earth, but a new study suggests that we may have been counting incorrectly. According to the study, the human population did not reach the replacement rate in 2023 and is expected to peak at the end of the century before declining. However, the accuracy of these estimates has been questioned for some time, and this study adds to the debate by suggesting that we may have made a mistake in our counting. As one might say, 'the numbers don't add up'.

**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**
British paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species. 'If we make a concerted effort to expand into the Universe, we could 'live -- potentially -- for millions of years,' he says. However, he warns that if we don't take action, 'there might be no one left on the Earth for you to wave back to.'

**Why we're heading for extinction - and much faster than you think**
According to Henry Gee, a British palaeontologist and senior editor of Nature, the human population is on a downward trend and may be nearing extinction more quickly than we think. Gee writes in his book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire' that the global population growth rate peaked in 1964 at 2.24% a year and is now projected to turn negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. Gee estimates that humans have about 10,000 years left before extinction. He attributes this trend to a combination of factors, including climate change, declining fertility rates, and a limited gene pool. Gee notes that humans are 'remarkably pox-ridden, worm-eaten and lousy' due to our small gene pool, making us vulnerable to diseases that could wipe out millions of us. 'The human population will sink to a level that is ultimately unsustainable, and extinction will beckon,' Gee writes.

**World Population Expected to Peak at 10.3 Billion by 2100**
The world's population is expected to peak at 10.3 billion by 2100, with an 80% chance of reaching this number, according to the United Nations (UN). After that, the population will start to decline. This is a more pessimistic prediction than 10 years ago, when it was estimated that the peak population would be over 12 billion. The UN's report, 'Perspectivas da População Mundial em 2024', states that many countries have already reached their peak population, including 63 nations such as Germany, Russia, China, and Japan. The report also predicts that 48 countries, including Brazil, will reach their peak population between 2025 and 2054. In contrast, 126 countries, including the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan, are expected to continue growing after 2054. According to the UN, despite the predicted decline in population, life expectancy is expected to increase. 'In the last three decades, mortality rates have decreased and life expectancy has increased significantly,' said the UN. 'After a brief decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy at birth is increasing again, reaching 73.3 years in 2024, up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.'

**Global Population Growth Slows Down: What's Behind the Decline?**
The world's population growth has slowed down significantly over the past few decades, according to IFLScience. The population has reached 8 billion people in 2024, but the UN predicts that the growth rate will slow down significantly in the next 60 years, adding only 2 billion people. By the 2080s, the population is expected to reach 10.3 billion, and by the end of the century, it will decrease to 10.2 billion. The probability of the population reaching its peak by 2100 is estimated to be 80%. This is largely due to a sharp decline in fertility rates. In most countries, the fertility rate is below the critical threshold of 2.1 children per woman. In fact, over 20% of countries have a 'below-replacement fertility rate', where a woman has fewer than 1.4 children. China, which was once the most populous country, is also experiencing a decline in population. According to forecasts, the population of these countries will decrease by approximately 14% from now until 2054. The decline in fertility rates can be attributed to the demographic transition phenomenon, where women have fewer children as societies become more industrialized. This is due to increased opportunities for women's career growth, leading to delayed family formation. Additionally, lower child mortality rates and reduced need for large families for agricultural work contribute to lower fertility rates. In combination with increasing life expectancy, this decline in fertility can significantly alter the demographic composition of the population, with people over 60 years old making up an increasingly large proportion. By 2070, people over 60 are expected to outnumber those under 18.

**Humanity Is At Pivotal Moment 25 Years Into Millennium: Al Gergawi - UrduPoint**
Mohammad Abdullah Al Gergawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs and Chairman of the World Governments Summit (WGS), stated that humanity is at a pivotal moment, having completed 25 years of a millennium that has witnessed major technological, economic, and social transformations. He emphasized that the progress of the next 25 years will surpass all previous human advancements, and that 'our future will be shaped by decisions we make today. Future is the result of present decisions informed by the past and prepared for what's next.' Al Gergawi highlighted four realities shaped by past decisions: over two million people have lost their lives in wars and conflicts, economic growth has not translated into greater well-being, trust in governments has declined, and 630 million people still live in poverty. He posed critical questions to the summit's audience, asking what if peace had been prioritized over violence, what if governments had focused on the 'quality of growth' rather than its 'quantity', what if fostering trust had been a priority, and what if human-driven motivations had led the global agenda. Al Gergawi shared key projections for the next 25 years, including a world population of 10 billion by 2050, significant growth in Africa and Asia, and the emergence of space as an integral part of human life.

**World Population to Peak at 10.3 Billion in 2080s, Then Decline**
According to the United Nations, the world population will reach a peak of 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, but then will begin to decline. The population growth rate is slowing down and will eventually turn negative due to a decline in fertility rates. The UN report highlights the differences in population growth rates among countries, with some countries, such as those in Africa, experiencing rapid growth, while others, such as Italy, Russia, and China, are experiencing a decline. The report suggests that the decline in population can be an opportunity to mitigate the effects of overpopulation and to implement more sustainable development and consumption models. However, the impact on climate change is uncertain, as a decline in population may lead to a decrease in emissions, but it may also lead to an increase in consumption and emissions.

**The Decline of Birth Rates: A Global Opportunity**
Over the past 100 years, the global population has quadrupled, from 2 billion in 1925 to 8.2 billion in 2024. This rapid growth is attributed to the decline in infant mortality, medical advancements, and increased global life expectancy, which has reached an average of 73.3 years. However, the expected demographic explosion by the end of the century is not materializing. According to the United Nations' 'World Population Prospects' report, which monitors global demographic trends, the actual growth rate is lower than predicted. The main reason is the decline in fertility rates. To maintain a stable population, the average number of children per fertile woman should be 2.1. Globally, this rate has decreased from 5.1 children per woman in 1965 to 2.2 in 2024. Today, 131 countries and regions have fertility rates below the threshold, although individual trends vary.

**Depopulation: the dramatic change facing humanity**
The global population is expected to peak in the mid-2080s, followed by a dramatic decline. This is the first time in 700 years that the global population will decline. The decline is attributed to falling fertility rates across much of Europe, Asia, and the Americas, as well as improving life expectancy. By 2100, India will be the largest country, with a population of 1.5 billion, while China will be the second-largest, with a population of 638 million. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia, will experience rapid growth. However, many countries will experience a decline in population, including Indonesia, Brazil, and the European Union. The decline in population will have significant impacts on economies, healthcare, and social security systems. Governments will need to adapt to these changes and implement policies to support aging populations and address the challenges of low fertility rates. 'The world population is expected to peak, it's just a question of to what level and how fast that peak and the decline will be,' says Patrick Gerland, chief of the Population Estimates and Projection Section at the UN's Population Division. 'Pensions systems that relied on increasing numbers of workers each year to support retirees will be strained or insolvent unless reformed,' says Jennifer D Sciubba, president of the Population Reference Bureau. 'There will be continued demands on healthcare.'
