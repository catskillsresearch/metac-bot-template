**Elon Musk Asked His Date, 'Do You Ever Think About Electric Cars?'  --  The Date Flopped, But His Obsession Sparked A $400 Billion Journey - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)**
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, has revealed that his enthusiasm for electric vehicles once thwarted a college date. In a 2013 interview, Musk shared that he went on a date with a woman who later became a writer for Scientific American and asked her, 'Do you ever think about electric cars?' She replied, 'no, I don't.' Musk noted that his once-niche interest has now become a 'more effective' conversation starter since his college years. His net worth has soared to $406.9 billion, according to Forbes, in part due to his earnings from Tesla. Analysts predict that Musk and Tesla are 'best positioned' to capitalize on the evolving trend of EV adoption among drivers.

**Tesla Faces Challenge from Shareholder Over Musk's Compensation Package**
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing a challenge from a shareholder who claims that Musk's 2018 approved compensation package is not valid. The package allowed Musk to buy Tesla shares at the 2018 price over a period of 10 years if the company met certain targets. Tesla exceeded these targets much faster than expected, making the package worth over $100 billion at current prices. A judge ruled in January 2024 that the package was not lawfully granted, citing that Musk had too much influence in the background during negotiations with the Tesla board and that this was not disclosed to shareholders. However, in a surprising turn of events, Tesla shareholders approved the package again at a general meeting in June 2024, seemingly with more information due to the high-profile case. The judge still rejected the approval, and Tesla has appealed the decision in Delaware.

**Elon Musk's 100 Billion Dollar Stock Package in Jeopardy**
Elon Musk has tightened the conditions under which he can be sued by Tesla shareholders, after a small shareholder brought a lawsuit that could cost him a 100 billion dollar stock package. Musk's 2018 approved compensation package allowed him to buy Tesla shares worth around 300 million dollars at the 2018 price, provided the company met high targets within a 10-year period. Tesla exceeded these targets much faster, and the package is now worth over 100 billion dollars. After a small shareholder challenged the package in court, Tesla changed its bylaws to require shareholders with at least a 3% stake to file lawsuits against managers or board members in the company's interest. However, the small shareholder had initially filed the lawsuit in Delaware, where Tesla was still based at the time, and a judge ruled in January 2024 that the package's allocation was unlawful. Musk had too much influence in the background during negotiations with the board, the judge argued, which was not disclosed to shareholders. After the bylaw change, shareholders must hold at least 3% of Tesla's shares, equivalent to around 97 million shares worth 34 billion dollars, to file lawsuits. The unusual twist in the case came when Tesla shareholders approved the package again at a general meeting in June 2024, this time with more information due to the high-profile process. However, the judge remained in her decision, and Tesla has appealed the case in Delaware, as the company's move to Texas in the summer of 2024 does not affect the proceedings on the 300 million shares.

**Is Elon Musk Still the Richest Person Alive In 2025?**
After a significant stock market drop in April 2025, Elon Musk's net worth plummeted by $135 billion, making him the first person in five months to have a net worth below $300 billion. However, Musk has since rebounded to a net worth of $361.6 billion, according to Forbes. Despite his losses, Musk remains the richest person in the world, followed by Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, and Larry Ellison. Musk's net worth is largely due to his ownership of Tesla, SpaceX, and X, as well as his estimated 54% stake in xAI. However, Tesla has seen a 71% drop in sales since last year, and Musk is facing criticism for his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been linked to mass layoffs and Tesla boycotts. Musk is now pivoting to improve Tesla's reputation, with plans to make vehicles more affordable and launch robotaxis in Austin in June.

**Elon Musk Remains World's Richest Person in 2025**
As of the end of April 2025, Elon Musk remains the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $335 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This is significantly higher than the net worth of other billionaires, such as Jeff Bezos ($209 billion) and Mark Zuckerberg ($195 billion). Forbes also estimates Musk's net worth to be $342 billion, keeping him at the top of the list of the world's richest people. Musk's wealth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. Although Tesla's stock has declined by 37% since the beginning of the year, the growth in value of SpaceX and other assets has helped to offset these losses. Musk has also announced plans to focus on leading Tesla, reducing his involvement in public affairs, which may positively impact investor confidence and further growth of his companies. In December 2024, Musk's net worth reached a record $500 billion, but it later decreased due to the decline in Tesla's stock. Since the beginning of 2025, Musk has lost approximately $134.7 billion. However, thanks to the growth in value of SpaceX and other assets, his net worth has again exceeded $300 billion. As a result, Musk continues to hold the position of the world's richest person, despite market fluctuations and political challenges.

**Elon Musk's Net Worth Drops by $110.8 Billion Amid Tesla's Stock Price Decline**
Elon Musk's net worth has decreased by $110.8 billion over the past three months, according to Forbes. The decline is attributed to the decline in Tesla's stock price, which fell 15% after the US imposed a 25% tariff on Chinese goods. As a result, Musk's current net worth is estimated to be $353.2 billion. The company is also facing losses due to the introduction of tariffs by the US on Mexico, Canada, and China, which were major markets for Tesla's electric vehicles. Additionally, the company relied heavily on importing parts from Canada. This comes after a report in February that Tesla's sales of electric vehicles in Europe decreased by 45% in January 2025, while sales of competing electric vehicles increased significantly. The US imposed a 25% tariff on goods from Canada, China, and Mexico on February 1, which was described by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the start of a trade war against the country.

**Elon Musk Loses $116 Billion in Three Months Due to Tesla Stock Decline**
According to Forbes, Elon Musk's net worth has decreased by $116 billion since December 2024 due to the decline in Tesla's stock price. Musk's net worth peaked at $464 billion on December 17, 2024, when Tesla's stock was trading at $480. However, by March 4, 2025, his net worth had dropped to $347.7 billion. Musk lost $7.1 billion in a single day. The decline in Tesla's stock price is linked to the S&P 500 index plummeting to its lowest point in 2025, following the US imposing higher tariffs on goods from Canada, China, and Mexico. As reported by Forbes, Musk surpassed Jeff Bezos as the richest person in history in November last year, with a net worth of nearly $350 billion.

**Elon Musk's Fortune Decreases to $378.8 Billion Amid Tesla Stock Decline**
Elon Musk's fortune has decreased due to the decline in Tesla's stock value. As of February 11, 2025, Musk's net worth was $378.8 billion, down from $421.6 billion at the end of January, according to Forbes. Despite the significant loss, Musk still leads the list of the world's richest people, surpassing Mark Zuckerberg by $130 billion. The decline in Tesla's stock value was due to lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and decreased sales in Europe and China. Analyst Colin Rusch stated, 'Elon Musk's political activity risks generating a negative reaction from consumers.' Additionally, Musk's close ties to the Trump administration have raised concerns among investors.
