**Toyota to sell seven EV models in U.S., send surplus cars overseas**
Toyota plans to sell seven electric vehicle (EV) models in the U.S. by mid-2027, including two American-made models and five imported models. The company aims to offer an electrified option for every model it makes globally by this year, with over 80% of its U.S. models already offering a hybrid or fully electric powertrain. Toyota expects slow but steady growth in U.S. EV sales, but will export any excess production to other global destinations. The company is on track to start shipping lithium-ion batteries from a massive plant in North Carolina later this year, which will supply cells for the two U.S.-made EVs. Total EV sales rose 7.3% in the U.S. last year to 1.3 million vehicles, but Toyota delivered fewer than 30,000 all-electric vehicles in 2024. Toyota expects battery electrics' share of the American market to nearly double by 2030. 'We'll sell a little bit more every year and grow with the market,' said Cooper Ericksen, a senior vice president at Toyota Motor North America. 'But we have to think about how many Canada will use, how many the U.S. will use, and we can then export to other global destinations.'

**Maharashtra Introduces New EV Policy, Aims To Achieve 30 Percent EV Adoption By 2030**
The Maharashtra government has introduced the Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy 2025 to encourage the use of electric vehicles in the state. The policy aims to provide financial incentives and infrastructure support to achieve a 30 percent increase in EV adoption by 2030. Key features of the policy include subsidies of up to Rs 2 Lakh for transport and commercial electric cars, and Rs 20 Lakh for electric buses. Electric vehicles will also be exempt from tolls on major expressways and will not have to pay road tax or registration fees. The policy requires charging stations to be set up every 25 kilometers on state and national highways, and new buildings must include EV charging points. Maharashtra has already made significant progress in EV sales, with 246,221 units sold in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, and aims to make electric vehicles easier to access and use, creating a cleaner and more sustainable environment in the state.

**EVs will Make Up 25% of New Car Sales Globally in 2025, up from 20% last Year**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that electric vehicles (EVs) will make up 25% of new car sales globally in 2025, up from 20% last year. This is expected to result in over 20 million EV sales worldwide. The IEA also notes that EV sales are unevenly distributed, with China accounting for 60% of new car sales being electric. In the European Union, EV sales have been boosted by government subsidies, but the IEA sees signs that EVs are becoming attractive to consumers even without subsidies. The US, on the other hand, is expected to have a lower EV market share, with around 10% of new car sales being plug-in vehicles in the first quarter of 2025. However, the IEA's projections do not account for potential technological and cost breakthroughs, which could lead to even higher EV adoption rates in countries like China.

**2 in 5 Cars Sold Worldwide Will Be EVs by 2030. US Drivers, You've Got Some Catching Up to Do**
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), more than 40% of all cars sold worldwide will be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030, nearly double the market share from last year. However, the growth rate of EV sales in the US is slower, with a 10% increase in the past year, partly due to the higher average price of EVs in the US, which is 30% more than conventional vehicles. Antuan Goodwin, EV writer at CNET, believes that the average price of EVs in the US will drop as more EVs are manufactured and cheaper models enter the market. Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at CarGurus, said that EV charging infrastructure has slowed EV sales in the US, citing a lack of fast and reliable charging options, especially in rural and suburban regions. Despite the challenges, EVs are cheaper to operate than conventional gas-powered vehicles, with EV drivers spending 60% less to power their cars, according to Consumer Reports.

**2 in 4 Cars Sold Worldwide Will Be EVs by 2030. US Drivers, You've Got Some Catching Up to Do**
According to the International Energy Agency, more than 40% of all cars sold worldwide will be electric vehicles by 2030, nearly double the market share from last year. However, the US is lagging behind, with a 10% increase in EV sales over the past year, compared to the global increase. The IEA report suggests that EV sales will continue to surge as their price becomes more competitive with conventional vehicles. In the US, EVs cost 30% more than conventional vehicles on average, but they are cheaper to operate, with EV drivers spending 60% less on 'fuel' and an average annual cost of $485 to power an EV, compared to $1,117 for gas-powered vehicles. The US Department of Energy also noted that EVs travel 4.4 times farther on a given amount of energy than gas-powered vehicles. Global EV truck sales increased 80% in 2024, with sales doubling in China, driven by lower operating costs with EVs compared to diesel-powered trucks.

**IEA Expects 40% of New Cars to be Electric by 2030**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects 40% of new cars to be electric by 2030, which would lead to a 5 million barrel per day decrease in oil consumption. This would be a significant contribution to energy security. However, there are uncertainties, including the impact of global economic growth and trade, particularly due to US President Donald Trump's trade policies. A decrease in oil prices could also slow the adoption of electric vehicles. Despite this, the IEA expects that with decreasing prices for electric vehicles, two-thirds of new cars could be electric by the end of the decade, according to Fatih Birol. China is the key driver of the development, with almost two-thirds of the world's electric vehicles sold in China last year. This is largely due to the availability of affordable electric vehicles, which now often undercut comparable gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of purchase price. In other regions, customers still have to pay a premium for electric vehicles, which they can only recover through lower operating costs over time. Almost every second new car sold in China last year was an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid. By 2030, this share could rise to 80%.

**Electric Vehicles to Reach 40% of Global Car Sales by 2030, Says IEA**
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the share of electric vehicles in global car sales will reach 25% by 2025 and 40% by 2030. The demand for electric vehicles is driven by their increasing accessibility. Sales of electric vehicles are growing rapidly, with a 35% increase in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year. By the end of 2025, global sales are expected to exceed 20 million. China remains the leader in the market, with electric vehicles accounting for nearly half of all sales in 2024. The number of electric vehicles sold in China last year (over 11 million) is equivalent to the total number of electric vehicles sold worldwide in 2022. Developing markets in Asia and Latin America are also becoming new centers of growth, with a 60% increase in sales in 2024. In the US, sales of electric vehicles have grown by around 10% year-on-year, with their share exceeding 10%. In Europe, sales have stagnated due to the reduction of subsidies and other support measures, although the share of electric vehicles in the market remains around 20%. On a global level, prices are falling due to increasing competition and decreasing battery costs. In China, two-thirds of all electric vehicles sold last year were cheaper than their conventional counterparts, even without considering purchase incentives. However, the price gap remains on many other markets. For example, the average price of an electric vehicle in Germany is still 20% higher than that of a conventional vehicle. In the US, electric vehicles with batteries are still 30% more expensive.

**Britain needs huge switch to EVs, heat pumps and to eat less meat...**
Britain's Climate Change Committee (CCC) has advised the government to make a significant switch to electric vehicles, heat pumps, and reduce meat consumption to reach its 2050 net zero target. The report recommends that 80% of cars on the road should be fully electric by 2040, with nearly all new car sales being electric from 2030. Additionally, more than half of homes should be heated by heat pumps by 2040, up from around 1% currently. The transition is expected to save households around 700 pounds ($883.82) on energy bills by 2050. Meat consumption is also expected to fall by 25% by 2040 and 35% by 2050 compared to 2019 levels. Piers Forster, Interim CCC Chair, said, 'Now we need to see action on transport, buildings, industry and farming. This will create opportunities in the economy, tackle climate change, and bring down household bills.'

**Millions of drivers with petrol cars issued warning ahead of major shift in UK**
The UK Government aims to have 80% of new cars be electric vehicles by 2030. According to reports, petrol car sales are expected to collapse in three years as electric vehicles dominate UK roads. Research suggests that electric vehicles will reach 24% of the market this year and 30% in 2026, but experts warn that the transition to 80% by 2030 will be a 'big leap'. Kia's UK head, Paul Philpott, says that the industry needs to 'accelerate' to meet the target, while Cox Automotive's Philip Nothard notes that the next four years will be 'volatile' due to economic headwinds and changing consumer demands. Nothard also emphasizes the importance of new market entrants establishing their brands and building trust with UK drivers to achieve the target.

**Goodbye gas: Volvo to make only electric vehicles by 2030**
Volvo announced that it will phase out the production of all cars with internal combustion engines by 2030. The Swedish automaker aims to have half of its global sales be fully electric cars by 2025, with the remaining half made up of hybrids. According to Volvo's chief technology officer, Henrik Green, 'There is no long-term future for cars with an internal combustion engine.' Volvo plans to sell its all-electric vehicles exclusively online, but will maintain dealerships for other services. The company aims to meet customer expectations and contribute to fighting climate change. Despite the growing number of electric vehicles, fully electric vehicles accounted for less than 2% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. last year. Volvo sold 661,713 cars worldwide in 2020, with 107,626 of those vehicles sold in the U.S.
