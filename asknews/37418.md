**Kazakhstan to Maintain Observer Status in BRICS, Not Joining Organization**
Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has stated that the country will not be joining the BRICS organization in the near future, but will instead maintain its observer status. 'Let's first see if BRICS will be an effective international organization,' Tokayev explained in an interview with Al Jazeera. 'So, at least for now, Kazakhstan will be an observer in BRICS, and we'll see what happens next.' Tokayev also expressed concerns about the organization's lack of a clear charter, structure, secretariat, and program. 'We've secured observer status in BRICS, and I think that's enough,' he emphasized. The move comes as BRICS is expanding, and the collective West is perceiving multipolarity as a challenge to its dominance. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has also weighed in on the issue, according to RT. The issue of Ukraine's crisis is expected to be discussed at the upcoming July summit of the community.

**BRICS Parliamentary Forum to Focus on Environmental and Sustainable Development Issues**
The 11th BRICS Parliamentary Forum will take place in Brasília from June 3 to 5, ahead of the BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 6 and 7. As the host and current president of the group, Brazil has suggested four priority areas for the BRICS Environmental Working Group: combating desertification, plastic pollution and waste management, preserving ecosystem services, and building collective leadership for climate action aligned with the 2030 Agenda. These topics will be discussed at the parliamentary forum, as explained by Laís Sacramento, a Senate consultant. 'All measures and actions taken by countries inevitably go through their parliaments. This is the time to discuss integrated actions, exchange experiences and best practices, define and identify relevant instruments, and guide discussions on pertinent topics, such as extreme weather events caused by climate change and desertification.' The forum will also feature a meeting of BRICS Women Parliamentarians to discuss strengthening women's role in addressing the climate crisis, and a meeting of presidents of foreign relations committees to discuss promoting investments and technology transfer for sustainable development. On June 5, the BRICS Interparliamentary Dialogue on Climate and Sustainability will take place, focusing on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda and targets for eradicating poverty worldwide. 'These debates will highlight the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda and targets for eradicating poverty worldwide, bringing up environmental issues, but also other issues that dialogue, such as sustainable cities, hunger, child and women protection, gender equality, and climate justice,' said Laís Sacramento.

**Lula's Agenda Gains Momentum Despite Fragilities Exposed by IOF**
As the first half of the year comes to a close, economic statistics show a firm economy. However, a slowdown in the second half is expected, but the surprise of a significant increase in job creation in April, far beyond projections, suggests a robust market, which raises bets on a more pronounced deceleration of activity and puts the prospect of a faster cut in interest rates in question. President Lula is expected to attend the Blue Economy and Finance Forum in Monaco and the 3rd UN Conference on the Oceans in Nice. He will then be invited to Canada, where the G7 Summit will take place from June 15 to 17. Despite the delicate relationship with Congress, Lula is fulfilling a long agenda in Paris. Meanwhile, the National Congress in Brazil will be paralyzed due to sessions and votes, as it will host the 11th Parliamentary Forum of the BRICS, a precursor to the BRICS Summit, which will take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6 and 7. The second half of the year will be established, and the president, as he has hinted, will accelerate his march across the country to 'do politics'.

**BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro: Expectations and Predictions**
The upcoming BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro will focus on key issues such as climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development. Experts from various fields have expressed their expectations and predictions for the summit. Sergey Rybakov, general director of the 'Nature and People' fund, emphasized the importance of civil society participation in shaping the summit's outcome. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' he said. Alexey Kokorin, an expert on climate issues, proposed a new approach to evaluating national climate goals, focusing on the role of civil society in their assessment. Victoria Elias, director of nature protection at the 'Nature and People' fund, highlighted the need for a stronger focus on biodiversity in the summit's declaration. 'We need to develop joint solutions for climate, biodiversity, and water issues,' she said. Nikolay Ostarkov, a member of the General Council of 'Business Russia', called for BRICS countries to develop their own voice and agenda, rather than following the Western one. 'We need to create our own institutions, tools, and scientific expertise,' he said. Vladimir Chuprov, executive director of the 'Nature Protection' association, emphasized the importance of local action in addressing climate change. 'We know the point B - the goals and tasks set in the global climate agenda. But the main question is how to get there,' he said. Alexander Voropaev, coordinator of projects on forest certification and work with companies at the 'Nature and People' fund, noted that the global system of forest management is outdated. 'We are still living in a forest economy built on the principle of gathering,' he said. Alexey Yaroshenko, leader of the forest program of the 'Land touches everyone' project, highlighted the need for a transformation of the global model of forest management in the face of climate and environmental pressure. 'We are still living in a forest economy built on the principle of gathering,' he said. Mikhail Babenko, member of the coordinating council of the Association 'National Working Group on Voluntary Forest Certification', emphasized the need for BRICS countries to formulate their own agenda and priorities, rather than following Western metrics. 'We need to develop our own interests and priorities,' he said. 'We have a high bioemission and the right to our own agenda for sustainable development, based on internationally recognized principles such as the UN Conventions and the Sustainable Development Goals.'

**The BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro: A Challenge to Western Values and Democracy**
The BRICS summit, scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025, will bring together leaders from China, Russia, and Iran, among others, in a region traditionally influenced by the United States. This gathering is significant, as it marks a shift in the global geopolitical landscape, with the BRICS members increasing their influence in Latin America and the Caribbean through trade agreements, investments, and military cooperation. The presence of these leaders in Brazil, a key player in the region, raises concerns about the potential erosion of democratic institutions and the promotion of corruption, illegal markets, and human rights violations. The United States, with its high interest in regional security, must be prepared to respond to the BRICS' agenda, which may include parallel tracks with non-state actors. The summit's outcome will have far-reaching consequences for the region and the global balance of power, with the BRICS' influence potentially challenging Western values and democracy.

**Chile's Participation in BRICS: A Step Towards South-South Cooperation**
Chile's recent visit by President Boric to China for the IV China-CELAC Ministerial Forum sparked criticism. Some argued that, in times of tension between the US and China, it would have been bold and risked angering Washington. However, the notion that Chile's President should not visit their main commercial partner, especially for an important dialogue between China and Latin America, is counterintuitive. In his speech in Beijing, President Boric reiterated Chile's commitment to two key principles of Chile's foreign policy: free trade and multilateralism. As the US renounces these principles, the question arises: should Chile adopt protectionism and unilateral action to appease Washington? The answer is clear. Similarly, the debate over Chile's invitation to the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7 is artificial. Informal instances like the G7, G20, and BRICS have gained importance in a world in transition. Chile is not a member of any of these groups, but attending the summit would be an opportunity to alternate with world leaders and discuss global issues. Participating in such events does not obligate Chile to anything or imply any commitment. The argument that Chile should not attend the BRICS summit, which represents 45% of the world's population, 35% of global GDP, and almost half of global oil production, is unsustainable. President Boric has referred to the rise of the Global South and Chile's role in it, and attending the BRICS summit would be a step in that direction. The BRICS' 2025 motto, 'Strengthening South-South cooperation for more inclusive and sustainable governance,' aligns with Chile's goals. As the North becomes increasingly divided, Chile should contribute to this South-South cooperation. Attending the Rio summit would be a step in that direction.

**11th Parliamentary Forum of the BRICS to Take Place at the National Congress**
The 11th Parliamentary Forum of the BRICS will take place at the National Congress from June 3 to 5, bringing together representatives from the 11 BRICS countries, nine partner countries, and two international institutions, including the New Development Bank (NDB), also known as the 'BRICS Bank', led by former President Dilma Rousseff. The forum aims to discuss the role of legislative houses in strengthening dialogue between BRICS countries, exchanging best practices, and building a common agenda focused on sustainable development, social justice, and multilateral governance. This year's program will also include the 2nd Meeting of Presidents of the Foreign Relations Commissions of BRICS Parliaments and the 2nd BRICS Women Parliamentarians Forum, which will have an official space within the parliamentary forum. The sessions will focus on topics such as a global health alliance, sustainable economic development, climate crisis, artificial intelligence governance, cooperation, and multilateralism. A final declaration is expected to be released at the end of the forum. The event will also feature women's representation, with meetings of women parliamentarians from BRICS countries. According to the Chamber of Deputies, the women parliamentarians will hold three working sessions to discuss topics such as women in the era of artificial intelligence, women's participation in the climate crisis, and building the future with women parliamentarians and the BRICS 2025 agenda. Deputada Jack Rocha (PT-ES) will preside over one of the women's meetings, stating that the BRICS parliamentary forum reinforces the role of women in power spaces. 'Brazilian women in Parliament, even at 18%, make up the largest female delegation in history. We are responsible for over 40% of the legislative production of this House. So, in addition to producing laws, participating in debates, not only related to women, we can still respond to other economic, cultural, health, and environmental dilemmas,' she said. Senadora Professora Dorinha Seabra (União-TO) will also preside over a meeting, stating that this is an opportunity to create space in favor of women in politics. 'Creating a debate on possible paths for a pact within the BRICS, respecting autonomy, of course, but at the same time understanding that there is a global march for greater participation of women in politics,' she commented. Deputada Célia Xakriabá (PSol-MG), president of the Commission for the Defense of Women's Rights in the Chamber, states that the BRICS Parliamentary Forum is a space to give voice to women. 'We need to understand that this is a space to bring voices, territory, life, diversity, because we believe that this BRICS agenda is crucial. The economy is feminine, democracy is feminine, the planet is feminine, the climate is feminine. Therefore, at this moment, it is impossible for the Parliament, together with the BRICS, to discuss an agenda that does not directly involve our presence, our participation. It's not a debate to discuss proposals for women, it's with women,' she emphasized.

**Brazil's BRICS Presidency at Risk of Failure**
The Brazilian government's presidency of the BRICS group is at risk of not producing significant results. The author, who has been involved with the BRICS since its inception in 2008, believes that the government is not politically strong enough to make a positive impact. The author cites the dominance of bureaucrats in the Itamaraty and the Fazenda, as well as the lack of identification with the BRICS' goals among some government officials. The author suggests that the government should focus on organizing a second meeting of BRICS leaders in November 2025, in parallel with the G20 summit in South Africa, to complete the Brazilian presidency and pass the baton to India, the next country to hold the presidency. This would allow the BRICS to be a major force in contesting the international status quo and offering concrete alternatives to the Western-led disorder. The author also criticizes the decision to hold the BRICS summit in July 2025, which may reduce the presidency to just six months, and suggests that the government should take a more proactive approach to organizing the summit and its related events.

**BRICS Approves First Recommendation on Climate Financing Ahead of COP 30**
The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) group has approved its first recommendation on climate financing ahead of the COP 30 conference. The document, which will be presented to the heads of state at the BRICS summit, focuses on issues such as reforming multilateral banks and mobilizing private capital to finance climate actions in developing countries. According to Ambassador Tatiana Rosito, the document is a 'first-time' effort to guide a common and collective action by BRICS in the area of climate financing. The document aims to contribute to the production of the 'Road Map Baku-Belém' which details the steps needed to reach $1.3 trillion in funding by 2035 for climate actions. The Brazilian government has also proposed the creation of the 'Fundo Florestas Tropicais para Sempre' (TFFF) to incentivize countries to protect their forests. This initiative is expected to mobilize private capital and could reach $100-125 billion in funding. Additionally, the BRICS group has agreed to create a platform for research and technology development to combat climate change, and a laboratory to discuss climate measures affecting international trade. 'This is a very important decision, coming out of this BRICS meeting, is an agreement to discuss carbon accounting. This means how to measure the carbon footprint of a product or sector and how it impacts exports, imports, and the economy of these countries', said Ambassador Liliam Chagas.

**BRICS Summit: Strengthening South-South Cooperation for a More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance**
The BRICS group, led by China, has expanded to include new members such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, the UAE, Indonesia, and Iran. The 17th BRICS summit, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, will focus on 'Strengthening South-South Cooperation for a More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance'. The agenda includes topics such as global health, trade, investment, and finance, climate, artificial intelligence, and multilateral architecture for peace and security. Brazil, as the host country, aims to influence the direction of the resolutions and promote a governance with rules in a new multilateral architecture in a multipolar world. The BRICS group has been criticized for being anti-Western, but it is not a proposal to create a single currency within the group to replace the dollar. Instead, it is a proposal to facilitate trade using local currencies or other credit mechanisms. This is not an easy task, as the dollar represents 57.8% of international reserves, and the yuan renminbi only 2.18%. The countries of the BRICS do not trade only within the group, and China's importance in their trade is not enough to keep their reserves entirely in Chinese currency. Brazil's trade with other BRICS members, excluding China, is very small, and it is not due to a lack of currency. The agenda of priorities for the 17th Summit is broad, and Brazil can try to influence the direction of the resolutions in the sense of opting always for a governance with rules in a possible new multilateral architecture in a multipolar world.

**Brazil to Host 17th BRICS Summit in 2025**
Brazil will host the 17th summit of the BRICS group on July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, according to a statement from the group. The BRICS group, led by Brazil this year, has confirmed the date and location of the next summit. In a previous interview, Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira said, 'From January 1, Brazil will lead the BRICS group, and we will also hold large ministerial meetings.' The BRICS group is expanding rapidly, with the number of member countries increasing, and is approaching the format of the G20. Russia led the group last year and during its presidency, Moscow identified three priorities: politics and security, economic and financial cooperation, and humanitarian and cultural exchanges. The group also organized over 200 political, economic, and social events to promote more cooperation between BRICS countries. The 16th BRICS summit was held in Kazan, Russia, in October last year, with the participation of around 40 countries, and the main theme was 'Promoting diversity for global development and security.' This was the first summit after the accession of five new countries to the BRICS group in 2024. The BRICS group is a joint association of countries established in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, and South Africa joined in 2011. Since the beginning of 2024, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia have joined the group, and dozens of countries, including Turkey, Venezuela, and Vietnam, have expressed their intention to join BRICS.
