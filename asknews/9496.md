**Renewable Energy Reaches New Heights in France**
According to the Panorama de l'électricité renouvelable, in 2024, one-third of the electricity consumed in France came from renewable sources. Solar and hydraulic energy remain the leading sources of electricity. The production of renewable electricity, including exports, reached a new record of 150 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024, a 9.8% increase from 2023. This growth is largely driven by the constant increase in solar energy production (+10%) and a significant increase in hydraulic energy production (+27%), as stated in the Panorama. In terms of installed capacities, hydraulic energy is the second-largest producer of French electricity with 25.7 gigawatts (GW), behind nuclear energy (61.4 GW). Hydraulic energy covered 15.8% of France's electricity consumption in 2024, ahead of onshore wind (9.6%) and solar (5.7%), while offshore wind, with its deployment underway, accounted for less than 1% of the country's needs.

**Renewable Electricity in France: A Record-Breaking Year in 2024**
According to the Panorama de l'électricité renouvelable report, one-third of the electricity consumed in France in 2024 came from renewable sources, primarily solar and hydraulic power. The production of renewable electricity, including exports, reached a new record of 150 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024, an increase of 9.8% from 2023. The report, published by the Syndicat des énergies renouvelables (SER) with the Agence ORE and the energy managers Enedis and RTE, notes that 'this strong increase is largely driven by the constant increase in solar energy production (+10%) and a significant increase in hydraulic production (+27%)'. The hydraulic power sector is the second-largest producer of renewable electricity in France, with 25.7 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity, behind nuclear power (61.4 GW). In 2024, hydraulic power covered 15.8% of France's electricity consumption, followed by onshore wind power (9.6%) and solar power (5.7%), while offshore wind power, which is still being deployed, accounted for 0.9% of the country's energy needs.

**France's New Energy Roadmap: A Balancing Act Between Nuclear and Renewable Energy**
The French government is preparing to publish a new energy roadmap, which outlines the country's energy objectives for the next decade. The roadmap aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and will determine the share of nuclear and renewable energy in the country's energy mix. The proposal, which has already been adopted by the Senate, will be examined by the National Assembly in mid-June. The Prime Minister, François Bayrou, has announced that the decree on the multi-annual energy programming (PPE) will be published by the end of the summer. The PPE will detail the energy objectives of France, including the share of nuclear and renewable energy. Bayrou has stated that 'our objective is to publish the decree by the end of the summer to provide the necessary visibility to the different industrial sectors.' The new energy roadmap is expected to be a contentious issue, with some parties advocating for a greater emphasis on nuclear energy and others pushing for a greater focus on renewable energy. A recent survey by Ifop found that 84% of French people have a positive image of renewable energy, including among supporters of the far-right National Rally party. The PPE aims to reduce the share of fossil fuels in the country's energy consumption from 60% in 2023 to 42% in 2030, and then to 30% in 2035.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**France pumps money into eastern air base to handle nuclear-armed bombers**
France is investing $1.7 billion (€1.5 billion) in the renovation of the Luxeuil-Saint Sauveur air base in eastern France, which will take a decade to complete. From 2035, the base will be twice its current size and will house new generation hypersonic missiles carried by 50 of France's Rafale fighter jets. According to Colonel Emmanuel Roux, the base's commander, the current hangars, which date back to 1952, are 'well used' but will be replaced as the Rafales will not fit in them. Roux joked that the renovation will be 'like building a cathedral', requiring a complete overhaul of the infrastructure. The renovated base will become the fourth in France capable of storing nuclear weapons.

**Egypt's Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy Visits France to Inspect Hydroelectric Power Plant**
Egypt's Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, Dr. Mahmoud Osman, visited France to inspect the Grand Maison hydroelectric power plant, which is the largest hydroelectric power plant in Europe. The plant is one of the experimental sites for some EU-funded projects to test smart technologies that can help hydroelectric power plants participate in supporting grid stability. Dr. Osman listened to an explanation from the plant's officials about the importance of hydroelectric power generation projects, which are considered one of the most important sources of clean and sustainable energy. He also emphasized the importance of working with French companies to develop and implement these projects, and to attract more French investment in Egypt. The minister stated that the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy has a plan to maximize the returns from renewable energy sources, and to ensure grid stability by introducing energy storage systems and building a pumped hydro storage plant. He also emphasized the importance of diversifying energy sources and increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, in line with the country's energy strategy, which aims to reach a renewable energy share of over 42% by 2030 and 60% by 2040. The minister also highlighted the importance of reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing the use of new and renewable energy sources.

**Europe's Nuclear Renaissance: A Shift Towards Energy Sovereignty**
Most European countries are reevaluating their stance on nuclear energy in response to the climate crisis and increasing electricity demands. The energy source has seen a resurgence in interest, with countries like France, the UK, and Poland planning to expand their nuclear capabilities. France, with 57 reactors, remains the most nuclearized country per capita. The country has announced a new program to build 6 to 14 new reactors, with the first expected to come online in 2038. Other countries, such as Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, are also considering a return to nuclear energy to reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels and volatile energy prices. The European Union is expected to realign its energy policies to prioritize carbon neutrality, competitiveness, and sovereignty, without discriminating against low-carbon energy sources. The shift towards nuclear energy is driven by the need for energy sovereignty and decarbonization, as well as the desire to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.

**South Korean presidential front-runner backs nuclear power - for now**
South Korea's presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being,' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables, like offshore wind, to supply industrial hubs, and calls for phasing out coal by 2040 and curbing natural gas consumption. Lee supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants, but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60 per cent of the mix. Analysts expect Lee to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30 per cent of the power mix by 2030, while Kim is likely to retain the current push for nuclear power.

**French Energy Policy Criticized for Incoherences**
The French government's new energy policy, the Programmation Pluriannuelle de l'Energie (PPE), has been criticized by the Académie des sciences for its incoherences. The policy aims to reduce France's dependence on fossil fuels, but it relies on an unrealistic assumption that electricity consumption will increase by 200 TWh by 2035. However, the Académie des sciences points out that electricity consumption in France has been decreasing since 2017, and this trend is expected to continue. The policy also relies heavily on intermittent renewable energy sources, which can lead to increased volatility in electricity prices and instability in the grid. The Académie des sciences recommends a more cautious approach, prioritizing the maintenance of France's nuclear power plants and the development of energy storage capabilities. 'We must not put the cart before the horse,' said the Académie des sciences. 'Let us first ensure the permanence of our nuclear power plants, which are both decarbonized and controllable. And let us develop renewable energies only to the extent of our real consumption needs, at the pace of our ability to modernize the electrical network to ensure its stability and to ensure the balance between variable sources and controllable sources.'

**François Bayrou Assures that France's Energy Roadmap is Not Written in Advance**
French Prime Minister François Bayrou assured the Senate on Tuesday that the country's energy roadmap for the next ten years 'is not written in advance.' He promised to 'listen attentively' to parliamentarians before publishing a decree in the summer. Bayrou emphasized that the multi-year energy programming (PPE) is not predetermined, and all analyses will be taken into account before its final writing. He stated, 'This multi-year energy programming is not written in advance. All analyses will be taken into account before its final writing.' Bayrou also reiterated the government's objectives for the period 2025-2035, which aims to put the country on the path to carbon neutrality by 2050. He assured that the decree defining the PPE 2025-2035, initially expected in the spring, will be published only after the examination by the National Assembly of a bill proposed by Senator Daniel Gremillet of the Republicans, reportedly from June 16. Bayrou praised the text already adopted by the Senate, saying it 'carries an ambitious but realistic programming for our country.' He also highlighted a 'major convergence' between the government and the Senate, stating that 'the core of our electricity mix must be nuclear energy production.' The plan proposes to reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy consumption from around 60% in 2023 to 42% in 2030, and then 30% in 2035. In contrast to the previous PPE, the new text promotes a nuclear renaissance, with the construction of six new EPR2 reactors. The ambition for the deployment rate of renewables is confirmed, particularly for offshore wind power. Bayrou also commented on the massive power outage in Spain and Portugal on April 28, stating that France is 'structurally less at risk' due to its lower share of renewable energies in its energy mix and its geographical situation, which allows for 'greater and more useful interconnections.' He concluded that this outage has shown 'that it is dangerous to concentrate the entire consumption on a single source of energy.'

**France's Energy Mix: Key Figures and Goals for a Sustainable Future**
France's energy consumption is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, with around 60% of energy coming from oil (40%), natural gas (20%), and a small percentage of coal. Most of these energy sources are imported. Electricity accounts for around 27% of France's energy consumption. To reduce energy costs and meet environmental goals, the government aims to decrease dependence on fossil fuels from 60% in 2023 to around 40% in 2030, and 30% in 2035. The European goal is to be completely independent of fossil fuels by 2050. This will be achieved by increasing energy production and promoting the electrification of transportation, particularly in the automotive sector. Today, 95% of France's electricity comes from nuclear and renewable energy sources. According to RTE, in 2024, nuclear production will rely mainly on the 57 reactors installed in France.

**France's Energy Roadmap 2025-2035: A Path to a Low-Carbon Future**
The French government has released a draft of the 2025-2035 Energy Roadmap, which outlines the country's energy objectives. The roadmap aims to reduce the share of fossil fuels in final energy consumption from 60% in 2023 to 42% in 2030, and then to 30% in 2035. This will be achieved by increasing the share of low-carbon electricity, primarily from nuclear and renewable sources, from 27% to 39% between 2023 and 2035, and by increasing the share of non-electric renewable energies, such as geothermal and biomass, from 15% to 30%. The document also emphasizes the importance of electrification of uses, replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon electricity in transportation, buildings, and industries. However, the document has been met with controversy, with some critics arguing that it prioritizes nuclear energy over renewable energy. The government has proposed a debate without a vote on the roadmap, and the publication date of the decree remains uncertain.

**Feuille de route énergétique de la France: les enjeux d'un texte qui divise**
The third multi-year energy program (PPE3) is at the center of a debate organized on Monday at the National Assembly on 'energy sovereignty'. This text sets the energy roadmap for France for ten years and raises many divisions on the sharing between nuclear and renewable energy. The PPE aims to put France on the path to carbon neutrality by 2050. It details the energy objectives of France: how much consumption and production, and how much nuclear and renewable energy. The PPE is one of the three planning documents - with the national low-carbon strategy (SNBC) and the national adaptation plan to climate change (Pnacc) - to implement the French strategy for energy and climate (Sfec) published in 2023. The project of PPE aims to reduce the share of fossil fuels in final energy consumption in France from 60% in 2023 to 42% in 2030, then to 30% in 2035. This will be replaced by low-carbon electricity (nuclear and renewable) with a share that will increase from 27% to 39% between 2023 and 2035, and by renewable energies outside electricity (geothermal, biomass...) which must be increased from 15% to 30%. The text confirms the ambition of the deployment rate of renewables, particularly for offshore wind, while maintaining the current rate for onshore wind. However, the document slows down the growth of solar energy. The emphasis is on electrification of uses, i.e. the replacement of polluting fossil fuels by low-carbon electricity in transport, buildings, industries. The text is contested, with some calling for it not to be published, citing a 'war of religion' between pro-renewables and pro-nuclear. The government had planned to present a draft law, but ultimately decided to present a decree to give visibility to the actors. The text was announced after the public consultation, which ended in early April. However, calls from parliamentarians not to publish the decree have been made, from the far right to centrists. The former CEO of EDF, Henri Proglio, has joined the controversy by signing a letter with parliamentarians to denounce a 'imposed trajectory' and 'the ideology of renewables'. This is an 'erroneous and worrying' position, judges Nicolas Goldberg, expert at Colombus Consulting, 'while for years we have repeated that we needed a policy of supply (renewable, NDLR) to decarbonize'. 'The future energy of France can no longer wait', pressed the CEO of Engie, Catherine Mac Gregor, like other energy professionals in the expectation of investing and recruiting. The calendar is uncertain, with the Prime Minister, François Bayrou, proposing a debate without a vote on the PPE, first on Monday at the Assembly, then at the Senate on May 6. The date of publication of the decree remains uncertain, even if the government's spokesperson, Sophie Primas, has mentioned a horizon 'before the summer'. The text can be subject to 'eventual modifications', according to her, depending on the debates on the proposal of law of the LR senator Daniel Gremillet. Already adopted in first reading at the Senate, it could be discussed at the Assembly on June 16, according to the Ministry of Relations with Parliament.

**PPE 3: The Energy Roadmap for France**
The third multi-annual energy program (PPE3) is at the center of a debate organized on Monday at the National Assembly on 'energy sovereignty'. This text sets the energy roadmap for France for ten years and raises many divisions on the sharing between nuclear and renewable energies. The PPE is a tool for managing energy policy to put France on the path to carbon neutrality by 2050. It was planned by the law of August 17, 2015 on the energy transition for green growth. The project of PPE 2025-2035 details the energy objectives of France: how much consumption and production and how much nuclear, renewable? The PPE is one of the three planning documents - with the national low-carbon strategy (SNBC) and the national adaptation plan to climate change (Pnacc) - to implement the French strategy for energy and climate (Sfec) published in 2023. A trajectory to ensure energy security and control prices, and to be less dependent on gas and oil imports. Concretely, it is a question of reducing the share of fossil energies in final energy consumption in France from around 60% in 2023 to 42% in 2030, then to 30% in 2035. How to replace them? By mainly low-carbon electricity (nuclear and renewable) with a share that will increase from 27% to 39% between 2023 and 2035, and by renewable energies outside electricity (geothermal, biomass...) which must be increased from 15% to 30%. In contrast to the previous PPE 2019-2024, which provided for the closure of nuclear reactors, the new text instead relaunches the atom, announced by President Emmanuel Macron in February 2022. The ambition of the deployment rate of renewables is confirmed in particular for offshore wind, while onshore wind is maintained at its current rate. On the other hand, the document slows down the growth of solar energy. The focus is on electrifying uses, i.e. replacing polluting fossil energies with low-carbon electricity in transport, buildings, industries. Expected in mid-2023, its publication has been delayed several times. The government had planned to present a bill, before giving up in April 2024 in the face of the 'war of religion' opposing pro-renewables and pro-nuclear, according to the terms of the then Minister of Energy Roland Lescure. Hence the path of a decree to give quickly some visibility to the actors. Except that the delays have accumulated in the wake of the dissolution and the reshuffles. The text was announced at the end of the public consultation which ended in early April. However, calls from parliamentarians not to publish the decree have been made, coming from a wide range of parliamentarians from the far right to centrists. The former CEO of EDF Henri Proglio has joined the controversy by signing a letter alongside parliamentarians to denounce a 'forced trajectory' and 'the ideology of renewables'. This is an 'erroneous and worrying' position, judges Nicolas Goldberg, expert at Colombus Consulting, 'while for years we have repeated that a policy of supply (renewable, NDLR) was needed to decarbonize'. 'The future energy of France can no longer wait', pressed Engie's CEO Catherine Mac Gregor, like other energy players in the expectation of investing and recruiting. Under pressure, Prime Minister François Bayrou proposed a debate without a vote on the PPE, first on Monday at the Assembly, then at the Senate on May 6. The date of publication of the decree remains uncertain, even if the government's spokesperson Sophie Primas has mentioned a horizon 'before the summer'. The text can be subject to 'eventual modifications', according to her, depending on the debates on the proposal of law of senator LR Daniel Gremillet. Already adopted in first reading at the Senate, it could be discussed at the Assembly a priori on June 16, according to the Ministry of Relations with Parliament.

**Accelerating 'Electrification' of France: Energy Professionals Urge Parliamentarians to Act**
A group of energy professionals, including the Union française de l'électricité and organizations from the renewable and nuclear sectors, have called on parliamentarians to accelerate the 'electrification' of France to reduce its dependence on imported and costly fossil fuels. They argue that 'each day, 180 million euros are spent to cover our consumption of fossil fuels, which amounts to over 65 billion euros per year paid to foreign powers, sometimes hostile to our interests.' The signatories emphasize the 'urgency' of transferring usage to electricity in transportation, industry, and buildings still heavily dependent on fossil fuels. A debate on energy sovereignty is scheduled to take place in the National Assembly on April 28 and in the Senate on May 6, following four years of consultation to build a new energy roadmap for France from 2025 to 2035. This roadmap aims to put France on the path to carbon neutrality by 2050 by reducing the share of fossil fuels in consumption from around 60% in 2023 to 30% in 2035.

**Artificial Intelligence - The Gluttonous Caterpillar: A Growing Demand for Electricity**
The demand for AI applications is increasing rapidly, leading to a surge in electricity consumption. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide consumed two to three percent of global electricity production in 2023, and this is forecast to grow to 460 to 1050 billion kilowatt hours by 2026. Macron, at the recent AI summit in Paris, responded to Donald Trump's 'drill, baby, drill' with 'it's just plug, baby, plug', highlighting the need for more renewable energies and nuclear power to produce the necessary electricity. France is a big supporter of nuclear power, producing over 60 percent of its electricity in nuclear power plants. Greenhouse emissions in Germany fell by almost 25 percent in 2023, but the goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2045 will not be achievable. Investors looking to invest in uranium for nuclear power should consider Uranium Royalty or IsoEnergy, which are successfully active in the royalty and streaming business and own high-grade uranium deposits.

**France Revises its Energy Strategy for 2035**
The French government has announced a new consultation on a revised version of its energy strategy for 2035, following criticism from various stakeholders. The new strategy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2035, with a focus on two 'equilibrated' pillars: nuclear power and renewable energies. However, the deployment of new solar power plants has been slowed down, with a target of 65-90 GW by 2035, down from 75-100 GW. The government has also revised the distribution of future solar installations in favor of large ground-mounted and rooftop installations, at the expense of smaller installations. The cost of purchasing surplus energy from small installations will also be revised. The energy strategy includes a comparative analysis of the complete production costs of each energy source. The government has also announced a 'tableau de bord de suivi' to monitor the production and consumption of electricity by sector. The strategy aims to reduce the weight of fossil fuels in the energy mix to 30% by 2035, with a complete exit from hydrocarbons by 2050. The government expects a strong increase in electricity production, with a target of 666-708 TWh by 2035, thanks to the growth of solar and wind farms. However, the government acknowledges 'incertitudes fortes' on the assumptions of electricity consumption made by RTE, the grid manager.
