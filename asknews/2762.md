**Don't miss the half-lit first quarter moon rise tonight: Here's what to look for**
The half-lit first quarter moon will be visible in the night sky on June 2, offering a unique opportunity to observe the lunar surface. At 11:41 p.m. EDT, the moon will be positioned at a 90-degree angle away from the sun, allowing viewers to see a myriad of craters and features on the terminator, the line separating the dayside and night side of the lunar surface. Using binoculars or a telescope, one can observe the Albategnius walled plain, Aristotles Crater, and other prominent features. The moon's 'lunar seas', Mare Serenitatis and Mare Tranquillitatis, can also be seen, which were formed by ancient lava flows. The site of the historic Apollo 11 moon landing, Mare Tranquillitatis, can be observed, as well as Mars and the bright star Regulus of the constellation Leo, which will be visible to the naked eye.

**The moon: Why we want to go back**
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, called Artemis Base Camp, and launch a new space station, Gateway, into the moon's orbit. A joint China-Russia project, the International Lunar Research Station, also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, make it an attractive destination for future space missions. These resources can be used to sustain lunar bases, extract minerals from asteroids, and even provide fuel for nuclear fusion power. The moon's distance from Earth also makes it an ideal location for testing technologies and equipment for future Mars missions. According to Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, 'Humans have had a continued presence in space for the past 20 years aboard the International Space Station. But the ISS is only 250 miles away in low-Earth orbit, which is as little as four hours after launching from Earth. The moon is 250,000 miles away -- about three days' spaceflight -- and a far riskier journey for astronauts.' The first research on the moon aims to make that journey safer and easier, and to determine how human activity affects the lunar environment. 'ESA is developing instruments for radiation environment measurements, drilling and in-situ sample analysis, geophysics and lunar space weather,' Pastor said. The long-term goal of building surface and orbital moon bases is to serve as a staging post for more distant space travel, and to provide a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration, as Pastor noted, 'A colony on the moon will be extremely useful and a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration.'

**Starship IFT-9 Test Flight Raises Concerns about Human Missions to the Moon and Mars**
The recent Starship IFT-9 test flight has raised concerns about the potential delay of human missions to the Moon and Mars. The flight saw several new improvements, including a redesigned structure to prevent fuel leaks and tile burnout, but unfortunately, these changes did not succeed. The mission was unable to deploy a mock payload, which is crucial for the Starlink satellite constellation. This delay could impact the development of the satellite internet, as well as the human missions to the Moon and Mars. Elon Musk has postponed the conference on Mars flights, and the 2028 manned mission to Mars is now uncertain. The company has received permission for 25 launches in 2025, but the Starship is still only launching every few months. Additionally, SpaceX has a contract with NASA to create a lunar landing module HLS based on Starship, which is due to be completed in 2027. However, this poses significant challenges, including the need to develop a life support system for astronauts and a 50-meter spacecraft capable of landing on the Moon. The company's attention is now focused on the development of Starlink and the lunar landing module, rather than the human missions to Mars.

**Gateway: A New Era of Space Exploration**
Scientists are proposing a new era of space exploration, with the lunar-orbiting station 'Gateway' serving as a key element. The station, which will rotate around the Moon, not the Earth, offers new possibilities for missions to Mars and the mysterious dwarf planet Ceres. According to researchers, 'Gateway' can be a 'transit hub' for missions to other planets, allowing for more efficient use of resources. The station will also serve as a testing ground for technologies that will be used in deep space missions. The researchers, Malaya Kumar Biswal and Ramesh Kumar V., propose a combined mission to Mars and Ceres, which would allow for the optimization of resources and the exploration of two objects in one 'journey'. The planned timeline is between 2040 and 2050. However, the researchers acknowledge that the realization of such ambitious plans is fraught with difficulties, including risk management, significant financial investments, and the need for a major technological breakthrough. Nevertheless, the creation of 'Gateway' is a bold step towards establishing a sustainable infrastructure for deep space exploration. An international consortium, including NASA, ESA, JAXA, CSA, and the UAE Space Centre, is already working on the first modules of the station, with the energy and living modules scheduled to be sent to the Moon in 2027.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**American, European, and Japanese Missions to Explore the Moon**
After a half-century since the Apollo mission left footprints on the moon, the moon has re-emerged as a destination for ambitious and precise engineering. However, this time, the competition is not limited to the major powers competing to raise their flags on the moon, but also private companies, multi-national partnerships, and 'robotic scouts', all seeking to explore the moon and pave the way for human return in the future. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessment test results released by the school system show that literacy levels have improved across the board for kindergarteners, first- and second-graders in the Montgomery County Public Schools system. The DIBELS assessment consists of short tests that measure phonics, reading fluency and other literacy skills, depending on the age group. The fall 2023 DIBELS assessment results showed 49.9% of kindergarten students, 58.0% of first-graders, and 60.4% of second-grade students met or went above benchmark status. That's up from fall 2022, when results showed 47.0% of kindergarten students, 52.5% of first-graders and, 56.0% of second-graders met or went above benchmark literacy goals for their age group. The moon's surface topography makes landing on it a challenging task. The moon's gravity is weaker than Earth's, and the surface is covered with craters, mountains, and lava flows. The moon's rotation is also synchronized with its orbit around Earth, which means that the same side of the moon always faces our planet. This makes it difficult to land on the moon's surface, as the spacecraft must navigate through the moon's gravitational field and avoid obstacles such as craters and mountains. The European Space Agency (ESA) is planning to launch the Lunar Pathfinder, a small lunar satellite, to facilitate communication between future missions and Earth. The mission will be launched in 2025 and will provide a communication relay for future missions, especially those that will operate on the far side or at the poles of the moon. The US company Intuitive Machines is planning to launch the IM-3 mission in late 2025 to test new advanced tools and possibly transfer NASA experiments to the moon. The mission will be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and will include a lunar lander and a rover. The rover will be designed to explore the moon's surface and collect samples, while the lander will provide a platform for the rover to operate from. The mission will also include a communication relay to facilitate communication between the rover and Earth. The mission is part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon by 2024. The program includes several missions, including the IM-3 mission, which will test new technologies and provide a platform for future missions to the moon. The mission will also include a lunar lander and a rover, which will be designed to explore the moon's surface and collect samples. The rover will be equipped with advanced instruments, including a drill and a spectrometer, which will allow it to collect and analyze samples from the moon's surface. The mission will also include a communication relay to facilitate communication between the rover and Earth. The mission is expected to launch in late 2025 and will provide a significant step forward in the exploration of the moon.

**China Aims to Establish Permanent Base on the Moon with Revolutionary Plan**
China plans to launch a missile to the Moon with a clear objective: to establish a permanent base on the lunar surface. A leaked video has revealed the National Space Administration of China's (CNSA) plan to establish a base on the Moon, which includes a modular station in lunar orbit that will serve as a hub for robotic missions to explore the surface and search for resources. The base will be built underground using missiles to drill into the crust and lava tubes to establish a safe habitat for astronauts. This move is seen as a significant acceleration of the CNSA's efforts to win the lunar race against the United States. As CNSA official said, 'This is a revolutionary plan that will allow us to establish a permanent presence on the Moon.'

**Future Lunar Landings to be Broadcast in High Definition**
The world was amazed by the images of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, although they were not in high definition. Now, as NASA prepares to send new astronauts to the moon with the Artemis program, they want to show everything in high definition. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the European Space Agency simulated a lunar walk in a realistic scenario at the LUNA laboratory in Germany, which mimics lunar conditions for testing equipment and procedures. They were able to capture images of the astronauts exiting the landing module, exploring their surroundings, and taking 'selfies'. The goal is to meet the high expectations of the large audience that wants to follow the mission with high-quality images.

**Apollo 10 Mission Concludes with Success, Paving the Way for Historic Moon Landing**
On May 26, 1969, after 8 days in space, the Apollo 10 mission successfully returned to Earth, landing in the Pacific Ocean. The crew, consisting of astronauts Thomas Stafford, John Young, and Eugene Cernan, completed the final major general test before the anticipated moon landing scheduled for the next mission, Apollo 11. The spacecraft traveled over 800,000 km, orbiting the moon and descending to just 15 km from the lunar surface. The lunar module, called 'Snoopy', was separated and piloted with precision, simulating all descent and ascent maneuvers, except for the actual moon landing. All critical systems, from navigation to module docking, worked perfectly. The success of the Apollo 10 mission marked a crucial step in the Apollo Program, confirming that the astronauts and vehicles were ready for the next historic achievement: landing a man on the moon's surface. 'The mission was a huge success,' said the crew. 'We're one step closer to making history.'

**Apollo 10: A Crucial Step in the Conquest of Space**
On May 22, 1969, the Apollo 10 mission reached a crucial milestone in the space race. The lunar module, called 'Snoopy', came within 15,400 meters of the lunar surface, performing a sort of 'dress rehearsal' for the historic moon landing of Apollo 11, scheduled for 2 months later. The mission, crewed by astronauts Thomas Stafford, John Young, and Eugene Cernan, was essential for testing all the maneuvers planned for a real moon landing, except for the final descent. The command module 'Charlie Brown' remained in orbit while 'Snoopy' separated to simulate the descent. The test aimed to verify the functioning of navigation, communication, and propulsion systems in real conditions. Apollo 10 was also the first mission to transmit in color from the Moon, increasing public interest and involvement. The data collected provided vital indications for correcting trajectories and procedures, making the success of the Apollo 11 mission possible. Although it never landed, the Apollo 10 mission was an essential step in the conquest of Space. Its technical precision and the courage of the astronauts paved the way for the first moon landing, becoming a key milestone in the history of space exploration.

**Apollo 10: The Final Rehearsal Before the Historic Moon Landing**
On May 18, 1969, Apollo 10 launched, serving as the final and perfect rehearsal before the historic moon landing attempt. The mission replicated all the steps of the actual landing, except for the direct contact with the lunar surface, making it a comprehensive dress rehearsal. Led by Tom Stafford, the crew consisted of Eugene Cernan in the lunar module 'Snoopy' and John Young in the command module 'Charlie Brown'. The crew launched on a Saturn 5 rocket from Kennedy Center and reached the moon's orbit after three days. The team broadcast the first-ever color television broadcast from space, and on the fourth day, the lunar module separated from the command module and descended to about nine miles from the moon's surface. However, a malfunction occurred due to a misplaced switch, causing a temporary loss of control, resulting in the module spinning out of control for 30 seconds before the crew regained control and safely returned. Apollo 10 was a crucial step towards success, giving NASA the confidence and readiness for the legendary moon landing mission that followed a few months later.

**NASA Launches LunaRecycle Challenge to Recycle Human Waste on the Moon**
The NASA has launched the LunaRecycle Challenge, a global competition that aims to transform human waste left on the Moon by the Apollo missions into water, energy, or fertilizers. The challenge, which closed its call for proposals on March 31, 2025, offers prizes of up to 2.75 million euros to those who propose the best solutions for recycling space waste. According to NASA, 'We are committed to sustainable space exploration. In future manned missions, it will be essential to reduce and reuse the different types of waste generated in space.' The challenge seeks to develop technologies capable of processing solid waste generated in lunar missions and converting it into useful resources. The proposals were accepted in two categories: transforming waste such as used clothing, food packaging, and laboratory materials, as well as human waste. The goal is to use the recovered water for life support systems, organic waste as fertilizer for space crops, and recycled materials to build tools or structures. The participants of the LunaRecycle Challenge include engineers, universities, startups, and research centers from around the world. Once the most promising proposals are selected, they will advance to a second phase: functional development and testing in simulated environments similar to those on the Moon. This type of innovation could transform the way humans live in space, proposing a sustainable model where every waste is converted into a valuable resource.

**In San Diego, NASA unfazed by SpaceX rockets blowing up before moon landings**
NASA officials, including Stanley Love and Liliana Villarreal, expressed confidence in SpaceX's ability to recover the Orion spacecraft, despite the company's history of rocket failures. Love said, 'They build it and throw it up there and it blows up and they get the data,' but added that 'fast and frequent failure gives just as much information as slow methodical development.' Villarreal echoed Love, saying, 'I'm not worried about it at all. And it's really interesting to see their milestones — like we are just cheering for them and they'll get it.' The officials were participating in a recovery test on the USS Somerset, where they simulated the return of the Orion spacecraft after a lunar mission. The test was a success, with the spacecraft being loaded onto the ship and the astronauts being rescued. The officials praised the Somerset's capabilities, saying it is ideal for spaceship pickup and can flood its well deck up to seven feet. The recovery test was a key step in preparing for the Artemis III mission, which will send astronauts to the lunar surface in 2026.

**NASA practices recovering its next moon astronauts: Space photo of the day**
NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense have practiced recovery procedures for the Artemis 2 mission, which will send four astronauts around the moon and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. This is the first time in over 50 years that a crew will splash down on Earth after flying to the moon. Unlike the Apollo program, the Artemis program is using amphibious transport dock ships with open well decks to envelop the Orion capsule. Several astronauts, including Victor Glover and Liliana Villarreal, participated in the NASA Artemis Underway Recovery Test-12 in late March 2025. The Artemis 2 mission will be the first test flight of the SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, and supporting ground system with astronauts aboard, and will set the stage for future Artemis crews to land at the moon's south pole and eventually send humans to Mars. 'This mission will be a significant step towards our goal of returning humans to the lunar surface and eventually sending them to Mars,' said Reid Wiseman, one of the astronauts on the mission. 'We're excited to see the progress we've made and the opportunities that lie ahead.'
