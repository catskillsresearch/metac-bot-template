**Gateway: A New Era of Space Exploration**
Scientists are proposing a new era of space exploration, with the lunar-orbiting station 'Gateway' serving as a key element. The station, which will rotate around the Moon, not the Earth, offers new possibilities for missions to Mars and the mysterious dwarf planet Ceres. According to researchers, 'Gateway' can be a 'transit hub' for missions to other planets, allowing for more efficient use of resources. The station will also serve as a testing ground for technologies that will be used in deep space missions. The researchers, Malaya Kumar Biswal and Ramesh Kumar V., propose a combined mission to Mars and Ceres, which would allow for the optimization of resources and the exploration of two objects in one 'journey'. The planned timeline is between 2040 and 2050. However, the researchers acknowledge that the realization of such ambitious plans is fraught with difficulties, including risk management, significant financial investments, and the need for a major technological breakthrough. Nevertheless, the creation of 'Gateway' is a bold step towards establishing a sustainable infrastructure for deep space exploration. An international consortium, including NASA, ESA, JAXA, CSA, and the UAE Space Centre, is already working on the first modules of the station, with the energy and living modules scheduled to be sent to the Moon in 2027.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**China and Russia Plan to Build Nuclear Reactor on the Moon by 2035**
China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035, which will serve as the energy hub for the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS is a robotic outpost, and later a human settlement, near the lunar south pole. The project aims to rival the US-led Artemis program, which involves 55 countries and plans to build a lunar orbital station (the Gateway) and return astronauts to the lunar surface, potentially by December 2025. The Sino-Russian alliance is gaining momentum, with 17 countries already partnering with the ILRS, and plans to expand to 50 countries, 500 scientific institutions, and 5,000 researchers through the Chinese 'Project 555'. The choice of the lunar south pole is not random, as it has prolonged solar exposure and the possible presence of water ice in the permanent shadows of craters. According to Roscosmos, the station will be used for basic scientific research and to test technologies capable of operating without human presence for long periods. Yury Borisov, Roscosmos director general, confirmed that 'the technological steps are almost ready', suggesting that the infrastructure could soon enter the operational phase. The ILRS project foresees a first robotic phase with the Chinese mission Chang'e-8 in 2028, which will test automated construction with 3D-printed lunar soil. Between 2030 and 2035, five heavy-lift launches will transport the main modules to the Moon. The long-term goal, by 2050, is to establish an extensive network of bases powered by solar, radioisotopic, and nuclear sources, with rovers, lunar jumpers, and high-speed communications between Earth and the lunar far side.

**China and Russia to Build Nuclear Reactor on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have officially agreed to jointly build a nuclear reactor on the Moon. The project aims to provide energy for the future international research base, which the countries plan to build by 2036. The agreement comes as the US may cancel its own ambitions to create a lunar orbital base. NASA has presented a budget project for 2026, which includes the possibility of canceling the Gateway mission. Russia has previously boasted about the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) project, which they want to build with China. The exact technical details of the implementation are still unknown, but the general director of Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, said that the necessary technologies are almost ready. The station will be built near the south pole of the Moon and will unite 17 countries, including Egypt, Pakistan, Venezuela, Thailand, and South Africa. The key milestone will be the Chinese mission 'Chang'e-8' in 2028, which will be the first landing of Chinese astronauts on the Moon. The project includes five launches of heavy rockets to deliver components of the automated base from 2030 to 2035. After the deployment of the main infrastructure, China plans to expand the station, including an orbital module, two ground nodes on the equator and on the far side of the Moon. The final completion of the full system is planned for 2050. It will work on a combination of solar, nuclear, and radioisotope energy. The technology of the reactor, how it will combine with other energy systems, and how it will be implemented is still unknown. China recently launched its first toroidal reactor, which has a power of two megawatts and is considered safer, and may be chosen for placement on the Moon. The project also includes the creation of a network of communication between the Moon and Earth, a high-speed data exchange system on the surface of the satellite, and a range of devices, from drones to hermetic and open lunar rovers. China's initiative is developing against the backdrop of its growing space ambitions. The country has already made its first landing on the Moon as part of the 'Chang'e-3' mission, after which it has repeatedly delivered devices, collected samples, and created maps of the surface. As for Russia, there are doubts about its ability to participate in such large and expensive projects. It is unclear what role Russia will play in this idea. It can be assumed that Russia will provide its rockets for launching details, but China does not have problems with this. Russia, on the other hand, has problems with money and science. The American response to the Chinese-Russian project is the 'Artemis' program, which is currently facing numerous delays. The launch of the 'Artemis III' mission, which is supposed to return NASA astronauts to the Moon for the first time since the 1970s, is expected no earlier than 2027. Meanwhile, the future of the lunar orbital station Gateway is under threat - the Trump administration's budget proposal for 2026 includes the cancellation of this mission, despite significant progress in the development of its modules.

**NASA's New Probes to Search for Alien Life**
The NASA project, called ORCAA (Oceanic World Recognition and Astrobiological Analog Characterization), aims to search for extraterrestrial life. In 2023, the team conducted a test mission at the Echo glacier in Alaska, using a hot water drill to collect samples from the glacier's bottom. They found traces of ATP and chlorophyll-a, key molecules for life. The team is now preparing for a second campaign in North Basin in 2025, where they will use a cryobot to simulate the conditions they will face on Jupiter's moon Europa. The goal is to test the autonomous operation of the cryobot, from drilling to sample analysis, to determine if these technologies can be used in a future real landing on Europa. The study aims to detect changes in the environment and find potential indicators of habitability, such as microorganisms or organic compounds. The research is advancing, with the Europa Clipper mission already en route to Jupiter's moon. This spacecraft will fly over Europa 49 times starting in 2030, searching for areas where the ice crust is thinner. This will help choose the most promising location for a future landing mission, such as the Europa Lander. While this mission will not penetrate the ice, it will test the first key instruments for that stage. Other oceanic worlds in the solar system where these probes could be used include Enceladus and Titan (Saturn), Triton (Neptune), Ganymede and Callisto (Jupiter), and even Ceres and Pluto. Enceladus, for example, has active geysers that eject water into space and have already been analyzed by the Cassini mission, which found water vapor, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds: basic ingredients for life.

**China to Launch 'Synthetic Sun' by 2050, a Major Breakthrough in Nuclear Synthesis**
China's State Atomic Energy Corporation plans to launch a 'synthetic sun' by 2050, using nuclear synthesis to produce energy. The company, which operates an experimental device called the 'synthetic sun', aims to start commercial operation of its first project to generate electricity in about five years after a demonstration phase, which is expected to begin around 2045. This technology will work without harmful emissions, according to Bloomberg. China has recently strengthened its ambitions to achieve nuclear synthesis, a process by which the Sun and other stars generate energy, and which is considered almost limitless clean energy, say scientists. The company has set a goal to surpass the US and France as the world's largest owner of nuclear reactors by 2030. Since the energy shortage in 2022, about 10 new reactors have been added each year, and the country will continue this pace until 2030 to achieve climate goals, according to CNNC. The company has also formed an industry alliance and created a new national thermonuclear company, China Fusion Corp. 'We have invested about 1.75 billion yuan ($240 million) in advanced tokamak devices, which use magnetic fields to confine and control heated plasma to produce energy without emissions or significant radioactive waste,' said Sheng Fen, deputy general manager of CNNC. The company also plans to increase production of its own designs for conventional nuclear reactors and small modular reactors over the next five years. In contrast, a German startup called Proxima Fusion has announced its concept design for a commercial thermonuclear installation, Stellaris, with a target connection to the network by the 2030s, according to Hackaday. This implies a stellarator design, which has the advantage of stable plasma, avoiding the Greenwald regime and density problems, which are a problem for tokamaks.
