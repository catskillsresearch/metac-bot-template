**Thousands Demonstrate in Baden-Württemberg for AfD Ban**
Thousands of people in Baden-Württemberg demonstrated in several cities under the motto 'AfD-Verbot jetzt' (AfD ban now) against right-wing extremism and for a ban on the AfD party. According to the police, around 1200 people gathered in Freiburg, while in Stuttgart there were several hundred participants, and in Heidelberg around 450 people took part. The organizers, including the network 'Zusammen gegen Rechts' (Together against the Right) and the initiative 'Menschenwürde verteidigen - AfD-Verbot jetzt' (Defending Human Dignity - AfD Ban Now), called for a nationwide action day in over 60 German cities. They are demanding that the federal government initiate a ban procedure against the AfD. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had classified the AfD as 'secured right-wing extremist' in early May, but the party is fighting against this classification with an emergency application. The new classification remains suspended until a decision is made by the Administrative Court in Cologne.

**Thousands Protest Across Germany Against AfD, Calling for Immediate Ban**
Thousands of people took to the streets across Germany on Sunday for anti-AfD protests, with the largest demonstrations taking place in Berlin and Munich. The protests, organized by the 'Together Against the Right' network and other civil society groups, called for the immediate ban of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. According to the police, around 4,000 people attended the main protest in Berlin, while organizers estimated the number to be around 7,500. In Munich, around 2,500 people took to the streets. The protests were held in over 60 cities across Germany. The organizers are calling on the Bundestag, Bundesrat, and the new federal government to initiate the procedure for delegalizing AfD before the Federal Constitutional Court. As stated by the initiators, AfD is a concrete threat that can be prevented, as provided by the Basic Law. 'We cannot stand by and wait,' said the initiators of the protests. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) had previously classified AfD as a 'right-wing extremist organization' threatening the democratic order of the state. AfD has filed a complaint with the administrative court in Cologne, and BfV has announced that it will not publicly label AfD as an extremist organization until the court case is resolved. New Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed caution in the ongoing debate about banning AfD, stating that the party has 10 million voters and 'cannot be banned.' He emphasized that the new government must focus on eliminating the reasons for such behavior among voters. 'I want to do everything in this federal government to help people regain their trust in the political center,' Merz said in an interview with ARD. The goal should be to make people 'no longer feel the need to vote for a party like AfD.'

**Thousands Demand Ban on AfD Party in Munich**
Up to 3200 people gathered on the Königsplatz in Munich to demand a ban on the AfD party, following its classification as 'secured right-wing extremist' by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. The protesters, part of the nationwide action day 'Zusammen gegen Rechts' and 'Menschenwürde verteidigen - AfD-Verbot jetzt', called for consequences to be drawn from the classification. Jana Häfner, 26, from the Munich group 'AfD-Verbot jetzt', stated that there are now 'enough evidence' to file a petition for a ban on the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. SPD-Bundestagsabgeordnete Carmen Wegge said, 'We must now file this petition, otherwise it will be too late to protect democracy.' The protesters argued that the AfD party disrespects human dignity and legitimizes violence, and that it is 'long overdue' for the party to be classified as right-wing extremist. Stadträtin Barbara Likus (SPD) stated that the party should be banned, and that the next step is to 'withdraw financial flows from the AfD, so that the state does not further finance the brown swamp.' Luca Barakat from 'AfD-Verbot jetzt' said, 'We will continue to build political pressure until this party disappears.'

**Thousands Expected to Demonstrate for AfD Ban in North Rhine-Westphalia**
A coalition of over 50 organizations has called for nationwide demonstrations on Sunday to demand a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In North Rhine-Westphalia, events are planned in Cologne, Essen, Bochum, Aachen, and Recklinghausen, according to the 'AfD-Verbot jetzt' campaign. In Essen, around 5,000 participants are expected to join a demonstration and rally, while fewer participants are expected at other events in the state. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had classified the AfD as a 'secured right-wing extremist' party in early May, citing a 'humiliating and extremist character of the entire party.' The AfD is contesting this classification in an emergency proceeding at the Administrative Court in Cologne. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution has assured that it will no longer observe the party as 'secured right-wing extremist' until a court decision is made, but it will continue to consider it a case of suspicion.

**Nationwide Demonstration: Protests for AfD Ban in Many Cities**
On Sunday, people in many German cities demonstrated against right-wing extremism and for a ban on the AfD party. The network 'Zusammen gegen Rechts' and other civil society organizations called for the demonstrations. In Berlin, the main rally took place at the Brandenburg Gate, with around 4,000 participants, according to the police, and around 7,500, according to the organizers. In Munich, around 2,500 people took to the streets, according to the police. The organizers demanded that the government initiate a ban procedure against the AfD immediately. They stated that the question of a party ban is a legal, not a political issue, and that 'the government must find the courage to submit a motion for a ban procedure.' The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had classified the AfD as a 'certain right-wing extremist tendency' in early May, but the party is fighting this classification with an emergency application. Until a decision is made by the Cologne Administrative Court, the domestic intelligence agency will not implement the new classification and will continue to treat the AfD as a suspected case.

**AfD: Verfassungsschutz gives Stay of Proceedings**
The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) has temporarily suspended the classification of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a securely extremist right-wing effort. This decision was made in response to an emergency application filed by the AfD. According to the court, the BfV has agreed to a 'stay of proceedings' and will not publicly label the AfD as a securely extremist right-wing effort until the court has made a decision on the AfD's emergency application. The BfV had previously classified the AfD as a 'suspicion case' after a year-long review, citing a 'disregard for human dignity and extremist ideology that pervades the entire party.' The AfD is fighting this classification in court, seeking to have it banned. The case is being heard in Cologne, where the BfV is based, as the court previously ruled in 2022 that the AfD's classification as a 'suspicion case' was lawful.

According to Juso-Chef Türmer, the AfD-Verbotsverfahren (AfD ban procedure) should be brought to the cabinet table. A party ban can only be requested by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or the federal government at the Federal Constitutional Court. In January, the Bundestag discussed a motion to ban the AfD, but it was not voted on. Due to the principle of discontinuity, the motion has expired and must be re-submitted. 'The AfD-Verbotsverfahren must be brought to the cabinet table,' said Juso-Chef Türmer.

**AfD's Court Bid to Stop Debt Package Fails Again**
The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has failed again in its attempt to stop the government's debt package through a court injunction. The AfD's Bundestag faction had filed an emergency application with the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, seeking to temporarily prohibit the Bundesrat from approving the constitutional amendments. However, the Second Senate rejected the application for a preliminary injunction (2 BvE 10/25). This is the latest in a series of rejections by the court, which had previously dismissed several AfD applications aimed at preventing the adoption of the debt package in the Bundestag. The AfD had argued that the old Bundestag was not entitled to hold special sessions and that the consultation period was insufficient. The Bundestag had already approved the multi-billion euro package for defense and infrastructure on Tuesday, and it will face a final hurdle in the Bundesrat today. If the states vote in favor with a two-thirds majority, the package will be adopted.

The AfD-Fraktion has filed another emergency application with the Federal Constitutional Court to temporarily stop the approval of the Bundesrat for the recently passed Grundgesetzänderungen. The goal is to prevent 'ghost laws' with irreversible consequences from coming into effect. Stephan Brandner, the Justice Secretary and parliamentary manager of the AfD-Fraktion, said, 'We cannot allow completed facts to be created before the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled on our constitutional complaint. If the Bundesrat approves the Grundgesetzänderungen on Friday, the parliamentary process will be completed and the law could come into effect - with unforeseeable financial consequences for our country and future generations.' The Federal Constitutional Court had previously rejected the first emergency application on March 17, 2025, due to a balancing of interests. The outcome of the second constitutional complaint is still open.

**Marco Wanderwitz Calls for AfD Ban in Current Bundestag**
Marco Wanderwitz, a CDU politician, has called for the current Bundestag to pass a law banning the AfD before the new Bundestag convenes. He tweeted, 'Until the 21st German Bundestag is constituted, at the latest 30 days after the federal election, things can still be done that will be much more difficult with the new majorities.' Wanderwitz also mentioned that this could include amending the Basic Law, the budget, and a procedure to ban the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. According to Article 39 of the Basic Law, the newly elected Bundestag must convene within 30 days after the election for a constitutive session. However, in the new Bundestag, AfD and the Left together have a blocking minority, making it difficult to pass decisions with a two-thirds majority. Wanderwitz is now calling for a quick start to an AfD ban procedure in the old composition of the Bundestag. He has been a strong advocate for an AfD ban since before the elections, and in November 2024, he submitted a motion to the Bundestag, along with 113 supporters, to have the Bundestag request the Federal Constitutional Court to declare the AfD unconstitutional. Wanderwitz stated, 'A large part of the AfD voters can be won back, but only when the party that nourishes them comes to an end.' He also accused the AfD of being 'not just a bit right-wing, but enemies of humanity.' He believes that Germany cannot continue to tolerate the AfD without suffering long-term 'irreparable damage.'

**Göring-Eckardt calls for AfD ban decision before federal election**
Bundestagsvizepräsidentin Katrin Göring-Eckardt (Greens) is calling for a decision on a motion to ban the AfD party before the federal election. The German Institute for Human Rights (DIMR) considers the cross-party initiative by MPs for a ban on the party to be promising. Göring-Eckardt said, 'Only the Federal Constitutional Court can decide whether the AfD is unconstitutional. In the upcoming parliamentary week, we must as a Bundestag take responsibility for protecting our democracy and pave the way to Karlsruhe.' She added, 'The AfD is increasingly openly inciting against people who do not fit into its worldview and is aggressively attacking our rule of law and our constitution.' The DIMR stated, 'The instrument of the prohibition procedure of a party has been created for a situation like the current one from historical experience.' The institute had already expressed the opinion in a June 2023 analysis that the party could be banned by the Federal Constitutional Court due to its 'danger to the free democratic basic order.' The party has since further radicalized, the DIMR said. A motion from more than 100 MPs from various factions for an AfD ban procedure is to be debated for the first time in the plenum in the upcoming week. The initiators of the group motion, Carmen Wegge (SPD), Marco Wanderwitz (CDU), Till Steffen (Greens), Martina Renner (Left) and Stefan Seidler (SSW), announced this on Monday.

**AfD Ban: A Pre-Election Capitulation?**
The topic of banning the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is not trivial. The German constitution allows for the banning of a party, and the AfD has been deemed 'securely right-wing extremist' by the Saxon State Office for the Protection of the Constitution. However, a ban would require the party to 'target the free democratic basic order or eliminate it, or endanger the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany.' Before a ban can be considered, a request must be submitted by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or Bundesregierung. It is up to the constitutional authorities to decide whether to pursue a ban or consider it a greater risk than the party itself. At this time, it would be unwise to reopen the issue, especially just before the 2025 federal election, as it would be seen as a capitulation in the political debate. The AfD provides ample grounds for attack, both politically and legally, but no court can take away the freedom of citizens and parties to engage in debate, as guaranteed by the German constitution, according to the Federal Constitutional Court.

**AfD Ban Proposal to be Debated in German Bundestag**
A group of over 100 politicians from various parties in the German Bundestag have submitted a proposal to ban the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The proposal will be debated in the Bundestag next week. Critics warn that the outcome of such a move is uncertain. According to Marco Wanderwitz (CDU), 'In their continued radicalization, the AfD is expressing increasingly unvarnished revisionist positions, such as the recent claim by Frauke Weidel that Hitler was a communist.' Carmen Wegge (SPD) stated that 'there is no alternative to submitting the application.' The chances of the proposal passing are unclear, with 124 out of 733 parliamentarians having signed on so far. A ban can be requested by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or federal government at the Federal Constitutional Court. The court would then determine whether the AfD is unconstitutional under Article 21 of the Basic Law. Critics, such as Thorsten Frei (CDU), fear that a ban could lead to a 'martyrdom' effect for the AfD. Renate Künast (Greens) has proposed an alternative, which involves commissioning experts to assess the feasibility of a ban.

**AfD Ban Question to be Discussed in German Parliament**
A question about banning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party may be put on the agenda in the German parliament next week, according to media reports. The AfD is currently second in popularity among voters, with around 20% support, behind the opposition coalition led by Friedrich Merz with around 30%. Social Democrat Carmen Wegge, who initiated the motion with a cross-party group, said, 'The application for the ban will be discussed in the parliament next week.' If the motion is accepted, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany will make the final decision on banning the party. However, it is unclear whether the issue will be discussed before the upcoming elections, as there will only be two days with parliamentary sessions before the vote. In November 2024, a similar motion was submitted, but it was unsuccessful. In 2023, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution recognized AfD branches in Saxony, Thuringia, and Saxony-Anhalt as right-wing extremist, allowing federal authorities to expand their surveillance powers. The party is suspected of extremism at the federal level. A report by the German Institute for Human Rights in June 2023 concluded that the conditions for banning the AfD have been met. The AfD, in turn, accuses the German authorities of persecution and suppressing dissent.
