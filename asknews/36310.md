**CBO: House Energy Panel Tops $880B Savings Target**
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has confirmed that the House Energy and Commerce Committee has exceeded its target of finding $880 billion in savings for the reconciliation budget bill. According to CBO Director Phillip Swagel, the committee's recommendations would reduce deficits by more than $880 billion over the 2025-2034 period and would not increase on-budget deficits after 2034. However, Democrats have expressed concerns that the bill would lead to millions of Americans losing Medicaid coverage, citing a previous CBO report. A committee spokesperson disputed this claim, stating that the report was based on speculation and that official scores would be released in the coming days. Committee Chair Rep. Brett Guthrie defended the bill, saying it 'preserves and strengthens Medicaid for children, mothers, people with disabilities and the elderly -- for whom the program was designed.'

**Colombian Community in the US on Alert: Medicaid Cuts Threaten Healthcare for Millions**
A Republican-led bill in the US House of Representatives threatens to drastically cut the Medicaid program, leaving millions without access to medical coverage. The proposal, which aims to reduce the program's budget and tighten eligibility requirements, has sparked controversy, with critics warning of a devastating impact on vulnerable communities, according to El Tiempo. The bill includes measures such as stricter verifications for beneficiaries, residency tests, and rigorous exams for providers receiving reimbursements. It also proposes requiring healthy adults between 19 and 64 to work at least 80 hours a month or perform community service to maintain their eligibility, with limited exceptions for pregnant women or those with extreme economic difficulties. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, these changes would result in a $715 million cut, leading to the loss of coverage for at least 8.6 million people by 2034. President Donald Trump has prioritized a fiscal austerity agenda, including cuts to social programs like Medicaid. Representative Brett Guthrie defended the bill, arguing that 'Washington cannot afford to subsidize able-bodied adults who choose not to work' while others rely on Medicaid for vital services. However, Democrats have branded the proposal as a direct attack on the most vulnerable.

**Fight over Medicaid cuts heats up as House Republicans release bill**
House Republicans have released a bill that includes cuts and changes to Medicaid, a contentious issue in their party-line agenda. The bill would make Medicaid spending reductions through stricter eligibility verification, citizenship checks, and federal funding cuts to states offering coverage to undocumented residents. It also seeks to impose work requirements for able-bodied adults aged 19-64 without dependents, demanding they work at least 80 hours per month. Democrats argue that the bill would cut spending by $715 billion and reduce the number of people with health insurance by at least 8.6 million in 2034. Rep. Brett Guthrie said the bill 'preserves and strengthens Medicaid for children, mothers, people with disabilities and the elderly,' while Rep. Frank Pallone called it 'cutting to the bone' and taking health care away from millions of Americans. The bill needs to win over nearly every Republican on the floor of the narrowly divided House to become law.

**A conversation to avoid a potential catastrophe**
The Reconciliation Act, a bill proposed by the Republican Party in Congress, is expected to cut $1.4 trillion in funding over the next 10 years for programs such as Head Start ($880 billion), SNAP ($230 billion), and Medicaid ($300-plus billion). Congressman Hank Johnson is hosting a roundtable discussion on May 9, 2025, to discuss the impact of these cuts on the nonprofit sector and the children and families they serve. According to Johnson, the cuts would be a 'catastrophe' for the state of Georgia, and it is essential to raise awareness about the potential consequences of these funding reductions.

**Healthcare Preview for the Week of: May 12, 2025 [Podcast]**
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce released the budget reconciliation bill text ahead of its scheduled markup on May 13, 2025. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not yet released a score, but it is expected to do so before the markup. The bill includes policies and savings in the Medicaid program, as well as provisions outside of Medicaid, such as codifying the Affordable Care Act program integrity proposed rule and establishing a 'doc fix' for clinicians. The bill would also prevent disproportionate share hospital payment cuts until 2029. The committee markup will likely last well into the evening on Tuesday, with Democrats offering amendments and critiques. Assuming the bill passes committee, it will then need to be stitched together with the other bills that make up reconciliation for consideration on the House floor. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will testify on Wednesday before the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on the president's fiscal year 2026 proposed HHS budget.

**Most controversial Medicaid cuts left out of reconciliation text**
House Republicans have released a package that would make significant changes to Medicaid, including work requirements for most healthy adults, more frequent eligibility checks, and changes to how states raise their share of Medicaid funding. However, the package left out more controversial proposals, such as capping federal spending on Medicaid expansion per enrollee and decreasing the amount the federal government pays to cover the population of 20 million people who received Medicaid under broadened eligibility in the 2010 health care law. The package would require states to conduct eligibility checks for Medicaid every six months instead of every 12 months, and would reduce the federal government's share of Medicaid funding by 10% for states that cover undocumented immigrants in their programs. It would also delay until 2035 several Biden-era Medicaid rules, including one that would streamline enrollment and eligibility for beneficiaries. The package would also change states' ability to finance their share of Medicaid spending through provider taxes, and would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to issue regulations preventing state-directed payments from exceeding Medicare rates.

**Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie: Budget Reconciliation Bill Defunds Planned Parenthood**
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, led by Chairman Brett Guthrie, has included a provision in the proposed budget reconciliation bill to strip federal taxpayer dollars from abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, through Medicaid. This move comes after a campaign from conservatives and pro-life organizations to end taxpayer funding for abortion organizations. Rep. Mary Miller praised the decision, saying, 'I applaud Chairman Guthrie for taking a step in the right direction to stop taxpayer-funded Medicaid dollars from being sent to abortion providers and other dangerous services.' Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser also praised the move, stating, 'Taxpayers should never be mandated to prop up an industry that profits from ending lives and harming women and girls.' According to Planned Parenthood's 2023 annual report, taxpayer funding made up 34% of their overall revenue, totaling $699.3 million. The organization performed 392,716 abortions in 2021-2022, a five percent increase from the previous year.

**Conservatives chafe at taking Medicaid savings options off table**
House Republican leadership's decision to drop two Medicaid cost-saving proposals has sparked outrage among hard-line conservatives, who see it as an 'embrace of Obamacare' that will harm the traditional Medicaid population. The proposals, which would have cut federal Medicaid spending by billions of dollars, were met with opposition from moderate GOP lawmakers. A Congressional Budget Office analysis shows that the proposals could lead to steep losses in health care coverage for millions of people. Republican leadership is racing to find savings to help pay for President Donald Trump's reconciliation bill. Chairman Brett Guthrie said that per capita caps for states' Medicaid expansion programs are still 'alive,' despite Speaker Mike Johnson's statement that they were off the table. The CBO analysis estimates that reducing the federal match for Medicaid expansion would save $710 billion over 10 years, but would also result in 5.5 million fewer people being covered under Medicaid by 2034.

**Holland & Knight Health Dose: April 29, 2025**
The U.S. Congress is aiming to pass a reconciliation bill by Memorial Day 2025, with a focus on budget savings and funding recissions. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to mark up its section of the package, which includes $880 billion in savings. President Donald Trump is also expected to share a list of up to $9 billion in 'recissions,' federal funding the Trump Administration would like to pull back on spending. Several committees will hold hearings and markups on provisions that may be included in the reconciliation bill. The Trump Administration has continued to release executive orders, including one that extends the federal hiring freeze through July 15, 2025. The administration also announced a potential pathway to restore accountability to policy-influencing positions within the federal workforce. The House Ways and Means Committee issued a request for information on the tax status of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs). The Senate HELP Committee released a report titled, 'Congress Must Act to Bring Needed Reforms to the 340B Drug Pricing Program.' The report makes five recommendations for Congress to consider as it looks to potentially reform the program. The Health Tech Investment Act was introduced to establish a payment pathway for AI-enabled medical devices. The CMS issued the proposed fiscal year (FY) 2026 Medicare Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) and Long-Term Acute Care Hospital (LTCH) Rule. The MACPAC and MedPAC April Meetings highlighted the importance of Medicaid coverage for maternity care services and long-term services and supports (LTSS). The report finds that China leads in biotechnology advances, and the U.S. is at risk of losing its competitive edge. The Department of Commerce initiated a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas vacated part of CMS' rule to require a minimum nurse staffing for nursing homes. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc., which may have implications for access to no-cost preventive services under the Affordable Care Act.

**Colorado skirts Medicaid cuts as Fed considers reductions**
The House of Representatives has passed a federal budget blueprint that calls for $1.5 trillion in total spending cuts, with a focus on reducing Medicaid funding. However, Colorado lawmakers and health care leaders are concerned that these cuts will harm the state's Medicaid program and its beneficiaries. Colorado Representative Rick Taggart stated, 'We have to find deficiencies in the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF) and in Medicaid, without hurting the people that rely on it. That's not going to be easy because we can't absorb $300 to $500 million additional every year.' The state's Medicaid expenses have exceeded its budget by $154 million in the 2023-2024 fiscal year and by $73 million in the 2024-2025 fiscal year. Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper said, 'I've talked to a bunch of Republican and Democrat Governors, and they're pretty unified: this is a terrible idea.' U.S. Representative Jeff Hurd, a Republican serving Colorado's 3rd District, signed a joint letter to his fellow Republican representatives emphasizing that he will only support the proposed budget if Medicaid funding is protected. 'We cannot and will not support a final reconciliation bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations,' the letter said.

**Senate Republicans go weak on spending cuts - Washington Examiner**
The House reconciliation bill aims for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, partially offset by $2 trillion in spending cuts. However, the Senate budget instruction lacks a forcing mechanism to ensure spending cuts, instead setting a paltry $4 billion target. Senate Republicans claim this is a placeholder for later cuts, but House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-TX) says, 'The only thing you can trust in the United States Congress and in Washington, D.C., is an airtight budget target that's enforceable.' The reality is that many Senate Republicans lack the courage to cut programs driving federal spending, such as Medicaid, which is expected to rise from $618 billion this year to $1.02 trillion in 2035. House Republicans have made a bold step by admitting slowing Medicaid growth is essential for bringing deficits under control, with $880 billion in savings from the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Senate bill's low spending cut target is a recipe for tax cuts not offset by spending reductions and an explosion in federal deficits.

**Congress unveils spending plan after Trump calls on Republicans to avoid government shutdown**
Congress has released a bill to avert a partial government shutdown during the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's term. The 100-page legislation would maintain current government funding levels through the beginning of fiscal year (FY) 2026. The bill includes a $6 billion increase in defense spending and a $13 billion decrease in non-defense spending. It also adds $6 billion for healthcare for veterans. House GOP leaders are confident that they can pass the bill with Republican votes alone, but Democrats are opposing it, accusing Republicans of trying to cut Medicare and Medicaid. Trump has not reviewed the specific pages yet, but has expressed support for the bill, saying it sets up the opportunity to cut taxes and spending in reconciliation.

**Louisiana's Mike Johnson scored a big budget win. Here are the challenges he faces now.**
House Speaker Mike Johnson has secured a significant victory for President Donald Trump's legislative agenda, passing a budget reconciliation bill by a single vote. The bill, which sets budgetary levels for fiscal years 2025-2034, includes increases for border security, deportations, and national defense, as well as tax breaks for the wealthy. Johnson faces new challenges, including passing a stopgap funding bill to avoid a government shutdown on March 14 and navigating the Senate's likely changes to the bill. Johnson said, 'We are going to deliver the America First agenda. We're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back in the morning.' The bill could add at least $5 trillion to the nation's debt and has been criticized by Democrats for slashing funding for programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.

**CT delegation warns of threats to Medicaid in GOP budget plan**
The House Republicans have passed a budget resolution that calls for spending cuts to offset the implementation of President Donald Trump's agenda. The plan includes at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, with social programs that help low-income families, such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), at risk. Democrats argue that the majority of the tax cuts benefiting the ultra-wealthy and big corporations would come at the expense of working families who rely on these programs. U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro said, 'Those struggling the most with high health care costs are the first ones left behind.' The resolution's passage will set in motion negotiations with Senate Republicans, who passed their own version last week. Trump prefers the House's budget resolution, which is the first step in what is known as reconciliation. The plan instructs deficit reductions from half a dozen committees, with the biggest cuts from three between fiscal years 2025 and 2034: $880 billion from the Energy and Commerce Committee, $330 billion from the Education and Workforce Committee, and $230 billion from the Agriculture Committee. About 72 million Americans received coverage under Medicaid as of 2024, and nearly 400,000 SNAP beneficiaries in Connecticut are at risk of cuts. Sharon Parrott, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities president, said, 'The quick math on the House budget shows a stark equation: the cost of extending tax cuts for households with incomes in the top 1% equals roughly the same amount as the proposed potential cuts for health coverage under Medicaid and food assistance under SNAP.'

**What Does the Federal Government Spend on Health Care?**
The federal government spent $1.9 trillion on health care programs and services in fiscal year 2024, accounting for 27% of all federal outlays. This includes $398 billion in forgone tax revenues from tax subsidies for employer-sponsored insurance coverage and the Affordable Care Act. Medicaid, Medicare, and employer-sponsored coverage account for 86% of total federal support for health programs and services. Discretionary spending, which includes funding for veterans' health care and global health, accounts for 11% of federal support. Proposed cuts to federal spending on health programs and services could increase the number of people without insurance, reduce access to health care, and increase consumer costs. The effects would be felt by people of all incomes, but would likely be concentrated among those with low incomes. The federal budget reconciliation process could be used to reduce federal financial support for health programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. A 50-page menu of options for policies that could be included in a reconciliation package includes reducing federal spending on Medicaid, Medicare, and the ACA subsidies.

The U.S. Senate passed a budget resolution for fiscal year 2025 with a 52-48 vote, authorizing $340 billion in spending and fully offset by corresponding cuts. The resolution is a blueprint for one of two budget reconciliation bills, with the second focusing on tax cuts and spending reductions. The House of Representatives plans to vote on its own budget resolution next week, which includes $2 trillion in spending cuts and up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. President Trump prefers the House's one-bill approach.

**Medicaid overhaul proves to be politically perilous proposition**
House Republicans are considering Medicaid cuts to pay for a $4.5 trillion tax cut package, but face obstacles such as public opinion, governors' concerns, and hospitals' opposition. The federal government spent $618 billion on Medicaid in fiscal 2024, and any reduction in funding would force states to cut services, reduce rates, or limit benefits. Hospitals, which receive 19% of their payments from Medicaid, are particularly concerned about the proposals. Senate Republicans are working on their own version of a reconciliation bill, but have not said what role Medicaid will play in it. 'Hospitals are really viewing this as an existential threat,' said Carlos Jackson, a principal at Cornerstone Government Affairs. 'If you eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in Medicaid, you've got a huge amount of money that you can spend on real priorities for the country,' said Speaker Mike Johnson. However, experts say that reducing Medicaid funding would have downstream effects, including less funding to states and service cuts for patients and rate cuts to providers.
