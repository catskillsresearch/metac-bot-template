**Drone Delivery Tests Successfully Conducted on Kuril Islands**
Experts from the 'Krylya Sakhalya' scientific and production center conducted a series of tests to use drones for delivering medicines to remote areas on the Iturup Island in the Kuril Islands. The tests were conducted on the route from Kurilsk to Gorячие Ключи village and back. The journey by land takes around an hour, but due to the complex road conditions in winter, it can take even longer. However, using drones reduced the delivery time to 22 minutes. The tests were successful and confirmed the possibility of using this technology for healthcare needs on the Kuril Islands. This new technology was tested at the request of Governor Valery Limarenko after his meeting with the Kurilsk residents. 'The drone test flights showed that their application for medical purposes is at a new level', said Vasily Alenkov, deputy head of the regional government.

**Russia May Lose Financial Cushion by 2026, Report Warns**
According to a recent report, if current sanctions remain in place and the West increases control over oil sanctions evasion, Russia may lose its remaining financial cushion by 2026. Official data shows that at the beginning of July 2022, the liquid part of the reserve fund was worth $145 billion. However, this amount decreased by almost half to $78 billion within a year, and by May 1, 2025, it was reduced to $39 billion. As a result, Russia's reserves have decreased by nearly four times. The report also notes that if the average price of Brent oil falls to $64 per barrel in 2025 and to $60 in 2026, Russia's budget, which heavily relies on energy resources, will face significant fiscal pressure. Additionally, the report highlights that the economic situation within the country is deteriorating: 'Rosatom' projects for 2025 are underfunded by 80%, rail transportation is declining, and there is a decline in the extractive, metal, and construction industries. Furthermore, several large companies have suspended dividend payments. 'Despite this, Moscow continues to demonstrate confidence in the stability of the economy. However, state propaganda cannot hide the real scale of the crisis - Russia's raw material-based economy is rapidly losing its effectiveness,' the report concludes.

**Drones Successfully Tested for Medical Delivery on Kuril Islands**
A team of specialists successfully conducted a series of tests using drones to transport medications between settlements on the island of Iturup. The tests were conducted on the route Kurilsk - Goryachie Klyuchi and back, which typically takes around an hour to complete by land, especially during the winter months due to the poor condition of the roads. However, using a drone, the delivery took only 22 minutes, demonstrating a clear time-saving advantage. According to Viktor Griytsenko, general director of the 'Krylya Sakhalya' scientific and production center, four flights were conducted under a simulated scenario to deliver medications from the central district hospital to a rural health post. The tests were successful, but Griytsenko noted that there is still room for improvement. 'We still have something to strive for. This is what test flights are for - to work out the technology that will become perfect and fault-tolerant,' he said.

**Ukrainian SVR: Russia May Lose Financial Cushion in 2026**
According to the Ukrainian SVR, Russia may lose its financial cushion in 2026. Over the past three years, Russia has spent a significant portion of its National Welfare Fund (NWF) due to the ongoing war. If current sanctions remain in place and the West tightens control over oil sanctions evasion, Russia may lose its remaining financial cushion by 2026. The NWF's liquid assets have decreased from $145 billion in July 2022 to $39 billion in May 2025, a nearly fourfold reduction. The SVR also notes that a decline in the average Brent oil price to $64 per barrel in 2025 and $60 in 2026 would put Russia's budget, heavily reliant on energy resources, under significant fiscal pressure. The economic situation within Russia is deteriorating, with 'Rosatom' projects underfunded by 80%, declining rail transportation, and a downturn in the mining, metalworking, and construction sectors. Several major companies have suspended dividend payments. 'Despite this, Moscow continues to demonstrate confidence in the stability of its economy. However, state propaganda cannot conceal the real scale of the crisis - Russia's raw materials-based economic model is rapidly losing effectiveness,' the SVR concluded.

**Russia Expands Control in Ukrainian Region of Sumy, Sparking Concerns of Large-Scale Attack**
Russia has expanded its control in the Ukrainian region of Sumy, sparking concerns in Kiev about a large-scale attack. According to a statement by the Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday, they have taken control of the village of Vodolagyi near the Russian border in Sumy, north-east of Ukraine, after announcing control over other villages in the region in recent weeks. The Ukrainian military's chief of staff, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Saturday that Russia is focusing its attacks on several locations in the Donetsk region, including Bokovsk, Turivsk, and 'parts of the Sumy region.' He also noted that Russian forces are intensifying their attacks in the south, in the Zaporizhzhia region, where Ukraine is also concerned about a potential attack. A large-scale attack would pose a significant challenge to the Ukrainian military, which is less equipped and faces difficulties. Despite intense diplomatic efforts to end the Russian invasion, which began in 2022, fighting continues in Ukraine. Russia has mobilized over 50,000 troops, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said Moscow is seeking to establish a buffer zone to prevent Ukrainian advances, as happened last summer in Kursk, near the Sumy region. Authorities in Sumy have ordered the mandatory evacuation of 11 villages near the border, citing the 'ongoing threat to civilians' lives due to shelling of border towns. Orders to evacuate have been issued in 213 towns in the region in recent weeks, but this does not necessarily mean that the Russian army is preparing to occupy the village or town. The head of the government's border guard service, Andrei Demchenko, told Ukrainian television on Thursday that Russia has enough troops near Sumy 'to try to launch an attack.' He said the troop buildup began when Russian forces were fighting the Ukrainian army in the Russian region of Kursk. The Ukrainian army launched a surprise attack in Kursk in August, but since then, Ukrainian forces have lost almost all the territory they controlled. In February 2022, Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and now occupies about 20% of its territory. Behind this conflict are thousands of civilian and military casualties from both sides.

**Russia Claims Japan Still Seeks Dialogue with Moscow**
The Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitri Peskov, stated that in Japan, 'there are still sectors that consider it necessary to restore relations and resume dialogue' with Russia, despite Tokyo's sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. This comes after the visit to Moscow of Akie Abe, the widow of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was received by President Vladimir Putin in an unusual diplomatic meeting. According to the Russian agency TASS, Peskov claimed that the current Japanese government has taken a 'short-sighted' stance by joining Western sanctions, and criticized what he called 'illegal and unfriendly' measures against Russia. Peskov emphasized that the gesture of receiving Abe responds to the memory of the 'constructive and warm' relationship between Putin and the former Japanese leader. Peskov recalled that during Abe's tenure, 'significant and productive negotiations' took place for the signing of a peace treaty between the two countries, pending since the end of World War II due to the dispute over the Kuril Islands. 'The bilateral situation at that time was very favorable,' he stressed. The meeting between Abe and Putin is seen as having implications beyond the personal level, suggesting a possible message to the Japanese government in the context of improving relations after the invasion of Ukraine.

**New Cruise Line to Connect Sakhalin, Kurils, and Kamchatka in 2026**
The authorities of Primorye plan to launch a cruise line along the Far East in 2026. This was announced during the 10th Pacific Tourism Forum, reported by RIA VladNews. According to Governor of Primorye Oleg Kozhemyako, a new cruise line will be launched in 2026, connecting Sakhalin, Kurils, and Kamchatka, allowing tourists to enjoy the unique nature of these territories. 'We are working to open new cruise routes. Meetings have taken place, which give grounds to believe that this line will be launched in 2026. It will cover Sakhalin, Kurils, Kamchatka, and give tourists the opportunity to admire the natural beauty of these wonderful places. It will give Russian and foreign tourists the opportunity to get to know Russia,' said Oleg Kozhemyako. As noted by Alexander Tsiganov, head of the department of insurance and economics of the social sphere, Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, cruises are a modern and in-demand type of rest, which Russians have actively used. 'The route along the Far East can and should become popular, as it combines several known natural sites and reserves, historical attractions, which are also present in the region. Visiting the Kuril Islands with their unique nature, and disembarking will be remembered and become an adventure that many Russians will strive for. This will increase the number of tourists arriving in the Far East, in Vladivostok and other regional centers, where cruise stops and passenger delivery from airports can be organized,' said Alexander Tsiganov. Professional traveler Albert emphasized that there is already interest in Far Eastern routes. According to his data, in 2024, the macro-region was visited by 6.5 million tourists, and the number of foreign guests increased by 80%. 'In the cruise tourism segment, demand is clearly ahead of supply. The available today expeditionary cruises belong to the premium segment and are inaccessible to a wide audience. The new line is able to expand the market and make the Far East a real alternative for domestic and inbound tourism,' said Albert. He also noted that cruises allow solving the problem of transportation accessibility of remote regions and compensating for the lack of infrastructure. The coverage of several territories in one trip increases the value of the route for tourists, especially foreign, who prefer organized and comfortable rest. However, despite the positive aspects, the project may face serious challenges. 'The high cost of cruises to the Far East remains a barrier to mass demand. The lack of suitable Arctic-class ships limits the opportunities for increasing supply. Administrative procedures, including requirements for coordinating routes with controlling authorities, may complicate the organization of voyages. Cruise tourism is also sensitive to seasonality, which requires flexibility in navigation planning,' said traveler Albert. The success of the project will depend on the ability to overcome these limitations, he believes. He considers that government support is needed for the construction of the fleet, subsidizing voyages in the initial period, and simplifying procedures for operators. This will help the cruise line occupy a place on the country's tourist map and become a symbol of the development of tourism in the Far East.'

**Russia Prepares to Unlock Unique Rhenium Deposits on the Kuril Islands**
Russia is preparing to open a unique production facility that will significantly strengthen its position in the high-tech industry. The facility will be located on the Iturup Island and will utilize the volcano Kudryavy, which is the only industrial source of rhenium, a rare metal with unique properties. Rhenium is one of the densest and most heat-resistant metals on the planet, and its addition to alloys significantly improves their characteristics, making it essential for the production of modern supersonic aircraft and high-precision missiles. However, extracting rhenium is a complex process due to its low natural concentration, often found in copper ores. Russia's access to rhenium was limited after the collapse of the Soviet Union, forcing it to rely on imports and recycling of scrap metal. The situation changed in the 1990s when Russian scientists discovered that the Kudryavy volcano emits at least 20 tons of rhenium into the atmosphere annually, while the global demand for the metal is only 60 tons per year. Despite this discovery, the technology to extract rhenium in such extreme conditions did not exist. After years of work, the company 'Russian Rhenium' has patented a technology and is preparing to launch a pilot production facility within the next two years. However, the question of why this valuable resource was left untapped for so long remains open. The answer lies in the technological complexity and the reluctance of investors to invest in a high-risk project, as well as diplomatic considerations, as Japan has historically been sensitive to any Russian activity on the Kuril Islands. However, with the introduction of anti-Russian sanctions by Japan and its support for Ukraine, the situation has changed, and Russia can no longer afford to ignore its own rare earth resources. The loss of 20 tons of rhenium per year is not just a missed opportunity but a strategic vulnerability, especially when combined with the loss of other valuable elements, such as indium, germanium, and possibly other unexplored minerals. The chances of launching rhenium mining on Iturup are higher than ever. The success of this project will not only strengthen Russia's position in high-tech industries but also become another argument in the dispute over the Kuril Islands, not only from a military but also from an economic perspective.

**Russia Bans Japanese NGO Over Kuril Islands Dispute**
Russia has banned a Japanese NGO, the Northern Territories Issue Association, which has been advocating for the return of the disputed Kuril Islands to Japan. The islands, located between the northeastern tip of Hokkaido and the Kamchatka Peninsula, have been under Russian control since the end of World War II. The dispute between Russia and Japan over the islands remains unresolved. According to the Russian authorities, the NGO is considered 'undesirable' for supporting the return of the southern Kuril Islands to Japan. 'The Kuril Islands are a disputed territory, and it seems that its status will not change in the near future,' the article states.

**Japan Calls Russia's Position on Kuril Islands Dispute 'Unfair and Unacceptable'**
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Esimasa Hayashi has called Russia's position on the Kuril Islands dispute 'unfair and unacceptable'. Hayashi stated that 'between Japan and Russia, negotiations on a peace treaty are ongoing, as the territorial issue remains unresolved. We consider Russia's response to be extremely unfair and completely unacceptable.' This comment comes in response to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's statement that Russia has no territorial disputes with other countries, including Japan. Lavrov said, 'All territorial disputes are closed, they understand this perfectly.' Japan views the Kuril Islands as its 'northern territories' and has repeatedly expressed its opposition to Russia's control over the islands. In April, Japan re-designated the islands as 'illegally occupied by Russia.' The dispute has led to Japan imposing sanctions on Russia in March 2022 in response to the military operation on Ukraine. Russia's Foreign Ministry responded by stating that Moscow would not continue negotiations with Tokyo on a peace treaty due to Japan's 'hostile' unilateral restrictions.

**Russian Audit Chamber Evaluates Effectiveness of Preferential Regimes in the Far East**
The Russian Audit Chamber has evaluated the effectiveness of preferential regimes in the Far East and has found them to be insufficient. The Chamber notes that the regimes do not form a unified system of support for the development of the region, and has sent a number of recommendations to the government for their improvement. The Chamber's evaluation was based on the activities of the 'Corporation for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic', the federal target program 'Social and Economic Development of the Kuril Islands for 2016-2025', and the results of the application of the preferential regime on the Kuril Islands in 2021-2023. According to the Chamber, the territories of advanced development (TOD), the territory of the free port of Vladivostok (SPV), the preferential regime on the Kuril Islands, the special economic zone in the Magadan region, and the regional investment project (RIP) regime all have their own separate approaches to evaluation, monitoring, and control. 'We have sent the government a number of recommendations, including proposing to prepare changes to the legislation aimed at improving the regimes of TOD, SPV, and the special tax regime on the Kuril Islands, to stop the operation of the RIP regime in the Far East, while preserving the benefits for its participants within the period of their validity, to establish monitoring of the activities of residents of TOD and SPV, whose period of action of the provided benefits is coming to an end, for the analysis of the sustainability of the effects of the mentioned regimes', - it is said in the materials. The Chamber notes that the management of the preferential regimes in the Far East is carried out by different federal and regional authorities, and the legislative acts regulating their work provide different approaches to evaluation, monitoring, and control. 'In particular, the benefits and support measures in most of the preferential regimes are in general similar and are mainly aimed at maintaining investment activity in a wide range of industries without clear direction', - notes auditor Natalya Trunova. For example, the support measures within the SPV regime are not fully focused on integration into the economic space of the states of the Asia-Pacific region and international trade. 'In the volume of investments attracted by SPV residents, 35% are occupied by projects in the field of construction and development, and 39% - in the field of logistics and transport', - it is noted in the materials. Additionally, when creating TODs, economic and budgetary effects for the subjects of the Russian Federation and (or) municipal formations are not fixed, which should be achieved, and TODs located in the largest cities of the Far East show insufficient indicators of improving investment activity. 'The Corporation for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic' did not fully use the subsidies provided in 2021-2023 for the development of TOD infrastructure. As for the preferential regime on the Kuril Islands, the Audit Chamber notes that about 30% of its participants do not conduct any activity. At the same time, the remaining participants have attracted only 4.4% of the planned volume of investments and created 8.2% of the envisaged number of jobs. 'It is necessary to establish a unified system of support for the development of the Far East, which would provide clear direction and focus on the development of specific industries and regions', - Natalya Trunova emphasizes.

**Russia to Introduce New Tax Incentives on Kuril Islands**
The Russian government plans to introduce new tax incentives on the Kuril Islands to encourage more investment projects. According to the government's press service, the changes will include allowing investors who own more than 50% of a company registered on the islands to benefit from tax incentives. Additionally, companies that have been operating in the region for the past three years and use a simplified tax system will be able to apply a reduced rate of 7.6% for social security contributions. 'This will contribute to the implementation of more investment projects,' emphasized Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. The Kuril Islands have two preferential regimes in place, with the first being the 'Kurils' Free Port created in 2017 and the second introduced in March 2022. Since their introduction, 20 organizations have already taken advantage of these regimes.

**Russian Government Submits Bill to Repeal Tax Benefits Ban for Kuril Islands**
The Russian government has submitted a bill to the State Duma to repeal the ban on applying tax benefits to new legal entities registered on the Kuril Islands after January 1, 2022. According to the current legislation, an organization registered on the Kuril Islands is exempt from tax obligations until December 31, 2046, but only if it was registered after January 1, 2022. However, the recipient of tax benefits cannot be a new organization if 50% or more of its share is owned by a person (or related companies) that already owns the same share in another company registered on the Kuril Islands before January 1, 2022. The bill removes these restrictions for companies if their new investment project meets the government's criteria and is approved by the government's commission for the development of the Far East. 'The proposed changes will not affect the established bans on applying preferential conditions for business activities of individuals created as a result of reorganization of organizations registered on the territory of the Kuril Islands before January 1, 2022, or reorganized by joining such an organization registered on the territory of the Kuril Islands before January 1, 2022,' - it is said in the explanatory note. The adoption of these amendments will allow the implementation of 16 new investment projects on the Kuril Islands, with a total investment of 12.4 billion rubles, creating 400 new jobs. The second amendment allows organizations registered on the Kuril Islands after January 1, 2022, and applying the simplified tax system, to pay insurance premiums at reduced rates. The financial and economic justification for the bill estimates the tax expenditures of the federal budget at 2.3 billion rubles for the period 2026-2036. The calculation was made based on the hypothesis of annual creation of 11 new legal entities. If the bill is adopted, it will enter into force a month after official publication, but not earlier than the first day of the next tax period for corporate income tax and insurance premiums.

**Russian Government Submits Bill to Expand Tax Benefits on Kuril Islands**
The Russian government has submitted a bill to the State Duma to increase the investment attractiveness of the preferential regime on the Kuril Islands. The bill proposes to exclude the ban on applying tax benefits to new legal entities, created by organizations and (or) their related parties, which do not have more than 50% ownership in another participant that has lost the right to tax benefits in the preferential regime on the Kuril Islands or in another organization registered on the Kuril Islands before January 1, 2022. The bill also plans to add norms to the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which will require investment projects implemented by this category of investors to meet the criteria set by the Russian government and receive approval from the presidium of the government commission on social and economic development of the Far East. According to preliminary data, lifting these restrictions will contribute to the implementation of about 16 new investment projects, with a total investment of approximately 12.4 billion rubles and the creation of 400 new jobs, as stated in the explanatory note. 'The proposed changes will not affect the established bans on applying preferential conditions for conducting entrepreneurial activities by entities created as a result of reorganization of organizations registered on the Kuril Islands before January 1, 2022, or reorganized by merging with them organizations registered on the Kuril Islands before January 1, 2022', - the government noted. Additionally, the project proposes to amend Article 427 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, allowing organizations registered on the Kuril Islands after January 1, 2022, and applying the simplified taxation system, to pay insurance premiums at reduced rates. According to preliminary estimates, the number of organizations interested in reducing the rate of insurance premiums in the framework of applying the simplified taxation system is approximately 11 newly created legal entities per year, as noted by the government.

**Japanese Prime Minister Hardens Rhetoric on Kuril Islands**
Japanese Prime Minister Sigeru Ishiba has hardened his rhetoric on the Kuril Islands for the first time in years. Speaking at the 'All-Japan Congress on the Demand for the Return of the Northern Territories', Ishiba stated, 'Japan will firmly adhere to the policy of resolving the issue of the four northern islands and concluding a peace treaty.' This phrase was last used by the Japanese government in 2019. The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to Ishiba's words, stating that in light of Japan's hostile policy towards Russia, Moscow sees no possibility of holding a dialogue with Tokyo on concluding a peace treaty between the two countries. The Kuril Islands have been a point of contention between Russia and Japan since the end of World War II, with Japan refusing to recognize Russia's sovereignty over the islands. Japan's position on the Kuril Islands has become more aggressive since the start of the special military operation, with Tokyo using the phrase 'illegal occupation' in its 2023 'Blue Book on Diplomacy' to describe Russia's control over the southern part of the islands. Japan aims to 'resolve the territorial issue' and then resume peaceful relations with Russia, according to the report. Japan's imposition of anti-Russian sanctions, which it joined in 2022 at the behest of the US, has also hindered efforts to improve relations between the two countries.
