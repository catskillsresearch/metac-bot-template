**AI Chat Bot Grok Predicts Winner Of Indian Premier League Clash Between Lucknow Super Giants And Gujarat Titans**
AI chat bot Grok predicts Gujarat Titans (GT) to win the IPL 2025 clash against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) on May 22 at Narendra Modi Stadium. According to Grok, GT's strong batting lineup, led by Shubman Gill, and home ground advantage give them an edge over LSG. GT has secured a playoff spot with 18 points, boasting a strong batting lineup with Sai Sudharsan and Jos Buttler, and a lethal bowling attack featuring Prasidh Krishna and Rashid Khan. LSG, on the other hand, relies on Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni but lacks bowling depth. GT's historical dominance (4-2 head-to-head) and home advantage tilt the scales in their favor, said Grok in its prediction for the IPL clash.

**Leaderboard illusion: How big tech skewed AI rankings on Chatbot Arena**
A study, titled 'The Leaderboard Illusion,' has revealed that major tech firms, including Meta, Google, and OpenAI, allegedly exploited private testing on Chatbot Arena to secure top rankings, raising concerns about fairness and transparency in AI model benchmarking. The study found that these companies were given privileged access to test multiple versions of their AI models privately, allowing them to selectively publish only the highest-performing versions and boost their rankings. According to the study, this manipulation of the leaderboard has potentially distorted perceptions of model performance and undermined open competition.

**Leaderboard Illusion: A Study on the Flaws of Chatbot Arena's Rating Mechanism**
A recent study, 'Leaderboard Illusion', has raised concerns about the transparency and objectivity of the rating mechanisms used by Chatbot Arena, a platform for evaluating chatbots. The study found that the platform's reliance on anonymous models, hidden testing of multiple models, and varying treatment of participants can systematically distort the ratings. The researchers collected data by scraping the platform from January to March 2025 and de-anonymized the models by asking them questions like 'who are you?' or 'who trained you?' They found that some large providers, such as Meta and Google, were allowed to test multiple anonymous models simultaneously, which can lead to biased ratings. The study also presented a mathematical simulation to demonstrate the impact of private testing on the ratings. The researchers concluded that the current rating system is flawed and that more transparent and objective methods are needed to evaluate chatbots.

**Study accuses LM Arena of helping top AI labs game its benchmark**
A new study from AI labs Cohere, Stanford, MIT, and Ai2 accuses LM Arena of helping top AI companies, including Meta, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon, achieve better leaderboard scores on the popular crowdsourced AI benchmark Chatbot Arena. According to the authors, LM Arena allowed these companies to privately test multiple AI models, then only publish the scores of the top performers, giving them an unfair advantage. 'This is gamification,' said Cohere's VP of AI research, Sara Hooker. LM Arena has maintained that its benchmark is impartial and fair, but the study's authors say they uncovered evidence to the contrary. One AI company, Meta, was able to privately test 27 model variants on Chatbot Arena before releasing its Llama 4 model, which ranked near the top of the leaderboard. LM Arena has denied the allegations, saying that the study contains 'inaccuracies' and 'questionable analysis.'

**Study accuses LM Arena of helping top AI labs game its benchmark | TechCrunch**
A new study from AI lab Cohere, Stanford, MIT, and Ai2 accuses LM Arena, the organization behind the popular crowdsourced AI benchmark Chatbot Arena, of helping a select group of AI companies achieve better leaderboard scores at the expense of rivals. According to the authors, LM Arena allowed some industry-leading AI companies like Meta, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon to privately test several variants of AI models, then not publish the scores of the lowest performers. This made it easier for these companies to achieve a top spot on the platform's leaderboard, though the opportunity was not afforded to every firm, the authors say. 'This is gamification,' said Cohere's VP of AI research and co-author of the study, Sara Hooker. The authors found evidence that LM Arena allowed certain AI companies to collect more data from Chatbot Arena by having their models appear in a higher number of model 'battles.' This increased sampling rate gave these companies an unfair advantage, the authors allege. The study calls on LM Arena to implement changes aimed at making Chatbot Arena more 'fair,' such as setting a clear and transparent limit on the number of private tests AI labs can conduct, and publicly disclosing scores from these tests.

**Beyond the Leaderboard: Why Real-World Impact Matters More Than Benchmark Scores**
A recent research paper, 'The Leaderboard Illusion', reveals that the current AI model ranking system, Chatbot Arena, has been manipulated by industry giants to benefit their own interests. The researchers found that certain providers are allowed to test multiple model variants privately before releasing only the best performers, creating an unfair advantage. This practice, known as 'best-of-N' submission strategy, significantly inflates scores and creates a self-reinforcing cycle where proprietary models remain active longer and gather more data. The paper also found that open-weight and open-source models are disproportionately affected by these deprecations. The researchers argue that leaderboard rankings are an incomplete measure of a model's value and can be misleading. They propose a more nuanced approach to AI evaluation and implementation, focusing on how effectively AI addresses specific business challenges rather than benchmark scores. This approach is exemplified by Cocoa AI's framework, which assesses AI readiness across six critical pillars and identifies opportunities that align with business goals.

**The AI model race has suddenly gotten a lot closer, say Stanford scholars**
The competition to create the world's top artificial intelligence models has become increasingly competitive, with a narrowing gap between the best and the weakest models. According to Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, the Elo score difference between the top and 10th-ranked model on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard narrowed from 11.9% in 2024 to 5.4% in early 2025. The gap between OpenAI and Google has also narrowed, with the GPT family and Gemini having a performance difference of just 0.7%. Additionally, the rise of 'open-weight' AI models, such as Meta Platforms's Llama, has made it possible for them to equal the top 'closed' models, such as GPT. The authors note that creating benchmarks is not simple and that standardizing across benchmarks is essential going forward to ensure reliable AI evaluation and prevent misleading conclusions about model performance.
