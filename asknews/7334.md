**Ban on livestock markets before Eid is a harsh move on farmers: Prakash Ambedkar**
The Maharashtra Goseva Ayog has issued a circular banning the holding of livestock markets from June 3 to June 8, 2025, ahead of Bakri-Eid on June 7. The move has raised concerns among cattle rearers, who are mostly daily wage farmers, as they will incur significant financial losses during this period. Prakash Ambedkar, founder of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, has strongly opposed the circular, stating that it is a harsh step against farmers and those who depend on the market. He questioned the authority of the Maharashtra Goseva Ayog to issue such a circular and asked who will compensate for the losses incurred by farmers. The circular has also disrupted the plans of people who plan to purchase animals for Bakri-Eid rituals, which involve animal sacrifice, primarily goat or sheep.

**Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture Announces Success of Local Wheat Experiment**
The Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture has announced the commercial success of an experiment to harvest three improved local wheat varieties, launched by Minister Abdul Rahman bin Abdul Mohsen Al-Fadhli in February. The experiment, which lasted for three seasons, included three improved varieties of wheat, two of which are 'soft wheat' and one is 'durm' wheat. The three varieties were planted on an area of over 45 hectares in the Al-Jouf region, in collaboration with the Al-Jouf Development Company, using agricultural techniques and with the supervision of the Seeds and Genetic Resources Center. The results of the harvest showed a high production rate, with some fields producing up to 8000 kilograms per hectare. The ministry stated that the results reflect the suitability of the varieties for commercial cultivation and their ability to compete with imported varieties, reducing the need for imported wheat. The project is part of the center's plan to improve local wheat varieties, in line with the national agricultural strategy, to achieve sustainability and increase local production efficiency, in accordance with the goals of Vision 2030.

**Maharashtra Government's Decision to Close Animal Markets Ahead of Eid al-Adha Sparks Controversy**
The Maharashtra government has taken a significant decision ahead of Eid al-Adha, which is celebrated on June 7. The Animal Welfare Board of Maharashtra has instructed all Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) to close all animal markets from June 3 to June 8. This move is aimed at preventing the illegal slaughter of animals. In Maharashtra, the slaughter of cows and bullocks is completely banned, and the sale of their meat is also considered a crime. Under this order, all animal markets, including those for goats, sheep, and buffaloes, will be closed for a week. The Animal Welfare Board has issued a circular on May 27 to all APMC, stating that during Eid al-Adha, a large number of animals are sacrificed, so no animal markets should be organized in any village during the first week of June to prevent animal slaughter incidents. The board has implemented this order under the Maharashtra Animal Preservation Act, which imposes strict restrictions on animal slaughter in the state. However, this decision has been met with opposition from various communities, particularly the Muslim community. They have questioned the need to close all markets for a week, as it will not only affect the sale of cows and bullocks but also other animals like goats, sheep, and buffaloes. Farooq Ahmed, the state vice-president of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, has said that the closure of markets will affect the livelihood of farmers, laborers, Kurmi-Khatik community members, and other related professionals. He has also questioned the authority of the Animal Welfare Board, saying that it can only provide advice, not issue direct orders. The Maharashtra government has 305 major and 603 minor APMC, under which there are 292 animal markets in the state. These markets are of great importance to the farming community, where they buy and sell animals during the monsoon season, use them for farming, and then sell them after the harvest due to the cost of their maintenance. During Eid al-Adha, the demand for goats, sheep, and small animals increases in these markets as Muslims buy them. This order will put a stop to all these activities for a week, making it a significant commercial and social issue. In this controversy, the Animal Welfare Board has clarified that its intention is only to prevent the illegal slaughter of cows and bullocks. The board believes that if animal markets are open, the sale of animals for sacrifice during Eid al-Adha will increase, and the chances of illegal slaughter will also increase. However, the closure of markets will affect the income of people involved in the sale of small animals, and a suitable solution needs to be found. The state government needs to make a balanced decision, taking into account the sentiments of all parties, so that both religious faith and the law are respected.

**Tangier Governor Bans Sale of Sacrificial Animals**
The Governor of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region has issued strict instructions to the mayors and workers in the region to prevent the sale of sacrificial animals in the coming days. According to sources, the Governor, Younes Tazi, held a meeting with the mayors and leaders, and issued strict orders to tighten the surveillance and prevent any illegal sales of the sacrificial animals. The sources also reported that the authorities in the city of Tetouan have increased their surveillance efforts, in coordination with the security forces and the Royal Gendarmerie, and are stopping any trucks carrying sacrificial animals to the city for sale in the markets at the end of the week. The sources stated that the city has seen a significant movement in the purchase and slaughter of sacrificial animals in the past few days, and their storage in a warehouse that has raised eyebrows among many observers and stakeholders in the meat industry. The sources also reported that checkpoints have been set up at the entrances to the city of Al Hamama Al Bayda, preventing the passage of any trucks carrying sacrificial animals, unless the driver has a permit that allows him to go directly to the slaughterhouse affiliated with the municipal council. As for the region of Al Hoceima, which has one of the largest markets for the sale of sacrificial animals in the north, the sources confirmed that the ban will also apply to the marketing of sheep in the market of 'Oulad Hamid' in the Kasr Al Kebir, which is visited by residents of various cities in the north to buy sacrificial animals. The local sources reported that the instructions issued in this regard aim to prevent the transfer of sacrificial animals to the market, and that the authorities will confiscate the heads of the animals and issue reports against those who violate the ban. This measure appears to be applied to all regions in the province.

**Samuel Allix's Quest for Sustainable Potato Production**
Samuel Allix, a 58-year-old farmer, has been working in the potato sector since 1986. He is the largest producer in Gironde, with 13,000 tonnes commercialized in 2024. Allix tries to reconcile his agricultural activity with more environmentally friendly methods. He uses technology, such as weather stations, sensors, and remote irrigation control, to consume less water in his activity. He also employs a technique of precise and fractioned fertilization of the soil, which allows for an economy of 25% of fertilizers, equivalent to 80 tonnes of product at the scale of his 280 hectares. In addition, he plants flowers that feed bees, such as the black bee of the Landes, in the pathways. Allix has been partially engaged in organic production since 2016, with 20 hectares in 2025. He uses mechanical weeding and herbicides are strictly forbidden. The soil, which is sandy and filtering, lends itself well to this method, which is more difficult on heavy, clayey soils. The farmer can also activate the irrigation pivots via his phone. His goal for 2025 is to be 100% organic and eliminate chemical weeding. He also uses a model predictive system, Miléos, to predict the risk of mildew and protect against it. He has invested in high-precision and high-capacity spraying equipment to delay treatments until the last moment. He also uses a biocontrol product, Pygmalion, to reduce the frequency of anti-mildew treatments. The waste from the potato harvest, which was previously left on the edges of the fields, is now used to produce biogas in a methane digester. The digestate, a kind of soup, is then spread as fertilizer between two crops.

**Austrian Government Coalition Agrees on Ban of Full-Spate Pig Pens**
The Austrian government coalition has agreed on a new regulation for the ban on full-spate pig pens in pig farming. The bill, which was passed in parliament on Tuesday, sets a shortened transition period until 2034. This implements a ruling by the Constitutional Court, which had overturned the previously planned deadline of 2040. The new law includes several stages to develop animal welfare standards, including the completion of the 'IBeST+' research project by the end of 2026, the development of a new minimum standard from 2027, and the introduction of improvements in existing stables from 2029. From mid-2034, the keeping of pigs on full-spate pens will be generally prohibited. However, around 170 farms that invested in new stables between June 2018 and December 2022 will receive an individual transition period of 16 years. Landwirtschaftsminister Norbert Totschnig praised the regulation as a 'sustainable and constitutionally compliant compromise'. However, the Greens criticized the planned amendment, saying it would be 'a mess that would be even more vulnerable to attack due to the too long transition periods' and that there would be no mention of a new statutory minimum standard from 2027. The animal welfare organization VGT described the draft as 'unbelievable', saying that the passage about all pig holdings having to comply with the new minimum standard from 1 January 2040 had been omitted. This means that all pig holdings would have to comply with the ridiculous new version of the full-spate pen without straw from 1 June 2039. The NEOS representative Christoph Pramhofer emphasized that farmers need more legal certainty to make investments. Without this, they would not be able to invest. Josef Hechenberger from the Farmers' Association assured that there would be higher standards in animal welfare in the future and that the supply of Austrian pork would continue to be guaranteed. The FPÖ, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, fearing that many pig farmers would give up. As a result, more meat would be imported from countries with lower animal welfare standards.

**Austrian Government Coalition Reaches Agreement on Pig Farming Regulations**
The Austrian government coalition has reached an agreement on new regulations for pig farming, which will gradually ban full slat floors. The corresponding bill, to be presented to parliament next week, sets an end date for the transition period in 2034, six years earlier than initially planned. This decision comes in response to a constitutional court ruling that deemed the previous regulation, set to expire in 2040, as unconstitutional. The SPÖ Niederösterreich has been advocating for a comprehensive ban on full slat floors for years. SPÖ animal welfare spokesperson Michael Bierbach expressed his satisfaction with the compromise: 'For years, we have been pushing for an end to this animal-cruel system - it was never understandable to us why ÖVP and FPÖ consistently opposed it. It seems that it took the SPÖ's participation in the federal government to finally bring movement to this important issue.' Bierbach emphasized that the new regulation is only a first step: 'It is unbearable that animal suffering has been allowed and even protected by existing framework conditions until now. The new regulation brings improvements, but our goal remains a rapid and complete ban on full slat floors.' Bierbach also highlighted the responsibility towards farmers: 'We have been demanding a package of measures and support for years, which would support agricultural businesses in the transition. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all those in agriculture who already act in the interest of animal welfare, as well as to all those who advocate for an end to this form of housing.'

**Coalition Reaches Compromise on Full-Slat Floor Ban in Pig Farming**
The coalition government has agreed on a bill to introduce a transition period for the ban on full-slat floors in pig farming. The ban was originally set to come into effect on June 1, 2025, but the Constitutional Court had previously struck down the transition period, which was set to end in 2040. The new bill shortens the transition period to 2034. According to Health and Agriculture Minister Norbert Totschnig, 'this is a sustainable and constitutionally compliant compromise.' However, the Greens have criticized the bill, calling it 'a mess.' The Farmers' Association welcomed the agreement, saying 'the development in the pig industry will continue.' The Animal Protection Association has condemned the bill, saying it 'is unbelievable' that the transition period has been shortened and that the ban on full-slat floors without straw will come into effect in 2039. 'This means that all pig farms will have to switch to the new, ridiculous version of the full-slat floor without straw by June 1, 2039.'

**Coalition Agrees on Compromise for Full-Slat Floor Ban in Pig Farming**
The coalition government has agreed on a bill to introduce a transition period for the ban on full-slat floors in pig farming. The ban was originally set to take effect on June 1, 2025, but the Constitutional Court of Austria (VfGH) struck down the transition period, which was set to end in 2040, in January 2024. The new bill sets the transition period to end in 2034. According to a joint statement from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, the bill is a 'broadly supported compromise' that will be voted on in parliament next week and take effect on June 1, 2025. The Austrian Farmers' Association welcomed the agreement, but saw it as a 'painful compromise'. The Greens, on the other hand, called it a 'mess'. 'The development in the pig farming industry will continue', said the Austrian Farmers' Association. The bill includes further stages until the ban takes effect, including the completion of the research project 'IBeST+' by the end of 2026. Landwirtschaftsminister Norbert Totschnig (ÖVP) described the regulation as a 'sustainable and constitutionally compliant compromise'. The organization 'Verein gegen Tierfabriken' (VGT) was 'baffled' by the bill, saying that the passage requiring all pig farms to meet the new minimum standard (with straw) by January 1, 2040, was removed. Without this passage, all pig farms would have to meet the new version of the full-slat floor without straw by June 1, 2039. Other animal welfare organizations also called the bill a 'scam'.

**BBC Radio 4 - Farming Today, 03/05/2025 Farming Today This Week: sandeel ruling, vets call for ban on farrowing crates, offshore wind farm, pulses**
A partial victory has been achieved in the challenge to Britain's ban on commercial fishing for sandeels in the North Sea. The EU's Permanent Court of Arbitration upheld the ban in Scottish waters, but not in English waters. Meanwhile, the British Veterinary Association and the Pig Veterinary Society have called for a ban on farrowing crates, which are used by 60% of UK sows to prevent them from rolling on and crushing their piglets. Research has also shown that a new spray can improve wheat yields by 12%, and conservation groups in Scotland are urging ministers to reject plans for an offshore windfarm that could kill tens of thousands of seabirds. Additionally, there is a drive to grow more pulses in the UK for animal feed, with research underway to find the best options for British farmers.

**Austrian Pig Farmers Face Uncertainty Due to Upcoming Ban on Full-Slat Floors**
The Austrian pig farmers are facing uncertainty due to the upcoming ban on full-slat floors, which is set to come into effect on June 1. According to Werner Habermann, CEO of the Erzeugergenossenschaften Gut Streitdorf, 80% of pig farms in Austria will be affected by the ban, which will result in severe consequences, including the possibility of a ban on animal keeping. The Landwirtschaftskammer Niederösterreich is calling for the new government to establish clear regulations for pig farming, as the current situation is 'verheerend for the domestic production', says President Johannes Schmuckenschlager (ÖVP). The ÖVP and Greens had previously agreed on a transition period until 2040, but the Verfassungsgerichtshof ruled that this was too long and not justified. The government parties have since failed to reach a new agreement. The farmers are hoping for a new government to bring about a solution, as the current lack of clear regulations is hindering investments in pig farming.

**EU plans import crackdown around animal welfare and 'hazardous' pesticides**
The European Commission has released its long-term policy for agriculture and food, known as the Vision for Agriculture and Food. The strategy aims to make farming 'more attractive, more resilient and more sustainable' by 2040. It includes a stricter alignment of production standards on imported commodities, particularly animal welfare, sustainability and pesticide use. The Commission has also scaled back its environmental agenda to focus on commercial aspects of protecting local producers and supply chains. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the strategy would make farming more competitive, while Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen emphasized the need for less bureaucracy and more support for farmers. The strategy also includes measures to reduce red tape, increase profit margins, and introduce new income streams through the bioeconomy and carbon farming. However, environmental groups have criticized the strategy for shifting away from the EU's Farm to Fork plan and prioritizing commercial interests over environmental protection.

**Oregon Considers Bill to Prohibit Octopus Farming Due to Intelligence and Ethical Concerns**
A bill is being discussed in Oregon, USA, to prohibit the farming of octopuses for human consumption due to their intelligence and ethical concerns. Amanda Fox, executive director of the Animal Rights Initiative, said, 'It's a preventive measure.' She added, 'Most people really support not expanding agriculture to other intelligent species, as we're having trouble regulating current types of agriculture.' Although octopus farming does not currently exist in Oregon, the concern among animal defenders arose when a Spanish company planned to farm octopuses in the Canary Islands. A similar situation is happening in Hawaii, where a bill is being discussed to protect this species. Courtney Neron, co-sponsor of the initiative and a Democratic representative, said, 'We're trying to stop inhumane practices before they start in Oregon and send a clear message to other regions that might consider allowing this practice.' However, some lawmakers oppose prohibiting an industry before it begins and question arguments like the intelligence of these animals. Anna Scharf, a Republican representative, pointed out that some statements about octopuses would be 'misleading' and that animal rights organizations would eventually try to ban large-scale meat farming. Others argue that prohibiting the breeding of a species without a 'clear scientific justification' could be 'counterproductive.' The bill would prohibit the breeding and commercialization of octopuses for human consumption but allow them to be kept as pets or for scientific research. The law would be added to Oregon's existing wildlife legislation, and civil penalties would apply if it is infringed. Octopuses are considered an intelligent species, as science has documented that they can play, learn, recognize people, and solve problems. They also have a complex nervous system that divides their brain cells into their tentacles, which is why they are said to have 'multiple brains.'
