**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**Elon Musk's Plan to Colonize Mars: 2026 the Key Year**
Elon Musk has revealed his plan to colonize Mars, with the first unmanned flight of the Starship spacecraft to the planet expected to take place in late 2026. The mission will transport robots called Optimus, developed by Tesla, to the Martian surface. Musk aims to send the first human missions to Mars in the second or third landing, with the goal of establishing a permanent and self-sufficient human settlement on the planet. To achieve this, SpaceX estimates that it will need between 1,000 and 2,000 launches of the Starship every 26 months, coinciding with the optimal alignment between Earth and Mars. Musk believes that there is a 50% chance that Starship will be ready for the 2026 window. If not, the company will wait until 2028 for the next opportunity. Musk has been interested in colonizing Mars since the 1990s and has invested billions of dollars in developing space technology to make humanity a multi-planetary species.

**From Earth to Mars: SpaceX Continues its Quest for the Big Dream**
Despite a series of rocket tests that ended in explosions, SpaceX is still planning to send its Starship to Mars by next year. During a presentation on May 29 on the X platform, Elon Musk emphasized that true progress is measured by how close humanity is to creating a self-sustaining civilization on the red planet. He said, 'Every new Starship launch is a step towards making life multi-planetary'. The Starship consists of two stages: the booster 'Super Heavy' and the upper stage known as 'Ship', which is 121 meters long, making it the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. The third version of the Starship is planned to be 124.4 meters long, with advanced capabilities including in-orbit refueling, a crucial step for long-distance travel. The Starship has undergone nine test flights, with the last one on May 27 reaching space but losing control and crashing into the Indian Ocean due to a fuel leak. However, Musk sees each attempt as providing a vast amount of data to improve the spacecraft, saying that the performance in the last test was better than its predecessors. According to Musk, the third version of the Starship will be ready for launch by the end of 2025. If things go as planned, the first uncrewed missions to Mars could be launched as early as 2026. This will include sending five 'Ship' uncrewed spacecraft, equipped with Tesla-developed Optimus robots. Musk commented, 'It will be thrilling to see Optimus robots walking on Mars'. The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to build a self-sustaining city on Mars, capable of supporting over a million people and surviving even if contact with Earth is lost. Hundreds of spacecraft will transport thousands of tons of cargo and people through space during each future launch window. Musk mentioned that the potential site for the city is 'Arcadia Planitia' in the northern hemisphere of Mars, due to its flat surface and potential sources of frozen water. Musk concluded his speech by saying, 'It's a monumental project. A new city on a new planet, it's a chance to reimagine civilization, and we'll do it'.

**Musk retains plan to fly Starship to Mars in 2026 despite setbacks**
Elon Musk has reaffirmed his plan to send Starship to Mars in 2026, despite recent setbacks in test flights. Musk stated that the success of this mission depends on Starship's ability to accomplish several challenging technical feats, including a post-launch refueling manoeuvre in earth orbit. He gave SpaceX a 50% chance of meeting the deadline. If not, the company will wait two years before trying again. Musk envisions launching 1,000 to 2,000 ships to Mars every two years to establish a self-sustaining human settlement. NASA plans to return humans to the moon aboard Starship in 2027, with the goal of launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Musk has previously aimed to send an uncrewed vehicle to Mars by 2018 and a crewed mission by 2024, but has since pushed back the timeline.

**WIDE ANGLE: SEEING RED**
Ten years after the release of Andy Weir's bestselling novel The Martian, Mars exploration has made significant progress, but it looks different than predicted. While the book envisioned humans landing on Mars three times by 2035, NASA's current plans are fragile. Instead, robotic missions have propelled discovery and human imagination forward. The Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance rovers have studied layered rock formations, revealing insights into Mars' past climate and environment. A planetary scientist notes that the area of Arabia Terra, where the protagonist Mark Watney must cross, has been the focus of scientific investigation, with detailed analyses of layered materials and the naming of previously unnamed craters. Despite advances, many unknowns remain, including the precise ages and atmospheric conditions of different rock types. The Mars Sample Return mission aims to address these questions by delivering unaltered fragments of Mars to Earth. The scientist argues that robotic exploration has been more effective than sending humans to the surface, and that the payoff has been staggering, with rapid technological advances in robotics, telecommunications, and materials science.

**China spacecraft aims to return with 'groundbreaking' asteroid samples**
China's Tianwen-2 probe, launched on Thursday, aims to collect samples from an asteroid near Mars and a main-belt comet, and return them to Earth in about two years. According to the China National Space Administration, the mission represents a 'significant step in China’s new journey of interplanetary exploration' and will 'yield groundbreaking discoveries and expand humanity’s knowledge of the cosmos.' Shan Zhongde, head of the CNSA, said, 'The Tianwen-2 mission will over its decade-long mission will yield groundbreaking discoveries and expand humanity’s knowledge of the cosmos.' The samples from the asteroid 2016HO3 are expected to provide clues into the formation of Earth, such as the origins of water. China has welcomed international cooperation, but any cooperation with the US hinges on removing an American law banning direct bilateral cooperation with NASA.

**Musk's Ambitious Plan to Send Starship to Mars by 2026**
Elon Musk's SpaceX aims to send the first Starship to Mars without a crew by the end of 2026. This ambitious goal is feasible due to a favorable astronomical window, but it is still dependent on overcoming several technical challenges. The success of the mission will depend on the outcome of the next Starship testing campaigns, particularly the orbital refueling operation, which is still a work in progress. If the tests are delayed, SpaceX will have to wait until at least 2028 to try again, slowing down the decade-long colonization plan. Musk has stated that Tesla will send between 1,000 and 2,000 Starships every two years, and the recent test flight of Starship provided valuable data for SpaceX. NASA will need to ensure the full reliability of each stage of the flight before the mission can proceed. As Musk often does, his vision anticipates the technical feasibility by several years, but it is not to be underestimated. The 2026 deadline is not far off, and if SpaceX succeeds in sending its first Starship to Mars that year, it will be a historic event that will change the narrative of space exploration forever. Otherwise, we will have to wait until 2028.

**NASA Faces Funding Crisis Threatening Mars Sample Return Mission**
NASA is facing a major funding crisis that could jeopardize plans to bring Martian samples to Earth. The US space agency is facing significant challenges after the Trump administration proposed a 24% budget cut for 2026, which threatens the future of the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. According to a recent report, the MSR project will be directly affected by these budget cuts, as it has been classified as significantly over budget. Official documents suggest that the administration prefers to focus on ambitious goals such as landing humans on the moon before China and sending astronauts to Mars, at the expense of some scientific missions. The project has been criticized for its high cost, currently estimated at around $11 billion, with a delayed expected completion date of 2040. However, previous reports suggested that the mission could be completed for around $8 billion and as early as 2035. This development comes as the Perseverance rover continues to collect valuable samples from the Martian surface, which were planned to be brought back to Earth for analysis using the latest scientific technologies. Experts believe that these samples may hold answers to fundamental questions about the possibility of life on the red planet. Despite the financial challenges, many scientists continue to emphasize the exceptional importance of this mission, considering that the scientific returns will be worth the investment and will pave the way for successful human missions to Mars in the future.

**Mars Sample Return now! (op-ed)**
NASA's Mars Sample Return mission has been dropped from the President's proposed budget, despite being a crucial step in exploring Mars and searching for life elsewhere. Dr. Bruce Jakosky and Dr. Scott Hubbard, both renowned Mars researchers, argue that returning samples of the Martian surface to Earth for study is essential for answering fundamental questions about the history of Mars and the potential for life to have existed there. They emphasize that having samples in labs on Earth will provide more information than can be obtained on Mars with limited scientific instrumentation. The scientists also highlight the importance of worldwide participation in shared samples, the potential for samples to be a 'gift that can keep on giving', and the risk of losing critical engineering and technological knowledge if the return of samples is delayed. They conclude that returning samples in advance of human missions will help reduce the risk in the human missions themselves and provide a compelling rationale for sending people to Mars.

**Trump Budget Calls for Stranding NASA's Mars Samples on the Red Planet**
The Trump administration has proposed cutting NASA's funding by a quarter, slashing the space agency's science budget by nearly half, and entirely eliminating the Mars Sample Return (MSR) program. The MSR program, which has been in the making for decades, aims to retrieve samples of air, rock, and soil from Mars and return them to Earth for further analysis. Experts are furious about the proposed cancellation, citing the program's importance for advancing our understanding of the Martian surface and the possibility of life beyond Earth. They argue that the program's goals cannot be achieved by human missions to Mars, which would be far more expensive and potentially compromise the integrity of the samples. The cancellation would also undermine U.S. leadership in space exploration and science, and potentially allow other nations, such as China, to seize the opportunity to pull off sample-return missions. NASA's director for the MSR program, Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, had previously acknowledged the program's growing pains, but expressed optimism about its prospects. The proposed cancellation has sparked widespread criticism from experts and advocates for space science and exploration.

**Nasa and Esa want to bring Martian rocks to Earth. Here's what will happen to the samples once they get here**
The Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, led by NASA with participation from the European Space Agency (ESA), aims to bring Martian rocks and soil to Earth in the 2030s. The samples will be analyzed using sensitive instruments on Earth, which are too big and complex to send to Mars. The scientific community is still making new discoveries with the 380kg of rock and soil from the Moon delivered by the Apollo missions over 50 years ago. To preserve the Martian samples, a sample receiving facility (SRF) will be designed and constructed, where initial analyses will take place under strict biocontainment rules. The SRF will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, but a measurement definition team is working to determine which analyses are needed within the SRF, and new technology is being designed to allow both biological containment and analysis of the minerals in Martian samples.

**NASA Considers Private Spacecraft for Mars Sample Return Mission**
NASA considers using a private spacecraft for the Mars Sample Return mission, instead of the JPL solution. The final decision on which path to take is expected by the second half of 2026. In the space race between the US and China, there won't be a declared winner until one of the two powers sets foot on Mars. However, there are several intermediate goals that either country can achieve first. One of these goals is to bring back samples from the red planet. Context The recovery of Martian soil samples is an unprecedented achievement that the US was well on its way to achieving. NASA's Perseverance robot has been collecting rock cores and depositing them in sealed tubes left on Mars for four years. Currently, there are 27 tubes with Martian air and soil waiting to be collected in a future recovery and return mission. However, there is no defined plan to do so because last year, NASA decided to halt the development of the Mars Sample Return mission in an attempt to contain its budget, which threatened to reach $11 billion, more than double the expected amount. As a result, China surpassed the US in the race to recover Martian samples. The Chinese mission Tianwen-3 consists of two spacecraft, with a launch scheduled for 2028. One will land on Mars, drill into the soil, and return to orbit. The other will collect the samples in orbit and bring them back to Earth by 2031, according to Dr. Elin, 'It was a great day.'

**NASA's New Strategy for Bringing Martian Samples Back to Earth**
The NASA has announced a strategic shift in its ambitious Mars Sample Return program, designed to bring back rock and sediment samples collected by the Perseverance rover from Mars. To maximize the chances of success and optimize time and costs, the US space agency has opted for a two-path approach. This decision highlights NASA's commitment to ensuring the success of this critical scientific mission, encouraging competition and innovation among industrial partners to select the most effective and reliable solution. 'Following two possible paths will allow NASA to bring back these samples from Mars with a significant cost and time savings compared to the previous plan,' said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. 'These samples have the potential to change the way we understand Mars, our universe, and ultimately ourselves.'

**NASA's Perseverance Rover Collects First Samples of Martian Soil and Rocks**
NASA's Perseverance Rover has collected the first 28 samples of Martian soil, rocks, and dust, which may hold clues to the planet's past and potentially even signs of life. The samples are being stored on Mars and will be returned to Earth in the mid-to-late 2030s. Libby Hausrath, a geochemist and member of the NASA Mars Sample Return team, said, 'These samples will help us learn more about Mars, but they may also teach us more about Earth, because the surface of Mars is much older than the surface of Earth.' The rover's instruments allow scientists to analyze the samples remotely, and the team is excited to study the samples in detail when they return to Earth. The mission aims to determine if Mars ever had life, understand the planet's climate and geological history, and prepare for future human exploration. 'If there was life on Mars in the past, we might be able to see signs of it in these samples,' said Hausrath. The rover's findings have already provided strong indicators that water flowed freely on Mars about 2 billion years ago. The team is eager to collaborate with the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin rover, which will launch in 2028 and will be able to drill deeper into the Martian surface than Perseverance.

**Mars Mission Plans: NASA, ESA, and SpaceX**
NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) are working on missions to send humans to Mars. Chris Carberry, director of Explore Mars, suggests that establishing a lunar base is a necessary step before sending humans to Mars. 'We need to learn to live on a lunar base before creating a Martian base,' he says. Chris McKay, a NASA geophysicist, believes that a direct mission to Mars is possible, but it would need to be short-term. The ESA is planning to develop a 'remorqueur' (tugboat) spacecraft, called LightShip, which would transport people and cargo between Earth and Mars at a low cost. The spacecraft would use electric propulsion, which is less expensive than traditional chemical propulsion. A mission to Mars would also need to protect astronauts from radiation, which is 700 times stronger on Mars than on Earth. Some scientists suggest that terraforming Mars could be necessary to make it habitable for humans. This would involve releasing greenhouse gases to warm the planet and using genetically modified plants to produce oxygen. The NASA's Perseverance rover has been collecting samples on Mars, which will be returned to Earth on a European spacecraft called ERO in 2027. SpaceX's Starship, developed by Elon Musk, has been tested and is expected to be used for missions to Mars. However, it may not be able to transport enough material for a human mission, and several preparatory flights would be needed. 'We could imagine the same scenario for Mars,' says Chris Carberry. 'The version of Starship that would go to Mars would be larger, of second or third generation.'

**NASA's Mars rover collects rock sample 'unlike anything we've seen before'**
NASA's Perseverance rover has collected a rock sample from Mars known as 'Silver Mountain', which is 'unlike anything we've seen before' according to the space agency. The sample is abundant in low-calcium pyroxene (LCP) and is a one-of-a-kind treasure. NASA has sealed the rock core in a sample tube that will be transported to Earth for analysis at a later date. This sample collection marks an important milestone in the mission to uncover the geological history of Jezero Crater. The rover has now returned to full-time exploration after completing a 1,640-feet climb up the side of the crater, which it has been exploring since its landing four years ago. NASA is currently considering the best way to carry out its Mars Sample Return mission, which will attempt to bring to Earth all of the material gathered by Perseverance during its Mars mission.
