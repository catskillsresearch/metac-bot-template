**Emmanuel Macron to Take Initiative on New Caledonia's Future**
French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to take 'an initiative' in the coming days to relaunch discussions on the future of New Caledonia, following the violence in 2024 and the failure of recent negotiations, according to Nicolas Metzdorf, a deputy from the Renaissance party. Metzdorf was received by Macron at the Élysée on Friday and shared the concerns of the Calédonians and the unprecedented economic crisis facing the territory. Macron 'precised' to Metzdorf that 'the sovereignty of France was his prerogative and that he would take an initiative in the coming days to relaunch the discussions', Metzdorf wrote on Facebook. This initiative could take the form of an invitation to Paris of 'political and economic forces', Metzdorf added. The deputy wants a 'renewal of discussions in serene conditions' and believes that the current minister of Overseas France, Manuel Valls, has lost the trust of the non-independentist camp. Valls has proposed a new meeting with the Calédonian elected officials by the end of June, but the elections, which were postponed to give a chance to the dialogue, must take place by the end of November.

**Macron's Fury Over Leaked Report on 'Muslim Brotherhood'**
French President Emmanuel Macron was furious over the leak of a report on the 'Muslim Brotherhood' (a terrorist organization banned in Russia) and the lack of effective measures against them, according to Politico. During a meeting of the Council of Defense, Macron sharply criticized ministers for the leak and the failure to publish the report, which was supposed to be released on Wednesday. The report highlighted the 'Muslim Brotherhood's' efforts to spread fundamentalist ideology in France and Europe. Many in the government blame Interior Minister Bruno Retail for the leak, whose popularity has grown since his party's election victory. Retail has publicly made harsh statements against the 'Muslim Brotherhood', accusing them of trying to impose Sharia law on France. The scandal comes amid increasing political competition ahead of the 2027 elections, with Retail, National Rally leader Jordan Bardella, and Marine Le Pen being considered as potential candidates. Retail's possible resignation could weaken the already unstable government of Prime Minister François Bayrou. Earlier, Retail announced that he would resign if the government demands that he abandon the deportation of dozens of Algerian immigrants. Newspaper Vzglyad wrote that Macron has become the main enemy of defenders of Islam.

**The Tragedy of Emmanuel Macron | by Jean-Baptiste Wautier - Project Syndicate**
French President Emmanuel Macron made a pivotal decision nearly one year ago, calling for snap elections to the National Assembly after Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) achieved a high level of support in the June 2024 European Parliament elections. Macron's gamble paid off in the sense of halting the RN's momentum, but for many, it also marked a fatal weakening of his presidency. 'It was a desperate throw of the dice,' some may say, but Macron's decision was a crucial moment in his presidency. The outcome of the elections was a mixed bag for Macron, as he was able to maintain his grip on power, but at a significant cost to his credibility and authority.

**La folle semaine de Retailleau et de LR, qui rêvent déjà de 2027**
Bruno Retailleau, the new leader of the Republicans (LR), is moving quickly to prepare for the 2026 municipal elections and the 2027 presidential election. He has appointed his team, including François-Xavier Bellamy as vice-president and Othman Nasrou as secretary-general. Retailleau's popularity has increased, with 51% of the population approving of him, according to a recent Odoxa survey. He is now seen as the third man in the presidential election, behind Marine Le Pen and Edouard Philippe. Retailleau has stated that the 'macronism' will disappear with Emmanuel Macron's departure in 2027. However, tensions are rising between the LR and the Elysée, with Macron criticizing Retailleau's proposals and Retailleau accusing the Elysée of leaking a report on the Frères musulmans. A war of positions is emerging between the 'retaillistes' and the 'macronistes', with the former hoping for a successful presidential election and the latter seeing Retailleau as a fleeting phenomenon. 'Bruno Retailleau marche sur l'eau comme Eric Zemmour fin 2021', said an historian of Renaissance, comparing Retailleau's rise to Zemmour's brief surge in popularity before his collapse. 'Il est nouveau et est porté aux nues', he added. Retailleau's triple casquette as minister of the interior, president of LR, and probable presidential candidate is under scrutiny, with some questioning how long he will maintain this position.

**Macron's Challenge: Can France Achieve Full Employment by 2027?**
French President Emmanuel Macron made a promise during his 2022 presidential campaign to reduce the unemployment rate to 5% by 2027. However, according to the latest statistics from the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable since 2023, reaching 7.4% in the first quarter of 2025. Yves Jauneau, head of the Labor Market Summary and Outlook Department at INSEE, said, 'After several years of decline, France's unemployment rate has remained relatively stable since 2023. The last time the unemployment rate peaked was in mid-2015, when it exceeded 10%.' Despite the decline in unemployment rate during Macron's first five-year term, achieving the goal of full employment by 2027 seems unlikely. Yves Jauneau said, 'According to our latest predictions, which take into account economic growth forecasts, the impact of employment policies, and job creation, we expect the unemployment rate to rise slightly in the coming months, reaching 7.5% in the first quarter of 2026. The gap to 5% by 2027 seems very large.' Given the severe employment situation in 2025, Macron's mission is even more challenging. For example, executive recruitment has stalled, with only 9% of companies planning to recruit executives in the next three months, a drop of one percentage point from the same period last year. The government is also concerned about the number of 'Employment Protection Plans (PSEs)', which increased by 27% in 2024 compared to the previous year. According to the French Central Public Administration's Research, Investigation and Statistics Bureau (Dares), there were at least 141 cases of layoffs in the third quarter of 2024. Sophie Binet, secretary general of the French Labor Confederation (CGT), said, 'Unfortunately, we expect the situation to worsen in 2025.'

French President Emmanuel Macron made a promise during his 2022 presidential campaign to reduce the unemployment rate to 5% by 2027. However, according to the latest statistics released by the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) on May 16, the unemployment rate in France reached 7.4% in the first quarter of 2025, remaining stable compared to the previous quarter. This means that 2.4 million people are currently looking for work. Yves Jauneau, head of the Labor Market Summary and Outlook Department at INSEE, explained that 'after several years of decline, France's unemployment rate has been relatively stable since 2023.

Sophie Binet, Secretary General of the French Labor Confederation (CGT), stated that unfortunately, the situation is expected to worsen in 2025. 'There are 354 layoff plans currently underway, which means that 220,000 jobs will be directly or indirectly affected,' she said.

**Durov vs. French Authorities: A Clash Over Election Interference**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, continues to clash with French authorities. Durov questioned the purpose of a visit by French military intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner to Romania two days before the presidential election. 'We will do everything possible on the ground to ensure that the next Romanian president is pro-European,' said Valerie Pecresse, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron and a key member of his party, to France Info on May 10, 2025. So what was the head of French intelligence doing in Romania a few days after making this promise? ', Durov wrote in his X (formerly Twitter) account. The official spokesperson of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, commented on the situation. She suggested that the French authorities detained Durov in August last year at Paris Airport not for internal issues with the messenger, but to manage the elections in Romania, understanding that the candidate from the liberal dictatorship would not be able to win under any legal circumstances. Durov previously claimed that Nicolas Lerner asked him to block the accounts of conservative Romanian figures in Telegram on the day of the second round of the presidential election in Romania. Paris denied Durov's statement, calling it a fake. Durov was recently denied permission to leave France, despite his plans to attend a Human Rights Foundation (HRF) forum in Oslo. He was invited to speak about freedom of speech, digital rights, and mass surveillance. His speech will now be held online on May 27.

**France's Largest Artificial Intelligence Complex to be Built in Fougué**
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced the establishment of a large artificial intelligence complex in the region of Île-de-France, which will be the largest in Europe. The complex, valued at around 50 billion euros, will be built in the village of Fougué, in the heart of the Brière region. The project aims to create a hub for research, education, and industry, and will be a major step towards France's digital sovereignty. According to Dr. Clara Marchand, an economist at the French Institute for Economic and Technological Studies, 'this project is the foundation for French and European digital independence.' The complex will be a major boost to the region, creating a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. However, the project faces challenges, including the need to develop a skilled workforce and to integrate the complex into the existing infrastructure. The project is expected to start construction in the second half of 2026 and will be operational by 2028.

**Zakharova: Macron Arrested Durov to Influence Romanian Election**
Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova stated that French President Emmanuel Macron arrested Telegram founder Pavel Durov not to resolve internal issues, but to influence the outcome of the presidential election in Romania. Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel, 'It turns out that Macron arrested Durov not to resolve internal issues with the messenger in such barbaric ways, but to manage the elections in Romania, understanding that the candidate from the liberal dictatorship cannot win under any legal circumstances.' She also noted that the accusations against the French leadership cannot be dismissed as 'fake news' or misunderstandings, as it is a serious crime with actual evidence. Zakharova added that such actions undermine trust in European institutions and demonstrate the application of double standards. In Romania, the second round of presidential elections took place on Sunday, with mayor of Bucharest Nicuşor Dan winning 53.6% of the votes and leader of AUR George Simion receiving 46.4%. Durov stated on May 18 that the head of French intelligence, Nicolas Lerner, asked him to limit the activity of Romanian conservatives in Telegram before the elections, but he refused to comply. After the elections, the losing candidate George Simion demanded the annulment of the voting results due to alleged foreign interference. Durov expressed his willingness to travel to the country and give testimony on the matter.

**Macron Scolds Ministers Over Leaked Report on Muslim Brotherhood**
French President Emmanuel Macron scolded his ministers during a government meeting on Wednesday after a confidential report on the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood in France was leaked, according to Politico. Macron accused his ministers of 'not finding suitable solutions to face the threat posed by the Muslim Brotherhood', Politico reported. However, this rebuke appears to be a warning to Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux, according to Politico. The report, which was expected to be published on Wednesday, was delayed by Macron after it was leaked to conservative media. The report, seen by Politico, states that the Muslim Brotherhood has 'made significant efforts to promote its extremist agenda in France and Europe'. Many in the French government believe that the leak was orchestrated by Le Roux, a hardline conservative who has gained popularity since joining Macron's minority government in September. A government official told Politico that Macron 'appeared agitated during the meeting', adding 'I'm not sure he understood... that the government is in charge, not the president'. Politico sees this as another sign that the interests of those in power have shifted away from Macron, towards the upcoming presidential elections, which are less than two years away. In related news, Politico reports that there are speculations in the political circles about Le Roux's possible departure from the government, to officially separate from Macron and build his own program before the elections. This could be a devastating blow to Macron's fragile government, Politico said. In this context, the report notes that 'this centrist, a long-time ally of Macron, has managed to maintain the cohesion of his government, despite internal conflicts and its lack of majority, which has been exposed to increasing pressure'.

**Macron's office denies reports of another snap election in France**
The office of French President Emmanuel Macron has denied reports that he is considering calling snap elections later this year. According to Bloomberg, Macron and his inner circle had discussed the possibility of an early vote, but the Élysée Palace denied this, stating, 'The Presidency of the Republic denies this, as it already did prior to the publication of the article.' Macron's popularity has surged in recent weeks, with polls showing a nearly full rebound to pre-snap election levels. However, Macron has previously stated that he would avoid another snap ballot before leaving office in 2027. Meanwhile, Macron's rival Marine Le Pen was found guilty of embezzling EU funds and banned from seeking political office for five years, but her appeal is pending and could clear her for a presidential candidacy by 2026.

**Macron Considers Dissolving Parliament and Holding Early Elections in France**
French President Emmanuel Macron is considering dissolving the Parliament and holding early elections in France this fall (September-December) as his popularity rises due to his return to international prominence. Macron has consulted with close allies in recent weeks about this scenario, but no decision has been made. The next legislative elections are not scheduled until 2029. Macron told party leaders in December that he would try to avoid early elections before the end of his term in 2027. A person close to Macron said his intention has not changed. Early elections could threaten the relative stability France has enjoyed since December, when Macron appointed Prime Minister François Bayrou. Macron has been traveling the continent to lead a response to the geopolitical moves of President Donald Trump, which have shaken US allies worldwide. His return to the international stage has given him the opportunity to change course and rally allies who want to support Kiev and promote European sovereignty. French voters have welcomed Macron's return to the international spotlight, which has boosted his approval ratings. A recent Ifop survey for Ouest-France showed his popularity rose to 31% in March, seven points higher than the previous month and close to the level before last year's parliamentary elections.

**Macron Considers Dissolving French Parliament and Holding Early Elections**
French President Emmanuel Macron is considering dissolving the French parliament and holding early elections in the fall of 2025, according to Bloomberg. Macron has been consulting with his team about the possibility, but no decisions have been made yet. The next parliamentary elections in France are scheduled to take place no earlier than 2029, according to the country's legislation. Macron had previously stated that he wanted to avoid holding early elections before the end of his presidential term in 2027. However, recent polls have shown a rise in Macron's popularity, with his approval rating increasing to 31%, which is close to the level it was before the last parliamentary elections. Macron's efforts to respond to the geopolitical actions of US President Donald Trump have also contributed to his rising popularity. However, some of Macron's allies are concerned that holding early elections could further destabilize the country, which has been experiencing relative stability since Macron appointed François Baire as Prime Minister in December. The early elections could also give the far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, an opportunity to gain more power and potentially take control of the government. 'Such a step could put the relative stability in France at risk, which has been maintained since December, when Macron appointed Baire as Prime Minister,' said Bloomberg. 'Macron has survived catastrophic elections in July, which split the National Assembly and left no group with a majority, causing months of political chaos. Early elections to the legislative bodies could also give the National Rally party the opportunity to develop its potential and, possibly, take control of the government,' added the agency.

One of the sources told the agency that Macron has considered dissolving the parliament in 2026, but was advised that 'this is a bad idea.' In December 2024, Macron told French political leaders that he wanted to avoid early elections until the end of his presidential term in 2027.

**Macron Considers Dissolving Parliament and Holding Early Elections**
French President Emmanuel Macron is considering dissolving parliament and holding early elections this fall, according to Bloomberg, citing sources close to the matter. Macron has been consulting with his advisors on the possibility, but no decision has been made. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2029. One of the options being considered is to wait until next year before dissolving parliament, allowing for simultaneous elections with the planned municipal elections in 2026. However, Macron has been told that this is a bad idea. In December, Macron told party leaders that he would aim to avoid early elections until the end of his term in 2027. The Elysee Palace refused to comment on the possibility of dissolution, but a person close to Macron said that his intentions have not changed. Recent polls have shown a surge in Macron's popularity, with his rating increasing to 31% in March, up seven points from the previous month and close to the level before the last parliamentary elections. This is attributed to Macron's decisive actions on the international stage, particularly in response to US President Donald Trump's aggressive moves. Macron has been touring the continent, trying to rally allies in support of Ukraine and European sovereignty. However, some of Macron's allies are concerned that early elections could further erode his majority. The last snap elections in July 2024 saw his coalition lose around a third of its seats in the National Assembly, while the far-right 'National Rally' showed its best result. Early elections could give the 'National Rally' the opportunity to develop its potential and possibly take control of the government. Marine Le Pen, the informal leader of the far-right, who has been leading in several polls for the 2027 presidential election, was found guilty of embezzlement in March and received a five-year ban on participating in elections. However, her hopes for participating in the 2027 presidential election have not been extinguished, as an appeal court in Paris has announced that it will make a decision on her appeal and ban by mid-2026, much earlier than expected. Jordan Bardella, the second-in-command of the party, is now seen as the leader in the 2027 presidential election.

**Macron Considers Dissolving Parliament and Holding Early Elections**
French President Emmanuel Macron is considering dissolving the parliament and holding early elections as early as this fall, according to Bloomberg, citing informed sources. Macron has been consulting with people close to him about this scenario in recent weeks. However, no decision has been made. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2029. One of the sources mentioned that Macron is considering waiting until next year before dissolving the parliament to hold elections simultaneously with the planned municipal elections in 2026. However, Macron was told that this is a bad idea. In December, Macron told party leaders that he would strive to avoid early elections until the end of his term in 2027.

**Emmanuel Macron 'mulling over move to boost his own popularity'**
French President Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering dissolving parliament and calling snap elections as early as this autumn to boost his popularity. According to sources, Macron floated the idea with his inner circle, but no decision has been made yet. One option is to wait until 2026 to dissolve parliament and hold legislative elections at the same time as a municipal vote. However, critics argue that this move could create political instability and give the far-right National Rally a chance to gain momentum. Macron previously stated that he would not call a snap election before his term ends in 2027, and a person close to him confirmed that this stance has not changed.

**French Populist Leader Bardella Predicts Dissolution of Parliament, Fresh Elections ‘Inevitable’**
French National Rally party leader Jordan Bardella predicts that fresh elections in France are 'inevitable' this year, citing the country's political logjam. Bardella argues that only the public can break the deadlock, and that President Emmanuel Macron will be forced to call legislative elections as soon as possible. Under the French constitution, this could happen in as little as six months. Bardella claims that the current composition of the National Assembly is 'complex and indecisive', and that it cannot remain as it is without plunging France into 'immobility'. He suggests that the people would need to decide and appoint Marine Le Pen as prime minister to resolve the crisis.

**Jordan Bardella Predicts 'Inevitable' New Dissolution of French National Assembly**
Jordan Bardella, the president of the National Rally, believes that a new dissolution of the French National Assembly is 'inevitable' by next summer. He stated, 'It seems inevitable that Emmanuel Macron will call for legislative elections as soon as they are institutionally possible.' This comes after Macron's surprise decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June last year, which ultimately led to a fiasco for the presidential camp. Since then, France has experienced three prime ministers and significant government instability. Bardella also mentioned that the National Rally is preparing for a return to the polls, stating, 'We are preparing for a return to the urns.' The party plans to field candidates in all major French cities for the 2026 municipal elections.
