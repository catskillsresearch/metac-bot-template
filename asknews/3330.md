**Faster CPR Saves Lives: Delay Beyond 4 Minutes Reduces Survival in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest, Study Finds**
A recent study published in the Resuscitation Journal found that the time it takes to begin dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) significantly affects survival outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The study, led by Dr. Haruka Takahashi, analyzed data from 3,861 adult patients who experienced witnessed, non-traumatic OHCA and received DA-CPR. The researchers found that delays in starting CPR, particularly beyond 4 minutes, reduce the chances of survival with favorable neurological outcomes at 30 days. The study emphasizes the importance of rapid intervention during medical emergencies and calls for emergency services to prioritize faster response mechanisms to ensure bystanders can act swiftly under dispatcher guidance. As Dr. Takahashi and her team noted, 'These findings highlight the urgent need to streamline dispatcher response systems and reduce the time it takes to initiate CPR instructions over the phone.'

**5-Year-Old Boy Successfully Resuscitated at Linzer Parkbad**
A 5-year-old boy was successfully resuscitated at the Linzer Parkbad after being submerged in the water for approximately 2 minutes. A 37-year-old woman noticed the accident and pulled the boy out of the water. Other bathers, led by a 41-year-old man, began CPR, and after a 1-minute resuscitation, the boy regained consciousness and started breathing on his own. He was taken to the children's hospital for further treatment. His parents, who were nearby with five other children and an adult, had lost sight of the situation due to the crowded pool area and initially did not notice the accident.

**25 Years of Saving Lives: The SAMU in Asturias Celebrates a Quarter Century**
The Servicio de Asistencia Médica Urgente (SAMU) in Asturias is celebrating its 25th anniversary. With 216 professionals, including doctors and nurses, the SAMU has been saving lives for a quarter of a century. According to Dr. Marta Martínez del Valle, a 62-year-old veteran of the SAMU, 'it's a very beautiful job' that requires 'intervening in situations of gravity and in hostile environments.' The SAMU has managed 351,702 incidents in 2024, including the recent accident in a livestock farm in Coaña. Rosa Martín, a 38-year-old nurse, has been working with the SAMU since 2022 and emphasizes the importance of forming people in emergency techniques, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 'We make every effort to save lives,' she says. 'It's a job that puts your feet on the ground and makes you see the fragility of life,' adds Dr. Martínez del Valle, who has dedicated over a third of her life to the SAMU.

**Postoperative Nivolumab Plus SOC Extends DFS in Resected, High-Risk Head and Neck Cancer**
The addition of adjuvant nivolumab (Opdivo) to standard of care (SOC) cisplatin and radiotherapy significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with resected, high-risk head and neck cancer, according to data from the phase 3 NIVOPOSTOP trial. The 3-year DFS rate was 63.1% in the nivolumab arm and 52.5% in the SOC arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.76. The cumulative incidence of loco-regional relapse at 1 year was 11% vs 16%, at 2 years it was 12% vs 19%, and at 3 years it was 13% vs 20% between the nivolumab and SOC arms, respectively. 'Post-operative nivolumab added to SOC cisplatin-[radiotherapy] improved patient outcomes for resected high-risk LA-SCCHN, that could be proposed as a new standard treatment,' said Jean Bourhis, MD, PhD. The trial enrolled 680 patients and showed that nivolumab did not compromise compliance with SOC cisplatin. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects were stomatitis, radiation skin injury, dysphagia, nausea, and dry mouth. Grade 3/4 TRAEs included stomatitis, dysphagia, neutropenia, renal disorder, and radiation skin injury. The median patient age was 59 in both arms, and 75% and 77% of patients were male. The trial showed that nivolumab improved DFS in patients with resected, high-risk head and neck cancer.

**US Man's 45-Minute Near-Death Experience: 'Watching a Movie' of His Own Death**
A 45-minute near-death experience was shared on TikTok by a US man who had a severe allergic reaction to a toxic substance and lost his pulse and breathing. He was pronounced dead and placed in a body bag, but miraculously revived. The man described the experience as 'watching a movie' where he saw himself being placed in a body bag and taken away, but felt detached from his body. He said he saw a light and heard someone say he wasn't dead yet, and was resuscitated. The medical team determined that his heart and breathing had stopped for 45 minutes. The man's account has gone viral on TikTok, with many users calling it a 'soul out of the body' experience and praising it as 'fascinating' and 'enjoyable'.

**HUCA Pioneers Innovative Lung Cancer Treatment with Microwave Ablation**
The Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA) has made a 'giant step' in the treatment of lung cancer and other respiratory tumors by successfully using a new procedure called ablación bronquial mediante microondas. This technique uses heat from microwaves to destroy the tumor, extracts it using cold, and restores air flow in the lung in just a few minutes. Two patients, aged 65 and 77, with obstructed bronchi, were treated with this innovative method and were able to leave the hospital in 24 hours without needing oxygen and continue with complementary oncological treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. The technique is quick and minimally invasive, using a microwave antenna to heat the tumor to 80 degrees Celsius, without damaging healthy tissue, and extracting it with a cryosonde. According to Dr. Miguel Ariza, a pulmonologist at HUCA, 'If they can tolerate general anesthesia, they are eligible.' The technique can be used in 90% of patients with lung cancer or other bronchial pathologies, which are often diagnosed in advanced stages that make breathing difficult. Dr. Ariza explained that 'the improvement is immediate' and that the technique is 'safe, effective, with promising results, rapid recovery, and improved quality of life and survival for the patient.'

**Notfallmediziner advocates for mandatory Ersthelfer-Apps to save lives in cardiac arrests**
Notfallmediziner Clemens Kill believes that Ersthelfer-Apps should be made compulsory for alerting bystanders to cardiac arrests. These apps would summon qualified volunteers in the vicinity to perform reanimation via smartphone. According to Kill, 'We must do everything to improve the qualified first aid for cardiac arrests.' The German Resuscitation Council reports that 120,000 people suffer cardiac arrests annually, with only one in ten surviving. The average response time for emergency services is nine minutes. Kill notes that 'Ersthelfer-Apps offer a good chance of having someone at the scene within three to four minutes who knows what to do and can bridge the time until the emergency services arrive.' He emphasizes that 'in most emergencies, it's not about five or ten minutes, but in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, every second counts.'

**The Evolution of Resuscitation Methods: From Tabacco Enemas to Modern Techniques**
The author was surprised to learn that 100 years ago, there was no modern method of providing first aid, and even 20 years ago, resuscitation was a strange ritual. Until the 20th century, resuscitation was understood as stimulating the body to mechanical action. Humanitarian communities often recommended warming the drowning person and attempting to perform artificial respiration. The most important thing was to make the body-machine work again. External stimulation - rubbing and massage. Internal stimulation usually consisted of introducing rum or some stimulating potion into the stomach. One of the most unusual methods was 'smoking tobacco smoke' into the rectum of the drowning person, which was also recommended by humanitarian communities. The English phrase 'blowing smoke up your arse' (blowing smoke into someone's anus) is a polite way of saying that one person is praising another, not very sincerely. This phrase is not just a coincidence. In the late 1700s, doctors literally filled the anus of their patients with smoke. This was a widely used medical procedure in standard resuscitation. Mostly for drowning victims. Although artificial respiration was first used in ancient Sumeria or ancient Egypt, by the 18th century, there were not very high hopes for such ventilation of the lungs. Humanity wanted progress. New incredible breakthroughs and achievements. Therefore, the idea of pulling a corpse out of the Thames and smoking it in the anus seemed very interesting. In London, the equipment needed for this procedure was widely available on the riverbanks (it was kindly provided by the Royal Humane Society). People who often rested near the water were required to know where the equipment was located and how to use it. For this, masterclasses were conducted with the participation of local residents, who were summoned by brave London police officers. The smoke was inhaled into the anus using a special tube connected to a fumigator and a syringe, which, when compressed, released smoke into the rectum. Sometimes, to get the smoke into the lungs faster, it was inhaled through the nose and mouth of the patient, but most doctors found the rectal method more elegant and effective. They believed that nicotine contained in tobacco made the heart beat stronger and faster, thus stimulating breathing. Also, doctors thought that smoke warmed the patient and dried out his internal organs, removing excess moisture. The practice of using 'tobacco enemas' for rescuing drowning people quickly became a popular method of treating many other diseases, including headaches, hernias, respiratory diseases, and stomach cramps. Tobacco enemas were even used to treat typhoid and cholera when patients were on the last stage of the disease. From the mid-19th century, the method of resuscitation using the lifting and spreading apart of the patient's hands became popular. Only in the 1940s in the US, research was conducted, showing zero effectiveness of this method. Modern application of the 'mouth-to-mouth' method of artificial respiration began only in the 1950s, during the polio epidemic in the US. Chest massage: In 1880, Neumann first performed direct chest massage on a human. In 1901, Igelsrud successfully performed resuscitation using indirect chest massage. In 1960, Jad, Koewendhoven, and Nikerboker again clinically justified the effectiveness of indirect chest massage. All this served as the basis for creating a clear scheme of resuscitation manipulations. The most clear scheme of resuscitation procedures was proposed by American anesthesiologist and resuscitologist Safar in 1966. This scheme entered the literature under the name 'Safar's alphabet'. The main principles introduced by him are still in effect today. Only the ratio of compressions on the chest and breaths has changed. In the early 21st century, it was 35:2. In recent years, it was 30:2, and according to the latest research, artificial respiration is not recommended as oxygenation is sufficient. In 1913, Professor F. A. Andreev published an article 'Experiments on restoring the activity of the heart, breathing, and nervous system function'. But it took 40 years to follow these methods. The author thought - what methods of assistance are now considered absolute heresy, but will become absolutely traditional in 40 years - in 2065.

**Cryopreservation: A $80,000 USD Gamble for a Second Chance**
Alcor, a US-based non-profit organization, is offering Quebecers the chance to cryopreserve their heads for $80,000 USD and their bodies for $220,000 USD, plus annual fees. Jeremy Wiggins, president of Alcor Canada, explains that the cost is often covered by life insurance policies. 'We have teams that deploy to the bedside of the person,' he adds. Alcor, founded in 1972, cryopreserves human bodies in liquid nitrogen in the hope of reviving them one day. Wiggins notes that some elderly people move to the US, just 10 minutes away from Alcor's offices, to be cryopreserved quickly after death. 'We want to have Quebecers and Canadians among our members,' he says, seeking donors to support his research. However, the cost of cryopreservation is not for everyone. 'There are annual fees based on age. The earlier you sign up, the cheaper it is,' Wiggins explains. Annual membership fees range from $60 USD per year for children to $200 USD per year for adults.

**Cryopreservation: A Second Chance at Life or a Futile Quest?**
The concept of cryopreservation, or freezing a body at -196 degrees Celsius, has sparked debate and curiosity. According to Ramón Risco, a scientist at the University of Sevilla, it is biologically possible to revive a cryopreserved body. However, there are significant ethical concerns. Currently, over 2,000 bodies are cryopreserved worldwide, with some individuals, like a 14-year-old British girl, leaving behind a letter requesting a second chance at life. The process involves cooling the body to -196 degrees Celsius, replacing blood with cryoprotectants, and storing it in a cryogenic tank. While some scientists, like Ramón Risco, believe it is only a matter of time before cryopreservation becomes a reality, others raise questions about the feasibility and ethics of reviving a person after centuries. The cost of cryopreservation is estimated to be around 200,000 euros, and there have been no successful revivals of cryopreserved bodies to date.

**Klaus Sames: The Man Who Wants to Cheat Death**
Klaus Sames, a 86-year-old former professor of gerontology, has decided to be cryopreserved after his death. He hopes to be revived and rejuvenated in the future when medical technology advances. Sames has signed a contract with the Cryonics Institute in the USA, which will preserve his body at a temperature of -196°C. He believes that the cryopreservation of his body is a scientific and rational approach to death, rather than a religious one. However, experts such as Julia Neubauer, a cryotechnologist, and Stefanie Förderreuther, a neurologist, have expressed skepticism about the possibility of reviving a person who has been cryopreserved for a long time. They point out that the process of cryopreservation is still in its infancy and that there are many challenges to overcome before it is possible to revive a person who has been cryopreserved for a long time. Sames has written a book on the topic of cryopreservation and has become a prominent figure in the cryonics community. He believes that the cryopreservation of his body is a way to cheat death and to live forever. However, his views are not shared by everyone, and the debate about the possibility of reviving a person who has been cryopreserved for a long time continues.

**Woman killed and another in 'critical condition' after nitrogen poisoning during cryotherapy at Paris gym**
A 29-year-old woman was killed and a 34-year-old client is in critical condition after nitrogen poisoning during a cryotherapy session at a Paris gym. The two women collapsed after nitrogen displaced oxygen in the ultra-cold chamber, causing cardiorespiratory arrest. Despite paramedics' efforts, the staffer was pronounced dead at the scene, while the customer was taken to intensive care. The gym has been closed indefinitely, and French prosecutors have ordered an autopsy and toxicological analyses of the victims. Cryotherapy has been labeled a controversial treatment due to mixed scientific evidence regarding its effectiveness and potential risks, including oxygen depletion and asphyxiation. 'The body is exposed to temperatures as low as -140C (-220F) using liquid nitrogen and other substances,' according to the article. 'Liquid nitrogen, which is used to cool the chambers, can displace oxygen in the air if ventilation is inadequate,' the European Industrial Gases Association warned in 2018. 'Research into the benefits of cryotherapy is 'still in its infancy', the Mayo Clinic says.

**Cryopreservation: The Quest for Immortality**
Scientists are working on a way to bring people back to life through a process called cryopreservation. This involves freezing a body in a tank filled with liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees Celsius, with the goal of reviving it in the future. Several companies around the world are working on this technology, including the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona, USA. According to the article, there are currently 200 people who have undergone cryopreservation, including a 14-year-old British girl who died of cancer in 2015 and had her body cryopreserved. Ramón Risco, a scientist at the University of Seville, has successfully revived a microscopical worm that had been cryopreserved and believes that this technology could be applied to humans in the future. However, the article also raises concerns about the ethics of cryopreservation and the potential consequences of reviving a person after a long period of time. 'It's only a matter of time' before this technology becomes a reality, says Risco, but 'we need to control how the cooling and mass transfer process is carried out to avoid the formation of ice, which is our greatest enemy when it comes to cryopreserving a body.'

**The hidden flaw in cryonics that could ruin your shot at living forever | BBC Science Focus Magazine**
Cryonics, the process of freezing and storing human remains for potential revival in the future, has gained renewed interest. However, experts warn that the process is still plagued by significant hurdles, including irreversible cellular damage, especially to the brain, caused by freezing. The human body is a complex system sustained by delicate biochemical processes, and freezing can cause irreparable harm. Even with advanced technology, reviving a frozen body is not like 'flicking a switch' but rather like trying to unscramble an egg. The brain, in particular, is vulnerable to damage due to its intricate structure and high metabolic demands. Additionally, rebuilding neuronal connections and memories is a daunting task, akin to rewriting a burned book from ashes. Cryonics relies heavily on optimism, but experts caution that people should think twice before risking their lives on a very unlikely outcome. As one expert notes, 'it's a process with many significant hurdles to overcome before it could be said to 'work', in any meaningful way.'

**Brit frozen in liquid nitrogen chamber for chance of reawakening in far future - The Mirror**
A British man, known as 'Patient 268', has been cryogenically frozen in a liquid nitrogen container in the US as part of an advanced programme by the Cryonics Institute (CI). He was transported from the UK to the US after signing up with the CI, a medical organisation based in Michigan. The process, carried out by Cryonics UK, involved cooling the body to a temperature of -196C using liquid nitrogen. The CI's spokesperson said, 'The patient was then transferred to the computer-controlled cooling chamber to cool to liquid nitrogen temperature. The human dry ice program was selected and the time needed to cool the patient to liquid nitrogen temperature was 25 hours.' The CI's facilities are the largest in the world, with over 250 patients across two sites, and offer various programmes for cryopreservation, including a 'lifetime' membership with 'human cryopreservation' costs of $28,000. The organisation's chief, Dennis Kowalski, believes that death is something to be 'defeated' and said, 'The grave is your only real alternative and that's complete oblivion. So we want to defeat man's greatest enemy - death itself.'

**The Quest for Immortality: Cryopreservation in Russia**
The demand for cryopreservation in Russia has increased in recent years. However, the process of freezing and reviving humans is still in its infancy. Scientists around the world are exploring the possibility of cryopreservation, but it is not a guarantee of immortality. Herman Stadnik, a Russian man who has chosen to be cryopreserved, said, 'This is 100 years with the possibility of prolongation. If in 100 years, no procedure for thawing and restoring is found, then you will be extended for the next term.' However, experts like Irina Arutinyan, head of the laboratory of cellular technologies and tissue engineering at RUDN, believe that cryopreservation is not a means of achieving immortality. She said, 'Death in our country, in accordance with the law, begins only when the brain is dead. What is a dead brain - all its functions are completely and irreversibly completed. Only then can we work with this object, with the human body, and freeze it. But there is no sense in this, because when thawing, the brain will not come back to life. It is dead.' The procedure is currently being performed on people of advanced age with poor health indicators, which means that even if they are revived, they will be the same age. Cryopreservation is more of a way to put life on hold rather than achieve immortality.
