Süleyman Burak Bodur, a rapper known as Lvbel C5, was called to give a statement at the Gebze Emniyet Müdürlüğü on May 5th as part of an investigation into 'inciting the use of narcotics' initiated by the Gebze Cumhuriyet Başsavcılığı. After completing his statement, Bodur was sent to the adliyeye and subsequently to the Kandıra Cezaevi after being held in custody.

The court ultimately ruled in favor of Bodur's lawyer's request for his release, ordering that he be tried without being held in custody.

Former Taipei City Mayor Ko Wen-je was re-arrested for 2 months due to the Khyangwa Castle case. According to former legislator Guo Zhengliang, Ko Wen-je will not be released before the end of the recall, and at least until the first trial or the Democratic Progressive Party's defeat in the local elections, he will not be released.

**Zeki Göçtürk: 'We're living in a state of constant fear and insecurity'**
Zeki Göçtürk, a shop owner in Diyarbakır's Bağlar district, has been a target for drug dealers since 2022, after he allowed the police to use his security camera footage to identify them. Göçtürk stated, 'We were constantly threatened with verbal attacks, such as 'You're an agent, you can't stay here, we won't let you live here.' When my client came to work, they would encounter human filth, the shutters would be broken, and they would be attacked by some drug dealers.' The trial is ongoing at the Diyarbakır 3rd Heavy Penal Court, but the leader of the gang has not been brought to justice. Göçtürk said, 'The court has not taken any action against the gang leader. We have appealed the non-prosecution decision, and the court has overturned it, but no action has been taken against the gang leader. In every hearing, we have stated that the suspects should not be released due to security concerns, as they will attack again. However, they were released despite our objections. My client has been in custody for over two years, but was released. This is a clear violation of the law.' Göçtürk also stated that the police have been providing their support, but the suspects are being released after giving their statements, which is causing significant distress to his clients. He said, 'They are arrested, taken to court, and then released after giving their statements. This is a big problem for my clients. They are being threatened and attacked, and it's clear that they will not be prosecuted unless they are killed.' Göçtürk's clients have been subjected to constant threats and attacks, and their two businesses and two vehicles have been damaged. They have been forced to leave their homes and are unable to change their address in the MERNİS system due to the threats. Göçtürk stated, 'We have been forced to sell our businesses and leave our homes. We are living in a state of constant fear and insecurity. We have reported the attacks to the police, but no action has been taken against the suspects.'

İmamoğlu continued, 'You are not mistreating people just because they work with me. You are taking honorable, diligent, and patriotic people away from their homes, arresting them on false pretenses, and torturing them. You are even arresting a mother on her child's birthday, leaving the child alone. You are taking people into custody for a 5-minute statement, keeping them in cells for days, and fabricating charges when you can't find any. Our country has never experienced such cruelty. Release the mothers, don't cause any more harm to the children. You won't be able to account for this cruelty in two worlds.'

**Tanzanian Opposition Party Leader Detained Ahead of Elections**
The Tanzanian authorities have detained Amani Golugwa, the deputy general secretary of the Chadema opposition party, citing 'confidential information' that he was regularly entering and leaving the country without following legal procedures. According to the party's spokesperson, Brenda Rupia, Golugwa is currently being held at the central police station in Dar es Salaam. The International Democratic Union (UID) has condemned the 'illegal detention' and called for his immediate release, stating that 'silencing opposition voices violates the very foundations of democracy.' This is the latest incident targeting Chadema members, the main opposition party in the country, which is set to hold elections in October. Last month, the party's president, Tundu Lissu, was detained and accused of 'treason', a crime punishable by death, and the party was excluded from the electoral process. Golugwa had also reported the disappearance of a Chadema supporter, who he claimed was abducted by police agents. The Chadema party accuses the government of President Samia Suluhu Hassan of reverting to authoritarian practices reminiscent of her predecessor's regime.
