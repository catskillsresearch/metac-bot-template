**Lunar Resources: A New Frontier with Uncertain Rules**
Scientists have estimated that the Moon's surface contains over $1 trillion worth of platinum and other precious metals, delivered by asteroids. This could lead to a new 'gold rush' in space, but there are several challenges to overcome, including the lack of clear international laws governing the exploitation of lunar resources. Jayant Chennamanal, a Canadian researcher, has modeled the Moon's 'inheritance' from the asteroid impacts that have shaped its surface. The team found that around 6,500 craters could be 'treasure troves' of valuable metals. However, extracting these resources would be a complex task, requiring significant technological advancements. Dr. Chennamanal suggests that lunar mining could be more practical than chasing individual asteroids, due to the Moon's gravity, which would provide a stable platform for drilling and excavation. The US has proposed the 'Artemis Accords', a set of principles to regulate the exploration and commercial use of the Moon. However, these agreements are not legally binding, and key space-faring nations, such as China and Russia, have not signed them. As a result, the international community is still grappling with the complex issues surrounding the exploitation of lunar resources.

**The wild hunt for clean energy minerals**
The world is facing a critical mineral shortage, essential for clean energy technologies. The US Geological Survey has flagged 50 minerals as critical to the economy and security, with 18 materials particularly important for energy. The demand for these minerals is surging, with mineral demands from clean energy deployment projected to double to quadruple by 2040. The US is a major consumer of critical minerals but not a significant producer, with China leading in production and refining capacity. Researchers are exploring alternatives to lithium, such as lithium iron phosphate batteries, and developing more efficient mining technologies. However, the challenge of securing a reliable supply of critical minerals remains, with the world likely to rely on lithium for decades to come. New mining projects are underway, including in the US, and companies are exploring mining the ocean floor and even asteroids for critical minerals.

**Asteroids in 2025: A Close Encounter with the Earth**
The US space agency has listed over 100 asteroids that will approach the Earth in 2025, some of which are massive. According to Detlef Koschny, an asteroid expert from the European Space Agency, 'the size range of 20 to 40 meters' already poses an 'existing threat.' A larger asteroid, with a diameter of 1,000 meters, would be considered a 'planet killer.' However, none of the large asteroids in 2025 pose such a threat. The closest approach of a large asteroid in 2025 will be on June 6, 2025, when the asteroid 424482 (2008 DG5) will be about 3.5 million kilometers away from Earth, with a diameter of 310 to 690 meters. Other notable asteroids approaching Earth in 2025 include 2020 BC6, 2022 CE2, and 2016 AX165, among others.

**China's Ambitious Tianwen 2 Mission to Explore Asteroid and Comet**
China has launched the ambitious interplanetary mission Tianwen 2 on May 28. Initially named after a 15th-century Chinese explorer, the mission aims to explore the asteroid Kamo'oalewa, a fragment of the Moon that was broken off by a meteorite impact. The spacecraft will use a combination of touch-and-go sampling and anchoring methods to collect samples, which will be returned to Earth between 2027 and 2028. After that, the spacecraft will head to the comet 311P/PanSTARRS, which orbits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The mission will include a range of instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and a mass spectrometer. According to Gilles Dawidowicz, vice-president of the Société Astronomique de France, 'This mission is significant not only because China will join the exclusive club of asteroid explorers, but also because it will achieve a new feat by collecting samples from an asteroid and visiting a second, different asteroid in a single mission.'

**Asteroid '241 Germany' Holds a Treasure Worth $95.8 Trillion**
A recent discovery of a metal-rich asteroid, '241 Germany', has revealed a treasure worth approximately $95.8 trillion, equivalent to the world's total annual GDP. This asteroid is one of five profitable asteroids in our solar system, with the others being: 162385 (2000 BM19) worth $3.44 trillion, 4034 Vishnu worth $2.51 trillion, 65679 (1989 UQ) worth $1.77 trillion, and 7753 (1988 XB) worth $1.38 trillion. However, the company 'Planetari Resources' is not targeting this asteroid due to its distance, but instead plans to focus on the closer ones. According to Ian Webster, creator of 'Asterank', 'mining asteroids has finally taken over the headlines', adding that 'companies like Planetari Resources are a great example of the commercial viability of the space industry, but how much will it cost to mine a body millions of miles away?' The company plans to invest in optical scanners to determine what's inside these asteroids. NASA scientists say that the high concentration of raw materials in these asteroids could replenish Earth's natural resources. 'Planetari Resources' aims to launch experimental missions within two years. The company refused to discuss details about how and when they plan to start mining the asteroids.

**China's Tianwen-2 Mission to Explore Asteroid and Comet**
China has launched the Tianwen-2 mission to study two celestial bodies: an asteroid called Kamoʻoalewa, which is a quasi-satellite of Earth, and a comet called 311P/PANSTARRS. The mission aims to understand the origin of water on Earth and reveal secrets of the solar system. The asteroid, discovered in 2016, is thought to be a fragment of the Moon that was expelled by an impact millions of years ago. The Tianwen-2 spacecraft will use two methods to collect samples from the asteroid, including a rapid contact method and a drilling method that has never been attempted before. After studying the asteroid for a year, the spacecraft will leave it and head to the comet, which is an 'asteroid active' that expels dust without ice. The mission is expected to last 10 years and will provide unique data on the origin of water on Earth and the formation of comets.

**NASA's Secret Mission to Hunt Down Hidden Asteroids and Comets**
The NASA has revealed a secret mission, known as NEO Surveyor, to locate and track the approximately 25,000 asteroids that are hidden in space and could potentially pose a threat to Earth. The mission aims to detect and divert or destroy these asteroids and comets before they can impact the planet. According to NASA, the NEO Surveyor spacecraft will use sensitive infrared detectors to track the elusive objects, including dark asteroids that do not reflect much visible light but will glow in the infrared spectrum when heated by sunlight. The mission is crucial in detecting large rocks that are difficult to see and approach the Earth from the direction of the Sun, as well as those that are hidden behind the Sun's glare, said NASA. 'These massive space rocks are threats that larger ground-based observatories might miss,' added the agency. The NASA has been monitoring the asteroid YR4, which could have impacted Earth in 2032, but its chances have decreased.

**Opinion: What are the chances an asteroid will impact Earth in 2032?**
According to updated calculations, the chances of an asteroid impacting Earth in 2032 are near zero, with a high of 3.1% in 2024. While there are countless asteroids and comets in our solar system, the actual risks of impact are drastically reduced. Gordon Osinski notes that deflecting an asteroid from its path is possible, citing the work of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. A potential impact would be catastrophic, releasing energy equivalent to an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and would likely destroy a city of the size of London, Ontario, with a population of around 420,000. However, for now, the risk is minimal.

**Karman+: $20 Million (Seed) Secured For Mining Asteroids**
Asteroid mining company Karman+ has secured $20 million in seed funding led by Plural and Hummingbird to develop its first technology demonstration mission and customer missions. The company aims to mine space resources from near-Earth asteroids to provide abundant, sustainable energy and resources in space and for Earth. Karman+ seeks to make commercial asteroid mining a reality with scalable low-cost missions that reduce the cost of delivering material to customers by several orders of magnitude. According to Teun van den Dries, co-founder and CEO of Karman+, 'The idea of mining asteroids has moved out of science fiction and academic research into a commercial market opportunity that we can build for today.' The company's 'open space' approach to mission development is founded on principles of transparency and has created a feedback loop across the industry. Karman+ plans to use asteroid regolith to refuel space tugs that service existing satellites in geostationary orbit and aims to transform industries such as manufacturing and energy by moving production off Earth to eliminate the devastating social and environmental impacts of these activities.

**Asteroid Mining: No Threat to Gold Market**
The exploitation of asteroids for mining has made significant progress in recent years, but it is still in its infancy. The NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission has returned with a 250-gram sample of the asteroid Bennu, breaking the previous record of 5 grams set by the Japanese mission Hayabusa 2. The mission Psyché, launched in 2023, aims to study the asteroid Psyché 16, which is estimated to have a value of 10,000 quadrillion dollars, 38.5 million times the value of all the gold on Earth. However, experts from S&V argue that the exploitation of asteroids is not yet commercially viable, and even if it were, it would not be profitable due to the high cost of transporting the gold back to Earth. They estimate that it would take until 2039 for the exploitation of Psyché 16 to become a viable option. In the meantime, the gold from asteroids will be used as a raw material in space, rather than being brought back to Earth. The true motivations for asteroid mining are not the prospect of acquiring precious metals, but the potential for intellectual property and the development of new technologies. The value of the market for asteroid mining is estimated to reach $3.87 trillion by 2025.

**NASA on High Alert for 'Assassin of Cities' Asteroid with 1.5% Chance of Hitting Earth in 2032**
The NASA is on high alert for an asteroid called 'assassin of cities' that is heading towards Earth. According to the space agency, the asteroid, designated 2024 YR4, has a 1.5% chance of colliding with Earth in 2032. International agencies are working intensively to track the space rock and evaluate the possibility of destroying it if necessary. 'No one is panicking, but it's definitely the topic we're discussing in the corridors of NASA,' says a project manager at the Kennedy Space Center. 'We know we have time to act, but now it's time to start planning. You can't do this in a rush at the last minute.' The NASA has released a bombastic estimate that puts the probability of a deep impact at 3.1%, or 1 in 32, more likely than choosing the correct number in a roulette. The space agency has since increased the chances of the Earth escaping the space rock with new observations made on Wednesday. The asteroid is estimated to be 130 to 300 feet wide, approximately the size of a large commercial building. Its projected trajectory could mean impact in eight of the most populous cities in the world, including Bogotá (Colombia), Lagos (Nigeria), and Mumbai (India), with up to 110 million people potentially at risk in case of collision with the Earth. If it hits one of these cities, the consequences would be catastrophic. 'If you put it over Paris, London, or New York, you basically wipe out the entire city and some surrounding areas,' said Bruce Betts, chief scientist of the Planetary Society, to AFP. If international space agencies determine that the asteroid will likely hit the Earth, they could send a rocket armed with explosives towards the rock in 2032, changing its trajectory or destroying it completely. 'Destroying it would be easy,' says the NASA project manager. 'You wouldn't need many explosives. The trick is to reach it and deliver the explosives precisely at the right moment and angle. That's the hard part.' The destruction of the asteroid would depend largely on its density and composition, which scientists still do not know. Some asteroids are composed of porous rock and metal, causing easy disintegration, like the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013. Those would require fewer explosives than other, more solid asteroids. The NASA has not commented on the possibility of sending a nuclear warhead or other explosive to neutralize the asteroid, and experts warn that the conversation may be premature, as they are still in the observation and waiting phase. 'We will be able to track it until April, and then it will be too far away. But we can learn a lot in the next month or more and decide what to do from there,' said a NASA source. International Collaboration The NASA has confirmed that it is in contact with several space agencies, including the National Space Administration of China (CNSA), the Russian space agency Roscosmos, and the European Space Agency (ESA). The agencies are also in contact with astronomers from the International Asteroid Warning Network to map the asteroid's trajectory and determine the risks of collision with the Earth at 61,200 km/h. Hundreds of telescopes are focused on the asteroid, which is currently moving away from us in an elliptical orbit that brings it close to the Sun. It takes approximately 4 years to orbit the Sun. The YR4 was initially spotted crossing our solar system in December. Astronomers initially believed that the asteroid had a 1 in 83 chance of hitting the Earth during its return in 2032. The rock will return to the vicinity of the Earth in 2028, giving scientists another chance to recalculate the probabilities and determine if it still represents a threat. Some scientists believe that the probabilities will drop drastically in its next orbit. 'At some point in the next few months or years, the probability will be zero,' says Betts. But the NASA and other agencies are not taking any risks. 'We have plenty of warning time, and this is one we should observe,' says the NASA project manager. 'It may not be a threat. It may change mass if there is ice in it, and that would change things enormously. It may oscillate a bit now, and that slight change now could become tens of thousands of miles when it returns. The sky is not falling — yet. Anything can happen. But we still have to stay on alert.'

**NASA's Plan to Counter Comet 2024 YR4: A Potential Threat to Earth**
The NASA has revealed its plan to counter the comet 2024 YR4, which could potentially impact the Earth in 2032. The agency has a protocol in place to follow in case the asteroid becomes a threat to global population; alternative options are being considered. According to preliminary calculations, if 2024 YR4 maintains its current course and collides with the Earth, the impact could occur in a region spanning from northern South America to southern Asia, the Arabian Sea, and Africa. Countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Nigeria are at risk. However, its trajectory could change in the coming years, especially upon entering the atmosphere. While an object of this size does not represent a global extinction threat, its impact could generate massive shockwaves, damage cities, and affect local climates, depending on whether it lands on land or in the ocean. The NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office is monitoring the object and designing strategies to mitigate a potential collision. In case 2024 YR4 becomes an imminent threat, the protocol includes three key actions: 'The four key points of the NASA's plan are: 1) to monitor the object's trajectory and composition; 2) to assess the potential impact zone and population at risk; 3) to develop a deflection strategy, which could include a kinetic impactor or a nuclear explosion; and 4) to prepare for emergency response and evacuation procedures.' According to NASA, the agency has been developing and perfecting strategies to deflect asteroids or comets in recent years. In 2022, NASA conducted the DART mission, in which a spacecraft impacted the asteroid Dimorphos and altered its orbit. This experiment demonstrated that it is possible to modify the trajectory of a space object with sufficient anticipation.

**NASA's Plan to Counter the Meteorite 2024 YR4**
The NASA has revealed its plan to counter the meteorite 2024 YR4, which could impact the Earth in 2032. The estimated diameter of the object is between 40 to 100 meters, and it was detected on December 27, 2024, by the ATLAS asteroid detection system in Chile. According to preliminary calculations, if 2024 YR4 maintains its current course and collides with the Earth, the impact could occur in a region spanning from northern South America to southern Asia, the Arabian Sea, and Africa. Countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Nigeria would be at risk. However, its trajectory could change in the coming years, especially when it enters the atmosphere. NASA's Office of Planetary Defense Coordination is monitoring the object and designing strategies to mitigate a possible collision. The plan includes: alerting governments and international organizations, evaluating the possibility of deflecting the comet using a mission similar to DART, and implementing evacuation plans and emergency measures to minimize human and economic losses. NASA has been developing and refining strategies to deflect asteroids or comets in recent years, including the DART mission in 2022, which successfully altered the orbit of the asteroid Dimorphos.

**UN Activates Planetary Security Protocol for Asteroid 2024 YR4**
The United Nations' (UN) network of experts has activated the international planetary security protocol for the first time due to the 1.6% chance of the asteroid 2024 YR4 impacting Earth in 2032. The protocol is activated when an asteroid has a 1% or higher chance of impact and is over 10 meters in diameter. The next step is for the SMPAG to evaluate if a mission should be planned if the impact is within the next 50 years with a probability of over 1% and the asteroid is over 50 meters in diameter. According to the SMPAG, they will continue to actively monitor the evolution of the impact probability, but do not consider taking immediate measures regarding the planning of any space mission. The asteroid will be visible until late April and will be reevaluated then. It will be observable again in June 2028, allowing for a reevaluation of the impact probability and potential actions. As explained by Josep Maria Trigo, principal investigator of the Asteroids, Comets, and Meteorites Group at the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC/IEEC), the improvement in detection capabilities makes it likely that such cases will increase. 'This is good news because this active criterion allows us to react quickly, monitor the situation, and, hopefully, alert the risk more quickly,' Trigo notes. This is the first time the protocol has been activated, with its criteria finalized in 2017. In 2004, the asteroid Apophis was discovered, with initial estimates giving a 2.7% chance of impact in 2029. However, after further observation, it was found to pass close to Earth but not impact.

**Asteroid 2024 YR4: A 1.3% Chance of Impact on December 22, 2032**
A group of astronomers observed an asteroid, 2024 YR4, which is estimated to be between 40 and 100 meters long, shortly after Christmas. They used simulators to identify its possible future orbits and now claim that there is a 1.3% chance of it impacting the Earth on December 22, 2032. However, David Rankin from the University of Arizona, who specializes in identifying comets and asteroids, says, 'No, not at all.' The current probability of impact may seem alarming, but Rankin notes that it is also a 98.7% chance that it will not hit the Earth. He adds, 'It's not a number you want to ignore, but it's not a number that will keep you up at night.' The probability of impact may decrease over time as astronomers collect more data on the object. Andy Rivkin, an astronomer and planetary defense researcher at Johns Hopkins University, says, 'The international systems we are putting in place to find, track, and characterize hazardous asteroids and comets (and, if necessary, mitigate their impact) are working as planned.'
