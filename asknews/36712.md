**OPEC+ Unwinding Cuts Leaves Market Miraculously Balanced | OilPrice.com**
Standard Chartered forecasts a balanced market in Q2-Q3, even if all voluntary cuts are lifted. The OPEC+ group is set to meet on Friday to discuss production strategy for July, with analysts predicting an increase of 411 thousand barrels per day. However, this increase has not translated into a large increase in OPEC+ output, partly due to production headwinds in some countries. StanChart estimates that OPEC+ total crude output in March clocked in at 40.99 mb/d, set to rise to 41.90 mb/d in July. The group will effectively add just 905 kb/d to daily output despite the 1.4 mb/d relaxation in targets. StanChart also forecasts that global markets remain broadly balanced in the second and third quarters of the current year, with global demand expected to increase by 1.17 mb/d y/y in 2025. However, if the worst overproducers (Kazakhstan and Iraq) fail to scale back production, the group could accelerate the unwinding clip to more than 411kb/d. Still, StanChart notes that bearish sentiment still rules oil markets, with counter-seasonal or larger-than-normal inventory builds across a wide range of crude and product categories. According to the latest EIA weekly data, crude oil inventories increased by 1.33 mb w/w to 443.16 m, cutting the deficit to the five-year average of 26.31 mb. Goldman Sachs notes that the ongoing slowdown in drilling activity in the Permian Basin is likely to provide support to crude oil prices, as the decline in tight oil production is quite alarming considering the lowest breakeven costs for shale oil in the region.

**Oil Prices Fall Despite Decline in US Inventories Amid OPEC+ Alliance Expectations**
Oil prices fell at the end of Thursday's trading, despite a decline in US oil inventories, as expectations of a 'OPEC+' alliance decision to increase July supplies grew. The Brent crude futures contract for July delivery fell by 1.1% or $0.75 to $64.15 per barrel. The US crude futures contract for July delivery fell by 1.4% or $0.90 to $60.94 per barrel. This comes amid reports of a possible agreement between eight OPEC+ member countries to increase production by 411,000 barrels per day in July. Oil prices were also pressured by US data released today, which showed a contraction in the country's GDP in the first quarter, despite a slower pace of decline than initially reported. Despite this, investors remain calm about the outlook for the US and global economies, following a US court ruling yesterday to suspend most of the tariffs imposed by the current administration. US oil inventories declined last week, according to official data released by the Energy Information Administration, indicating a rebound in energy demand in the world's largest economy.

**Oil Prices Plunge by Over 1% Amid OPEC+ Production Hopes and US Economic Data**
Oil prices deepened their losses on Thursday, despite a decline in US oil inventories, as expectations of a production increase by the 'OPEC+' alliance in July next month weighed on the market. Brent crude futures for July delivery fell by 1.20% or $0.78 to $64.12 a barrel at 08:06 pm local time in Mecca, after falling 0.50% earlier in the day. US crude futures for July delivery fell by 1.44% or $0.89 to $60.95 a barrel. This comes as reports of a possible agreement by eight OPEC+ member countries to increase production by an additional 411,000 barrels per day in July have been circulating. Oil prices were also pressured by US data released on Thursday, which showed a contraction in the country's GDP in the first quarter, although the pace of the decline was 0.20%, less than the 0.30% recorded in the initial reading. Despite this, investor concerns about the US and global economies have eased, following a US court ruling on Wednesday to suspend most of the tariffs imposed by the current administration, within 10 days. US oil inventories declined last week, according to official data released by the Energy Information Administration, indicating a rebound in energy demand in the world's largest economy.

**Pemex's Crude Oil Production Declines 11.2% in First Quarter of 2025**
Pemex's crude oil production continues to decline, with a 11.2% drop in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, according to its latest operational report. This decline confirms that Pemex is far from reaching its official goal of producing 1.8 million barrels per day, set by the current government of President Claudia Sheinbaum as part of its strategy to recover energy self-sufficiency. Pemex has accumulated 29 consecutive months of annual declines in its oil production. In April, Pemex reported a production of 1.369 million barrels per day, a 8.8% annual decrease. Considering not only crude but also condensates, the total production in April was 1.627 million barrels per day, also representing an 8.8% decrease compared to April 2024. Pemex's export of crude oil also declined, with 647,750 barrels per day exported in April 2025, a 4.9% annual decrease in terms of volume. Moreover, the value of exports fell by 24.2% compared to April last year, with Pemex earning $1.176 billion from crude oil exports in that month, a significantly lower amount than the same period in 2024. Secretary of Finance Édgar Amador Zamora acknowledged that Pemex has the urgent task of stabilizing national production, focusing on improving the exploitation of existing wells and maintaining investment in exploration.

**Oil Updates  --  crude tumbles as OPEC+ accelerates output hikes,**
Oil prices fell over $1 a barrel on Monday as OPEC+ agreed to accelerate oil production hikes for a second consecutive month, raising output in June by 411,000 barrels per day. According to Reuters, Brent crude futures dropped $1.34, or 2.19 percent, to $59.95 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was at $56.87 a barrel, down $1.42, or 2.44 percent. Barclays and ING have lowered their Brent crude forecasts following the OPEC+ decision, with Barclays reducing its forecast by $4 to $66 a barrel for 2025 and by $2 to $60 for 2026. ING expects Brent to average $65 this year, down from $70 previously. 'The oil market has been dealing with significant demand uncertainty amid tariff risks. This change in OPEC+ policy adds to uncertainty on the supply side,' ING analysts led by Warren Patterson said. 'The May 3 OPEC+ decision to raise production quotas another 411,000 bpd for June adds to the market expectation that the global supply/demand balance is moving to a surplus,' Tim Evans, founder of Evans on Energy said.

**Oil Prices Rise Amid US Tariff Ruling and OPEC+ Production Increase**
The Brent crude oil price rose by 1.27% to $65.14 per barrel on May 29, 2025, after reaching a high of $65.01 the previous day. The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil also rose to $62.49 per barrel. The increase in oil prices is attributed to a court ruling in the US that blocked the implementation of President Donald Trump's tariffs on most countries. The ruling has boosted risk appetite in global markets, with investors focusing on the potential for new sanctions on Russian oil and the OPEC+ group's decision to increase production in July. Experts predict that the OPEC+ group will agree to a daily increase of 411,000 barrels in production, which will continue until the end of the third quarter. This increase in supply is expected to be accompanied by a rise in global demand, particularly in the US, which is the world's largest oil consumer. The Energy Information Administration's weekly petroleum stock report, due to be released today, will provide further insight into the US oil market. According to technical analysis, the Brent crude oil price is expected to face resistance at $67.07 and support at $60.85.

**Oil Prices Fall Over 1% as Market Weighs Trump Tariffs and OPEC+ Decision**
Oil prices fell more than 1% on Thursday, reversing earlier gains, as investors weighed the potential effects of a US court ruling that blocked some of President Donald Trump's most drastic tariffs. The market was also watching for possible new US sanctions that could curb Russian crude flows and a decision by OPEC+ on increasing production in July. Brent crude futures fell 75 cents, or 1.2%, to $64.15 a barrel, while US crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped 90 cents, or 1.5%, to $60.94 a barrel. Analysts from ING said, 'We assume the group will agree to another large increase in supply of 411,000 barrels per day. We expect similar increases until the end of the third quarter, as the group increases its focus on defending its market share.' However, new sanctions on Russian crude are also a concern.

**Opep+ confirms it will maintain oil production cuts until 2026**
The Opep+ alliance, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, has confirmed that it will maintain the mandatory cuts in its oil production until the end of 2026, totaling 3.6 million barrels per day (mbd). The announcement was made in a statement after the conclusion of the 39th plenary meeting of the ministers of industry of the 22 member countries of the alliance. The Opep+ reconfirmed the 'total level of crude oil production' fixed in December 2024 at 39.725 mbd, about 38% of global production, until December 31, 2026, according to the statement. This joint quota does not include the productions of Venezuela, Iran, and Libya, three Opep partners exempt from the commitment to limit their pumping due to various involuntary circumstances, such as sanctions and conflicts, that weigh on their oil industries. The ministers also confirmed the mandate of two internal committees responsible for closely monitoring the market and convening extraordinary meetings if they consider necessary to adjust the levels of supply, and requested the full compliance of national quotas. Additionally, the Opep secretariat was entrusted with 'developing a mechanism to evaluate the maximum sustainable production capacity of participating countries,' so that it can be used as a basis for calculating new quotas for 2027. The next Opep+ ministerial conference was called for November 30 this year. The statement made no reference to the voluntary and additional cuts, totaling 2.2 mbd, implemented by Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman from 2023 to April 1, when an agreement came into force to gradually and progressively suspend their implementation over 18 months. However, they surprised by announcing increases of 411,000 bd in May and June, triple the initial monthly increase projected (137,000 bd), and now there are speculations that they may increase the same volume again in July.

**Oil Prices Fall Amid Unexpected US Oil Reserves Increase and Iran-US Nuclear Deal Possibility**
Oil prices have fallen for the second consecutive day, with Brent crude dropping 3.25% to $63.95 per barrel and Wti crude falling 3.91% to $60.68 per barrel. The decline in oil prices is attributed to several factors, including an unexpected increase in US oil reserves, the OPEC's maintained growth estimates for 2025 and 2026, and the possibility of a deal between Iran and the US on nuclear issues, which could lead to the revocation of sanctions. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil demand growth will be reduced to 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 2025, down from 990,000 bpd in the first quarter. The IEA also increased its growth estimate for 2025 to 740,000 bpd, citing a stronger economic growth and lower oil prices supporting consumption. For 2026, the IEA expects global oil demand growth to be 760,000 bpd. The IEA also increased its estimate of oil supply growth by nearly 400,000 bpd per month, to 1.6 million bpd in 2025, due to expected increased production from Saudi Arabia and a slowdown in US shale oil production.

**IEA Raises Forecast for Oil Demand Growth in 2025**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has symbolically increased its forecast for oil demand growth in 2025 by 741,000 barrels per second (b/s) compared to the previous year. This is according to the IEA's monthly report. The agency had previously forecast a growth of 726,000 b/s. The IEA's overall assessment of oil demand has been revised upwards: in 2024, it is now estimated at 103.16 million b/s (April's estimate was 102.82 million b/s), in 2025 - 103.9 million b/s (previous estimate was 103.54 million b/s), and in 2026 - 106.66 million b/s (previous estimate was 106.23 million b/s). The symbolic change in the forecast is due to data on global oil consumption in the first quarter: according to the IEA, growth in demand during this period was almost 1 million b/s, while last year's figure was 830,000 b/s. 'The first three months will likely remain the strongest quarter of 2025, as last year's unusually mild winter led to a weak base for heating fuel, including gasoline, diesel, and propane. We believe that the remaining part of 2025 will see a more moderate growth in consumption of 650,000 b/s and reach an average annual growth of 741,000 b/s', - the report says. The IEA analysts note that the recent decline in oil prices, caused by trade wars, will contribute to its consumption. 'Retail prices for gasoline and diesel have already fallen to multi-year lows in most countries', - the IEA writes, noting that a weak US dollar is also an additional support for oil-importing countries. The agency's analysts note that, unlike last year, when China was the main driver of global oil demand growth, this year's geography will be much more diversified. In addition to China, significant contributions will come from India, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. The IEA's forecast for oil demand growth in 2026 has been increased to 760,000 b/s, which is almost 70,000 b/s more than previously forecast.

**EIA Downgrades Oil Price Forecast for 2025**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revised its forecast for global oil prices downward for this year. According to the EIA's 'May 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook Report', the production increase announced by OPEC+ countries last month has strengthened the perception of a surplus in the global oil market, leading to an increase in global oil stocks. It is expected that the increase in stocks will put pressure on oil prices for the rest of the year. Daily average oil additions to stocks are expected to be around 300,000 barrels in the first four months of the year, which is higher than the expected daily decline of 200,000 barrels in January. The EIA expects the increase in stocks to continue in the coming months, with daily average increases of 500,000 barrels in the second quarter and 700,000 barrels in the fourth quarter. For the year as a whole, the EIA expects an average daily increase of 400,000 barrels, and 800,000 barrels per day in 2026. The expectation of no problems in global oil supply is indicating a gradual decline in Brent oil prices. The EIA expects Brent oil prices to decline to $61 per barrel by the end of the year and to average $59 per barrel in 2026. The average price of WTI crude oil is expected to be $61.81 per barrel. The EIA had previously announced an average price of $80.56 per barrel for Brent oil and $76.60 per barrel for WTI crude oil last year. Daily average oil production in the US is expected to be around 13.42 million barrels this year, up from 13.21 million barrels last year.

**EIA Downgrades Oil Price Forecast for 2025**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revised its oil price forecast for this year downward. According to the 'May 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook Report', the production increase announced by OPEC+ countries last month has strengthened the surplus supply perception, leading to an increase in global oil stocks. It is expected that the stock increases will put pressure on oil prices for the rest of the year. The report states that an average of 300,000 barrels of oil will be added to the stocks daily in the first four months of the year, which contradicts the expected decrease of over 200,000 barrels per day in January. The report also highlights that the surplus supply perception is not only due to OPEC+ countries, but also due to the increasing production of non-OPEC producers, and that the uncertainty surrounding the reciprocal tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump has increased short-term price volatility. It is expected that the stock increase will continue in the coming period. The EIA forecasts that global oil stocks will increase by an average of 500,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and 700,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. For the year as a whole, this increase is expected to be around 400,000 barrels per day, and 800,000 barrels per day in 2026. The expectation that there will be no problems in global oil supply is indicating a gradual decline in Brent oil prices. The price of Brent oil, which was around $76 per barrel in the first quarter of 2025, is expected to decline to $61 per barrel by the end of the year and to around $59 per barrel in 2026. Therefore, the average price of Brent oil for this year is expected to be around $65.85 per barrel, which is lower than the previous forecast of $67.87 per barrel. The average price of WTI crude oil is expected to be around $61.81 per barrel, which is lower than the previous forecast of $63.88 per barrel. The EIA had previously announced that the average price of Brent oil for last year was $80.56 per barrel and the average price of WTI crude oil was $76.60 per barrel. It is expected that the daily average crude oil production in the US will be around 13.42 million barrels this year, which is slightly higher than the 13.21 million barrels produced last year. On the other hand, the global oil supply is expected to be around 104.13 million barrels per day, and the global oil demand is expected to be around 103.71 million barrels per day this year.

**EIA Lowers 2023 Oil Price Forecast by Approximately 8 Dollars**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revised its 2023 oil price forecast downward by approximately 8 dollars to 65.85 dollars. The increase in global oil stocks due to the production increase decisions of OPEC+ countries will put pressure on prices. According to the EIA's 'May 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook Report', the production increase decisions of OPEC+ countries in the previous month have strengthened the surplus perception, leading to an increase in global oil stocks. It is expected that the stock increase will put pressure on oil prices for the rest of the year. The report states that the daily average addition of 300,000 barrels of oil to the stockpile in the first four months of the year is expected, which is contrary to the expected daily decrease of 200,000 barrels in January. The report also notes that the surplus perception is not only due to OPEC+ countries, but also due to the increasing production of non-OPEC producers, and that the uncertainty surrounding the reciprocal tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump will also increase short-term price volatility. It is expected that the stock increase will continue in the coming period. The EIA forecasts that global oil stocks will increase by an average of 500,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and 700,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. The report also states that the average daily increase of 400,000 barrels is expected for the year as a whole, and 800,000 barrels per day in 2026. The expectation that there will be no problems in global oil supply is indicating a gradual decline in Brent oil prices. The report forecasts that the Brent oil price will decline to 61 dollars per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2025 and average 59 dollars per barrel in 2026. Thus, the average oil price of Brent oil is expected to be 65.85 dollars per barrel for this year. This figure was previously estimated to be 67.87 dollars. The average price of WTI crude oil is expected to be 61.81 dollars per barrel. The EIA had previously estimated this figure to be 63.88 dollars in the previous month. The EIA had previously announced that the average price of Brent oil per barrel in 2022 was 80.56 dollars and the price of WTI crude oil was 76.60 dollars. The daily average oil production in the US is expected to be approximately 13.42 million barrels this year. This figure was approximately 13.21 million barrels last year. On the other hand, the global oil supply is expected to be 104.13 million barrels per day, and the global oil demand is expected to be 103.71 million barrels per day.

**EIA Revises Downward Its Forecast for Global Oil Stocks**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revised its forecast for global oil stocks downward. According to the EIA's 'April 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook Report', global oil stocks are expected to increase in the second quarter of this year, which will put downward pressure on oil prices. The increase in stocks is expected to be due to the easing of production cuts by OPEC+ countries, an increase in production in non-OPEC countries, and a slowdown in oil demand growth. As a result, global oil stocks are expected to increase by an average of 600,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and 700,000 barrels per day in the second half of the year. The EIA also expects a similar rate of increase in 2026. In parallel with the increase in stocks, the price of Brent crude oil is expected to fall from an average of $75.83 per barrel in the first quarter to an average of $64 per barrel in the fourth quarter. For 2026 as a whole, prices are expected to average $61.48 per barrel. Additionally, the impact of US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies, including tariffs, and existing sanctions on Russia, Iran, and Venezuela are also expected to affect prices. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding OPEC+'s production cuts and the extent to which they will meet their announced production targets is also expected to continue to influence price outlook. As a result, the EIA expects the average price of Brent crude oil to be $67.87 per barrel this year, down from the previous forecast of $74.22 per barrel. The average price of WTI crude oil is expected to be $63.88 per barrel. The EIA previously reported that the average price of Brent crude oil was $80.56 per barrel last year, and the average price of WTI crude oil was $76.60 per barrel. US oil production The EIA expects US oil production to average around 13.51 million barrels per day this year, up from around 13.21 million barrels per day last year. The EIA previously reported that US oil production would average around 13.61 million barrels per day this year. On the other hand, the EIA expects global oil supply to average around 104.1 million barrels per day, and global oil demand to average around 103.64 million barrels per day this year.

**Is The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB) the Best Oil and Gas Dividend Stock According to Billionaires?**
The US oil and gas industry is facing challenges, including declining production in the Permian Basin, the country's largest oil field, and the impact of falling Brent prices. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), American crude oil production is expected to average 13.59 million barrels per day in 2025. However, despite these challenges, the industry remains committed to shareholders and has increased returns to record levels, with over $49 billion in dividends distributed in the third quarter of 2024. As the industry shifts focus to natural gas, it will need to maintain high levels of payout. As one executive noted, 'the industry will need to shift focus to its second major source of revenue - natural gas.'

**Crude oil futures rise as EIA forecasts drop in global inventories**
Crude oil futures rose on Wednesday morning after the US EIA forecasted a decline in global inventories during the first half of 2025. The EIA's monthly report stated that global oil markets will remain tight through the middle of 2025 before shifting to oil inventory builds later this year. According to the report, global oil inventories will fall in the second quarter of 2025 due to decreasing crude oil production in Iran and Venezuela. As a result, the Brent crude oil spot price is expected to rise from $70 per barrel to $75 per barrel by the third quarter of 2025. However, the report expects oil inventories to build and place downward pressure on crude oil prices in late-2025 and through 2026. Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey from ING Think said that oil prices managed to settle higher on Tuesday, supported by the weaker US dollar. They also noted that the oil market seems to be ignoring Ukraine's agreement to a US-brokered ceasefire, with uncertainty over Russia's stance on the proposed agreement. The API data showed a 4.2 million barrel increase in US crude oil inventories, well above the expected 2 million barrel build.

**EIA Raises US Crude Oil Production Forecast for 2025**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has increased its forecast for US crude oil production to 13.59 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2025, surpassing its previous estimate of 13.55 million bpd. The agency maintained its estimate for US oil and liquid fuel consumption at 20.5 million bpd in 2025. According to the EIA, the prices of Brent crude oil are expected to average around $74 in 2025, but will fall to around $66 in 2026. The agency predicts gradual increases in combined production and relatively weak global demand growth. The EIA also stated that OPEC+ production cuts will reduce global oil inventories and keep crude prices near current levels until the first quarter of 2025. The global production of liquid fuels is expected to increase by 1.7 million bpd in 2025, with 100,000 bpd coming from OPEC+ producers. The EIA added that the group will increase production by 600,000 bpd in 2026, but will remain below its targets in an effort to limit the increase in global oil inventories. The growth in production outside of OPEC+ will be driven by the US, Canada, Brazil, and Guyana until 2026. The global consumption of liquid fuels is expected to increase by 1.4 million bpd in 2025 and 1 million bpd in 2026, led by India and China, according to the agency. However, the forecasted growth remains slower than the pre-pandemic trend, the EIA added. The EIA also stated that any future imposition of tariffs by Trump on Canada and Mexico is not currently expected to have a significant impact on global oil supply, but added that tariffs and new US sanctions on Russia are sources of uncertainty for crude oil prices in the future. The utilization of US refineries will remain relatively high and net exports of fuel from the US will decrease to meet internal fuel demand due to the closure of two refineries in the country, explained the EIA.
