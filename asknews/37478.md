**It's Time For SCOTUS To Hold Rogue Judges Accountable**
The U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling in United States v. Skrmetti has sent a clear message to lower courts about the constitutional limits of the third branch. However, some judges, such as Brian E. Murphy, a Biden-nominated U.S. District Court judge for the District of Massachusetts, have ignored the high court's ruling. Constitutional law expert Hans von Spakovsky said the message should be crystal clear, and that the court's ruling 'spoke to what is going on in the court system.' He hopes the high court will issue an even stronger message to activist judges if it issues an end-of-term ruling involving birthright citizenship. Murphy's order blocking the administration from sending violent illegal immigrants to a detention facility has been stayed by the Supreme Court, but he insists his order remains in full force and effect. Trump Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller called Murphy's order a 'judicial coup' and warned that the administration will hold him accountable for refusing to obey the Supreme Court.

**US Supreme Court Clears Path for Trump's Deportation Plan to Third Countries**
The US Supreme Court has published a decision that clears the way for President Donald Trump's plan to deport immigrants to third countries. The measure suspends a previous ruling by federal judge Brian Murphy, which required the Administration to give immigrants sufficient time to appeal their deportation due to the risk of torture and prohibited their sending to countries where they had not previously resided. Murphy considered that the authorities had 'unquestionably' failed to comply with his ruling by deporting a group of eight immigrants from various nationalities to South Sudan. The White House requested that the Supreme Court suspend the measure. The Supreme Court's announcement does not have a signature, as it is an urgent measure, but it reflects the vote against the three judges considered 'liberal' in the US, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. 'In matters of life or death, it is better to proceed with caution. In this case, the Government has taken the opposite approach,' they argued. The National Alliance for Immigration Litigation, a party in the process, has warned of the 'horrible consequences' of this measure, as it 'strips away the protection of due process' and could lead to 'torture and deaths,' according to the executive director of the organization, Trina Realmuto. The US Attorney General, D. John Sauer, had argued that Murphy's measure imposed 'onerous procedures' on the Government that affected the presidential competition to carry out foreign policy. Sauer emphasized that the goal is to deport 'the worst of the worst' and therefore 'it is common that they do not want them' in their countries of origin.

**US Supreme Court to Review Case of Rastafarian Man's Haircut in Prison**
The US Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of Damon Landry, a Rastafarian who was arrested and had his hair cut while in prison, violating his religious beliefs. Landry, 46, has been growing his hair for 20 years, and it reached his knees in 2020. He was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Louisiana, where he was told by officials that a federal appeals court had already ruled that Louisiana's policy of cutting Rastafarians' hair was unconstitutional. However, a guard threw the ruling in the trash, and Landry was forced to sit and have his head shaved. Landry's lawyers argued that the law does not allow individual officials to be held liable for financial damages. The Supreme Court will review the case in its upcoming term, which begins in October. The court has expanded the rights of individuals and religious institutions in a series of recent rulings. The case revolves around a federal law that prohibits religious discrimination and protects the religious rights of individuals in institutions such as prisons. Landry's lawyer, Zachary Tribble, welcomed the decision, saying 'No one should have to go through what Mr. Landry went through. A ruling in favor of Mr. Landry will greatly contribute to holding officials accountable for egregious violations of religious freedoms and ensuring that what happened to Mr. Landry does not happen to anyone else.' The state of Louisiana argued that it had changed its grooming policy in prisons to prevent similar incidents, but urged the court to reject the case, saying that a ruling in favor of Landry would 'significantly exacerbate the already severe workforce shortage' faced by states in providing staff for prisons across the country. The Supreme Court has also ruled in favor of religious rights in another case, allowing a Catholic diocese to exempt a priest from a Wisconsin state unemployment insurance tax.

**Abuja property dispute: Judge berates EFCC over refusal to obey court order**
Justice Musa Liman of the Federal High Court in Abuja has berated the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for refusing to obey a court order to vacate a property in dispute. The EFCC had obtained an ex-parte order to evict High Chief Ikechi Emenike, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), from the property, but Emenike presented evidence that he had been paying rent to the EFCC for over 10 years. The court held that the EFCC had no legal right to keep the property for itself and should have sold it and remitted the proceeds to the Treasury Single Account (TSA). The EFCC was ordered to vacate the property, but armed security operatives chased away a bailiff who went to execute the order. Justice Liman accused the EFCC of treating the court's order with disdain and denied the agency further audience until it purges itself of contempt. The EFCC Chairman and a lawyer representing the commission have been accused of brazen and grievous acts of contempt and a motion has been filed for a bench warrant for their arrest.

**Senate parliamentarian rejects GOP's attempt to limit courts' contempt powers**
The Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, has ruled against a provision in the Senate Republicans' megabill that would have limited courts' ability to hold Trump officials in contempt. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer hailed the decision as a major victory, saying, 'Senate Republicans tried to write Donald Trump's contempt for the courts into law -- gutting judicial enforcement, defying the Constitution and bulldozing the very rule of law that forms our democracy.' The provision, which would have required a bond to be paid before a court could use its contempt power, was deemed to violate the Senate's rules governing simple-majority votes on budget reconciliation fast track. Schumer added, 'Donald Trump is not above the law. And thanks to Senate Democrats, the courts can still hold him and any president accountable.'

**Nepal's Special Court Orders Drishti Publisher to Appear Within Three Days**
A special court in Nepal has ordered the publisher of the weekly magazine 'Drishti', Shambhu Shrestha, and the executive editor MP Subba to appear before the court within three days. The court's decision comes after a report was submitted by six judges, including the court's president Teknaryan Kunwar, on the issue of contempt of court. The report was submitted in response to a news article published in Drishti, which allegedly contained contemptuous language. The court has ordered the defendants to appear before the court and give their statement, and has also instructed them to not make any changes to the original article. The court has also decided to include the contempt of court case under the criminal code. The six employees of the special court had submitted a report to the court, stating that the news article published in Drishti and online contained contemptuous language. 'We should not tolerate such behavior,' said the court's president, Teknaryan Kunwar. 'The defendants should be held accountable for their actions.'

**Hearing in contempt proceedings against CBN governor stalled**
The hearing in contempt proceedings against Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Olayemi Cardoso, was stalled on Monday at the Federal High Court in Abuja. The hearing was postponed following an oral application by C.E. Odum, who appeared for the applicant, Melrose General Services Limited, seeking an adjournment until June 30. Odum stated, 'The matter was slated for hearing today my lord. The 4th and 5th defendants were not in court though they were duly served with hearing notice.' The judge, Mohammed Umar, adjourned the matter until June 30 for hearing. The contempt proceedings stem from a Supreme Court judgment in June 2024, which overturned a previous forfeiture order against Melrose General Services Limited's funds. The company is seeking the release of N220 million, which remains unpaid despite the Supreme Court's decision.

**Don't tamper with our leadership list, Action Alliance warns INEC**
The Action Alliance (AA) has warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) against altering the list of its state chairmen, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) leadership, and National Executive Committee (NEC) members. The party, led by National Secretary Vernimbe James, cited credible intelligence that sacked members were lobbying INEC to change the list. AA vowed to resist any attempt to alter the leadership list, citing multiple court judgments affirming Chief Kenneth Udeze as the legitimate national chairman. The party reminded INEC of three Court of Appeal judgments in favour of Chief Udeze, stating that any move to change the leadership list would be a violation of these judgments and could attract contempt proceedings. AA also accused some individuals of seeking to undermine these appellate rulings by securing a conflicting decision from the Federal High Court in Osogbo, which the party described as legally untenable. 'It is elementary law that a Federal High Court cannot overturn a decision of the Court of Appeal,' the party asserted. The party urged INEC to maintain its neutrality and respect the rule of law by upholding the leadership structure validated by the courts and monitored by its officials.

**If Trump officials are found in contempt, what happens next?**
A US federal judge has given President Donald Trump's officials a one-week deadline to comply with his court order or risk being found in contempt of court. Judge James Boasberg said the officials could avoid contempt by 'asserting custody' over a group of over 200 people deported to El Salvador. However, the Trump administration has shown no sign of complying, criticizing the request and planning to appeal. Experts believe a showdown between the judicial and executive branch is inevitable. If the government does not comply with the deadline of 23 April, it could lead to a historic clash between the two branches of government.

**We’re Now on the Fast Track to a Historic Constitutional Clash**
The US is on the path to a historic constitutional clash between the executive branch and the federal judiciary. The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported, has taken on significant importance as it tests whether President Trump will abide by limitations imposed by the judicial branch. The administration has been defiant and dismissive of Article III judges, setting up a constitutional showdown. US District Judge James Boasberg has given the administration an April 23 deadline to correct its error, or face a criminal contempt proceeding. This case, along with the Alien Enemies Act case, is poised to be the Supreme Court's biggest test of the Trump II presidency. As Trump continues to defy court orders, it remains to be seen whether the judiciary will stand up to him. 'He may not be wrong' that the judiciary is bringing a knife to a gunfight, said David Kurtz.

**Judge Finds Probable Cause to Hold Trump Administration in Contempt of Court**
A federal judge, James E. Boasberg, has found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating a deportation order. The judge warned that he may pursue contempt charges against some officials for intentionally disobeying his order to return planes carrying deportees to a prison in El Salvador last month. Boasberg accused government officials of rushing the deportations, citing the Enemy Alien Act, before the deportees could challenge their expulsion in court, and then deliberately disobeying his order to have the planes that were already in the air return to the US. 'The Constitution does not tolerate the intentional disobedience of judicial orders, especially by officials of a coordinated branch that have sworn to defend it,' Boasberg wrote. The government has announced that it will appeal. 'The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and illegal alien criminals are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,' wrote the White House communications director, Steven Cheung, on the social media platform X. The case has become one of the most contentious, amidst a series of legal battles being waged against the Republican government and that have put the White House on a collision course with federal courts. Government officials have repeatedly criticized judges for restricting the President's actions, accusing the courts of improperly affecting his executive powers. Trump and his allies have called for Boasberg's impeachment, which prompted an unusual statement from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who said that 'impeachment is not an appropriate response to a disagreement over a judicial decision.' Boasberg wrote that the government's conduct 'betrayed a desire to evade the equitable reach of judicial power.' Boasberg gave the government until April 23 to explain the steps it has taken to remedy the violation, or to identify the person or persons who made the decision not to have the planes return. In a separate case, the federal government has acknowledged deporting Kilmar Ábrego García to the prison in El Salvador by mistake, but has no intention of returning him to the US despite a Supreme Court ruling ordering the government to 'facilitate' his release. The federal judge handling that case has said she is weighing whether to pursue contempt charges, and alleges that officials 'seem to have done nothing to help Ábrego García's release from custody and his return to the US.'

**US Government Faces Contempt Proceedings for Ignoring Judge's Order**
A federal judge, James Boasberg, has ruled that there is probable cause to consider the US government in contempt of court for deliberately ignoring his order to return migrant planes to the US. The order was issued in a case involving migrants sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The judge is giving the government the opportunity to remedy the violation before proceeding with contempt proceedings. The White House has announced plans to appeal. This is the latest confrontation between the government and the judiciary, which has blocked several of Trump's executive actions on immigration and other issues. If the government chooses not to remedy the violation, Boasberg will proceed to identify the official or officials who made the decision not to order the planes to return. He may request written statements from the government, hold live testimony under oath, or refer the case for trial. According to Rory Little, a professor of constitutional law, the government could easily avoid being declared in contempt by returning the 200 migrants to the US. However, Boasberg has proposed a 'less intrusive method' for the government to comply with his order. The government may also face contempt proceedings in another case involving Kilmar Ábrego García, a man from Maryland who was sent to the prison in El Salvador by mistake. A judge in that case has said she is weighing whether to pursue contempt proceedings, stating that the officials 'seem not to have done anything to help Ábrego García be released and returned to the US', despite a Supreme Court ruling ordering the government to 'facilitate' his release.

**Federal judge finds 'probable cause' to hold Trump administration in contempt - a legal scholar explains what this means**
U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg has found 'probable cause' to hold members of the Trump administration in criminal contempt for disobeying his order to halt flights taking immigrants to El Salvador. Boasberg's decision was in response to the White House's willful disregard for his March 15 order. Amy Lieberman spoke with Cassandra Burke Robertson, a legal scholar at Case Western Reserve University, to explain the implications of Boasberg's decision. Robertson said that Boasberg is giving the administration until April 23 to respond, either by explaining the steps taken to return the individuals to U.S. custody or identifying the individuals who decided not to halt the transfer. If the administration does not comply, the court will investigate and may hold government officials in contempt, which could result in a term of incarceration or monetary sanctions. Robertson noted that it is rare for government officials to be held in contempt, but this case is significant because it shows the strength of the Constitution and the power of the contempt power.

**US Judge Finds Trump Administration in Contempt of Court Over Deportation of Migrants**
A federal judge, James Boasberg, has found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating his order to return deported migrants to the US from El Salvador. Boasberg warned that he may refer the case for prosecution if the government does not 'purge' its contempt by obeying his order voluntarily. The government could do this by returning those who were sent to prison in El Salvador in violation of his order 'so they can assert their right to challenge their deportation', Boasberg noted. If the Department of Justice refuses to prosecute the case, Boasberg said he will appoint another lawyer to process the contempt. 'The Constitution does not tolerate intentional disobedience of judicial orders, especially by officials of a coordinated branch that have sworn to defend it', he wrote. The move marks an escalation in a battle between the judicial and executive branches of government over the powers of a president to carry out key priorities of the White House. President Trump has asked for Boasberg's removal while the Department of Justice has accused the judge of overstepping his authority. Boasberg, who was nominated to the federal court by former President Barack Obama, ordered the government last month not to deport anyone under his custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Trump invoked the 1798 War Powers Act, claiming it was an invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. When informed that planes were already in the air headed to El Salvador, which agreed to house the deported migrants in a notorious prison, the judge ordered the planes to be returned to the US. But hours later, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele announced that the deportees had arrived in his country. The Trump administration argues that it did not violate any order, noting that the judge did not include the directive to turn back in his written order and said that the planes had already left the US when that order was issued. 'The Constitution does not tolerate intentional disobedience of judicial orders, especially by officials of a coordinated branch that have sworn to defend it', Boasberg wrote. The Supreme Court earlier this month overturned Boasberg's temporary order blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, but said that migrants must be given the opportunity to challenge their deportations before being deported. The conservative majority said that legal challenges must be taken in Texas, rather than in a Washington court. Boasberg wrote that although the Supreme Court found that his order 'suffered from a legal defect', that 'does not excuse the government's violation'. He wrote that the 'government's conduct betrayed a desire to evade the equitable reach of judicial power'. Mission failed Meanwhile, the Salvadoran government prohibited US Senator Chris Van Hollen from visiting a Salvadoran citizen who was deported by mistake, Kilmar Ábrego García, who remains in a notorious prison in the country. García was deported by mistake from Washington and is being held in a megaprisión in El Salvador, along with dangerous criminals. At his arrival, the Vice President of El Salvador, Félix Ulloa, told Van Hollen that he could not authorize a visit or a call with Ábrego, Van Hollen said, who is also a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 'Why should the government of the United States pay the government of El Salvador to imprison a man who was kidnapped illegally in the United States and who committed no crime?', Van Hollen said in a press conference. After Washington acknowledged that Ábrego was deported due to an 'administrative error', the US Supreme Court confirmed an order by Judge Paula Xinis to 'facilitate' his return. In a meeting with President Donald Trump in the White House on Monday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said that he had no plans to return Ábrego. Hours earlier, the US Department of Homeland Security declared in a judicial document that 'it has no authority to compel' Ábrego to return. On Tuesday, Xinis said she would not immediately accuse the government of contempt, but said there was no evidence that the Trump administration had tried to rescue Ábrego and that she would not tolerate 'tricks or showmanship'. 'The goal of my visit is to talk to people here about the release of Kilmar Ábrego García', Van Hollen wrote on X shortly after arriving in the Salvadoran capital. 'I told his wife and family that I would do everything possible to bring him home, and we will continue working on it until we achieve it', he added.

**'Stakes very high': Experts react as judge moves to hold Trump admin in contempt**
U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg ruled that 'probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt' for disobeying his order to turn around deportation flights to El Salvador. The judge stated that 'the Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders -- especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it.' Former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade said, 'The judge wasn't going to let this go.' The government can 'repatriate the deportees or turn over names for prosecution,' said Alex Nowrasteh, a Cato Institute vice president of economics and social policy. 'Get ready for prosecutions.' McQuade added, 'So, I think the stakes are very high for the Department of Justice. I don't think he's going to back down.' The judge can appoint a prosecutor to do it if the DOJ refuses to move forward with charges, which could lead to congressional oversight and potentially impeachment. This sets up a significant escalation between the judiciary and the executive at a time when the administration is already flirting with defying the Supreme Court.

**Judge Boasberg Threatens to Hold Trump Admin in Contempt of Court**
Judge James Boasberg has found 'probable cause' to hold President Donald Trump's administration in contempt of court for violating his order to turn back two deportation flights filled with illegal alien gang members. Boasberg wrote, 'The Court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given Defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.' The Supreme Court had previously vacated Boasberg's temporary restraining order, ruling that Trump has the authority to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport gang members. However, Boasberg stated that the Government's actions demonstrate a 'willful disregard for its Order,' and that the Constitution does not tolerate 'willful disobedience of judicial orders.' The Executive Branch has invoked the state secrets privilege and refused to provide further information in response to the Court's inquiry.

**What happens if a president and the federal government fail to follow a judge's orders?**
If a president and the federal government fail to follow a judge's orders, the judge can take action through civil contempt, which involves issuing an order holding the government or an officer in contempt. The judge can impose daily fines or jail time until the contempt is 'purged.' However, criminal contempt requires charges by the Justice Department, which the president oversees, making it a less viable option. A president can revoke criminal contempt by issuing a pardon, but civil contempt is not pardonable. According to Judge Paula Xinis, 'I've gotten nothing,' in terms of response or legal justification for not answering. The president cannot be held in contempt because they are not bound by court injunctions against the federal government. Local police and sheriffs could potentially enforce a contempt order, unlike the marshals who are responsible to the executive branch. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the subject, and appeals courts rarely uphold contempt findings. As the Supreme Court opinion states, 'The power of courts to punish for contempts is a necessary and integral part of the independence of the judiciary.'

**Should A Federal District Court Hold Contempt Proceedings While An Emergency Appeal Is Ongoing?**
A recent Supreme Court decision in Trump v. J.G.G. has raised questions about whether a Federal District Court should hold contempt proceedings while an emergency appeal is ongoing. The decision divested Judge Boasberg of jurisdiction to further adjudicate the matter and cast doubt on whether he could continue contempt proceedings against the executive branch. The article raises several other questions, including the reasons behind BlackRock's crypto assets drop, the drivers of record crypto M&A in Q1 2025, and the impact of Saudi Arabia's Hollywood plan failure. However, the main focus is on the Supreme Court decision and its implications for contempt proceedings.
