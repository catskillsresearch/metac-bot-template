**US Risks Losing 'Reliable Investment' Status, Allianz GI Manager Says**
According to Alex Bibani, a senior portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, the US may lose its status as a reliable investment destination due to Republican efforts to gut legislation supporting clean energy. Bibani stated, 'For investors, the message is clear: The US may no longer offer the reliable investment runway it did just months ago.' The decision to pass a tax bill that would repeal many of the incentives in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act threatens to upend investment strategies premised on the clean energy-transition. Bibani warned, 'Project economics, supply-chain commitments, and capital flows may now pivot toward more stable jurisdictions like Canada or the EU, unless clarity is quickly restored.' The S&P 500 Index fell last week, and the yield on 30-year US Treasuries rose as high as 5.1% as markets digested news of the Republican bill. President Donald Trump's escalation of the tariff war with the European Union also injected further uncertainty into markets.

**Egypt to Host Buran's $40 Million Carbon Capture Factory**
The General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAIFZ) has met with a delegation from Canadian company Buran, a leader in the development and production of carbon capture and gas processing technologies. The company plans to invest $40 million in a new factory to produce systems for recovering flare gas, separating carbon, and injecting the resulting gases into the national gas grid. Buran's CEO, Sam Slimi, said that the company's carbon capture and storage technology will enable companies that partner with them in Egypt to benefit from trading carbon credits on the Egyptian voluntary carbon market, in addition to significant economic benefits for the Egyptian market as a whole. The Egyptian government has launched a voluntary carbon market, and the company's technology will help reduce carbon emissions and provide job opportunities. GAIFZ Chairman Hossam Heiba highlighted the incentives offered to investment activities in Egypt, including tax and customs exemptions, ease of establishment procedures, and limited fees related to production operations. He also mentioned that the company's product will contribute to reducing carbon emissions, supporting Egyptian exporters in complying with the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which requires exporters to report their carbon emissions and provide a competitive price advantage if they have low carbon footprints.

**US EPA drafting plan to erase greenhouse gas limits on coal and gas-fired power plants**
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is drafting a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States. According to the EPA, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants do not contribute significantly to climate change, and eliminating them would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare. This move is part of the EPA's reconsideration of the previous administration's rule, which was seen as an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States. The EPA's plan is expected to be published after interagency review. The U.S. government under President Donald Trump has moved to remove federal spending related to climate change and eliminate regulations aimed at addressing greenhouse gas emissions. Trump's budget package would eliminate funding established under the Inflation Reduction Act and repeal grants intended to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

**Trump Tax Bill Passes House: What Clean Energy Stakeholders Need to Know**
The House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, which includes significant cuts to clean energy tax credits added under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The bill now heads to the Senate, where changes may be made to lessen the impact on the clean energy sector. Key changes include: the elimination of tax credits for clean energy generation and storage facilities that start construction after 60 days after enactment or are placed in service after 2028; the elimination of tax credit transferability under Section 6418 of many IRA tax credits; and the addition of rules that eliminate credits for projects funded by entities or constructed with components from certain prohibited foreign entities, including North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran. The legacy ITC and PTC under Sections 48 and 45 remain largely unchanged, but the bill shortens the runway for geothermal heat pumps to claim the Section 48 ITC. 'It remains to be seen whether and to what extent changes made by the Senate will lessen the impact on the clean energy sector,' said a statement. 'The bill adds a complicated set of rules that eliminate credits starting next year for projects funded by entities or constructed with components from certain prohibited foreign entities,' according to the bill. 'The bill also eliminates the production tax credit for sales of electricity produced at qualified clean hydrogen facilities beginning next year,' the bill states.

**What’s in Trump and Republicans’ giant tax and immigration bill?**
President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have introduced a massive bill that would reshape the federal government and the US economy. The bill includes new tax cuts, massive spending on border security, cuts to social safety net programs, and pullbacks on investments to fight climate change. Key provisions include extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, increasing the standard deduction, cutting Medicaid spending, quadrupling the state and local tax deduction, and making states pay for SNAP. The bill also includes a border wall, new taxes on colleges and universities, savings accounts for newborns, and no tax on tips, overtime, or car loan interest. Additionally, it includes billions for defense, including Trump's 'Golden Dome' continental missile defense system, and repeals the Biden student loan forgiveness program. The bill would save $295 billion over 10 years by repealing the program and making other changes to loan repayments. The legislation would also gut elements of Biden's signature 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and eliminate a federal tax credit for buying electric vehicles. Republicans are trying to move quickly to reverse many of President Joe Biden's legislative accomplishments and cement Trump's legacy in the tax code, on the southern border, and in generations-old anti-poverty benefits.

Bibani said, 'For investors, the message is clear: The US may no longer offer the reliable investment runway it did just months ago.' The decision to pass a tax bill that would repeal many of the incentives in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act threatens to upend investment strategies premised on the clean energy transition. Even if the Senate blocks some of the House proposals, European asset managers still face uncertainty and volatility that may force them to turn elsewhere, Bibani said. 'Project economics, supply-chain commitments, and capital flows may now pivot towards more stable jurisdictions such as Canada or the EU, unless clarity is quickly restored,' he said. The bill is 'worse than feared' for investors committed to energy transition strategies, according to equity analysts at Jefferies. If passed, a repeal of the IRA 'would mark a sharp reversal in US clean-tech policy', Bibani said, injecting 'significant regulatory and political risk into the market'. The S&P 500 Index fell last week, and the yield on 30-year US Treasuries rose as high as 5.1 per cent as markets digested news of the Republican bill. Tyler Christie, a former BlackRock executive, said the concern is that 'extreme volatility in US policy is creating uncertainty that's rippling through the financial system'. He added that European policy is 'more aligned and predictable than ever' as it tackles 'existential challenges around energy, security and resources'. The upshot is that asset managers are directing more capital into European projects where they can see policy is more consistent and reinforced by fundamental demand, Christie said.

**Live at 1 p.m. ET: Climate and Energy in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill – The Climate Realism Show #158**
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the budget reconciliation bill, also known as Donald Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill', which includes tax cuts and rolls back many of the 'green' energy and climate policies imposed by the Biden administration via the Inflation Reduction Act. The bill is expected to be passed by reconciliation, which is how the IRA was enacted and can also be repealed. Republican leadership plans to pass the bill, possibly as early as Memorial Day. Trump's executive orders are also expected to scale back EPA climate efforts, as stated by President Trump and confirmed by U.S. EPA staff. The Climate Realism Show will discuss the good, bad, and disappointing aspects of the Big Beautiful Bill, as well as the Crazy Climate News of the Week, on May 23, 2025, at 1 p.m. ET.

**Minister says Canada needs 'infrastructure that gets our energy to tidewater' at Calgary meeting**
Canada's new energy and natural resources minister, Tim Hodgson, called for the development of infrastructure to export oil and gas to tidewater and trusted allies, and pledged to be a voice for Alberta and Western Canada at the cabinet table. He emphasized the need for 'one project, one review' to fast-track approvals and reduce red tape. Hodgson also championed the Pathways Alliance's proposed carbon capture project, which aims to capture carbon dioxide from 13 oilsands sites in northern Alberta and send it to an underground storage site. However, experts such as Richard Masson and Martin Olszynski noted that the federal government still needs to establish certainty for investors, particularly with regards to a potential cap on oil- and gas-sector emissions and uncertainty around carbon credits. Hodgson's speech suggests a willingness to discuss and adjust current policies, but it remains to be seen how the government will balance its goals of reducing emissions and exporting energy.

**Moment of truth nears on green credits, climate cuts**
A group of Republican lawmakers, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) and Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), have introduced the 'Certainty for Our Energy Future Act' to phase out solar and wind incentives, disqualify companies tied to foreign adversaries, and continue the practice of 'transferability.' The bill aims to 'safeguard both our energy independence and our taxpayers' by responsibly phasing out subsidies for technologies like wind and solar. However, the issue remains unsettled, with some lawmakers calling for the preservation of certain Inflation Reduction Act provisions, including the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (48E), the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (45Y), and the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (45X). Others, like Rep. Julie Fedorchak, are lobbying to phase out wind and solar investment and production credits in favor of technologies like nuclear, carbon capture for fossil fuels, and geothermal.

**Trump's CCS Policy Shift: Oil Industry Gains, Tech Sector Seeks Natural Carbon Capture**
After taking office on January 20, 2025, US President Trump adjusted the policy and funding for carbon capture and storage (CCS). According to a survey by DIGITIMES, the oil industry has received Trump's support, and the layout of the affected areas is relatively small, further forming a CCS industry cluster in the Gulf of Mexico, creating a significant profit opportunity. The technology industry, on the other hand, is worried that Trump will reduce or revoke subsidies, so it is seeking natural carbon capture methods, aiming to pursue corporate carbon reduction in the face of policy obstacles. The US has implemented a 45Q tax credit for domestic carbon dioxide since 2008, and in 2021 and 2022, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) were passed. BIL invested $3.5 billion to build four Direct Air Capture (DAC) regional centers, while IRA increased the 45Q tax credit from $50 per ton to $180 per ton, promoting companies' willingness to invest in CCS. ExxonMobil and Chevron, two major oil companies, have focused on reducing their own carbon footprint, cooperating with fertilizer manufacturer CF Industries, investing in low-cost technologies from Svante and ION Clean Energy, and deploying overseas CCS projects. They have also combined CCS technology with natural gas power generation to provide low-carbon electricity to meet the increasing electricity demand of AI data centers. Additionally, the two oil giants have chosen to set up CCS plans in coastal states along the Gulf of Mexico, forming a CCS industry cluster in the Gulf of Mexico, which overlaps with the DAC regional centers and CCS deployment locations under BIL, indicating that the region is a high-carbon production industry hub that urgently needs carbon capture support. Microsoft and Google have benefited from the IRA's expanded 45Q tax credit policy, purchasing large quantities of DAC carbon capture and establishing the carbon removal alliance Symbiosis and Frontier to promote carbon removal technology. In the face of Trump's new policy uncertainty, the two tech giants have laid out afforestation, enhanced rock weathering, and biochar to diversify their operating risks. DIGITIMES believes that Trump's support for the oil industry will continue to provide space and time for CCS to play a role in the US, and although BIL and 45Q policy subsidies may face revocation in the future, they will prompt the technology industry to explore multiple paths for carbon reduction, enriching global carbon reduction solutions.

**Treasury Department Releases Final Regulations Applicable to the Hydrogen Tax Credits**
The US Department of the Treasury has released final regulations for the hydrogen production tax credit under Section 45V and the investment tax credit for hydrogen production facilities under Section 48(a)(15). The Hydrogen Tax Credits, passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, incentivize the production of low-carbon hydrogen. The Final Regulations make material changes to the proposed regulations, including adding exceptions to the requirement that electrical power used to produce hydrogen must be from new generation sources. The regulations also eliminate the requirement that renewable natural gas (RNG) originate from the 'first productive use' of the relevant methane. Hydrogen producers can rely on the version of the GREET model in effect at the time that the hydrogen production facility began construction. The future of the Hydrogen Tax Credits is unclear, with a full repeal or expansion of the regime possible under the Trump administration.

**Is Trump On a Collision Course with Energy Companies?**
Industry officials praised the Trump administration's deregulatory moves, but expressed concerns about the uncertainty created by the administration's policies. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said, 'Swinging from one extreme to another is not the right policy approach.' He emphasized the need for consistent and durable policy, citing the long-term capital allocation of his company. Meanwhile, Cheniere CEO Jack Fusco praised the administration's 'fair and transparent' approach, but expressed hope that the agenda would 'hold up in a rule of law.' The industry is also worried about the potential repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes tax incentives for technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Occidental Petroleum CEO Vicki Hollub said, 'We're looking for the continuation of 45Q,' a tax credit for carbon capture, to accelerate the technology and improve energy independence.

**Strange bedfellows unite to kill carbon capture credit**
Reps. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) have introduced legislation to repeal the 45Q tax credit, which incentivizes energy companies to capture and store carbon dioxide. Perry, a climate change skeptic, called the credit 'wasteful' and said it 'subsidizes technologies that serve no purpose beyond distorting energy markets.' The 45Q tax credit is considered one of the least imperiled climate-friendly energy incentives from the Democrats' 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

**Efforts to put carbon dioxide underground face less support in Trump's second term**
Under President Donald Trump, efforts to put carbon dioxide from power plants and industrial facilities underground may face less federal support and enthusiasm. However, experts and industry advocates doubt demand for the technology will go away as long as utilities face state-level climate change goals. Despite Trump's vow to 'drill, baby, drill' for fossil fuels and his administration's criticism of zero-carbon goals, carbon capture has deep support in Republican Wyoming, where it is seen as a way to protect the state's coal industry. Analyst Rohan Dighe with Wood Mackenzie notes that even without government rollback of funding, a broader trend away from 'environmental, social and governance' investing could sap momentum for carbon capture. The Carbon Capture Coalition, a group of over 100 environmental groups, unions, and companies, is urging Congress to uphold the '45Q' tax credit for carbon capture projects, which was included in the Inflation Reduction Act.

**Efforts to put CO2 underground face less support in Trump's second...**
The Trump administration's stance on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology may lead to less federal support and enthusiasm for the technology, but experts and industry advocates believe demand for it will persist due to state-level climate change goals. The technology involves separating carbon dioxide from power plant emissions and pumping it underground, either for permanent storage or to increase oil production. While some conservative groups and environmental organizations are skeptical of CCS, others see it as a middle ground between carbon-free energy production and fossil fuel use. The Carbon Capture Coalition, a group of over 100 environmental groups, unions, and companies, is urging Congress to uphold the '45Q' tax credit for CCS projects, which was included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Despite the challenges, the technology has gained traction in Republican states, including Wyoming, where Governor Mark Gordon has pledged to make the state 'carbon negative' through the use of CCS. Analyst Rohan Dighe notes that even without government rollback of funding, lower interest in decarbonizing could lead to fewer project announcements and movements. However, the technology has deep support in Wyoming, and Gordon is sticking with CCS to protect the state's coal industry. The future of the '45Q' tax credit is a concern for the Carbon Capture Coalition, which recently urged Congress to uphold it. 'In order for these American industries to really remain competitive, not only in domestic markets, but really in the global marketplace, their businesses really depend on investing in innovative solutions like carbon management,' said Madelyn Morrison, the group's government affairs director.

**90% of Linde’s current US clean hydrogen developments will be blue**
Linde's CEO, Sanjiv Lamba, revealed that up to 90% of the company's clean hydrogen projects under development in the US will be blue hydrogen. This decision is based on the company's bet on carbon capture tax credits, specifically the 45Q tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act. Lamba referenced President Trump's suspension of funds from key hydrogen supporting Biden-era legislation, indicating that the company is hedging its bets on the IRA's tax credit. This move comes as Linde reported a strong future demand with a $10.4bn project backlog and sustained profitability with a 29.5% adjusted operating margin.

**Proposed bill would repeal 45Z clean fuel production tax credit**
Representative Beth Van Duyne has introduced a bill to repeal the Section 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The credit supports the production of low-carbon transportation fuels, but critics argue that the initial guidance released by the Treasury Department falls short of expectations. The guidance has been met with mixed reactions from industry groups, with some praising the inclusion of climate-smart agriculture practices and others criticizing the lack of clarity on key details. The American Carbon Alliance and National Farmers Union have expressed disappointment with the guidance, while the American Soybean Association and National Oilseed Processors Association have welcomed the Treasury's notice of intent to propose regulation. The industry is urging the Treasury Department to finalize and publish guidance for the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Credit as soon as possible, citing the need for policy certainty and the potential for significant headwinds and business risks if the guidance is not published promptly.
