**Study sees lower chances of Milky Way crashing into Andromeda galaxy**
A new study suggests that the likelihood of the Milky Way colliding with the Andromeda galaxy in the next 5 billion years is less than 2%, and in the next 10 billion years is about 50%. The study, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, uses recent observational data and adds fresh variables to previous research. According to University of Helsinki astrophysicist Till Sawala, lead author of the study, 'The future collision - if it happens - would be the end of both the Milky Way and Andromeda.' The study also found that a merger between the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud is almost certain within the next 2 billion years, long before a potential collision with Andromeda. Sawala said, 'Collisions between stars are very unlikely, but the two supermassive black holes would sink to the center of the newly formed galaxy, where they would eventually merge.'

**The Milky Way was on a collision course with a neighboring galaxy. Not anymore**
NASA scientists had previously predicted that the Milky Way galaxy and its neighboring Andromeda would collide in four billion years, resulting in a 'makeover' of our solar system. However, new research suggests that this collision is unlikely to occur within the expected timeframe. According to Durham University Professor Carlos Frenk, 'we now know that there is a very good chance that we may avoid that scary destiny.' The study, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, found a 2 percent probability that the Milky Way and Andromeda would crash into each other over the course of the next five billion years. The researchers used 100,000 simulations of both galaxies based on the latest observational data from NASA's Hubble and the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescopes. Lead author Dr. Till Sawala explained, 'we also include the effect of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a dwarf galaxy that orbits the Milky Way. Its gravitational pull directed perpendicular to the orbit with Andromeda perturbs the Milky Way's motion enough to significantly reduce the chance of a merger with the Andromeda galaxy.' The results are a 'testimony' to the power of large supercomputers, according to Frenk.

**Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may not collide after all**
A new study published in the journal Nature Astronomy has cast doubt on the likelihood of a catastrophic collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies in 4 billion years. The team ran 100,000 simulations using the latest data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's Gaia space observatory, and found only a 2% probability that the galaxies will collide in the next 5 billion years. The study suggests that the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite of the Milky Way, may have a significant impact on the collision, and that the galaxies may pass each other at a large enough distance to continue evolving without colliding. As study co-author Till Sawala said, 'When we tried to start from the same assumptions as previous researchers, we recovered the same results. We've simply been able to explore a much larger space of possibilities, taking advantage of new data.' The team stresses that it is still difficult to make a precise prediction, but the new study does not imply a mistake to earlier calculations, but instead includes more variables into the simulations with newer data. As study co-author Carlos Frenk said, 'The Universe is a dynamic place, constantly evolving. We see external galaxies often colliding and merging with other galaxies, sometimes producing the equivalent of cosmic fireworks when gas, driven to the centre of the merger remnant, feeds a central black hole emitting an enormous amount of radiation, before irrevocably falling into the hole. Until now we thought this was the fate that awaited our Milky Way galaxy. We now know that there is a very good chance that we may avoid that scary destiny.'

**Supermassive Black Hole Destroys Star in Rare Cosmic Event**
Astronomers have observed a rare event in which a supermassive black hole destroyed a star while its galaxy merged with another. The event, classified as AT 2022wtn, occurred about 700 million light-years away in a small galaxy that is in the process of merging with a larger one. The black hole, with a mass of approximately one million suns, caused the star to undergo a process called spaghettification, where the tidal forces deformed and eventually disintegrated the star. Part of the star's remains formed a disk of incandescent plasma around the black hole, while another fraction was expelled at high speed, creating a visible gas bubble in various wavelengths. The data collected show an unusual luminosity behavior: the event maintained a constant brightness for about 30 days, followed by a rapid temperature drop. The spectra also revealed very defined emission lines of helium and nitrogen, which is rare in this type of event and has sparked great interest in the scientific community. 'Thanks to our follow-up campaign, we were able to propose an interpretation of the origin of the observed radiation: AT 2022wtn led to the rapid formation of the disk around the black hole and the subsequent ejection of part of the stellar material,' said Francesca Onori, from the National Institute of Astrophysics, to Space.com. The ejection of material was confirmed through the analysis of certain spectral lines that showed rapid propagation towards the outside. This dynamics reinforces the idea that the event not only generated an accretion disk, but also an expanding gas envelope that can contribute to modifying the immediate environment of the black hole. The study's results have been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and highlight their value in understanding how tidal disruption events are generated and evolve.

**NASA's Photo of the Day: The Remains of a Star in the Milky Way**
A spiral shape, like the one shown, is all that remains visible of a star in the Milky Way galaxy. Approximately 7,000 years ago, the star exploded in a supernova, leaving behind the Veil Nebula. At the time, the expanding cloud was as bright as a crescent moon and remained visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history. Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is only visible through a small telescope pointed towards the Cygnus constellation. However, the remaining Veil Nebula is physically enormous, covering over five times the size of a full moon, despite being 1,400 light-years away. The featured image, taken in Kuwait in mid-2024, shows light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue. Even in deep images of the complete Veil Nebula, such as this one, readers may struggle to identify the iconic filaments.

**Mysterious Celestial Object Emitted X-rays and Radio Waves Every 44 Minutes**
A mysterious celestial object, located at the heart of the Milky Way, has been discovered by astronomers. The object, named ASKAP J1832-091, emits X-rays and radio waves every 44 minutes, but its origin and nature remain unknown. According to Ziteng Andy Wang, researcher at the University of Curtin in Australia, the object could be a neutron star or a highly magnetized white dwarf, but it's also possible that it's something entirely new. The discovery was made possible by a chance observation by the Chandra telescope, which was originally observing the remnants of a supernova. The exact distance of the object is still uncertain, making it difficult to determine if it's related to the supernova or if it's evolving independently in a dense region of stars, gas, and dust. 'Our discovery doesn't solve the mystery, it deepens it,' said Wang. The discovery opens up two major avenues of research: either they're dealing with a completely unknown phenomenon, or they're observing an object that's already cataloged, but from a new angle.

**Astronomers Discover 14-Million-Year-Old Bubble with Possible Interstellar Tunnels**
Astronomers have discovered a 14-million-year-old bubble of hot gas surrounding our solar system, which could be connected to other regions of the Milky Way through 'interstellar tunnels'. The bubble, known as the Local Hot Bubble (LHB), has a canal of ionized gas that points towards the Centaurus constellation. The discovery was made by a team from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics using data from the eROSITA telescope. The analysis revealed a 3D map of the bubble, showing temperature variations and areas of lower density that were not previously identified. The team found a tunnel, a channel of hot gas that passes through the LHB and connects to a larger bubble in the Centaurus constellation. This is not a wormhole or a magical portal, but a physical opening that marks a route where gas can move with less resistance through the interstellar medium. This finding suggests that the LHB is not an isolated bubble, but part of a larger network of structures. The researchers already knew of a similar connection in the Canis Major constellation and suspect that these channels may be spread throughout the galaxy, forming a connected network of cavities and gas passageways. The LHB is a structure of ionized gas at temperatures exceeding a million degrees, capable of emitting X-rays. It surrounds the solar system like a cavity of low density and was shaped, according to current models, by a chain of supernovae that occurred 14 million years ago. The interest in this bubble is not new, but now, with the improved sensitivity of the eROSITA telescope, it has been possible to observe the interior with unprecedented detail. The 3D thermal map showed that the north galactic pole is colder than the south, and that the bubble seems to stretch towards the galaxy's poles, a pattern that coincides with old data from the ROSAT telescope. The key lies in the shape of the newly found tunnel, which is a kind of corridor where hot gas flows through a route of lower resistance, a kind of thermal passage that passes through the bubble and projects towards Centaurus. The team believes that these channels are formed by the combined action of supernovae, stellar winds, and young star jets, in a process known as stellar feedback.

**Astronomers Discover Almost Perfectly Spherical Supernova Remnant in the Milky Way**
Astronomers led by Miroslav Filipović from the University of Western Sydney have discovered a unique object in the Milky Way - a supernova remnant (SNR) with almost perfect spherical shape. The object, named 'Teleios' (meaning 'perfect' in Greek), has an official designation of G305.4-2.2. It is one of the most symmetrical SNR ever observed, with a roundness of 95.4%. Teleios has a diameter of 46 to 157 light-years, depending on the estimated distance to Earth - 7,175 or 25,114 light-years. Its unique shape, rare for SNR, may be explained by its location 2.2° below the galactic plane, where the interstellar medium is less dense. 'Typical supernova remnants are asymmetric due to the inhomogeneity of the explosion or the environment, but Teleios looks like it expanded in ideal conditions,' Filipović explained. Another mystery of the object is its 'invisibility' in most frequency ranges. Teleios emits only in radio waves with the presence of hydrogen lines (H-alpha), contradicting standard models. Most SNR are visible in optical, infrared, or X-ray ranges. Scientists suggest that this may be related to the object's age or low temperature of its material. The origin of Teleios remains unclear. Main hypotheses include a Type Ia supernova explosion in a binary system or a less destructive Type Iax supernova that leaves a 'zombie star'. However, the data do not match any model fully. Further studies are planned using new radio telescopes such as ASKAP and MeerKAT, which Filipović calls 'the golden age of radio astronomy'.

**Mysterious Object in the Milky Way: A New Discovery in the Universe**
Astronomers have discovered an unusual object in the Milky Way that is emitting X-rays and radio waves simultaneously, with a cycle that repeats every 44 minutes. The object, designated ASKAP J1832-091, was detected by chance by the Chandra X-ray Observatory of NASA while it was focused on a supernova remnant. According to Ziteng Andy Wang, author of the study published in Nature, 'it could be something exotic and unknown.' The object's distance is uncertain, making it difficult to determine if it is associated with the supernova remnant. Wang said, 'although our discovery does not resolve the mystery of what these objects are, it may deepen it.' The study suggests that there may be more of these objects in the universe, and that studying them could lead to a better understanding of their nature.

**Mysterious Celestial Object Discovered in Milky Way Galaxy**
A team of international astronomers has discovered a mysterious celestial object in the Milky Way galaxy. This object, named ASKAP J1832-091, emits radio signals and X-rays every 44 minutes and continues to do so during its active phase. Located about 15,000 light-years away from Earth, it is situated in an area with a high concentration of stars, gas, and dust. Scientists believe it could be an extremely magnetic dead star, such as a neutron star or white dwarf, or something entirely new. Dr. Jiteng Andy Wang from Curtin University in Australia said, 'It could be a known object that is behaving in a way that has never been seen before, or it could be something entirely new.' NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory had accidentally detected X-rays from this mysterious object last year while studying the remnants of a supernova. This is the first time a 'long-period radio transient', an object that emits radio signals for several minutes, has been seen to emit X-rays. The active phase lasted for about a month and then subsided. Scientists believe that there could be more objects like this in the universe, but they have not been detected yet. Wang said, 'Our discovery may deepen the mystery, but it brings us closer to two possibilities. Either we are discovering a new type of object, or we are seeing a known object behave in a way that has never been seen before.'

**Andromeda is coming right for us**
Astronomers have discovered two galaxies engaging in a cosmic duel, with one galaxy armed with a supermassive black hole. The galaxies are approaching each other at almost two million kilometers per hour, causing distortions in their gravitational fields and material to fall into the black hole. This results in intense bursts of X-rays and ultraviolet radiation, which disrupt the victim galaxy's ability to form new stars. The attacker's black hole is also likely to be damaging its own galaxy, but it is still expected to be the dominant entity in the merger. This phenomenon is a far cry from the graceful simulations of galactic collisions, and is more akin to cannibalism. The Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy similar in size to the Milky Way, is currently heading towards us at about 400,000 kilometers per hour and is expected to collide with the Milky Way in about 5 billion years, resulting in a large, elliptical galaxy. However, the Sun will have run out of fuel by then, making it unlikely that we will be around to see the collision.

**Hubble helps explore the wreckage of a supernova star explosion in a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way (image)**
Astronomers have used the Hubble Space Telescope to explore the wreckage of a supernova star explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The team, led by Rami Alsaberi of Gifu University, has presented new high-resolution images of the supernova remnant MC SNR J0519-6902 and made reliable measurements of its polarization and magnetic field. Alsaberi said, 'We have detected a faint structure on the northeast side of this supernova remnant that had not been observed before.' The team also identified a cloud of atomic hydrogen associated with the remnant. They suggest that MC SNR J0519-6902 is around 2,000 years old and is in the 'Sedov-Taylor phase' of its evolution, during which the blast wave sweeps up material from the surrounding gas and dust. Alsaberi said, 'MC SNR J0519-6902 is one of only four known young supernova remnants in the LMC with an estimated age of less than 2,000 years.' The team plans to observe it using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope to determine whether the atomic hydrogen cloud is associated with the remnant.

**A Terrifying Glimpse of the Milky Way's Potential Fate**
A team of international astronomers, led by the University of Christ in Bangalore, India, has published a study that questions the habitability of the Milky Way in a future, possibly also in a past before the birth of the Solar System. The study, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, examines a radio galaxy, designated 2MASX J23453268-0449256, which suggests that life in the Milky Way may be less secure than previously thought. 2MASX J23453268-0449256 is a large spiral galaxy, three times larger than the Milky Way, which can be observed as it was about a billion years ago with instruments like Hubble and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Hubble and ALMA revealed that 2MASX J23453268-0449256 had a particularly bright active nucleus and produced one of the largest radio jets ever observed in a spiral galaxy. The presence of such a jet is not expected in spiral galaxies, but is more commonly found in elliptical galaxies. The study suggests that the galaxy may have a supermassive black hole at its center, containing several billion solar masses. The discovery of the galaxy's jets, visible under the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India, may provide a terrifying glimpse of the potential fate of the Milky Way. The production of these jets is accompanied by significant emissions of cosmic rays, gamma and X-rays, which are detrimental to life as we know it on Earth. This discovery challenges the previous understanding that spiral galaxies are not capable of producing significant jets. The study suggests that the Milky Way may have been capable of producing such jets in the past and may do so in the future if its own supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, is fed with sufficient matter. Joydeep Bagchi, the lead author of the study, says, 'This discovery is more than just a curiosity: it forces us to rethink the evolution of galaxies and the development of supermassive black holes within them. If a spiral galaxy can not only survive but thrive in such extreme conditions, what consequences will this have for the future of galaxies like the Milky Way? Could our Galaxy one day experience similar high-energy phenomena, which would have grave consequences for the survival of precious life?'

**James Webb Space Telescope Captures Stunning Image of Galaxy NGC 2283**
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) captured an image of the spiral galaxy NGC 2283, showing its curved arms filled with stars and dense regions of hot gas and dust, in colors ranging from red to orange to yellow. The galaxy is 45 million light-years away from Earth, in the Canis Major constellation. The image shows a group of stars illuminating the surrounding hydrogen gas, which is the primary fuel for the formation of new stars. Nearby, there are powerful and deadly stellar explosions known as supernovas. The JWST used six images taken by the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) over 17 minutes to form the new image. The astronomers used different infrared filters to capture the galaxy's and stars' emissions. According to the European Space Agency (ESA), 'All the galaxies studied in this program are massive star-forming galaxies, close enough for individual star clusters and gas clouds to be visible.' A supernova Type II, SN 2023AXU, was observed in the galaxy for the first time on January 28, 2023. This type of supernova occurs when a star near the end of its life has at least eight times the mass of the Sun. The collapse of a star's core is the trigger for the explosions of material in its outer layers, from which new star formations will be constituted. With time, the enriched gas from the supernova is incorporated into new generations of stars. This completes the cycle of life of the gas and stellar stars in galaxies throughout the Universe. As the ESA concludes, 'While the process of star formation converts gas into new stars, supernovae complete the cycle. A supernova explosion can launch gas over hundreds of light-years, enriching the interstellar medium with elements like oxygen and sodium.'

**Astronomers Capture Rare Cosmic Event in Galaxy Similar to the Milky Way**
Astronomers have captured a rare cosmic event in a galaxy similar to the Milky Way, thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope. The galaxy, NGC 2283, is located 45 million light-years away from Earth and contains a unique star explosion. According to Space.com, the high-quality image shows a bright, starry arm in the center of the galaxy, reminiscent of the Milky Way's structure. The image also reveals a large number of young, bright stars that are clearly visible against the background. Scientists are studying the galaxy to gain a better understanding of the structure of the Milky Way, which cannot be seen in its entirety. As reported by Space, the image demonstrates the importance of such observations in understanding the formation of stars and galaxies in the universe. 'The water vapor plays a crucial role in creating stars, while supernovae mark the end of their existence,' said scientists from the European Space Agency. 'The explosions of massive stars release a huge amount of material into space, which eventually mixes with the interstellar gas and becomes the basis for the formation of new stars in molecular clouds.' In 2023, a supernova of type II was detected in the galaxy NGC 2283, which occurs when a star with a mass at least eight times that of the Sun dies. During this process, its core collapses, and the outer layers are scattered into space, providing material for the formation of new stars.

**The Supernova that Revolutionized Astronomy: SN 1987A**
On February 23, 1987, astronomers around the world observed an extraordinary event: a supernova exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way located about 168,000 light-years from Earth. Dubbed SN 1987A, this was the closest supernova observed in the last 400 years, offering a unique opportunity to study in detail the phenomenon of stellar explosion. 'This was a once-in-a-lifetime event,' said astronomers, who initially detected the event with telescopes in Chile and later confirmed it with observers worldwide. The supernova resulted from the death of a massive star, Sanduleak -69° 202, which collapsed in on itself, triggering an unprecedented explosion of energy. In addition to visible light, scientists also detected a flux of neutrinos, elementary particles emitted during the stellar collapse, confirming theories on nuclear fusion in supernovae. SN 1987A has allowed astronomers to better understand the life cycle of stars, the evolution of chemical elements in the universe, and the role of supernovae in the formation of nebulae. Even today, its remnant is studied to reveal new secrets of the universe.

**NASA telescope captures the most detailed glimpse yet of the black hole in the middle of our galaxy**
NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured the most detailed glimpse yet of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. According to Northwestern University's Farhad Yusef-Zadeh, the black hole, Sagittarius A*, is 'always bubbling with activity and never seems to reach a steady state.' The team observed the black hole multiple times throughout 2023 and 2024 and noticed changes in every observation. They found that the event horizon of the black hole is emitting a constant stream of flares, which are expected to happen in all supermassive black holes, but the uniqueness of this black hole lies in its constant activity. The researchers believe that two minor and major disturbances generate the short bursts and longer flares they observed. They hope to use the telescope to observe Sagittarius A* for a longer period of time to reduce noise and see features that were unable to be seen before. 'When you are looking at such weak flaring events, you have to compete with noise,' Yusef-Zadeh said. 'If we can observe for 24 hours, then we can reduce the noise to see features that we were unable to see before. That would be amazing.'

**A Vibrant 'Rose' of San Valentín: NGC 2040 Captured by Gemini South Telescope**
The Gemini South telescope has captured a vibrant and fiery 'rose' of San Valentín, NGC 2040, a young star cluster within the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. According to NOIRLab, the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, the image shows 'the dramatic story' of the life, death, and rebirth of stars. The nebula surrounding NGC 2040 is 'a pulsating rose' in shades of red, orange, and yellow, as explained by NOIRLab. The image is one of the sharpest ground-based long-exposure photos of NGC 2040 without using adaptive optics, a technique to counteract the distortion caused by the Earth's atmosphere. The cluster contains over a dozen O and B-type stars, which live for only a few million years before exploding as supernovae. The energy released by these massive stars fuels the formation of NGC 2040's structure, while the expelled material seeds the next generation of stars.
