**Minister Yumaklı Announces Completion of TARSİM Damage Assessment Works**
Agriculture and Forestry Minister İbrahim Yumaklı stated that the damage assessment works under the TARSİM program will be completed within 10 days, and the damages will be paid in June and July. Yumaklı said, 'We will see the completion of TARSİM's work within 10 days, hopefully. In June and July, these damages will be paid. For uninsured producers, we will also cover the expenses of registered producers in the ÇKS until the date of the frost event.' Yumaklı attended the seed distribution ceremony at the Il Agriculture and Forestry Directorate, which was organized within the scope of the Effective Use of Agricultural Lands Project (TAKE). He stated that the zirai don event, which occurred at the beginning of last month, mainly affected the districts of Yeşilhisar, Yahyalı, Develi, and İncesu, where apples and pears were affected. Yumaklı emphasized that the damage assessment works in all provinces under TARSİM are ongoing, and that they will complete these works within a short period of time according to the damage rates.

**Moscow's Autonomous Metro Project to Conclude in 2026**
Moscow's Deputy Mayor for Transport, Maxim Liksutov, announced that the city plans to complete the pilot project for autonomous train movement in the metro by 2026. The project will start this year with test runs of the 'Moscow-2020' train without passengers. The goal is for the train to operate independently, stopping, opening and closing doors, and controlling the doors to ensure no one is trapped. Liksutov stated, 'The set of functions handled by artificial intelligence will gradually increase. By the end of 2026, we plan to reach the final stage of testing.' Mayor Sergei Sobyanin previously announced that the first autonomous train may be launched on the Big Circle Line as early as 2025.

**Federal database that tracked costly weather disasters no longer being updated**
The Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters project, a database that tracked costly weather disasters in the US, is no longer being updated. The database, which was maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), logged 403 events between 1980 and 2024, with a total estimated cost exceeding $2.9 trillion. Experts in the disaster and climate change communities lament the loss of the database, citing its unique ability to compile data from proprietary and non-public sources. Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, said, 'It was a tremendous service.' Daniel Swain, climate scientist with the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, added, 'It was kind of a unique program that's going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to replace.' The database's discontinuation is attributed to agency restructuring and budget cuts, which have led to a reduction in staff and a shift in priorities. 'It comes down to many people who have left, myself included, combined with reducing the scope of data products and services,' said Adam Smith, the climate scientist who was NOAA's lead scientist for the disaster program.

**NOAA to retire its public database meant to keep track of costliest climate change-related disasters**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced on May 8, 2025, that it will cease tracking the financial impact of weather events linked to climate change, including floods, wildfires, heat waves, and hurricanes. According to NOAA, 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes, NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) will no longer be updating the Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters product.' The decision comes as weather-related disasters continue to escalate in both intensity and financial toll. Meteorologist Jeff Masters from Yale Climate Connections expressed concern over the loss of NOAA's dataset, describing it as the 'gold standard' for evaluating disaster costs. Kristina Dahl of Climate Central warned that the removal of this resource would make it more difficult for the public to recognize the growing impact of climate change, further reducing safety in communities affected by extreme weather.

**Newsom asks lawmakers to fast-track Delta tunnel project**
California Governor Gavin Newsom is asking state lawmakers to pass a trailer bill to fast-track the Delta Conveyance Project, a $20 billion, 45-mile long tunnel through the Delta. Newsom has called the project 'key to the state's climate adaptation' as it faces a 10 percent reduction in water supplies by 2040. He aims to finish the project's permitting by the end of his term in early 2027. Newsom has sought to show off his efforts to increase water storage and supplies in the state. However, environmental and tribal groups are fighting the project, citing concerns about habitat loss and construction impacts, and have filed a petition asking the State Water Resources Control Board to cancel the hearing if more information about the project's historic water use is not provided.

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has announced that it will discontinue its Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database, which has been tracking extreme weather events since 1980. The decision comes amid significant budget reductions, particularly under the Trump administration, which proposed a 25% reduction in NOAA's budget for 2026. NOAA stated that the database will be 'retired' with no updates beyond 2024, citing 'evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes.' The cuts aim to end initiatives 'not aligned with Administration policy' and cancel satellite instruments 'designed primarily for unnecessary climate measurements rather than weather observations.'

**Court sets 4-month deadline for rollout of upgraded criminal tracking network | Chennai News - The Times of India**
The Madras High Court has directed the Tamil Nadu director-general of police and the home department to complete the CCTNS 2.0 project, a real-time digital crime and case tracking system, within four months. The court also ordered monthly review meetings to monitor implementation and ensure real-time digital tracking of compliance with court orders. Justice A D Jagadish Chandira stated that such measures are necessary to avoid repeated complaints from litigants over non-compliance. The court noted that lack of accountability and frequent transfers hindered timely action in a case where an accused was arrested over two years after a high court order. Inspector K Uma Maheswari arrested the accused and filed the final report, now before the Egmore metropolitan magistrate. The court said, 'With stereotypical affidavits filed by the officials, the lack of accountability and frequent transfers hindered timely action.' The court also highlighted that between 2022 and 2024, 610 contempt petitions were filed in criminal matters, with 485 relating to investigation and filing of final reports.

**Tracking SCRD project progress to get simpler**
The Sunshine Coast Regional District (SCRD) has developed a reporting and prioritization tool to track project progress and simplify the process of finding out what's going on with current projects. The tool is a spreadsheet that lists approved projects with resourcing details, including monetary budget and assigned staff hours. A red line indicates the limits of the organization's current capacity, with projects above the line prioritized for implementation in 2025 and those below it formally deferred for reconsideration in 2026. Chief administrative officer Tina Perreault explained that as projects above the red line are completed, capacity is anticipated to free up for projects below the line to move up. The plan is to act as a tool for both board decision-making and operational execution, and an updated version of the workplan report is slated to be in front of directors every two months. Perreault said this might not happen when 2025 Q1 reports come forward in April, but she will be pushing for it to be available when 2025 Q2 results go to elected officials in July. The tool is expected to provide something that is not too cumbersome and highlight areas where attention is needed rather than going line by line through a couple of hundred different things.' Kelly Backs, committee chair and Area D director, was 'overjoyed' to introduce the item, stating, 'It is one of the best pieces I have seen in my two and a half years on the board,' and something that will help 'organize the organization.'

**Health NZ was using a single spreadsheet to track $28b of public money**
An independent report by Deloitte found that Health NZ was using a single Excel spreadsheet to track $28 billion of public money, which raised significant concerns due to its reliance on manual data entry and lack of error tracking. The report found that the spreadsheet was prone to human error, and financial reporting took 12-15 days to complete. Health NZ has admitted to the issues and agreed with all the report's recommendations, including implementing a solution to automate financial reporting. The agency has also acknowledged ineffective savings plans, with plans of over $500 million deemed 'ineffective'. Health NZ Commissioner Lester Levy stated that the agency is 'on a path to increased stability' with the release of the Health Delivery Plan, which sets clear milestones to achieve objectives by the end of 2026. Interim chief executive Dale Bramley said the agency will work to its health plan to ensure it's in the best possible shape. 'The delivery plan sets clear milestones to achieve our objectives by the end of the 2026 financial year and to drive better patient outcomes,' he said.

**These Redditors made a super simple website to track Trump's Project 2025 progress**
Two Reddit users, Adrienne Cobb and another user, collaborated on creating the Project 2025 Tracker, a website that visually tracks President Trump's progress on the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation's Project 2025. The tracker takes a big-picture approach, showing how closely Trump's second term aligns with the project's policy goals. Cobb, an archaeologist and administrator of the r/Keep_Track subreddit, initially created a spreadsheet to track the Trump administration's progress on Project 2025 initiatives, which gained traction on her subreddit. As Cobb said, 'The tracker is a way to visualize how closely the administration is following the Project 2025 blueprint.'

A new tracking site, created by Redditors, has revealed that President Donald Trump's administration has implemented over 36% of Project 2025, a 900-plus-page document outlining conservative goals to shrink federal bureaucracy and implement conservative ideology. The tracker, which monitors 297 objectives recommended by the Heritage Foundation, has found that Trump has achieved 88% of the objectives put before the Executive Office of the President. The tracker also highlights the administration's efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Education, and has deemed the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) fully finished by Project 2025. As one of the tracker's creators, rusticgorilla, explained, 'Today, his administration is stuffed full of Project 2025 contributors, and his executive orders are ripped straight from the playbook's pages.'

**Paris Climate Goals in Jeopardy: A Decade After the Agreement**
The Paris climate goals are in jeopardy, according to a recent report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The report warned of the need for massive measures to achieve the goals. The Paris Agreement was signed 10 years ago, on December 12, 2015, by 197 countries, aiming to limit global warming to below 2°C and ideally 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. However, the current trend suggests that the goals may be unachievable. Mojib Latif, a renowned German climate researcher, was quoted as saying, 'It's almost laughable that the world politics still holds on to the 1.5°C goal.' A study published in 'Nature Climate Change' in February 2025 found that the 1.5°C threshold may have been exceeded, with a probability of over 99%. The study was conducted by an Austrian-German expert team. The year 2025 has seen a series of record-breaking temperatures, despite the onset of the La Niña cooling phenomenon. The science has reported a never-before-seen acceleration of sea temperature rise from April 2023 to July 2024. Another research group reported that the cracks in the Greenland ice sheet are also increasing. The US has withdrawn from the climate agreement, with a one-year notice period, which is not surprising. According to the Climate Action Tracker, this would add an additional 0.04°C to the 2.7°C that the world is currently heading towards, even if all countries implement their climate protection plans. The UN deadline for submitting new climate goals has expired, and most countries have missed it. However, there is still hope that the new climate protection plans will be a step in the right direction and that the 10-year anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement will be a reason to celebrate.
