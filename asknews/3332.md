**Disney-Style Castle for Sale in England**
A castle reminiscent of Disney movies is up for sale in Bedford, England. The castle, built in 1992 by Deon Heiner, a wealthy construction entrepreneur, features towers, battlements, 40 rooms, and a mysterious underground tunnel. According to Leggo, the castle has 'a panoramic tower with windows to observe the view, and a subterranean area to give it a mystical touch.' The interior features marble columns, arched portals, and iron-forged windows, with five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and a kitchen with a double island. The castle also has secret areas, a system of tunnels, secret doors, a refrigerator room, and a safe. The castle is being sold for 12 million euros, which has been described as a 'convenient discount.' Walt Disney's castle in the movie 'Sleeping Beauty' was inspired by a medieval manuscript called 'Les Très Riches Heures,' which was created in 1410 by three French painters. Disney also used the manuscript to create the surrounding landscapes and environments in the movie.

**Historic Building in Seville to be Transformed into Five-Star Hotel**
The historic building of Aníbal González, located at the intersection of Trajano and Amor de Dios streets, will be transformed into a five-star hotel by September, according to sources from the project. The hotel, which will have 28 rooms, will be designed by interior designer Lorenzo Castillo and will feature a careful decoration. The building, which has been abandoned for over two decades, was once a cinema called Sala X and has been declared a Bien de Interés Cultural. The hotel will also have a theater on the ground floor, a characteristic that was preserved in the original plans. The building was constructed between 1920 and 1923 and has a total surface area of 2,700 square meters. During the construction of the hotel, remains of a 16th-century hospital and a 19th-century cemetery were found. The hotel will be operated by Cristine Bedford, a company that already runs hotels in Mahón, Menorca, and Málaga. 'We are excited to bring this historic building back to life,' said Cristine Bedford. 'We will preserve the original architecture and add a touch of luxury to make it a unique experience for our guests.'

**Military jury convicts Fort Stewart soldier of rape, sexual abuse of a child**
Army Spc. Blake E. Bedford, 27, was convicted of rape and sexually abusing a child at his court-martial on May 27. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison, reduction in rank to E-1, and a dishonorable discharge. The crimes occurred between July 2021 and November 2022 when the victim was between 6-8 years old. Bedford admitted to the abuse during an interview with Army CID agents on March 7, 2024. Lt. Col. Amanda Beckham, prosecutor, stated, 'Analyzing the evidence gathered by well-trained and experienced Army CID agents, understanding what happened to the victim, and conveying that evidence to a military panel is critical to any case, especially a case involving a child victim under 12.' Bedford will serve his sentence at the United States Disciplinary Barracks and will be required to register as a sex offender upon release.

**Lenggries: 2200-year-old Elk Skeleton to be Exhibited in Heimatmuseum**
A 2200-2300 year old elk skeleton, discovered in the 1980s by Josef Wasensteiner in a cave between Lenggries and Kreuth, is set to be exhibited in the Lenggries Heimatmuseum. The skeleton is considered the most complete found in Bavaria. Researchers led by Kerstin Pasda from the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität in Erlangen-Nürnberg found a projectile wound and cut marks on the bones, indicating that humans hunted the elk. This is the first evidence of elk hunting in pre-Roman times within the current borders of Bavaria. The community of Lenggries has agreed to display the skeleton, and the costs of further examination will be determined. Josef Wasensteiner, who discovered the skeleton, hopes that it will be displayed in the museum, saying 'If nothing happens, it will be forgotten.' The discovery is significant, especially in the context of other elk finds in the region, including a 9,290-year-old elk skull fragment found in the Walchensee and a 1,110-year-old elk antler found in Bad Heilbrunn. According to Christoph Mayr, the elk was likely hunted and only the most valuable parts were taken, as the complete skeleton would have been too heavy to transport.

**The Revival of the Doctrina Monroe: A Threat to Latin American and Caribbean Sovereignty**
The Doctrina Monroe, a policy of US foreign relations, has been revived by the current administration, with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth calling for the US to regain influence in its 'backyard'. Experts say this is a return to a previous era, when the US intervened in Latin America and the Caribbean under the guise of 'values universals'. However, under the Trump administration, the US is now openly pursuing its own interests, without justifying its actions with moral or international law considerations. The Doctrina Monroe was first introduced by President James Monroe in 1823, and has undergone several reinterpretations over the years, including the 'Corolario de Roosevelt', which authorized the US to intervene in Latin America if its interests were perceived to be threatened. The current administration's approach is seen as a return to the 'Corolario de Roosevelt', with a focus on US interests and a disregard for international law and moral considerations. The US has a long history of intervention in Latin America and the Caribbean, dating back to the 19th century, and has used various justifications for its actions, including the 'Destino Manifiesto' and the 'Corolario Olney'. However, under the Trump administration, the US is now openly pursuing its own interests, without justifying its actions with moral or international law considerations. The current situation is seen as a threat to the sovereignty of Latin American and Caribbean countries, and has sparked protests and opposition in several countries, including Panama, where the US is seeking to regain control of the Panama Canal.

As plans are still in the early stages, some details may change before the park's opening in 2031.

**Empresa de Ómnibus de Don Antonio Vaz Tourem: A Look Back at its History**
The Empresa de Ómnibus de Don Antonio Vaz Tourem operated a daily service from Salto to Rincón de Valentín in 1946. The company initially had two buses with license plates Nro. 112 and Nro. 178. According to the Expediente Nro 582 of 1952, a BEDFORD bus with license plate Nro. 178 was added to the line, and the following year, Don Vicente Limongi requested permission to remove bus 112 from the line, but it was later reinstated. In 1957, the Consejo Departamental authorized the transfer of a CHEVROLET bus with license plate Nro. 174 to Don Antonio Vaz Tourem. In 1959, the Consejo Departamental authorized the registration of a SEDDON bus with license plate Nro. 220, which had a capacity for 30 seated passengers, in favor of the Empresa de Transportes de Pasajeros de Antonio Tourem.
