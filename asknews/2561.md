**Meta Exploits Trump Presidency to Boost Military Business: Now Selling Glasses to the Army**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has announced its intention to create virtual and augmented reality devices for the US military, aimed at 'transforming the way combatants see, perceive, and integrate battlefield information'. Meta has partnered with the technology startup Anduril to present a joint offer to the Pentagon and secure a contract with the US administration that could be worth up to $100 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. The two companies are already working on Eagle Eye, a helmet with integrated sensors that, thanks to artificial intelligence, promises to improve soldiers' vision and hearing and grant them 'greater lethality, mobility, and situational awareness'. This alliance will reunite Zuckerberg with Palmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril and Oculus, which Meta acquired in 2014 for $2 billion. Luckey was fired from Facebook in 2017 due to internal and external pressure after his open support for Donald Trump. 'I was fired for making a $9,000 political donation to a group opposing Hillary Clinton's candidacy,' he confirmed to Bloomberg last year. Ironically, now it's Zuckerberg who has extended an olive branch to the US president with measures ranging from data verification removal to content moderation on Facebook and Instagram. After his departure, Luckey founded Anduril, a young defense technology firm that has managed to carve out a significant niche as a US government contractor in just eight years. The company, named after the mythology of The Lord of the Rings, sells surveillance towers equipped with AI to Customs and Border Protection, drones to the Marines, and combat aircraft to the Space Force. Its current value could reach $28 billion. Luckey, known for his unconventional look in the industry, has assured that his dismissal was not Zuckerberg's decision. 'When all the people who conspired to get rid of me have been fired from the company, what could possibly bother me?' he explained this week on the podcast 'Core Memory'. The coalition with Anduril solidifies Meta's military pivot, a recent strategy aimed at securing lucrative government contracts and increasing its business with public funds from the US administration. In recent months, the company has recruited former Pentagon officials and a former Trump advisor to boost its ambitions, according to Forbes. Last November 4, a day before the presidential elections that confirmed Trump's return to power, the company announced that it would put its AI models at the service of government agencies dedicated to national security. Defense contractors, from giants like Lockheed Martin to technology firms like Palantir or Anduril, will also be able to access its AI, dubbed Llama. Although its policies explicitly prohibit the use of this technology for military or war purposes, Meta has made an exception to feed the US and its major intelligence partners: Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. However, the alliance between the technology industry and the military is not new. In fact, Silicon Valley, the industry's mecca, cannot be understood without the injection of public money that since the late 1950s has allowed the development of technologies like semiconductors, crucial for the army but also for consumer electronics that has defined the last half-century. That symbiosis remains alive. Giants like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon already provide their cloud services and infrastructure to the US military, but also to countries like Israel, which has sparked protests over their role in the genocide against the Palestinian population in Gaza. Others, like Palantir, have put their surveillance tools at the service of the location and deportation of irregular immigrants. Even OpenAI, the AI startup responsible for ChatGPT, has joined this trend, also with Anduril. They all have one thing clear: if you want an endless source of income, go to the Pentagon.

**Gateway: A New Era of Space Exploration**
Scientists are proposing a new era of space exploration, with the lunar-orbiting station 'Gateway' serving as a key element. The station, which will rotate around the Moon, not the Earth, offers new possibilities for missions to Mars and the mysterious dwarf planet Ceres. According to researchers, 'Gateway' can be a 'transit hub' for missions to other planets, allowing for more efficient use of resources. The station will also serve as a testing ground for technologies that will be used in deep space missions. The researchers, Malaya Kumar Biswal and Ramesh Kumar V., propose a combined mission to Mars and Ceres, which would allow for the optimization of resources and the exploration of two objects in one 'journey'. The planned timeline is between 2040 and 2050. However, the researchers acknowledge that the realization of such ambitious plans is fraught with difficulties, including risk management, significant financial investments, and the need for a major technological breakthrough. Nevertheless, the creation of 'Gateway' is a bold step towards establishing a sustainable infrastructure for deep space exploration. An international consortium, including NASA, ESA, JAXA, CSA, and the UAE Space Centre, is already working on the first modules of the station, with the energy and living modules scheduled to be sent to the Moon in 2027.

**Meta Seeks to Enter Military Industry through Partnership with Anduril**
Meta is seeking to enter the military industry through a partnership with 'Anduril', as part of a comprehensive plan by the US military to update its wearable equipment, with an estimated total budget of $22 billion. The contract, worth around $100 million, has not been officially awarded yet. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, stated that this technology 'will protect our interests at home and abroad', highlighting the strategic importance of this partnership. Palmer Luckey, co-founder of Oculus VR, which was acquired by Meta, expressed his support for the partnership, saying 'Using Meta's massive investments in XR tech to support our military will save lives and money'. This collaboration between Meta and Anduril marks a return to the spotlight for Luckey, who was fired from Meta in 2017 after donating $10,000 to an anti-Hillary Clinton PAC. However, it appears that Luckey's relationship with Zuckerberg has improved, as he joked 'I finally got all my toys back'. Luckey also emphasized the importance of collaboration between tech companies and the military, stating that he believes the world needs to transition from being a 'global police force' to a 'global arms dealer'. Anduril is one of the leading emerging companies in the defense industry, having secured government contracts worth $6 billion globally, and has expanded its partnerships with Silicon Valley giants, particularly during Trump's administration, which Luckey openly supports.

**Meta Enters Defense Services Market with Anduril Partnership**
Meta, a social media giant, has officially entered the defense services market by partnering with Anduril Industries to develop military AR/VR devices. This collaboration is significant as Palmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, was previously fired by Meta in 2017. Luckey was the co-founder of Oculus, which was acquired by Meta in 2014. Meta has invested around $80 billion in various reality technologies since then, with its Reality Labs department still operating at a loss. The company expects the military market to generate a return on investment. According to Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, 'Meta has spent the past decade building AI and AR technologies to realize future computing platforms. We're honored to be working with Anduril to bring these technologies to the American military, who protect our domestic and overseas interests.' Luckey expressed his positive attitude towards re-cooperating with his former employer, stating, 'I'm thrilled to be working with Meta again. In the realm of dual-use technologies that can change America for the better, this is one of the most exciting ones. My mission has always been to turn warriors into tech wizards, and the products we're developing with Meta are exactly that.'

**Trump Withdraws Nomination of Isaacman as NASA Head, Deal Blow to Elon Musk**
A surprise turn of events has dealt a setback to Elon Musk. Trump had nominated a close friend of the tech billionaire, Isaacman, as the new head of NASA, but Trump has now withdrawn his nomination. Trump did not comment on the reasons for his decision, but it is believed that Isaacman's past donations to the Democratic Party and his close ties to Musk may have been factors. Musk is stepping down as a special envoy to the US government. This comes at a bad time for Musk, as the US government plans to cut NASA's budget by a quarter and reduce its staff by a third. The government also plans to redefine NASA's mission, with a focus on missions to the moon and Mars. This is important for SpaceX, which is developing the Starship rocket, capable of carrying up to 100 tons of cargo and potentially enabling a manned mission to Mars in a few years. Musk aims to send a million people to Mars by 2050. However, SpaceX has faced repeated setbacks in the development of the Starship, including a recent test flight that ended in a crash in the Indian Ocean. Musk remains undeterred, and has outlined an ambitious plan for a Mars mission, including a unmanned flight in 2026, a crewed flight in 2027, and the establishment of a Mars station in 2029, with the help of Optimus robots built by Tesla.

**Meta and Anduril Collaborate on EagleEye Project for US Army**
Meta, led by Mark Zuckerberg, is developing military augmented reality (AR) devices for the US Army in collaboration with Anduril, a company founded by Palmer Luckey, the creator of Oculus. The project, called EagleEye, aims to create modern AR/VR headsets for American soldiers, enabling them to navigate the battlefield more effectively, see more, react faster to threats, and work in complex conditions. The headsets will be 'smart' devices with AI support, various sensors, and the ability to connect to other military systems. This project is part of a $22 billion initiative by the US Department of Defense to digitally modernize the army. Microsoft previously developed similar headsets, but the military was dissatisfied with their quality. Meta and Anduril aim to do better. This is a new direction for Meta, which has not previously developed military technologies. However, the company is now trying to enter the defense market to develop its technologies and attract new funding sources. As reported by OBOZ.UA, US President Donald Trump has announced the construction of a 'Golden Dome' missile shield to protect the country from rocket attacks. He has already signed the relevant order. Additionally, the US has successfully tested a hypersonic missile using a marine launch technology. The Pentagon confirmed that the new cold gas start method will make hypersonic missiles safer to launch from ships. The hypersonic missile was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

**🔥Meta Is Opening More Stores To Sell Vr Headsets, Smart Glasses, And The Future. Turns Out The Metaverse Wants A Street Address.**
Meta is planning to open more physical stores to showcase its VR headsets, smart glasses, and wearables. The company believes that seeing is believing, especially when it comes to the future of tech. The move is part of Meta's long-term goal to bring spatial computing into the mainstream. Currently, Meta has a single physical space in Burlingame, California, where customers can test its products. The plan is to expand to more stores, cities, and ways to explore Meta's technology. This move is also about controlling the narrative and shaping the in-person experience around its own hardware. With the rise of emerging tech, Meta is betting that an in-person space can close the gap between consumers and its products. There is no timeline yet for new store launches, but this expansion signals that Meta is taking its hardware seriously.

**I took my Meta Quest 3 on a 3,000-mile flight so you don't have to - here's what I learned**
The author took their Meta Quest 3 on a 3,000-mile flight to test its in-flight entertainment capabilities. While the headset provided a great experience, including a superb viewing of Avengers: Endgame in 3D, the author encountered several issues, including limited software selection, battery life concerns, and space constraints. The author suggests that VR headsets are ideal for shorter flights, but may not be practical for longer journeys due to these issues. However, the author notes that the in-flight experience could be improved with upgrades such as more subtle motion controls, a bigger in-built battery, and a simpler way to find and download movies.

**Meta's Reality Labs Reports $4.2 Billion Loss, Accumulating Over $60 Billion in Losses Since 2020**
Meta's Reality Labs division, responsible for Virtual and Augmented Reality, has reported a significant loss of $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, despite a revenue of only $412 million. This is a decrease from the $3.85 billion loss in the same period last year. Since the end of 2020, Reality Labs has accumulated a total loss of over $60 billion. The division is developing VR headsets, such as the Quest series, and the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which are central to CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plans to create a new digital platform that combines virtual and augmented reality. Critics on Wall Street question whether and when the massive investments in the metaverse will lead to a profitable business model. Additional pressure comes from the US government, with new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, which could increase production costs for VR and AR devices and affect end-user prices. Meta is also facing internal restructuring, including layoffs at Oculus Studios, a development team within Reality Labs that produces content for VR headsets. A spokesperson explained that the affected teams will be restructured to work more efficiently on future mixed-reality experiences. Despite the setbacks, Zuckerberg remains committed to his vision and continues to invest heavily in the metaverse, even if economic success has not yet materialized and is not foreseeable.

**Meta's head of Oculus Publishing used GDC to debunk your 'theories' about VR profitability**
Chris Pruett, Meta's Director of Games and head of Oculus Publishing, addressed developer concerns at GDC 2025, debunking 'theories' about plummeting Quest sales and revealing a major audience for the (unannounced) Meta Quest 4. Pruett said that paid apps are still the majority of revenue on the platform, and that the shift to free-to-play in-app payments has not stolen money from customers who used to buy critically acclaimed Quest titles. Instead, the old VR guard isn't spending as consistently as it used to, and the new customer base skews younger and prefers 'meme games' to emotional AAA titles. Pruett also announced that Meta is hiring more people to improve the Quest Store, and that developers need to find alternative ways to reach audiences, not simply hope they stand out by quality and old successes. He pointed to internal Meta data that the opened app store and Horizon Worlds push in the mobile app decreased Quest Store profits by '<1%' and '3%,' respectively, while overall store profits climbed by 12% in 2024. 'Our commitment to continuing to grow the ecosystem is unwavering, but we're learning in real time,' Pruett said. He urged developers to get in touch with Meta and share their experiences and expectations, and he remained optimistic that the Quest space will continue to evolve and grow -- not just become a kid-dominated space where some devs can't profit.

**The Quest for General Artificial Intelligence: A Double-Edged Sword**
According to a survey by the Future of Humanity Institute, the median estimate for when General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) will be achieved is around 2040, although opinions vary widely. A Metaculus survey of nearly 1,500 predictors expects it to be achieved by 2030. The pursuit of AGI has become the new space race of the 21st century, with companies, governments, and experts worldwide competing to develop an AI that can equal or surpass human capabilities. However, the question remains whether humanity is close to achieving this milestone and whether it is prepared for its potential consequences. Miguel López, director for the South of EMEA at Barracuda Networks, shares this view: 'Achieving General Artificial Intelligence is a complex and ambitious goal. While we will undoubtedly see significant progress, achieving a complete AGI in this decade could be overly optimistic.' The current state of AGI is that it is closer than ever, but still far away, with major tech companies investing heavily in its development. However, Europe seems to be lagging behind, with López stating: 'Currently, our role in this technology is basically that of a mere consumer.' The European Union's investment in AI research and development is estimated to be only 3,200 million euros, compared to the 20,000-30,000 million euros invested by the US and China. The article also highlights the need for global coordination to ensure the safe and beneficial development of AGI, as well as the potential risks and consequences of its creation.
