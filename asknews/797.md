**Puerto Rico Adds 10 Municipalities to State of Emergency Declaration**
The Puerto Rican government has added 10 municipalities to the list of areas declared in a state of emergency due to the heavy rainfall that began affecting the island on April 19. According to Secretary of Public Safety, General Arturo Garffer, the decision was made after reviewing official documentation and conducting site visits to affected areas. The added municipalities are Adjuntas, Barranquitas, Camuy, Carolina, Cayey, Hormigueros, Maricao, Morovis, Sabana Grande, and Yauco. Garffer stated, 'We have been in the field, seeing the damage and listening to municipal leaders. Our work is to ensure that each community receives the necessary support without delays.' The 10 new additions bring the total number of municipalities under the Executive Order 2025-022 to 27. Garffer also mentioned that the Department of Public Safety is continuing to evaluate requests from other municipalities that may be incorporated in the coming days. Governor Jenniffer González Colón stated, 'This process (of including more municipalities) has been rigorous, based on evidence and direct contact with mayors and mayors, who know firsthand the realities of their communities.'

**Puerto Rico's Governor Defends Statehood and Promises to End JSF and LUMA Energy Contract**
Puerto Rico's Governor Jenniffer González reiterated her support for the island's 'statehood', or annexation to the United States, during her State of the State address. She emphasized that 'as governor, I will make sure that Puerto Rico becomes a state of the US,' and encouraged the public to 'fight for it.' González referred to the four non-binding consultations held on the island, which have favored 'statehood', a goal she described as 'not just a goal, but a right.' However, the US government under Donald Trump has shown no interest in approving a binding referendum on the island or granting 'statehood.' The governor also promised to end the presence of the Fiscal Oversight Board (JSF) in the island and the contract with the electricity operator LUMA Energy, two issues that the population strongly rejects. González stated that 'with a clear vision of what we want, and the right decisions, Puerto Rico will be able to leave the non-elected organism (the JSF), imposed by our colonial condition.' The JSF was imposed by the US Congress to restructure the island's massive public debt and oversee its public finances. The governor acknowledged that during the nearly 10 years the JSF has supervised the island's public finances, 'the path has been hard and full of lessons' that the government and society must ensure not to repeat. González emphasized that her administration's priority is to end the JSF's presence in the island and begin the transition towards a new era. To achieve this, she stressed the need for 'fiscal and budgetary discipline,' approving balanced budgets like the one already executed. The new fiscal year budget, which begins in July, has a 1.5% increase for a total of around $13.1 billion. The energy crisis, 'the greatest challenge' González also addressed the energy crisis, which has caused frequent power outages, including two general ones in the past months. She emphasized that 'LUMA is going,' referring to the private operator in charge of electricity transmission, as the 'greatest challenge' and the most urgent problem for the government is the energy situation. 'Our people deserve an electricity grid that works, that doesn't fail every time it rains,' she asserted, adding that the Executive is working 'with urgency and commitment' to address this issue. To reassure the public about the fears of a summer of power outages, González stated that the state of the generation system is 'much better' than in the summers of 2020-2024.

**Fact-checking Jenniffer González's Claims on Puerto Rico's Power Generation System**
Jenniffer González claimed that Puerto Rico's power generation system for the summer of 2025 is significantly better than it was from 2020 to 2024. According to González, the addition of Unit 5 in San Juan and the combined cycle of Central Aguirre will increase the system's capacity to approximately 3200 megawatts, which is enough to meet the current demand. González also stated that the upcoming entry of Unit 2 of Central Aguirre (400 megawatts) and Unit 4 of Central Palo Seco (200 megawatts) will further increase the system's capacity by 600 megawatts, bringing the total capacity to approximately 3800 megawatts. González emphasized that this will significantly reduce the likelihood of power outages during the peak consumption season, allowing for a sufficient reserve to handle unexpected situations and implement a preventive maintenance program for the units in service. González said, 'This is vital for all of us living on this island, as it will allow us to have the necessary reserve, not only to handle any unexpected situations, but also to implement a proper preventive maintenance program for the units in service to maintain our economy and have electricity.'

**Half of world's population endured extra month of extreme heat due...**
Scientists have found that 4 billion people, about half the world's population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat due to human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025. The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems. According to the report, 'Although floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event.' The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change. 'It makes it feel impossible to be outside,' said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report. The report suggests strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient. However, without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.

**Counterintuitive Questions Raised by Recent DOE Electric Emergency Orders**
The US Department of Energy (DOE) has issued three emergency orders under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to address grid reliability issues in Puerto Rico and Michigan. The orders aim to ensure grid stability amidst challenges involving weather, infrastructure, and shifts in energy policy. In Puerto Rico, the orders require the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority to make available 34 fossil-fuel fired units for 90 days to promote grid reliability and to reestablish transmission rights-of-way by managing vegetation. In Michigan, the order directs the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Consumers Energy to keep the Campbell Plant available to operate for 90 days to address forecasted shortfalls. The orders reflect a cautious approach to promote grid stability and do not address the transition from fossil fuels. They are intended to address 'emergency' situations and have a longer-than-typical duration of 90 days.

**What to know about rumors cheating 'after signing marriage papers' will be illegal in 2026**
A claim has been circulating online that cheating on one's spouse after signing marriage papers will be illegal in 2026. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. In the U.S., 13 states and Puerto Rico classify adultery as a misdemeanor, while Michigan, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin consider it a felony. However, lawyers generally do not recommend pressing charges. The claim originated in South Africa, where adultery was not a crime in 2025 and people can no longer sue for damages based on adultery due to a 2015 Constitutional Court ruling. The article also clarifies that marriage is not a traditional contract that would fall under contract law, and that people generally cannot sue a partner for breach of contract if their relationship breaks down. The article cites various sources, including laws and court decisions, to support its claims.

**The Importance of Territorial Democracy in Puerto Rico: A Critique of the Joint Regulation 2023**
This summer, there will be public hearings on the regulation. It is the most important moment of the year to stop a model that normalizes displacement, speculation, and disconnection between the role and the country, writes David Carrasquillo Medrano. In Puerto Rico, the most important decisions about where we live -- what is built, what is preserved, what is turned into commerce or what is privatized -- are not always made with our participation. The Joint Regulation 2023, approved without public views and recently annulled by the court, exemplifies a form of governance that prioritizes so-called administrative agility over territorial democracy. As Ramon 'Tonito' Zayas notes, 'It was a great day' that the regulation was annulled, but the issue remains. The author argues that the regulation is a step in the wrong direction and that public participation is essential in decision-making processes.

**PAN to SNAP Transition 'Cuesta Arriba', Says Pablo José Hernández**
According to Pablo José Hernández, the transition from the Puerto Rico Assistance Program (PAN) to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is 'Cuesta arriba' (uphill). A Democratic congressman recently visited the Econo supermarket in Altamira to tour the store's shelves. This is not the first time that Puerto Rico has requested the extension of the SNAP program, which is the standard in all states and other territories like the US Virgin Islands. The previous administration, led by former Governor Pedro Pierluisi, advocated for and developed the Cuna de Talento program, which required PAN beneficiaries to work if they were able, similar to the requirements of the SNAP program.

**Jalisco Launches State Highway Plan 2025-2030**
Jalisco Governor Pablo Lemus Navarro presented the State Highway Plan 2025-2030, a comprehensive infrastructure strategy that includes the maintenance and renovation of 4,562 kilometers of state highways. The program will have an investment of over 24 billion pesos and will benefit the 125 municipalities in the state. The plan aims to improve connectivity between regions, reduce travel times, provide greater road safety, and strengthen the flow of goods. Prioritized works include the construction of a new 169-kilometer highway connecting the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area with San Martín de Bolaños, reducing travel time by over three hours. The Secretary of Infrastructure and Public Works, David Zamora Bueno, stated that there are currently 207 active conservation fronts in different regions of the state, employing over 5,000 workers and over 2,000 heavy machinery units, generating jobs and economic dynamism. The multi-year program will be divided into several stages, including diagnosis, bidding, execution, and maintenance, and will intervene in over 66% of the state's network. Additionally, an annual component will focus on the conservation of an additional 1,537 kilometers of secondary network, with actions ranging from signage installation to culvert cleaning and school crossing improvement. The state government aims to consolidate Jalisco as a national reference point in highway infrastructure, in line with its position as the country's fourth-largest economy and leader in agro-food, technological, and tourism exports.

**Puerto Rico Senate Approves Extension of Exemption on Income from Residential Rentals**
The Puerto Rican Senate has approved a measure to extend the exemption on income from residential rentals for 10 years, until 2035. This exemption, which is set to expire at the end of this year, aims to promote stability in the rental housing market in Puerto Rico. The measure, proposed by Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, amends the Law of Stimulus to the Real Estate Market (Law 132 of 2010) to extend the exemption for 10 years. According to the law, the exemption currently benefits 'any individual, succession, corporation, society, or trust, resident or non-resident of Puerto Rico, that rents a new construction property or a qualified residential property.' However, the measure does not exempt short-term rental income from taxes, as it recognizes that these rentals 'have a predominantly tourist use.' Rivera Schatz stated, 'While we understand that supplemental short-term rentals should be considered a commercial activity, we also believe that these are alien to the purposes established in Law 132. This is because the purpose of Law 132 was to benefit people who rent properties with the aim of establishing their residence in them.' The legislative measure passed the Senate with a positive report from the Senate Committee on Housing and Social Welfare. The report states, 'At present, just as when the Legislative Assembly passed Law 132-2010, Puerto Rico faces a severe problem of affordable housing, exorbitant construction costs, and high bank interest rates that significantly reduce access to housing for Puerto Rican families.' The report details that the committee received a favorable opinion from the Department of Housing and that it did not request comments from the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (CRIM) because the measure 'does not impose an economic obligation on the municipal governments' budgets.' The report also does not mention that an opinion was requested from the Treasury Department or other fiscal agencies. Senate President Jaime Barlucea stated that 'it would be destructive for the people of Puerto Rico' if the Legislative Assembly does not act before the benefit expires in December, and that 'maintaining the exemption until December 31, 2035, would allow us to mitigate the negative impacts of inflation until better economic circumstances are reached.'

**State by State: An Updated Roadmap Through the Current US Energy Storage Policy Landscape**
The US energy storage market has seen significant growth, with a record-setting third quarter of 2024 adding 3,806 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity to the grid. The market is expected to install another 74 gigawatts (GW) between 2024 and 2028. Currently, 23 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have 100% clean energy goals in place. Storage can play a significant role in achieving these goals by serving as a 'non-wires alternative' that can provide added reliability and grid services. Many states have adopted energy storage policies, including procurement targets, regulatory adaption, demonstration programs, financial incentives, and consumer protections. For example, California has set a target of 2,000 MW of energy storage by 2030, while New Jersey has set a target of 5,000 MW of energy storage systems by July 31, 2030. The most significant battery energy storage resource development has occurred in states that have adopted some form of incentive for development, including through utility procurements, the adoption of favorable regulations, or the engagement of demonstration projects.

**Proposal to Make Puerto Rico Independent Could Save US $617.8 Billion**
A proposal to make Puerto Rico an independent country has been submitted to the White House, claiming it could save the US $617.8 billion in federal spending. The proposal, which has been reviewed by at least two congressional members, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Rep. Tom McClintock, aims to provide Puerto Rico with the resources needed for economic self-sufficiency. However, the proposal has been met with skepticism by Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration executive director Gabriella Boffelli, who called it a 'conspiracy theory' and said that 'any secret suggestion of Puerto Rico's independence is not true, but rather misleading and a distraction from our current status.' According to a 2024 poll, 58% of Puerto Ricans want to become a US state, while only 11% want independence.

**Puerto Rico Seeks Statehood, Despite Trump's Lack of Interest**
The government of Puerto Rico has launched a campaign in Washington this week, hoping to become a US state, despite the lack of interest shown by the Trump administration on this issue. According to Puerto Rico's Governor, Jennifer González, 'The people of Puerto Rico continue to demand, clearly and unequivocally, to be granted the status of a state.' González pointed out that the majority of voters in Puerto Rico, in referendums held in 2012, 2017, 2020, and 2024, have expressed their desire to join the United States, with 58% of voters supporting the move in the latest referendum. However, this is not binding as it requires Washington's approval. In a recent interview, Elon Musk, the CEO of the Government Efficiency Department, stated that he decided to support Donald Trump's candidacy because the Democratic Party's leadership wants to turn Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. into states to gain control of the legislative body. González downplayed the importance of these statements, emphasizing that Musk was referring to California and Washington D.C., and that he 'mentioned Puerto Rico as an example.'

**Puerto Rico Intensifies Campaign for Statehood in the United States**
Puerto Rico's government has strengthened its campaign in Washington D.C. to become the 51st state of the United States. Despite the lack of support from the Trump administration, Governor Jenniffer González expressed the local government's firm stance in favor of statehood during the Puerto Rico Equality and Statehood Summit at the Capitol, according to EFE. González stated that the people of Puerto Rico have consistently expressed their desire to become a state of the United States, as confirmed in the non-binding consultations of 2012, 2017, 2020, and 2024, in which 58% of voters supported annexation. González emphasized that statehood is a firm goal of the Puerto Rican government and that she is committed to pursuing it, despite the obstacles, including the lack of interest from the Trump administration and the opposition from some politicians. She also mentioned that Elon Musk, director of the US Department of Government Efficiency, expressed support for Trump's candidacy, citing the Democratic Party's intention to make Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. states to gain control in Congress. However, González downplayed these statements and reaffirmed that Puerto Rico has a political balance that would allow it to advance towards statehood, regardless of the party in power in the White House.

US President Donald Trump has increased his expansionist rhetoric, aiming to convert Canada into the 51st state, but has forgotten about Puerto Rico, which has been under US control since 1898 and is seeking to define its future political status. The colonial situation of Puerto Rico is a major debate on the island, with those who opt for 'estadidad' (annexation to the US), those who advocate for independence, and those who prefer to maintain the current status of Associated Free State. Jorge Schmidt, a professor of Political Science at the University of Puerto Rico, explained that 'if we look from 1898, it is evident that in all the occasions in which any of the three branches of the US government have had the opportunity to express themselves officially, they have demonstrated an unequivocal interest in not making Puerto Rico a state of the union or a sovereign country.' Schmidt added that the US 'never had an interest' in defining a different status for the island, either economically or geopolitically, and that the intention of granting Puerto Ricans citizenship in 1917 was to keep them 'permanently under the US flag,' but not as a full-fledged state. The main obstacle for Puerto Rico to become a state is its large population living below the poverty line, which depends on federal funds, as well as the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural differences between the Caribbean island and the US. María de Lourdes Santiago, a senator from the Puerto Rican Independence Party, stated that 'the Americans benefit greatly from this ambiguous condition in the Associated Free State.' She criticized the fact that the island is a 'large consumer' of goods from the US, which arrive through the Jones Act, and lamented the approval of the Fiscal Oversight Board in 2016, which she considers 'an exercise of dictatorship' because it 'disappeared the fiscal autonomy of Puerto Rico.' Santiago also expressed doubts about the change of status, stating that Trump's interest in Canada is 'more an act of bravado than a legitimate intention' and that the fact that he does not mention Puerto Rico shows that 'the annexation of the island does not respond to any interest of that country.' 'It is a political project that has no possibility of future,' she emphasized.

**Puerto Rico as the 51st State: An Economic Powerhouse Waiting to Happen**
Making Puerto Rico the 51st state could be a 'slam dunk' for the U.S. economy, with billions in federal funding and job creation. According to the Government Accountability Office, Puerto Rico lost $2.9 billion in Medicaid funding in 2023 due to its territorial status. Statehood could also boost tourism, with the island's $9 billion industry potentially rivaling Hawaii's $20 billion. However, the article warns that Hawaii's statehood experience shows how economic gains can come at the cost of cultural identity, and that Puerto Rico's Spanish roots, Taíno heritage, and Afro-Caribbean soul must be protected. Governor Jenniffer González-Colón's GOP credentials and engagement with cultural icons like Bad Bunny could help sway Republicans and ensure buy-in from the 58% of Puerto Ricans who voted for statehood in 2024. 'Make it the 51st state, and watch it shine -- for itself, and for us all,' the article concludes.

**Puerto Rico governor's effort to eliminate renewable energy goals sparks pushback**
Puerto Rico's governor, Jenniffer González, has proposed a bill to eliminate the island's renewable energy goals, which aim to meet 40% of the island's energy needs by 2025 and 60% by 2040. Environmentalists and health officials are pushing back, citing concerns about the health impacts of burning coal and the lack of progress in transitioning to clean energy. The bill would also extend the operation of the island's lone coal-fired plant, which produces 20% of Puerto Rico's power, until 2035. Critics argue that the plant should be converted to clean energy, but there are no studies on the cost or viability of such a conversion. The governor has also announced a $767 million contract with Tesla to buy energy storage systems, which she says will help stabilize the island's power grid.

**Communities Oppose Proposal to Extend Coal-Burning Operation of AES Puerto Rico Plant**
Communities near the AES Puerto Rico cogeneradora in Guayama are questioning the proposal to extend the operation of the plant, which burns coal to generate electricity. The communities, including Los Jobos, Barrana, and San Felipe, are concerned that extending the plant's operation for another 10 years would be 'a death sentence'. José Cora Collazo, of the organization Acción Social y Protección Ambiental, stated, 'It was a hard blow for the communities. There is a lot of frustration, they are poor communities, and they don't have a way to go against the government or AES. They are tied up.' The Energy Secretary, Josué Colón, proposed extending the coal-burning operation until 2035, which would delay the implementation of the ban on coal-burning, set to take effect in 2030. Cora Collazo emphasized, 'The communities of Guayama are not in agreement because it would be sentencing us to death little by little.' The Comisión de Energía de la Cámara de Representantes will continue discussing the measure on Monday.

**Zar de Energía proposes extending coal use for electricity generation until 2035**
Zar de Energía, Colón, proposed extending the use of coal for electricity generation until 2035. In his proposal to the Legislature, he retained the language that allows the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau (NEPR) to postpone the implementation of the ban for five-year periods if AES production has not been replaced by new, cleaner, and more affordable sources. However, he suggested 'clarifying' that the goal of 100% renewable energy by 2050 should be achieved in terms of production to meet demand, not just as a percentage of generation. He also removed intermediate goals for clean energy sources, but proposed language to establish that these will be determined through the Integrated Resource Plan of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.
