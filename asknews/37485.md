**German Chancellor Confident US Will Increase Sanctions Against Russia**
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is confident that the US will follow the path of increasing sanctions against Russia. Scholz stated that the 18th package of sanctions against Russia is planned to be launched at the upcoming European Council in Brussels. 'At the G7 summit and during my previous visit to Washington, I especially advocated for the US to also strengthen their sanctions against Russia. This would contribute to the cessation of deaths, which President Trump calls for and which we all strive for. I remain confident that the American government will also follow this path,' Scholz said during a government statement before the Bundestag ahead of the NATO summit. The transmission was carried out on the Bundestag website. Earlier, on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, US President Donald Trump commented on the refusal to introduce sanctions against Russia, stating that the sanctions imposed by the US cost Washington 'huge' sums of money, billions of dollars. Trump emphasized that the EU authorities have not yet introduced new sanctions against Russia. He also noted that he is waiting to introduce sanctions against Russia in the hope of reaching an agreement on the settlement of the Ukrainian issue. On Monday, the head of EU diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, stated after the meeting of EU foreign ministers that the EU expects to approve the 18th package of sanctions against Russia by the end of the week. Hungarian Foreign Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Economic Relations Peter Szijjarto announced on Monday that Hungary and Slovakia have blocked the adoption of the 18th package of anti-Russian sanctions by the EU, as Brussels wants to ban Budapest and Bratislava from buying Russian oil and gas in parallel with its own rules. Russia has repeatedly stated that it will cope with the sanction pressure exerted by the West, which has been imposed on Russia for several years and continues to intensify. In Moscow, it was noted that the West lacks the courage to recognize the failure of sanctions against the Russian Federation. In Western countries, there have been numerous opinions that anti-Russian sanctions are ineffective.

**Hungary and Slovakia Block 18th Package of Sanctions Against Russia**
Hungary and Slovakia have blocked the 18th package of sanctions against Russia, citing a desire for cheap oil and gas. Both countries maintain warm relations with Moscow and continue to purchase Russian oil and gas. The European Commission proposed the new package of sanctions on June 10, targeting Russia's revenue from energy sources, its banks, and military industry. However, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico stated that Slovakia will not support the package if the European Commission does not find a solution to the situation Slovakia will face if it gradually stops importing Russian energy sources. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called on the EU to remove the proposal to ban Russian energy imports from the agenda, citing expected price increases after US bombings of Iran. According to a survey by the Razumkov Center, Hungary is the only European country perceived as hostile in 2025, with 52.0% of Ukrainians holding a negative view of the country.

**EU Prepares Record Sanctions Package Against Russia**
The European Union is preparing a record package of sanctions against Russia in response to its 'unbridled cruelty', said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot. 'Russia once again demonstrated its unbridled cruelty last night, intentionally delivering deadly missile and drone strikes on civilian targets,' he said before the start of the EU Foreign Ministers' Council meeting in Brussels. According to him, the Russian economy is increasingly suffering from 'a colonial campaign' led by dictator Putin for three years. 'The Russian economy's resources will be further depleted due to the sanctions package we will discuss today, which is likely to be the strongest since 2022. This will significantly increase pressure on Putin to agree to a ceasefire and start negotiations that will lead to a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,' he added. The EU hopes that the 18th package of sanctions against Russia will be adopted at the next European Council meeting, scheduled for June 26-27 in Brussels. Earlier, the media reported that the EU had reconsidered the decision to lower the ceiling on Russian oil prices, which was supposed to be a key measure in the previous package of sanctions against Russia.

**Canada Unveils Sweeping New Russia Sanctions Targeting Trade, Sanctions Evasion and Key Industries**
On June 13, 2025, the Government of Canada introduced three significant packages of amendments to the Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations, targeting trade, sanctions evasion, and key industries. The measures, announced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on June 17, 2025, represent a major escalation in Canada's economic pressure campaign against the Russian Federation. The amendments include new prohibitions on importing, purchasing, or acquiring certain Russian-origin goods, as well as exporting, selling, supplying, or shipping certain goods to Russia. The regulations also include 'prior contract' exceptions, which allow for transactions involving newly prohibited goods if they were entered into at least 60 days before the coming-into-force date of the relevant prohibition. The amendments add 116 individuals and entities to Schedule 1 of the Regulations, subjecting them to a full asset freeze and dealings ban. Canadian businesses with direct or indirect ties to Russia should review and update their sanctions compliance programs immediately, as the new rules have significant implications for a broad spectrum of industries.

**Slovakia Ready to Support 18th Package of Sanctions Against Russia, with Conditions**
Slovakia's Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar stated that his country is ready to support the 18th package of sanctions against Russia, but only if it 'does not have a negative impact on the economy'. Blanar emphasized that the Slovak government evaluates each package of sanctions based on whether it can harm the national economy. 'The negotiations are still ongoing, but based on what has been discussed so far, it is clear that the package will not have a negative impact on the Slovak economy, and we are ready to support it', said the head of the Slovak Foreign Ministry. However, Slovakia will request 'guarantees' and support to mitigate the consequences of disconnecting from Russian energy sources. 'There are also risks that will affect the Slovak Republic - possibly up to 20 billion euros. That's why we require guarantees regarding how these negative consequences will be eliminated', he added. Earlier, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó stated that Hungary and Slovakia oppose the proposed EU package of sanctions due to 'concerns about energy security'. The 18th package of sanctions against Russia, presented by the EU on June 10, includes a ban on transactions for Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, meaning that no EU operator can directly or indirectly participate in any transactions on these pipelines. On May 20, the EU approved the 17th package of sanctions against Russia, targeting almost 200 ships of the shadow fleet. On the same day, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that if Russia is threatened with additional sanctions, it may refuse to negotiate a ceasefire. Meanwhile, Senator Lindsey Graham stated that the US Senate is ready to vote on a bill imposing sanctions on Russia if there is no progress in negotiations on a ceasefire in the war between Russia and Ukraine within the next few days.

**Why the US and Europe are not intensifying sanctions against Russia**
The sanctions against Russia are indeed painful, but the US and Europe are not intensifying them, according to Igor Chalenko, a political scientist and head of the Center for Analysis and Strategies. Chalenko noted that if the US and Europe were to synchronize their actions, the Russian economy could collapse. Currently, Europe is implementing the 18th package of sanctions against Russia, but it cannot be adopted due to the actions of Hungary and Slovakia. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has extended his 'two weeks' warning to Putin for a month. This gives a boost to the Russian economy, but the effect of the already imposed restrictions will eventually hit the Russian economy, unless they take a serious step towards de-escalation. 'The question is in time,' Chalenko said. There were hopes from Volodymyr Zelensky that by June 2026, the Russian economy would suffer significant consequences due to sanctions. The West could have imposed even harsher restrictions on Russia, but they are stopping for one reason. 'They are not intensifying sanctions because of the logic that Trump and their European partners have voiced,' Chalenko said. 'They want to protect themselves from losses, deficits, and so on. It's strange to hear that. If the Kremlin has money, there will be war,' Chalenko added. It's worth noting that Europe has paid the aggressor country over $200 billion for various energy resources since 2022. Although they plan to stop importing gas from Russia by 2027.

**Hungary and Slovakia Block EU Sanctions Package Against Russia**
Hungary and Slovakia have blocked the new EU sanctions package against Russia, citing disagreements with the European Commission's plan to gradually phase out Russian energy sources by the end of 2027. The two countries have taken this step as they cannot block the EU's RePowerEU plan, which is a trade measure that requires a majority vote. Instead, they have 'taken hostage' the 18th sanctions package, which is a foreign policy measure that requires a unanimous decision. The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Kaja Kallas, stated that the goal is to adopt the sanctions package by the end of the week. Many in Brussels view the 18th sanctions package as very harsh, with some calling it the most severe yet. The package includes a ban on transactions related to the 'Nord Stream' and 'Nord Stream 2' pipelines, as well as the inclusion of 77 Russian tankers in the EU's sanctions list. Additionally, the package includes a ban on the import of refined petroleum products based on Russian oil, sanctions against 22 Russian banks, and 22 Russian and foreign companies that support the Russian armed forces. 'The Russian economy is suffering from a colonial war led by President Putin for three years, a war that is draining Russia's resources. These resources will be further weakened by the new sanctions package, likely the most extensive since 2022,' said French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. He believes that this package will significantly increase pressure on Putin and help achieve a ceasefire, leading to a lasting peace.'

**EU Sends Clear Message to Putin with New Sanctions Package**
The European Commission announced a new package of anti-Russian sanctions on June 10, aimed at limiting the export of energy resources, infrastructure, and the Russian financial system. These measures are intended to increase pressure on Moscow to stop the war against Ukraine. The sanctions include: The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, emphasized that the Russian economy has already been weakened by previous EU sanctions, and the new package will further undermine it. 'Russia continues to bring death and destruction to Ukraine. This war must end,' she said. The EU's High Representative, Josep Borrell, also called the war 'directly unlawful' and stated that Moscow must 'pay for its aggression.' The EU member states are expected to quickly agree on the new sanctions before the end of the month. The previous discussion has already taken place among EU ambassadors in Brussels. The sanctions also cover: Von der Leyen also provided economic statistics on the effect of sanctions against Russia. According to her, before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the aggressor country earned 12 billion euros per month on the export of energy resources to the EU. Now, this indicator has fallen to 1.8 billion euros. The last package of sanctions is the 18th to be agreed upon with similar measures being developed in the US, including Senator Lindsey Graham's initiative to introduce a 500% tariff on countries buying Russian energy resources.

Since the start of the Russian special operation in Ukraine in February 2022, the EU has implemented 16 packages of sanctions against Russia. After the 16th package of anti-Russian sanctions, approximately 2,400 individuals and organizations are under EU restrictions due to Ukraine.
