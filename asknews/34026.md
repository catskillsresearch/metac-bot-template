**Trump threatens Apple with 25% tariff to force iPhone...**
The author suggests that Apple can avoid a 25% tariff on iPhones by making efforts to on-shore manufacturing in the US. However, the process of setting up manufacturing processes in the US would take a minimum of 5-10 years. By that time, Donald Trump will likely be out of office, or Democrats may take control of Congress in 2026 and use their constitutional authority to impose tariffs. The author notes that Trump has previously threatened Apple with a 25% tariff to force the company to manufacture iPhones in the US.

**Trump Hints at Becoming 'Permanent' President, But Constitutional Experts Say He's Not Eligible for Third Term**
US President Donald Trump shared a video on his Truth Social platform, hinting that he will become a 'permanent' leader of the United States. However, according to the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, no person can be elected president more than twice. This means that Trump, who was elected president in 2016 and 2024, is not eligible to run for a third term in 2028. Constitutional experts consider any attempts to circumvent the 22nd Amendment, such as running for vice president and then taking over as president, to be legally questionable and likely unconstitutional. A proposed amendment to the Constitution, introduced by Republican congressman Andy Ogles in January 2025, would have allowed presidents who served two non-consecutive terms to run for a third term, but it requires the support of two-thirds of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states, making its passage unlikely.

**Trump Discusses Ways to Bypass Two-Term Limit**
Donald Trump has stated that there are ways to circumvent the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, which prohibits a president from serving more than two terms. Trump, who has not ruled out running for a third term, said that he is 'not joking' about finding a way to bypass the amendment. He mentioned that one possible way is for Vice President JD Vance to take the oath of office and then immediately resign, allowing Trump to take over. Trump also stated that 'many people want me to do this,' but added that 'it's still too early to think about it.' The 22nd Amendment requires a two-thirds majority in Congress or the approval of three-quarters of the states to amend the Constitution. Trump could potentially remain in office for a third and fourth term (until January 2037, when he would be 90 years old) due to a loophole in the Constitution, as described by the Daily Mail. This loophole allows a president to take office again if the previous president resigns or dies.

**US Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Plan to Reduce Federal Agencies**
A US federal judge ruled on Thursday that the Trump administration cannot reorganize the federal government and reduce its size without congressional approval. The judge, Susan Illston, agreed with a group of unions, non-profit organizations, and municipalities that mass layoffs of federal employees, which began last month, are likely unlawful and will cause widespread harm to citizens. The layoffs, which are part of a campaign by President Donald Trump and his advisor Elon Musk to reduce the government and cut spending, have already affected tens of thousands of federal employees. Illston blocked about 20 agencies from conducting mass layoffs for two weeks in May and ordered those who had already lost their jobs to be reinstated. She is likely to extend this order 'with some improvements.' Illston said at the beginning of the hearing, 'It is not lawful for agencies to make workforce reductions in a blatant disregard for congressional delegation, whether the President orders them to do so or not.' The Trump administration had asked the Supreme Court to block Illston's temporary order, saying she had overstepped her authority and infringed on Trump's constitutional power to control the executive branch. Andrew Bernhardt, a lawyer for the Justice Department, told Illston that federal agencies have broad authority to conduct layoffs and that Trump's executive order only asked them to identify potential reductions, without directing any specific actions such as layoffs or office closures. Over 260,000 federal employees, mostly those who received buyouts or will leave by the end of September, have already left their jobs, and large-scale reductions are planned in many agencies, including more than 80,000 positions in the Department of Veterans Affairs and 10,000 in the Department of Health and Human Services.

**Here Come the Judges**
The concept of a judicial system has been around as long as humans have been living in groups, as people disagree and want their way. The survival of a group depends on respecting a system to resolve disputes. The US Supreme Court recently decided that the Trump administration must stop deportations without sufficient notice and due process. Trump responded with a social media post, but the real issue is whether the decision is accepted as having the power of law. Trump stated he didn't know if he had to uphold the US Constitution, but relied on his lawyers. The majority of Americans believe in the rule of law and the Constitution, and that the three branches of government are 'co-equal.' However, when the President and Congress are from the same party, problems can arise. The Republican legislators are not objecting to many of Trump's executive actions, which are usurping powers belonging to Congress. This leaves the judicial branch to maintain the guardrails against Presidential power abuses. Over 150 retired judges criticized the administration's pattern of intimidation and retaliation against judges who ruled against their policies. They highlighted issues such as defiance of judicial orders, attacks on judicial independence, and misuse of presidential powers. These judges were speaking as guardians of the rule of law, not as proponents of liberal or conservative viewpoints. The phenomenon of 'midterm loss' has been a regular feature of US politics, where one-party control is disrupted by midterm elections. There's every reason to hope that 2026 will bring this disruption to the Trump administration, and slow the 'lawless juggernaut' of Project 2025.

**Trump Profiles Potential Successors Amid Speculation on Third Term**
In a recent interview with NBC News, US President Donald Trump ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term in the White House, which is explicitly prohibited by the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. Trump mentioned two key figures in his administration as potential successors: JD Vance, his current vice president, whom he described as a 'bright guy' who has played a crucial role in his government, and Marco Rubio, Secretary of State and Acting National Security Adviser, who has gained influence within the cabinet and has been key in US foreign policy. Trump emphasized that, although it's still early to define who could take over, the vice president usually has a natural advantage in the Republican nomination race. Trump prioritizes ensuring the Republican Party maintains its majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections and will have an active role in the electoral campaign and fundraising for Republican candidates. With his statement, Trump seems to be preparing the ground for a transition within the party, profiling Vance and Rubio as the main contenders for the presidential nomination in 2028.

**What is (and isn't) the Habeas Corpus - Factchequeado**
Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security, stated in a Senate hearing that the habeas corpus is 'a constitutional right that President Trump has to remove people from this country.' This is false. The habeas corpus is a legal recourse that allows a federal court to review the legality of a person's detention. In other words, it is the right of a detained person to ask a federal judge, 'Why am I in jail?' This guarantee applies to all people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, explaining that the habeas corpus is 'the legal principle that requires the government to provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning a person.' Without this protection, the government could arrest people, including U.S. citizens, and hold them indefinitely without cause. Hassan added that the habeas corpus is 'the fundamental right that separates free societies, like the United States, from police states, like North Korea.' Experts consulted by Factchequeado also explained that the habeas corpus is one of the tools that prevents a president from 'acting like a tyrant or king' and can 'disappear people without any legal process.' Noem, after hearing the explanation, stated, 'I support the habeas corpus,' but later said that the Constitution allows President Trump to 'decide whether to suspend it or not.' However, experts consulted by Factchequeado have stated that only Congress has the authority to suspend the habeas corpus. The U.S. Constitution does not define the habeas corpus specifically in its text, but establishes in Article I, Section 9, that this guarantee cannot be suspended, except in extraordinary cases.

**U.S. Supreme Court Authorizes Immediate Changes at Independent Federal Agencies**
The United States Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can remove leaders at independent federal agencies while they litigate the constitutionality of their removal. This decision, made on May 22, 2025, allows the President to replace agency leaders promptly, subject to narrow exceptions that must be fully litigated before they can be applied. The ruling does not decide the merits of the specific case, Trump v. Wilcox, but restrains lower courts' ability to enjoin allegedly-unconstitutional firings, expanding the President's authority to align federal agencies with his policy goals. According to the Court, 'the President's power to remove officials exercising executive authority is primacy, subject only to narrow exceptions.'

**Opinion: Stallings, LaRocco report to Idaho congressional delegation on town halls | Guest Column | postregister.com**
Stallings and LaRocco, in an open letter to the Idaho congressional delegation, report on their 11-town hall meetings held across the state from February 28 to May 3. The meetings centered on the US Constitution and the duty of elected officials to uphold their oaths of office. Attendees expressed deep concerns over the rule of law, due process, and the expansion of executive authority. They also questioned the use of the Alien Enemies Act and the growing number of constitutional questions before the courts. Stallings and LaRocco stated that Idahoans are in a constitutional crisis and that the delegation's avoidance of town halls has resulted in further isolation from the concerns of Idahoans. They criticized President Trump and Elon Musk for their actions, which they believe are corrupting the elections and undermining the Constitution. The letter also touched on issues such as the hacking of personal data, the misuse of executive power, and the impact of tariffs on farmers and small businesses. Stallings and LaRocco concluded that the town halls were centered on protecting democracy, the rule of law, and the Constitution, and that they were inspired by the patriotism and civic concern of Idahoans.

**Can Trump Negotiate Without Congress?**
The announcement of a 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs has sparked a long line of countries seeking to negotiate a reduction or elimination of these tariffs, according to the economic cabinet of Trump. However, the US Constitution establishes that Congress is responsible for international trade, making any commercial negotiation, particularly those affecting federal revenue, subject to Congressional approval. The USTR, Greer, has committed to keeping both Senate and House committees informed of the negotiations, but this may not be enough, as the law requires more. Without the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), negotiations with countries interested in modifying their reciprocal tariffs would be limited, and Congress could still impugn issues related to tariffs applied by the US, even if Trump justifies them as an emergency measure. Trump has stated that he aims to secure agreements with over 70 countries within the next 90 days, which could lead to other problems, as Bessent, an expert in finance, lacks the same objectives and knowledge as Greer and the USTR. If Trump continues to ignore Congress in commercial negotiations and proceeds without TPA, he could present the agreements for ratification or declare them Executive Agreements (AEs). In the first case, they might be approved, but they could be impugned when Trump loses control of Congress in 2026. In the second, the possibility of being impugned is greater because the Constitution attributes responsibility for commercial matters to Congress, not the Executive.

**Senate Republicans Introduce Bill to Limit Trump's Tariff Authority**
Seven Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Grassley, have signed on to a bill that would limit President Trump's authority to impose tariffs without congressional approval. The 2025 Trade Review Act would require the president to notify Congress and explain the reasons for new tariffs within 48 hours, and would also require an assessment of the potential impact on American businesses and consumers. The bill would also establish a 60-day sunset provision for new tariffs, unless Congress passes a joint resolution to approve them. Additionally, Congress could pass a joint resolution of disapproval to revoke the tariffs before the 60-day deadline. According to Grassley, 'It's time for Congress to reassert its authority over trade and tariffs. We've given the executive branch too much authority over interstate commerce and foreign commerce for too long. As the chairman of the Budget Committee, I've worked tirelessly to reassert Congress's constitutional role and ensure that Congress has a voice in trade policy.' Trump has already warned that he will veto the bill. Other lawsuits have also been filed challenging Trump's tariff authority, including one by the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), which was funded by Trump's Supreme Court adviser. The NCLA lawsuit argues that Trump does not have constitutional authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and seeks a court order declaring the tariffs unconstitutional and unenforceable.

**Trump threatens to veto Senate bill limiting his tariff power**
The Trump administration has threatened to veto a bipartisan Senate bill that would limit President Trump's authority to impose new tariffs or increase existing ones. The Trade Review Act of 2025, introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), would require the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of imposing a new tariff or increasing an existing one, and provide an explanation for the decision. The bill would also require tariffs to expire after 60 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution of approval. The White House budget office warned that President Trump would veto the bill if it were presented to him, stating that it would 'severely constrain the president's ability to use authorities long recognized by Congress and upheld by the courts to respond to national emergencies and foreign threats.' Sen. Grassley said, 'For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch. Building on my previous efforts as Finance Committee Chairman, I’m joining Sen. Cantwell to introduce the bipartisan Trade Review Act of 2025 to reassert Congress’ constitutional role and ensure Congress has a voice in trade policy.'

**Sure, Congress could stop Trump's tariff plan, but they won't**
Despite proposed bills to limit President Donald Trump's tariff plan, four political scientists told Business Insider that the bills are symbolic objections and are unlikely to pass. The bills, introduced by Republican Sen. Charles Grassley and Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, would allow Congress to vote to end any tariff at any time and require the president to provide Congress with 48 hours' notice before imposing new duties. However, the scientists said that even with Democratic support, the bills lack the votes to pass. Justin Crowe, a professor of political science at Williams College, said, 'There's virtually no chance, at least in the near term.' Justin Buchler, an associate professor of political science at Case Western Reserve University, noted that the Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to levy tariffs, but lawmakers have taken a less active role in recent years. The scientists expect Congress to wait for constituents to complain before taking action, with Patricia Crouse, a professor of political science at the University of New Haven, saying, 'The only real pushback may come if it costs Republicans seats in the 2026 election.'

**The hidden politics of whiskey prices**
Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) has sponsored a bill to prevent President Trump from unilaterally imposing tariffs on American consumers. DelBene argues that the president should not have the power to decide what tariffs get charged on which imports, and that Congress should have the final say. According to DelBene, 'When we talk about taxes and whether or not we raise or lower taxes, Congress has the authority there.' The bill would require Trump to get permission from Congress before using emergency economic powers to levy new tariffs. DelBene also sponsored a resolution to block the tariffs and cancel the economic emergency declared by Trump in early February. She says that the tariffs are 'a tax' and that the president is 'overstepping' his authority by imposing them on allies like Canada and Mexico. 'If the president, any president, wants to put in place such broad tariffs, they have to come to Congress and get approval from Congress. That's what the Constitution says,' DelBene says.

**Trump’s Secret Weapon: A Never-Used Constitutional Power That Can End Democrat Obstruction**
President Trump is considering using a rarely discussed constitutional power to end Democrat obstruction of his cabinet nominees. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution grants the President the authority to adjourn Congress in case of disagreement over adjournment timing. Trump could leverage cooperation from the Speaker of the House or Senate Majority Leader to request an adjournment of ten days, creating a dispute that would allow him to invoke his constitutional power. Once Congress is adjourned, Trump could fill his cabinet vacancies through recess appointments, bypassing Senate obstruction. While this move would likely ignite controversy, it would also put Senate obstructionists on the defensive and demonstrate executive resolve in the face of congressional gridlock. As Senator Brian Schatz has vowed to block Senate votes on Trump's cabinet nominees, Trump must take decisive action to ensure that his nominees are confirmed swiftly. Trump's advisor said, 'It is a bold constitutional maneuver that can end Democrat obstruction.'

**Trump's Executive Orders: Can He Get Away with It?**
US President Trump has been using executive orders to impose tariffs and bypass Congress. The question is: can he do this? According to Francesco Clementi, a constitutional law expert, the President has significant power under the US Constitution, but there are limits. The President cannot legislate on matters reserved to Congress, nor can he harm the prerogatives of the states. The use of executive orders has increased over the years, and Trump is producing a 'valanga' of them in his second term. However, these orders can be challenged in court, and some have already been suspended or blocked. The 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on US soil, is one of the potential grounds for challenge. Clementi notes that the Supreme Court may not uphold all of Trump's executive orders, and that the President's strategy is to use the courts to his advantage before the midterm elections in 2026.

**Spending freeze mess shows Trump’s pick isn’t right for OMB**
Russell Vought, President Donald Trump's pick to direct the Office of Management and Budget, has a track record of disregarding congressional authority and the rule of law. Vought, who has not yet been confirmed, has advocated for expanding executive authority at the expense of the legislative branch and has a history of diverting funds and defying congressional subpoenas. He has also been critical of Congress's constitutional power of the purse and has claimed that the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is unconstitutional. Vought's views on purging the federal workforce and his fixation on invoking impoundment powers are also concerning. Senators who back Vought are choosing to undermine their own institution and give away their power of the purse, according to The Washington Post. 'We are living in a post-Constitutional time,' Vought wrote in 2022, and his actions suggest that he is committed to further eroding the rule of law. 'We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,' Vought said in a 2023 speech, highlighting his desire to intimidate and demoralize federal employees.

**Trump Seeks to Expand His Power, Sparking Constitutional Crisis**
Just over a week after starting his second term, President Donald Trump is taking steps to maximize his power, causing chaos and what critics say is a constitutional crisis by challenging the separation of powers that has defined the US government for over 200 years. The most challenging measure of the new government came this week, when it announced that it would temporarily stop federal payments to ensure that they comply with Trump's orders that prohibit diversity programs. The directive, which sounds technical, had a huge immediate impact before being blocked by a federal judge, potentially removing billions of dollars from police departments, domestic violence shelters, nutrition services, and disaster relief programs that rely on federal funding. Experts say that the president is explicitly prohibited from cutting spending for programs that Congress has approved. The US Constitution gives Congress the power to assign money and requires the executive to pay it. A 50-year-old law known as the Budget Control Act makes this explicit by prohibiting the president from stopping payments in subsidies or other programs approved by Congress. 'What prevents the president from being an absolute monarch is that Congress controls the power of the purse strings,' said Josh Chafetz, a law professor at Georgetown University, adding that even a temporary freeze violates the law. 'It's what ensures that there is control over the presidency.' Democrats and other critics said that the measure was openly unconstitutional. 'What happened last night is the most direct assault on congressional authority, I think, in US history,' said Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine. While some Republicans were critical, most were supportive. 'I think he's testing the limits of his power, and I don't think any of us are surprised by that,' said Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota who has a close relationship with Trump. The Trump administration's actions have led to a cascade of legal challenges that argue he has exceeded his constitutional limits. A federal judge in Seattle has already blocked Trump's attempt to revoke birthright citizenship, calling it a flagrant violation of the nation's foundational legal document. On Tuesday, non-profit groups persuaded a federal judge in Washington to block the government's order to freeze spending until a fuller hearing on February 3. Democratic attorneys general also rushed to the courts to block the order. Raul Torrez, attorney general of New Mexico and a Democrat, said that the speed of the legal action against Trump's spending freeze demonstrates the 'imprudence' of the order. 'My hope is that the president, working with Congress, can identify his priorities and work through the normal constitutional order that is well-established to limit the power of presidents, Democrats and Republicans alike,' he said. The spending freeze -- officials described it as a 'pause' -- aligns with a long-sought goal of some of Trump's allies, including his nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, to challenge the constitutionality of the Budget Control Act. They argue that the president, as the person in charge of distributing funds, should have some control over how the money is distributed. Although it is clear that the new government wanted a battle in the courts over its power to control spending, experts agree that this was not the way they expected to present it. 'This is a really careless way of doing it,' said Bill Galston, of the Brookings Institution, adding that he thought it was an error of the government. 'This is just classic Trump. He thinks it's better to be fast and careless than slow and precise.' In his first press conference, Trump's new press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, on Tuesday urged organizations that need the subsidies to call the government and show how their operations are 'in line with the president's agenda.' 'It's the responsibility of this government to ensure, again, that every penny is accounted for,' Leavitt said. Republican lawmakers largely took the freeze calmly. 'This is not a big surprise to me,' said Representative Dusty Johnson of South Dakota during the Republican retreat at one of the president's golf courses in Florida. 'Clearly, Donald Trump campaigned in large part on the idea that the Biden government was putting a lot of money that was not compatible with Donald Trump's values.' But Democrats and others were furious over the measure, which seemed designed to undermine congressional authority. 'If President Trump wants to change the laws of our nation, he has the right to ask Congress to change them,' said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. 'He does not have the right to violate the Constitution of the United States. He is not a king.' Chafetz, of Georgetown University, said that the lack of resistance from Republican members of Congress was especially alarming because the legislative branch is the one most at risk in the last game of power. Even if Trump loses the legal battle, Chafetz said, he and his followers might feel like they've won by taking things this far. 'Damaging the institutions they don't like,' he said, 'seems to be all their theory of government.'

**Susan Collins calls Trump’s federal aid freeze ‘far too sweeping’**
U.S. Sen. Angus King called the Trump administration's order to freeze all federal aid 'blatantly unconstitutional', while Sen. Susan Collins said it was 'far too sweeping'. The order, issued by acting Director Matthew Vaeth, aims to align federal loan and grant awards with President Trump's priorities, which include targeting transgender rights, environmental justice, and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The freeze could affect everything from medical research to Medicaid and 'food stamps', with an estimated $5.2 billion in federal funding to the state of Maine alone. Collins expressed concern about the impact of the order, which she believes will disrupt 'a lot of important programs'. King called the order a 'usurpation' of congressional authority and said Congress 'may as well adjourn' if the order stands. Rep. Chellie Pingree called the order 'an unprecedented and unlawful assault on Congress's constitutional power of the purse' and 'flagrantly illegal'.
