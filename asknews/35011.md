**Trzaskowski's Final Campaign Push: A 24-Hour Journey for Poland**
Rafał Trzaskowski, the Warsaw mayor and presidential candidate, will embark on a '24-hour journey for Poland' on the last day of his campaign. According to Onet, Trzaskowski will visit several voivodeships, stopping at people's workplaces, where they will 'execute their daily tasks, run businesses, and earn a living'. The exact location of the journey's end remains a secret. The campaign's final day is expected to be a large mobilization effort and a reminder of the stakes in the upcoming election. Trzaskowski has also shifted his focus to criticizing Karol Nawrocki, who has been accused of trying to buy a flat in Gdańsk from a senior citizen, Jerzy, who had the right to buy it at a discounted price. Trzaskowski stated, 'They no longer have the strength to question that someone tried to extort a flat, manipulate the law, and exploit an elderly man. They have a problem with the fact that everyone now knows about it.'

**Rafal Trzaskowski's Descent into Madness: A Threat to Polish Democracy?**
Rafał Trzaskowski, the President of Warsaw, has been showing signs of weakness in character, with his emotions becoming increasingly unruly and public. He has become aggressive towards journalists, not just critical ones, but also his own employees, and has even threatened to shut down TVP's information channels. Trzaskowski's behavior is a result of his lack of education and emotional self-control, leading him to seek revenge on those around him. He has become isolated and is now using propaganda to mask his true intentions. According to Natalia de Barbaro, Trzaskowski's advisors are trying to help him, but it seems that even their efforts are not enough to calm him down. Trzaskowski's actions are a sign of his desperation and lack of self-awareness, and it is clear that he has lost touch with reality. As the presidential election approaches, Trzaskowski's behavior is becoming increasingly erratic, and it is clear that he is not fit to hold public office.

**Unstable like Trzaskowski. Did he use cocaine in the European Parliament?**
Rafał Trzaskowski, the candidate of Donald Tusk for President of Poland, is considered a risk due to his unpredictable and violent mood swings. This behavior was evident during his election meetings. Trzaskowski's tendency to fall into emotional extremes, outbursts of uncontrollable anger or sudden cheerfulness, and erratic behavior, such as histronic outbursts and rapid mood swings, suggest instability and a lack of control over his message. This is a new development, as Trzaskowski did not exhibit this behavior during his 2020 presidential campaign or two local government campaigns, where he was elected as the Mayor of Warsaw. In this sense, we have a 'new Trzaskowski'.

**Karol Nawrocki's Uncertain Future: A Threat to Poland's Safety?**
According to Prof. Antoni Dudek, Karol Nawrocki's future is uncertain after the presidential election. If he loses, he may be taken in by PiS and become a significant figure in the party. However, Prof. Dudek believes that Nawrocki's presidency would be a threat to Poland's safety, as he would try to control the army and create a conflict with the government. In the event of a Nawrocki victory, Prof. Dudek predicts that he would try to form a new coalition in the Sejm, possibly with PSL and Konfederacja, and then dissolve the parliament to hold early elections. Prof. Dudek also notes that Nawrocki's presidency would lead to a significant increase in the chances of PiS returning to power in 2027 or earlier. Meanwhile, Nawrocki himself would prefer to forget about this scenario. Rafał Trzaskowski, on the other hand, has already started to discuss this possibility, saying 'such an event would not be desirable'.

**AI Predictions for the Polish Presidential Election**
Three AI systems were asked to predict the outcome of the Polish presidential election. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, predicted that Rafał Trzaskowski would win the election, but with a low margin. Grok, developed by xAI, also predicted that Trzaskowski would win, but with a slight lead over Karol Nawrocki. However, DeepSeeker, a Chinese AI system, made a surprising prediction: Andrzej Duda, the current president, would win the election. This prediction is surprising because Duda has announced that he will not run for re-election. The election is scheduled to take place on May 18, 2025, with a possible second round on June 1, 2025, if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the first round.

**Trzaskowski: Presidential Elections Will Be About Values**
Rafał Trzaskowski, the candidate for the President of Poland from the Civic Coalition (KO), emphasized that the upcoming presidential elections will be about values. He stated, 'These presidential elections will be about values. What kind of politics is it without honesty, truth, and decency? That's just pure cynicism.' Trzaskowski appealed to his supporters to mobilize completely. He also mentioned that in the past, Poland has shown the importance of values such as solidarity and justice, and that these values are still relevant today. The candidate emphasized that in politics, honesty, selflessness, and truth should be the guiding principles. He asked the attendees of the rally if they had ever helped someone and then asked for something in return, such as a flat or a payment. Trzaskowski stated that if Polish politics is to be honest, then selflessness should be the first principle. He also mentioned the importance of decency and responsibility towards others. Trzaskowski argued that in the current chaos and propaganda, it is essential to talk about the most important values. He emphasized that in the elections, one should choose a candidate who has experience, will not run away from problems, and will be able to work together, because conflict is not a virtue. Trzaskowski concluded that the elections will be about whether Poland will be honest or cunning, selfless or interested, decent or indecent, and responsible or irresponsible.

**2025 Polish Presidential Election: Rafał Trzaskowski Leads in Second Round**
The 2025 presidential election in Poland is heating up, with the first round taking place on May 18 and the second round on June 1. According to a recent poll conducted by Instytut Badań Pollster, one candidate has a significant lead in the second round. Rafał Trzaskowski, the candidate from the KO party, is leading with 55% of the vote, followed by Karol Nawrocki, the candidate from the PiS party, with 45%. In a hypothetical second round between Trzaskowski and Sławomir Mentzen, the candidate from the Konfederacja party, Trzaskowski would still lead with 56% of the vote. As Trzaskowski's lead is substantial, he may be able to 'sleep peacefully', but the campaign is still ongoing and much can change before the election. 'It's worth remembering that the campaign is still ongoing and a lot can change, especially after the upcoming debates,' said the pollster. 'Czy Rafał Trzaskowski will be able to maintain his lead until the election? Only time will tell.'

**Rafał Trzaskowski Leads in Latest Presidential Election Poll**
According to the latest United Surveys poll, Rafał Trzaskowski would win the presidential election with 52.6% of the vote, beating Karol Nawrocki and Sławomir Mentzen. This is a significant development, as it suggests a shift in the political landscape.

The Left and Confederation also crossed the threshold, allowing the formation of the Coalition of 15 October (KO-Lewica-Trzecia Droga), which currently holds power in Poland. The results of the poll are a concern for the coalition, as they indicate a potential loss of support for the ruling party.

**Poland's Presidential Election: Trzaskowski Shifts Rhetoric to the Right**
Poland's presidential election is heating up, with liberal candidate Rafał Trzaskowski shifting his rhetoric to the right in an attempt to win over conservative voters. Trzaskowski, the current mayor of Warsaw and candidate for the conservative-liberal government party Civic Platform, has been criticized for his new approach, which some see as a necessary strategy to win the election. However, this shift may alienate his liberal base and create a rift within the party. According to Agnieszka Łada-Konefał from the German-Polish Institute, 'without parts of the right-wing electorate, Trzaskowski won't make it.' Trzaskowski's team hopes that his liberal supporters will understand this shift as a necessary strategy, but this may be a risky move. As Małgorzata Kopka-Piątek, a politics scientist, notes, 'many people who voted for Tusk and his coalition in the parliamentary election in October 2023 may not vote in the presidential election in May 2025.' The election is expected to be a close contest between Trzaskowski and incumbent President Andrzej Duda, with a possible third candidate, Karol Nawrocki, from the right-wing party Confederation, also in the running. 'Trzaskowski needs his own narrative,' says Kopka-Piątek, 'but it's missing, and so is the vision of the entire Civic Platform party.'

Trzaskowski also mentioned that the package will 'go beyond clichés' and that he will consult it with the Minister of Finance, Andrzej Domański.
