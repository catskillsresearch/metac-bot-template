**Gukesh scores his first classical win against Carlsen in Norway**
19-year-old Indian chess player D Gukesh earned his first classical-format win over world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen at the Norway Chess 2025 tournament. The game saw Carlsen pressing with the white pieces, but Gukesh held steady under pressure. In the final stages, Carlsen made a misstep in a time scramble, and Gukesh responded accurately to convert the advantage. According to Gukesh, 'There was not much I could do. I just had to make the most of it. I was making moves that were tricky for him, and luckily he got into a time scramble. One thing I've learned from this tournament is that time scrambles can get out of control,' he said. Gukesh added, 'Ninety-nine out of a hundred times, I would have lost. It's a lucky day.' Carlsen was visibly frustrated and slammed the chessboard before exiting the arena.

**Norway Chess: Gukesh beats Magnus Carlsen for first time in classical game, World No.1 slams table**
D Gukesh, the reigning world champion, defeated Magnus Carlsen, the five-time world champion, in a classical game at the Norway Chess event on Sunday. This was Gukesh's first win over Carlsen in a classical game. Gukesh capitalized on a rare blunder by Carlsen during a time scramble to secure the win in 62 moves after over four hours of intense play. The victory was significant for Gukesh, who had suffered a defeat against Carlsen in the tournament's opening round. Carlsen was seen slamming the table in frustration after the loss. Gukesh's coach, Grzegorz Gajewski, stated that the win would provide Gukesh with a substantial confidence boost for the remainder of the tournament and future encounters with Carlsen. 'It (win) just gives a huge pump of confidence (to Gukesh) because once you've done it, you know you can do it again. And that's the plan,' said Gajewski. He also mentioned that the win would serve as a confidence booster for other Indian players. 'And for the tournament (Norway Chess) that's going ahead, it gives him (Gukesh) a bump. Hopefully we can break another unbreakable margin. Perfect,' said the Pole.

**Carlsen Loses Lead in Norway Chess After Thrilling Defeat**
Magnus Carlsen had a winning position against world champion Gukesh Dommaraju in Norway Chess, but lost under time pressure. This means he has lost his lead in the tournament and is now tied with Fabiano Caruana before the final three rounds. Carlsen played a fascinating game where he showed class with black pieces in a complex position and seemed to be beating Gukesh for the second time in the tournament. However, he struggled to deliver the final blow and lost in a thrilling endgame where both players had only seconds left on the clock. Carlsen was frustrated and slammed his hand on the table, causing the pieces to jump out of the board, before shaking hands with Gukesh and storming out of the playing hall in Stavanger. Gukesh said, 'I'm still shaking. I'm honest, I don't know what happened. The game was clearly lost, and I just tried to make moves that made it difficult for him. Luckily, he got into time trouble.' Carlsen also faced a challenge from his arch-rival Hans Niemann, who posted a picture with the text 'You come at the king, you best not miss.' Carlsen had posted the same picture on Monday when he beat Gukesh in their first match in the tournament.

**Carlsen Wins Thrilling Match Against Caruana in Norway Chess Tournament**
Magnus Carlsen, the world chess champion, won a thrilling match against Fabiano Caruana in the Norway Chess tournament. Carlsen, who was close to losing, managed to turn the game around and secure a draw. Caruana, who was under pressure to win, made a few mistakes that allowed Carlsen to escape. The match was part of the tournament's 'muerte súbita' format, where players have a limited time to make their moves. Carlsen praised the format, saying, 'I like the sudden death, but also the pace at which we play the classical game here because we don't get extra minutes after move 40, only 10 seconds per move, and that creates a tremendous pressure, much more demanding than in conventional tournaments.' Carlsen leads the tournament with 9.5 points, followed by Caruana with 8 points. In the women's tournament, Koneru is leading with 8.5 points, followed by Anna Muzychuk with 8 points.

Magnus Carlsen had trouble in his game against Fabiano Caruana at Norway Chess on Saturday, but managed to secure a draw and then won an extra half-point in armageddon. This has increased his lead in the tournament, with him now half a point ahead of Caruana. Carlsen had black in armageddon, which means he had less time, but he managed to secure a draw. He was in trouble again after a weak move early on, but turned the game around in his favor and took a convincing win.

When there is a draw, armageddon is played for an extra half-point. The six players will meet each other twice before the tournament winner is crowned.

**Riddle: Thomas-Alekhine solved!**
A re-examination of the chess game Thomas-Alekhine reveals that Black's winning advantage was not maintained until the end of the game. The analysis highlights several critical moments where Black made mistakes, including moves 35…Rxc4?, 42…Rca4?, 44…R6a5?, and 48.Bc1?. These mistakes allowed White to counterattack and potentially salvage the game. The analysis also suggests that White could have organized counterplay on the kingside with the move 37.g4! and held the game with proper play. The author notes that chess is a game of mistakes and that further analysis may reveal new ideas and defensive possibilities.
