**Annalena Baerbock to preside over the UN General Assembly**
Annalena Baerbock, the former German Foreign Minister, has been elected as the next President of the United Nations General Assembly for the 80th session, which will begin in September. Baerbock, 44, received the support of 167 countries, exceeding the required simple majority of 88 votes. Her opponent, Helga Smith, received 7 votes. Baerbock's election was expected, as she was the only candidate from the 'Western Europe and Others' group, and her candidacy had been widely negotiated and agreed upon within the European Union. Baerbock will take office on September 9, just before the annual General Assembly meeting. This will be the fifth time a woman has held the position, following María Fernanda Espinosa, who was elected in 2018. Baerbock's election has sparked calls for a woman to be appointed as the next Secretary-General, the highest executive and institutional position, when António Guterres' term ends in 2026.

**The Dominican Republic is Ready for a Female President**
The Dominican Republic is ready for a female president, and there are women with the skills, experience, and commitment to lead the country. Having a woman as president would not only be a historic milestone, but also a transformative moment in Dominican politics. Women tend to exercise power in a more human, more empathetic, and more transparent way. Their leadership focuses on serving, listening, and building, rather than imposing and dividing. This style of governance responds to a citizenry tired of arrogant politics and eager for representatives who govern with heart and common sense. The leadership of women promotes a different kind of politics: less confrontational and more collaborative, less clientelistic and more results-oriented, less vertical and more participatory. When a woman leads, she not only expands the public agenda to include traditionally neglected issues, but also redefines the style of governance. She governs from a commitment to social responsibility, from real proximity to communities, and from an ethic of care that values every decision as an opportunity to transform lives. The examples of other countries are not foreign to our reality: countries that have trusted women as heads of state have experienced not only institutional progress, but also improvements in social cohesion, transparency, and public management efficiency. This is possible here too. In our country, there are women who have directed institutions with effectiveness, negotiated in complex scenarios with height, and demonstrated invaluable political and human sensitivity. Today, the Dominican Republic has a more informed, more critical, and more open citizenry. Young generations, in particular, break with the prejudices of the past and value capacity, coherence, and vision. The moment is propitious for a woman to access the presidency, not as a quota or a symbol, but as a response to a real need for political transformation. In short, betting on a woman president in the Dominican Republic is betting on a politics with a human face, closer, more ethical, and more effective. It is a firm step towards democratic maturity, towards a nation where power is used to serve, not to dominate. Because when a woman leads, not only does the face of power change: the way it is exercised is transformed. And that, without a doubt, is what we all need.

**Annalena Baerbock Elected as Next President of the United Nations General Assembly**
Annalena Baerbock, the former German Minister of Foreign Affairs (2021-25), has been elected as the next president of the United Nations General Assembly for the 80th session, starting in September. Baerbock won the vote with a landslide majority, receiving 167 votes, while her compatriot Helga Smith received only 7 votes. Fourteen countries abstained from the secret vote. Baerbock's candidacy was widely negotiated and agreed upon within the European Union. She will be the fifth woman to hold the position, following María Fernanda Espinosa, the last woman to hold the position, who was elected in 2018. The United Nations has set goals to advance gender equality and women's empowerment, but has yet to have a woman as Secretary-General, a position that is currently held by António Guterres, who will step down in 2026. Baerbock said, 'It was a great day.' Baerbock's election is seen as a step towards greater representation of women in the UN, but it is also noted that the UN's decisions are ultimately made by its member states.

**Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: A Potential Threat to Donald Trump's Re-election?**
A recent survey shows that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswoman from New York, is gaining popularity in the US, with a significant approval rating. In contrast, Donald Trump continues to receive predominantly negative reviews. According to the survey, 44% of respondents view Trump positively, while 55% view him negatively. Ocasio-Cortez, on the other hand, is seen as a potential threat to Trump's re-election, with some Republicans even considering a third term for the 78-year-old president starting in 2029. Ocasio-Cortez has been vocal about her criticism of Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip, calling it 'genocide.' As reported by 'Newsweek,' the current administration, led by President Joe Biden, and his predecessor, Kamala Harris, also struggle to win over the public, with approval ratings ranging from -10 to -18.

**Pete Buttigieg Leads Democratic Poll for 2028 Presidential Election, JD Vance Tops Republican List**
A recent poll by AtlasIntel shows that Pete Buttigieg, the former US Transportation Secretary, is the most popular choice among Democrats for the 2028 presidential election, with 31.5% of the vote.

The poll also found that 50.9% of respondents would vote for a Democratic candidate in a mid-term election, while 41.7% would vote for a Republican candidate. Kamala Harris, the current US Vice President, saw a decline in her popularity, with 16.6% of the vote, possibly due to the recent controversy surrounding Joe Biden's health.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has not commented on speculation that she may run for president in 2028, but some believe she could be a potential candidate for the Senate.

**Letters to the editor: May 30, 2025**
The Senate's budget bill has been criticized for being the 'Hood Robin Bill' as it takes from the poor to give to the rich. Economist Robert Reich stated that Americans making between $17,000 and $51,000 will lose about $700 a year, while those with incomes of less than $17,000 will lose more than $1,000 a year. However, the top 0.1% of earners will gain nearly $390,000 a year. Additionally, the article discusses the issue of artificial intelligence 'scraping' research and artistic work without proper credit, and the need to value creativity and thinking for oneself. The article also touches on the topic of PG&E rates, with the CEO predicting a decrease despite a 68.6% increase in bills over the last five years. Furthermore, the Monterey County Republican Party has expressed support for President Trump's executive order banning transgender women from competing in female sports, citing the need to protect women's rights and fairness in women's sports.

**Hillary Clinton frets that a female Republican president would be...**
Former Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton expressed concerns that a female Republican president would be a 'handmaiden to the patriarchy', undermining feminist ideals. Clinton argued that few female Republicans reflect feminist values, citing Sen. Lisa Murkowski and former Rep. Liz Cheney as exceptions. She lamented the lack of progress in breaking the glass ceiling, referencing her own and Kamala Harris' defeats. Clinton stated that she would support a female Republican who she believes would be a good president, but emphasized that it's 'obviously so much harder' for women to win the presidency. This is not the first time Clinton has made disparaging comments about GOP women, having previously excluded former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher from her book 'The Book of Gutsy Women' due to her 'mixed record'.

**Mia Love, first Black Republican woman to serve in Congress, dies at 49**
Mia Love, the first Black Republican woman to serve in Congress, has died at the age of 49. Love, who represented Utah's 4th District from 2015 to 2019, made history by being the first Black Republican woman to hold a congressional seat. Her family announced her death, stating that she passed away peacefully at home surrounded by family. Love's daughter Abigale shared that her mother's glioblastoma brain cancer had progressed and was no longer responding to treatment. Love was a rising star in the Republican Party and tackled issues such as sexual harassment and immigration. She frequently criticized President Donald Trump's policies and did not seek his endorsement during her re-election campaign. Love's legacy is one of strength, resilience, and determination, inspiring many with her story. She wrote in an op-ed that she wanted neighbors to come together and focus on their similarities rather than their differences. Love is survived by her husband, Jason; daughters Alessa and Abigale; son, Peyton; and one grandchild. Her family will share details about funeral arrangements and a public celebration of her life this week. 'In the end, I hope that my life will have mattered and made a difference for the nation I love and the family and friends I adore,' Love wrote. 'America at its roots is respectful, resilient, giving and grounded in gritty determination,' she said. 'I was raised to believe passionately in the American dream and to love this country, warts and all.'

**Mia Love, First Black Republican Woman in US Congress, Dies at 49**
Mia Love, the first black Republican woman to serve in the US Congress, has passed away at the age of 49 due to brain cancer. According to her family, she 'died in peace' on Sunday 'at her home surrounded by her family' in Utah. Love was diagnosed with glioblastoma three years ago and her daughter Abigale had announced in March that the tumor was no longer responding to treatment and was progressing. Born in New York to Haitian immigrant parents, Love first ran for office in 2012 to represent Utah's 4th district in the House of Representatives and won the seat in the 2014 midterm elections. She lost her seat in 2018 to Democrat Ben McAdams, a defeat that was mocked by then-President Donald Trump. Love had decided not to support Trump in the 2016 presidential election and after losing her seat, she said that his behavior showed that for him, 'there were only convenient transactions, not real relationships.' Love was not only the first black Republican woman in Congress, but also the first black person to hold a legislative seat in Utah and the first Haitian-American to be elected to Congress.

Although she was a trailblazer for conservative women of color, Love became a critic of Donald Trump's policies and did not endorse him for president in 2016. 'People like the idea of women running, they do, especially a woman of color, but the efforts don't go far enough,' Love said in 2022. Her family has shifted their focus from treatment to enjoying their remaining time with her and will announce funeral arrangements and plans for a 'public celebration of her life' in the coming days.
