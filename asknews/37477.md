**Online Safety Act to be enforced once guidelines are finalised, says Fahmi**
Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil announced that the Online Safety Act 2024 will be enforced once all 10 regulatory guidelines developed by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) are finalised. Currently, five guidelines are ready, and five more are still in progress. Fahmi also called on the Malaysian Media Council (MMM) to play an active role in developing guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the broadcasting sector. He urged the Tun Abdul Razak Broadcasting and Information Institute (IPPTAR) to open its training programmes to the public as part of its institutional reform. Fahmi said, 'I believe the council has a role to play in these discussions. By involving MMM, the industry and the government, we can examine both the benefits and risks of using AI, particularly in media.' He also stated, 'I see a need for us to open IPPTAR's doors as widely as possible. Not just for the open day, I believe IPPTAR itself needs to adopt a more open approach.'

**The Senate is one step closer to passing a 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation**
The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has passed a key hurdle in implementing a 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation. The moratorium, which would prevent states from enforcing 'any law or regulation...limiting, restricting, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence... entered into interstate commerce' for 10 years, is part of the budget reconciliation text released on June 5. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that the provision does not violate the Byrd rule and may be passed by a simple majority via the budget reconciliation process. Reason's Joe Lancaster explains that the moratorium conditions the receipt of federal funding from the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program on compliance with the 10-year pause on local AI regulation. Some states have already passed stringent AI legislation, including New York's Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act and Colorado's Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence. Adam Thierer, senior fellow for the Technology and Innovation team at the R Street Institute, says that the moratorium 'is a prime example of costly mandates that could be covered by the moratorium.' Neil Chilson, head of AI for the Abundance Institute, says that withholding billions of dollars of BEAD funding encourages non-enforcement of poorly designed and heavy-handed state laws.

**US Congress Nears Vote on AI Regulation Bill**
A new development in the regulation of artificial intelligence in the United States may change the landscape of AI regulation. A Republican bill has passed a key procedural hurdle in the Senate, aiming to prevent states from imposing their own regulations on AI technology for the next decade. The bill, reworded by Senator Ted Cruz, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, would strip states of funding for broadband infrastructure if they implement any laws regulating AI. This rewording, according to amendments, aims to comply with general budget rules in the Senate and has avoided what is known as the 'Byrd Rule', allowing it to pass with a simple majority without the need for Democratic support or the risk of a 'filibuster'. Despite this legislative progress, the Republican position on the bill remains divided. Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee stated, 'We don't need a stop that prevents our states from protecting their citizens.' Meanwhile, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene strongly opposed the bill, calling it 'an infringement on state rights' and demanded its removal from Senate sessions. In contrast, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the bill, stating that it has the support of former President Donald Trump and that 'we must be cautious of 50 states regulating AI separately, as it has implications for national security.' However, civil society organizations have not remained silent, with the group 'Americans for Responsible AI' expressing concern that the general language in the bill could lead to the repeal of many local regulations on AI and algorithms, creating a 'dangerous regulatory vacuum' without clear federal alternatives. Despite the federal proposal, some states are moving forward with regulation, with California rejecting a contentious bill on general AI safety last year but approving laws related to privacy and combating 'deepfakes.' New York has passed a safety law pending the signature of Governor Kathy Hochul, while Utah has already passed laws to ensure transparency in AI use.

**President Trump issues Executive Orders to promote the development of Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Supersonic Flight**
President Trump issued two Executive Orders on June 6, 2025, to promote the development of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and supersonic flight in the United States. The orders, 'Unleashing American Drone Dominance' and 'Leading the World in Supersonic Flight', aim to reduce regulatory burden and provide incentives for the manufacturing and use of new technologies for UAS and supersonic aircraft. The orders require various federal agencies to take specific actions to expand commercial UAS operations, integrate UAS into the US airspace system, and strengthen the production and export of US UAS. The FAA Administrator must establish the Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) Integration Pilot Program, and all US agencies must prioritize the integration of US-manufactured UAS over those manufactured abroad. The orders also task agencies with promoting the export and financing of US-manufactured civil UAS and establishing federal regulatory standards for supersonic aviation. According to the orders, the Federal Acquisition Security Council must publish a Covered Foreign Entity List by July 6, 2025, and the Secretary of Commerce must take necessary actions to ensure that vital components remain under US control by September 4, 2025. 'We must unleash American drone dominance and lead the world in supersonic flight,' said President Trump, 'and we will do it with American ingenuity and American innovation.'

**New York Advances Frontier AI Bill**
New York has passed the Responsible AI Safety and Education Act (RAISE Act), which aims to establish transparency standards for frontier artificial intelligence systems. The bill, which targets the largest AI companies, requires them to publish safety and security protocols, report safety incidents, conduct risk evaluations, and undergo third-party audits. If companies fail to comply, they may face civil penalties of up to $30 million. The RAISE Act is seen as a more effective approach than California's failed SB 1047, which was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom in 2024. The Act includes safe harbor provisions for responsible development and provides a framework for regulation of frontier AI models in the United States.

**Senate to Keep AI Moratorium in Trump's Tax and Spending Package**
A Republican effort to prevent US states from applying new artificial intelligence regulations will remain in the massive tax and spending package of President Donald Trump, marking a victory for technology companies that have been pushing to stop and repeal dozens of AI security laws across the country. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that the provision fits the special budget process used by Republicans to consider the fiscal package, which allows the party to avoid concessions to Democrats. The Senate version of the AI moratorium would deny federal funding for broadband internet projects if states apply AI regulations. The provision is likely to be challenged in the full Senate, where its elimination would only require a simple majority. Some Republicans, both in the House and Senate, have opposed the AI provision. 'We don't need a moratorium that prohibits our states from intervening and protecting citizens in their states,' said Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee last week. The Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, has informed lawmakers that many other provisions have failed to pass the budget process, including language that requires state funds equivalent to food stamp coupons and a requirement that people seeking federal government orders deposit large bonds to obtain temporary restraining orders, said Democrats. The Republicans are competing to pass the fiscal package before July 4, and Senate leaders plan to vote on it this week. The provisions of the bills are being litigated in a closed-door process, and Senate Democrats on the Budget Committee are publishing periodic updates to the media. The AI provision would benefit many of the largest AI and technology companies in the US, some of which have lobbied against a 'patchwork' of state-by-state AI regulations. California, New York, Utah, and dozens of other states have introduced or enacted AI laws in recent years, including bills to address concerns over data privacy, copyright, and bias. Congress has yet to approve a federal framework on AI, leaving states to determine how to establish rules around this technology. The House approved its version of the bill, which would impose a 10-year moratorium on any state law that regulates AI or automated decision-making systems. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on June 9 that the AI provision had the full support of the White House, including the AI and cryptocurrency czar, David Sacks. More than 200 state lawmakers from both parties urged Congress to reject the measure, which could have nullified a wide range of consumer protection laws on topics including online child safety, AI-generated harm, and the adoption and deployment of AI in government, according to the AI security experts at the Center for Responsible Innovation. Senate Republicans also advanced the broader bill, as the Joint Committee on Taxation, the primary congressional tax control body, found that the new fiscal provisions in the bill would add $441 billion net to deficits through 2034. The 'current policy' baseline preferred by the Republican Party in the Senate assumes that billions of dollars in Trump's tax cuts on the verge of expiring are free. The scoring gives lawmakers space to negotiate final agreements on the broader package, including the establishment of the state and local tax deduction level and the speed at which green energy tax credits will end.

**Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: A New Perspective on Risk Management and Bias Mitigation**
The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the healthcare sector has opened up new perspectives in areas such as early diagnosis, personalized care, and integrated patient management. However, the adoption of these technologies poses complex ethical and regulatory challenges, particularly with regard to patient data security and privacy. Therefore, it is essential that AI systems are transparent, controllable, and adaptable to the context in which they are used. This project represents a significant scientific contribution to the field of healthcare innovation, in line with international research guidelines on the responsibility associated with the use of AI. 'The AI Act, which came into force in August 2024, represents the first global regulation on AI adopted by the European Union, aiming to ensure a safe, ethical, and responsible use of AI, protecting fundamental rights and promoting secure technological innovation.' The AI Act's risk-based approach classifies AI systems based on their level of risk, excluding those deemed unacceptable in terms of security and rights. Within this context, the VIMASS Laboratory of the University of Parthenope in Naples has completed the AIACT project, addressing a critical issue: identifying and mitigating biases in clinical data, particularly in breast cancer clinical trials where AI is used to support decision-making. The limited representativeness of the samples raises doubts about the validity and equity of the algorithms. Therefore, based on an analysis of the scientific literature on AI and algorithmic bias, the research project aimed to develop an AI prototype for risk management and evaluation, specifically designed for healthcare organizations and developers. The main goal is to provide stakeholders with an advanced simulation tool, designed to generate an optimized dataset for clinical trials. The bias-free dataset was developed specifically for training AI models applied to the healthcare sector.

**Implementation of Trump's science executive order prioritizes AI**
The Trump administration has set a deadline of August 22 for agencies to report on their implementation of President Donald Trump's executive order, 'Restoring Gold Standard Science.' According to Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, agencies should adopt streamlined approaches that utilize artificial intelligence and other automated tools to manage conflict-of-interest disclosures, quantify uncertainty, and standardize data reporting. Kratsios emphasized the need to minimize administrative burdens and avoid excessive bureaucratic requirements that can impede scientific progress. 'Agencies should explore the use of AI and other automated tools to manage conflict-of-interest disclosures, quantify uncertainty and standardize transparent data reporting,' he wrote.

**Texas Charts New Path on AI With Landmark Regulation**
Texas has become the second state to enact omnibus legislation regulating artificial intelligence (AI) systems, after Colorado. The Texas Responsible Artificial Intelligence Governance Act (TRAIGA) establishes a new regulatory framework that applies to developers and deployers of AI systems conducting business in Texas or producing AI products or services used by Texas residents. The Act prohibits the development or deployment of AI systems for certain purposes, including producing or distributing child pornography, and requires government agencies to disclose when they use AI systems to interact with consumers. TRAIGA also amends the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act to clarify that individuals do not implicitly consent to the harvesting of their biometric data based solely on the existence of online images or videos. The attorney general has exclusive authority to enforce TRAIGA and may bring enforcement actions to seek civil penalties and injunctive relief. Companies should consider preparing for the implementation of TRAIGA on January 1, 2026, by assessing how their development or use of AI systems might implicate TRAIGA's provisions.

**Trump Signs Executive Order for Flying Cars, Boosting eVTOL Companies Archer and Joby**
US President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on June 20, 2025, which redefines the regulatory framework for eVTOLs, drones, and supersonic aircraft. The goal is to make the US the global center for 'Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)'. Trump stated, 'The future of flight must be American-made. Today, we unlock the sky for the next century of innovation.' Archer Aviation (ACHR) and Joby Aviation (JOBY) are leading US companies in the eVTOL space, working on production-ready flying taxis. With Trump's Executive Order, they receive significant backing from the White House. Archer's 'Midnight' model is expected to conduct its first urban passenger flights in 2025, in partnership with United Airlines. Joby is a pioneer in eVTOLs, with FAA certification processes in an advanced stage. Their prototype is quiet, emissions-free, and optimized for long-distance flights. Trump's Executive Order brings flying cars from science fiction to reality, providing regulatory clarity for companies like ACHR and JOBY, and a rare investment opportunity in a potentially trillion-dollar transportation sector.

**From California to Kentucky: Tracking the Rise of State AI Laws in 2025**
In the United States, the regulatory landscape for artificial intelligence ('AI') is rapidly evolving at the state level, with an increasing number of states introducing their own AI laws and legislative proposals. This results in a patchwork of rules and requirements that creates a complex and fragmented compliance environment for businesses deploying and employing AI and automated decision-making systems. We provide a time-stamped overview of newly enacted state laws aimed at regulating AI and automated decision-making systems, highlighting the key provisions of these regulations and offering practical insights for businesses using AI. Notably, California, Arkansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Utah, and West Virginia have enacted or proposed AI regulations, including requirements for public entities to develop AI policies, ownership rights over content generated by generative AI, and regulations for AI-supported mental health chatbots. Additionally, there is an emerging deregulatory trend for AI at the federal level, with President Trump's executive orders rescinding President Biden's Executive Order on AI and introducing a new policy to sustain and enhance U.S. global dominance in AI.

**The New AI Mandate: What SMBs Must Know**
The U.S. government has introduced new AI guidelines under Executive Order 14179, mandating federal agencies to adopt AI and remove barriers to its use. This shift affects small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which must now prioritize AI knowledge and self-regulate to avoid fragmentation and inconsistency. Shopify's CEO, Tobi Lütke, has made AI knowledge mandatory for all employees, emphasizing that AI is not just a technical initiative, but a leadership mandate. SMBs must internalize AI capabilities and limits to remain competitive, as the government will not provide hand-holding through this transition. Vigilance and vision will define the winners in this new era of AI adoption.

**AI Watch: Global regulatory tracker - United States**
The US currently relies on existing federal laws and guidelines to regulate AI, but aims to introduce AI legislation and a federal regulation authority. Until then, developers and deployers of AI systems will operate in a patchwork of state and local laws, posing challenges for compliance. President Trump's Executive Order, 'Removing Barriers EO', rescinds President Biden's Executive Order, calling for federal departments to revise policies that hinder 'America's global AI dominance'. The US Congress is considering numerous AI bills, but it's unclear if they will enact legislation or focus on other priorities. Proposed bills emphasize voluntary guidelines and best practices for AI systems, reflecting a cautious approach to regulation that aims to foster innovation without strict mandates.

**Health AI industry left to self-regulate as feds change course | T...**
The healthcare industry is being left to self-regulate after the federal government rescinded the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence executive order. Healthcare law experts note that the order did not have a strong enforcement mechanism and its rescission will not significantly impact the industry. Brian Anderson, M.D., co-founder and CEO of CHAI, said, 'The executive order in the healthcare delivery space really didn't affect the development or deployment of models.' The industry is relying on frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework and FDA guidance to ensure safety and efficacy of AI tools. The FDA has approved nearly 1,000 AI- and ML-enabled medical devices as of December 2024. Worley noted, 'What I'm telling private industry is that NIST was really the way to go under the Biden EO, and it's still the way to go under what we know right now from Trump's statement in the January 23rd EO.'

**As Trump’s AI deregulation, job cuts sink in, industry gets spooked | Biometric Update**
The Trump administration has issued an executive order that aims to reduce regulatory hurdles for AI development in the US, but critics argue that this approach could lead to a deregulated AI landscape where discriminatory or unsafe AI systems proliferate. The order, which was issued in 2023, established the US Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (AISI) under the Department of Commerce to develop testing, evaluations, and guidelines for 'trustworthy' AI. However, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has instructed scientists to remove references to 'AI safety,' 'responsible AI,' and 'AI fairness' from their objectives, aligning with the Trump administration's emphasis on reducing ideological bias in AI models. Critics, including Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist, have condemned the policy as a 'witch hunt in academia' and warned that it could drive American scientists to seek research opportunities abroad. The implications of Trump's EO are wide-ranging, and the US is now on a divergent path from other global powers, particularly the European Union, which is implementing strict AI regulations emphasizing transparency, accountability, and fairness. Potential funding cuts to AISI and job losses at NIST have raised concerns within the technology sector, where many fear efforts to develop responsible AI could be jeopardized by Trump's push to downsize the federal government.

**New Executive Orders Signal Shift in U.S. Artificial Intelligence and Science Policy**
In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued two executive orders that mark a significant shift in the federal government's approach to artificial intelligence, science and technology policy. Executive Order 14177 establishes a new President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), while Executive Order 14179 revokes previous AI compliance requirements and emphasizes U.S. technological leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security. The new orders aim to 'clear a path for the United States to act decisively to retain global leadership in artificial intelligence.' The USPTO has removed its Artificial Intelligence Strategy from its website and is reviewing it to reflect the new AI policies. The public is invited to comment on the AI Action Plan until March 15, 2025.

**Trump's Uncertain AI Doctrine**
The United States is facing a challenge in regulating artificial intelligence (AI) as it advances rapidly, with the potential for both immense benefits and significant risks. Vice President JD Vance has declared that the US will go its own way on AI, pushing back against the European Union's safety-oriented regulations. However, the US lacks comprehensive federal legislation to regulate AI, and its governance model is grounded in executive orders. The Biden administration's AI safety order, which included diversity, equity, and inclusion provisions, was recently rescinded by President Trump. The Trump administration is likely to restore some of the order's provisions, focusing on engineering safety. The EU and China are developing their own governance models, with the EU's AI Act being a centralized, risk-averse, rights-focused model. A global consensus on AI safety is emerging, supported by the EU and China but not the US. The US must balance its innovation ethos with meaningful safeguards to ensure public trust and maintain its lead in AI development.

**U.S. Shifts AI Policy, Calls for AI Action Plan**
The U.S. administration has issued a request for information (RFI) to solicit input on the development of a comprehensive AI Action Plan. The plan aims to guide future AI policy and will cover topics such as AI safety, innovation, security, and privacy. The RFI seeks input from academia, industry groups, private-sector organizations, and state, local, and tribal governments. Interested parties must submit their responses by March 15, 2025. The administration has also revoked Executive Order 14110, which established a broad regulatory framework for AI, and is now reassessing compliance obligations. The new order and RFI signal caution in developing an AI Action Plan that will drive policy through stakeholder engagement and regulatory adjustments. As a result, organizations should take proactive steps to adapt to and contribute to the evolving AI regulatory landscape.

**Some States Step Up Early to Regulate AI Risk Management**
In the past month, the US executive order on AI safety and security was replaced by a new order focusing on AI innovation, while the EU's liability directive was abandoned in favor of a new 2025 Commission work program. Meanwhile, 45 US states introduced AI bills last year, with 31 states adopting resolutions or enacting legislation. Colorado and Utah stand out for their focus on consumer protection. Colorado's AI Act requires developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems to meet certain criteria, including completing impact assessments and implementing risk management policies. Utah's AI Policy Act also seeks to balance AI's potential risks and rewards by including regulatory mitigation agreements (RMAs) and establishing a Learning Lab for responsible AI development. Other states, such as Virginia, Connecticut, and New Mexico, are also introducing AI regulations. As AG Rosenblum of Oregon notes, 'If you think the emerging world of AI is completely unregulated under the laws of Oregon, think again!'

**UK Delays Plans for AI Regulation**
The British Labour Government has delayed plans to introduce a draft bill on artificial intelligence due to concerns that binding regulation could hinder the country's AI growth potential. According to The Guardian, a draft AI bill will now be put forward in the summer, rather than in December 2024 as initially planned. Some lawmakers worry that further regulation could jeopardize the UK's relationship with the US and make the country less attractive to AI companies. A Department of Science and Technology spokesperson stated that the government remains committed to bringing forward legislation, but will engage extensively to refine proposals and launch a public consultation to ensure a future-proofed approach. The UK has taken a decentralized approach to AI governance, relying on existing statutes to protect the populace. The US has also taken a similar approach, with President Donald Trump nullifying an executive order meant to inject safety checks into frontier model rollout.
