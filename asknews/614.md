**Egypt's Environment Minister Warns of Catastrophic Future for Alexandria and the Nile Delta**
Egypt's Minister of Environment, Dr. Yasmine Fouad, stated that the recent unstable weather in Alexandria is a result of a low-pressure system, but it is also a manifestation of extreme climate change, known as 'wild weather waves'. She emphasized that Egypt and the African continent are among the most affected regions by climate change due to the rise in sea levels caused by melting ice and increased evaporation. Fouad predicted that between 2050 and 2100, the sea level is expected to rise by 50 centimeters, which poses a significant threat to coastal cities. She mentioned that the Egyptian government has taken proactive measures to protect coastal cities, including the creation of a marine protection belt to prevent waves from reaching the city. Fouad also announced the launch of an early warning system based on a climate model developed by the government's climate change authority, in collaboration with the Meteorological Authority. She stated that the goal is to create an interactive map to predict climate-related risks before they occur. The minister also revealed that the Climate Loss and Damage Fund has received actual funding and will be officially activated in July or August, providing real support to countries affected by climate change, including Egypt. Fouad concluded her speech by presenting two possible scenarios for the future of the Nile Delta and Alexandria by 2100: a pessimistic scenario, which predicts the complete flooding of coastal areas, and an optimistic scenario, which expects significant damage unless drastic preventive measures are taken. She emphasized that the government is currently working on a national strategy that takes into account both scenarios to ensure a safer future for coastal cities.

**The Future of Food: 10 Trends to Watch by 2050**
By 2050, the way we produce, buy, and prepare food will undergo significant transformations. According to predictions, ten main trends will emerge. 1. 'Community meals' will continue to play a central role in our lives, with a focus on shared experiences and emotional connections. 2. The weekly grocery shopping trip will become a thing of the past, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and box delivery services. 3. Clothing will become a source of food production, with wearable technology that can grow food on the go. 4. Urban agriculture will become increasingly integrated into city landscapes, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and community-supported agriculture. 5. Food will be designed to absorb CO2, rather than emit it, with the help of oceanic agriculture and sustainable aquaculture. 6. AI will help reduce food waste by optimizing meal planning and transforming scraps into new dishes using 3D printing. 7. Climate change will lead to the adoption of new crops, such as mangoes and papayas in the Mediterranean, and quinoa and soy in Northern Europe. 8. Ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion, will make a comeback, providing a source of biodiversity and resilience. 9. 'Niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, will become more mainstream, providing a source of nutrition and sustainability. 10. Food will become a form of preventive medicine, with AI-powered meal planning and personalized nutrition tailored to individual needs and genetic predispositions. According to Dr. Joseph Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Dr. Morgaine Gaye adds, 'the next decade will see significant transformations in our daily habits and food models.'

**France Enters a New Demographic Regime: A Younger Population**
France is entering a new demographic regime characterized by an increasing life expectancy and a declining birth rate. Demographic inertia is already affecting social security accounts and the overall balance of society. However, the country is expected to become younger than its European counterparts. According to the United Nations' population division, by 2100, France's median age will be 47 years old, making it one of the youngest countries in Europe, alongside Hungary. This is a reversal from 1950, when France was one of the oldest countries in Europe, with a median age of 33 years. The country is expected to surpass Ireland as the youngest European nation by 2025, with half of the population under 44 years old. This projection is based on assumptions about mortality, fertility, and migration rates. Even with a constant fertility rate, France's median age is expected to remain at 47 years old in 2100, with a significant gap with other European nations. However, if immigration is zero, France's population would age more, while Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Hungary would become younger. The world is aging faster than France, with a 20-year increase in median age by 2100, compared to a 14-year increase in France. This trend is already underway, with individuals born in 2025 expected to be 75 years old in 2100.

**A Glimpse into a Climate-Changed Future: '2050 Store' and 'Wiers - the Voice of the Earth'**
As the temperature in Seoul reached 29 degrees Celsius on the first day of June, a mock '2050 Store' was set up at the Seoul Madang to showcase the potential effects of climate change on our daily lives. The store featured items that may be extinct by 2050, such as Korean apples, domestic squid, wine, abalone, chocolate, and iced Americanos. According to Greenpeace, the domestic squid catch has decreased by 16/20 over the past 20 years due to rising sea temperatures, and 44% of abalone and shellfish species are at risk of extinction due to ocean acidification. The event, 'Wiers - the Voice of the Earth,' was held to raise awareness about climate change and to encourage citizens to take action. Participants were asked to write down the small, everyday things they want to preserve in a '2050 Diary' wall, and to record their thoughts on a 'Voice of the Earth' audio booth. The event also featured a coffee truck serving fair-trade coffee and vegan milk tea. Greenpeace's climate and energy campaigner, Jeong Sang-hoon, said, 'We set up this event to hear the voices of citizens who are concerned about climate change and to amplify the voice of the Earth.' He added that the organization plans to use the feedback from the event to campaign for change in the government and parliament after the presidential election. Participants expressed their hopes for the next government to prioritize climate change, with one citizen saying, 'I hope the next government will reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy.' Another participant said, 'I hope the next president will actively communicate with international organizations like the UN to address climate change.'

**Cara a cara: The Most Populous Countries in 2025 and 2100**
The world population is not only growing, but also redistributing. While traditional powers like China are stabilizing or decreasing their population, other nations in Africa and Asia are preparing to lead the future demographic landscape. According to the data, India is currently the most populous country with a population of approximately 1.438 billion people. The population growth is driven by unequal access to education and birth control methods, as well as cultural traditions like early marriage and large families. China is in second place with over 1.4 billion people, followed by the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Nigeria. By 2100, the projections show that India will continue to lead with a population exceeding 1.5 billion people, followed by China with a population of around 633 million. Notably, countries in Asia and Africa are expected to experience significant population growth in the coming decades, with Pakistan and Nigeria rising to third and fourth place, respectively.

**AI Predicts a Bleak Future for Humanity in 2100**
A study by artificial intelligence predicts a bleak future for humanity in 2100. The analysis is based on current technological, environmental, and social developments. According to the AI, some people will have merged with technology to improve their physical performance and reduce suffering, while others will choose simpler ways of life, living in small communities connected to the earth and ancestral knowledge. Cities will float, but many regions will be destroyed by natural disasters. The AI predicts the disappearance of countries as we know them, replaced by digital borders. The main struggle will be for access to essential resources like water, air, and data. The AI also suggests that children may not always be born naturally, but rather in laboratories or through guided processes by 'ancient souls' to restore balance. However, the vision is not entirely pessimistic, as a new generation is said to emerge, guided by memory and spiritual connection, and living in harmony with nature. 'They talk to trees. They listen to the dead. And they walk without haste, knowing that time is no longer a line, but a spiral,' the AI concludes.

**Opinion | Having more babies isn't the only answer**
The United States is facing a declining birth rate, with President Donald Trump proposing initiatives to encourage women to have more children. However, experts argue that simply throwing money at young couples is not enough. Bina Venkataraman suggests that technology and AI can boost productivity without requiring a replacement of the labor force, while also acknowledging the need for a combination of technology and immigration to address the issue. According to the United Nations, by 2100, only six countries are expected to have fertility rates above replacement rate: Somalia, Niger, Chad, Samoa, Tonga, and Tajikistan. Molly Roberts notes that the fear is not just a plateau after the peak population, but a plummeting, with the world population expected to peak at 10 billion around 2100.

**Dire Future Predicted for the World by 2100: Rising Sea Levels, Extreme Weather, and Catastrophic Air Pollution**
A study using Google's ImageFX generator and the latest scientific research predicts a dire future for the world by 2100. Cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main factors will be rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions. If nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these changes will continue for a century. Climate scientist Professor Julian Stoye said, 'The biggest impact that everyone will feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will be increasing over the century if we do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.' The IPCC predicts that the global temperature will rise by 2.7°C by 2100 under a medium scenario and by 4.4°C under a worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than double, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. Countries like France, already struggling with water scarcity, will likely face devastating droughts. It is predicted that only extreme heat will lead to 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. Barcelona will be the most affected city, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. The study predicts that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather events will become more frequent, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. The risk of sudden floods will be high in areas where droughts have already weakened the land. Mega-tornadoes will become more common, posing a threat to countries like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the southern states of the US. Large-scale forest fires will also become more frequent, with a 50% increase in extreme forest fires by 2100. The World Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with 60,000 additional deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.

**Governments Are Throwing Money at Declining Birth Rates But It’s Not Working**
Governments worldwide are trying to reverse declining birth rates with financial incentives, tax breaks, and AI-powered matchmaking, but these efforts are not yielding results. According to projections, by 2100, only 12 countries will have fertility rates above the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman. The decline in birth rates poses significant economic challenges, including rising healthcare costs, pensions, and social services, and shrinking tax revenues. Experts point to deeper societal shifts, such as women's increased education and career focus, as the root cause of the decline. 'We have a whole cohort of women in high-income countries who have been educated in a very gender-neutral way,' said Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology at the University of Oxford. 'They enter the workplace in a gender-neutral way, and then they become parents and suddenly, no matter how hard one tries, it’s not gender-neutral.' Immigration is seen as a potential solution, but it remains a politically fraught issue. Raising the retirement age and investing in healthcare are also being considered, but these measures are deeply unpopular. Technology, such as AI and robotics, may help fill labor shortages and budget deficits, but there is no quick fix for the demographic crisis. 'Good local services—such as libraries, swimming pools, and decent childcare — seemed more important than money in encouraging women to have babies,' said Aihio.
