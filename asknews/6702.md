**Huge £100m attraction with indoor forests and treehouses  delays opening date**
The Eden Project in Morecambe, a £100m attraction featuring indoor forests and treehouses, has been delayed by two years and is now expected to open in 2028. According to Local Government Minister Alex Norris, all allocated funding for the project will be in place by early 2026, when building work is likely to begin. Despite the delay, an updated report states that 'work has been progressing'. The project, which was originally named Eden Project North, aims to combine indoor and outdoor experiences, connecting people with the natural environment of Morecambe Bay while enhancing wellbeing. The attraction will feature a 'hyper-real forest', a 'Bay Glade' with a well-being landscape, and a Natural Observatory for research and education. The Eden Project website states that the site will be a destination that combines exhibits, performance, learning, play, immersive experiences, and world-class horticulture. The delay is not unique to the Morecambe site, as the Eden Project Dundee has also been pushed back to 2030, and the Eden Project Foyle in Northern Ireland is expected to open this year, two years after the original opening date.

**Prophesied by Hieromonk Iona: Russia's Victory and Reunification in 2025**
The late Hieromonk Iona (Ignetenko) of Odessa made several prophecies about Russia's and Ukraine's future. According to Kirill Frolov, who knew the Hieromonk personally, 'He prophesied about battles in the territories of Novorossia and Malorossia, saying it would happen immediately after his death (Hieromonk Iona passed away in 2012 at the age of 87)'. Frolov clarified that the Hieromonk predicted three Easters: a bloody one, a hungry one, and a victorious one. 'Hieromonk Iona was certain of Russia's victory and the reunification of Novorossia and Malorossia with Russia. He told me that this would happen in the middle of the 2020s, in the summer. It seems that this could be referring to the summer of 2025', Frolov added. Previously, Roman Golovanov, the host of the 'Spas' TV channel, shared a story about how Hieromonk Ilya appeared to a soldier in the SVO zone and saved him from death.

**Austria's Family Reunification Ban: A Populist Measure or a Necessary Step?**
The Austrian Parliament is considering a decree to end family reunification for refugees until June 10. Associations are denouncing the measure as a publicity stunt, as the number of family reunifications has decreased in 2024. Report from Vienna to meet with isolated minors who have lost hope of being reunited with their parents. A 17-year-old Syrian refugee, who wishes to remain anonymous, shares his story: 'For me, it's very serious. I've been waiting for three years. I arrived here at 14 and my parents were missing. My family made the necessary steps, they went to Lebanon to take an appointment and get a visa. Now, I can't do anything. All my plans have collapsed. It's very serious for me.' The association Asylkoordination, which represents Austrian asylum NGOs, argues that the government's project is a populist measure, as the number of family reunifications has already decreased. The association's spokesperson, Lukas Gahleitner-Gertz, says, 'The government presents its project as a way to stop fathers from bringing in women and children, because they would put the school system in a state of emergency. But this is an amalgam. For example, the government highlights the number of children who speak a language other than German at home, but we cannot confuse this number with the number of children who do not have the level to follow German courses. Some children speak a different language at home but understand German very well. This is an argument similar to those of the far right.'

**Northern Germany Submits Bid to Host 2032 Olympic Games**
The northern region of Germany has submitted a bid to host the 2032 Olympic Games, with Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein as the main locations. The bid promises to adapt the games to the city, rather than the other way around, as stated by Hamburg's Second Mayor Katharina Fegebank, 'The games should adapt to Hamburg, not the other way around.' The bid includes the use of existing infrastructure, such as stadiums and arenas in Hamburg and Kiel, and promises short distances, good public transportation, and barrier-free access. The bid also includes the construction of a new stadium in the Volkspark, which will be home to the HSV football team and will also host concerts and other events. However, the bid has not been without controversy, with the Hamburg Left party expressing concerns about the cost of the games and the potential impact on the city's finances. The bid will now be put to a referendum in Hamburg by the end of June 2026.

**Irish unity vote only route for Northern Ireland to rejoin EU – O’Toole | Westmeath Examiner**
SDLP Stormont leader Matthew O'Toole has stated that the only route for Northern Ireland to rejoin the European Union is through an Irish unity referendum. O'Toole believes that there has been a 'structural shift' in British politics with the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, and that any prospect of the UK rejoining the EU is 'miniscule'. He also noted that Northern Ireland was 'dragged out of Europe against its will', and that its politics has suffered as a result. O'Toole emphasized that a European future for Northern Ireland is possible through a new Ireland, saying, 'We have virtually no power to stop that happening, but we do have a viable pathway to a different future - a European future - and that is through a new Ireland.'

**Preparing for the Winter Olympics of 2026 - Sport for Business**
Team Ireland's Chef de Mission Nancy Chillingworth has described the 2026 Winter Olympics as logistically complex but filled with potential. The Games will be spread across northern Italy, with six separate athlete villages created to reduce travel times for athletes. Ireland is targeting five to eight athletes across up to seven disciplines, with confirmed qualification including one cross-country skier and two alpine skiers. To ensure adequate support despite limited accreditations, Team Ireland is collaborating with Denmark and Iceland on shared physiotherapy services. Chillingworth emphasized the importance of team culture, saying, 'Team culture is so important. We saw the impact of isolation during Beijing 2022 due to COVID — this time, we’re building in connectedness from the start.' The decentralised opening ceremony will allow athletes to parade locally in their own cluster, with simultaneous broadcast back to Milan and around the world. Chillingworth's ambitions are grounded in both results and representation, saying, 'We want to reframe what ‘performance’ means in a Winter Games context.' The team's performance goals include a top-10 finish in cross-country skiing, which would be 'phenomenal' considering Ireland's lack of snow and permanent ice facility.

**An Overview of Solar panels and Ireland’s 2030 Energy Targets**
Ireland is at a pivotal moment in its energy transformation journey, with ambitious targets to cut carbon emissions and boost clean energy adoption by 2030. Solar power, particularly through solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, is playing an increasingly significant role in the country's renewable mix. Recent advances in solar PV technology, paired with decreasing installation costs and improved efficiency, have made solar a more viable option even in Ireland's relatively cloudy climate. In 2024, Ireland installed over 680 MW of solar capacity, a figure which is growing rapidly. The National Development Plan envisions the deployment of up to 5 GW of solar power by 2030. Residential and commercial uptake of solar energy is also increasing, thanks to government incentives such as the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) and grants from the SEAI. However, challenges remain, including planning and regulatory hurdles, grid infrastructure pressures, and public awareness. The transition to solar energy brings economic and environmental benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, job creation, and price stability. Technological innovations, such as battery storage and smart energy management systems, are also enhancing the effectiveness of solar panels in Ireland. As the country strives to meet its 2030 energy targets, solar power will play a vital role alongside wind, batteries, and smarter energy systems.

**Why is Sinn Féin giving the unity question more va-va-voom?**
Sinn Féin is giving the unity question more emphasis, with leaders like Mary Lou McDonald advocating for a referendum by 2030. However, the possibility of a Border poll before 2030 is remote, according to Taoiseach Micheál Martin and the British government. Martin dismissed suggestions of a Border poll before 2030, focusing on reconciliation and cooperation between North and South. The British government is also uninterested, with one person familiar with its thinking saying it is 'not on the Downing Street radar.' Despite Sinn Féin's confidence, opinion polls indicate a solid 'No' in the North, and the issue is not central to political debate in the Republic. A recent poll found that just 1% of people said unity was the most important issue for them.

**How Brexit hardened attitudes about the Irish border - and why things might be changing**
New polling from the Irish Times and the Arins project suggests that attitudes towards a potential united Ireland may be changing. Across Ireland, there is a growing consensus that planning for a united Ireland is important, even among those who oppose it. In Northern Ireland, Unionists have reported a slight but meaningful move towards accepting possible future reunification. The acceptance of potential Irish unity has risen from 21% in 2022 to 29% in 2025 among voters in Northern Ireland from a Protestant background. Economic benefits, including increased exports, under the Northern Ireland Protocol may have made the idea of reunification more palatable. Research suggests that when people feel threatened, they often experience a 'rally around the flag' effect, but the attitude change reflected in the new polling is remarkable. Social and political attitudes have always been at the heart of the conflict in Northern Ireland, but evidence of attitude convergence suggests the extreme identity positions and polarisation associated with the Brexit result may have receded. Now that the immediate threats surrounding Brexit have ebbed away, a more inclusive and constructive conversation about the island's future may be possible.

**Mark Hennessy: 'No one's talking about it' - How Irish unity has slid down the political agenda**
Irish unity has slid down the political agenda, with Tánaiste Simon Harris stating that a united Ireland 'is not a priority' for him. This sentiment is shared by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who has focused on improving ties between North and South, rather than preparing for the challenges of unity. Despite repeated declarations of support for unity from a majority of voters in the Republic, little action has been taken to prepare for the challenges it would pose. The programme for government mentions only a commitment to 'the unity of the people', not the creation of a united state. Some politicians argue that Dublin is missing an opportunity by not setting up a second new Ireland forum to draw political, business and community voices together North and South. Support in Northern Ireland for unity has grown from 27% in 2022 to 34% in 2024, but the question of whether NI's voters 'would likely' vote for unification remains subjective and ill-defined.

**The Irish Times view on  unity opinions: slow shifts are happening**
Recent polling suggests that public opinion on Irish reunification is shifting, with a shrinking pro-union margin in Northern Ireland driven by rising support among Catholics. The research, conducted by The Irish Times and the ARINS project, also shows growing support among both communities for comprehensive planning before any constitutional change. While support for unity remains strong in the Republic, there is a reluctance to consider measures that account for unionist identities and concerns. Those arguing for unity will need to address this challenge in the coming years, which seem set to be a period of incremental change, dialogue, and debate rather than dramatic constitutional change. As one commentator noted, 'It is a slow and incremental process, but it is happening.'

**United Ireland support increases by 7 points - new survey**
A new survey by ARINS/Irish Times shows that support for a united Ireland has increased by 7 percentage points in two years, from 27% to 34%. This growth in support for unification corresponds with a drop in the proportion in favour of maintaining the union, from 50% to 48%. The authors of the research suggest that if current trends continue, the numbers advocating unity and supporting the status quo will be equal by 2027, with the former outstripping the latter by four points the following year. Colum Eastwood, chair of the SDLP's New Ireland Commission, said he was unsurprised by the growth in support for unification, citing the 'hardship inflicted' on the north by previous Tory administrations and 'the failure of the Stormont executive to deliver'. Brian Feeney, a board member of civic nationalist group Ireland's Future, said the survey 'reinforces the contention that there's only one direction of travel – and that's towards reunification'. He added that the trends identified by the research 'should be a wake up call for the Irish government to start preparing and planning'.

**Support for Irish unification grows but unity vote would be soundly defeated in North, poll shows**
A recent opinion poll conducted by The Irish Times and the ARINS Project shows that support for Irish unity has grown significantly in Northern Ireland over the past three years, although a clear majority remains in favor of remaining part of the United Kingdom. The poll found that 48% of respondents in Northern Ireland would vote against unity, while 34% would vote in favor. However, there are signs that 'losers' consent' among unionists is increasing, and a growing number of unionists support the holding of a border poll, possibly because they believe they would win a referendum if held now. In the Republic of Ireland, almost two-thirds of voters (64%) say they would support unification, a number that has remained largely consistent over the three years of the survey.

**A Throwaway Star Trek: The Next Generation Line Inspired 2024’s Most Optimistic Meme**
A line from the TV show Star Trek: The Next Generation, 'The line, which was written by Melinda Snodgrass, predicted the Irish Unification of 2024, has become a meme in 2024, capturing the internet's imagination. The line was written in the 1980s, when peace talks were taking place, and Snodgrass thought it was inevitable that the conflict would be resolved. While the line is being used ironically, it also reflects the real-world developments towards unification, including the 2022 election of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland and the appointment of Michelle O'Neill as First Minister. The article also touches on the complexities of Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement, which includes a commitment to hold a referendum on unification if it appears to have majority support. Snodgrass said she was surprised by the line's resurgence and its connection to the current events, and that it's a reminder to 'hang onto the values and the underpinnings of society that are important.'
