**Ecuadorian Government Apologizes to Victims of Labor Exploitation by Furukawa Textile Company**
The Ecuadorian government has publicly apologized to the victims of labor exploitation by the Japanese-owned Furukawa textile company. This follows a constitutional court ruling last year that ordered the company to apologize and compensate the victims. According to AP news, Labor Minister Ivonne Nunez said on her social media platform X, 'I express my regret over the labor rights infringement case at the Furukawa plantation and will make efforts to build a country that guarantees the rights of workers.' The government held a ceremony in front of the presidential palace in Quito, acknowledging that over 300 workers at the plantation lived like slaves. They also declared May 31st as Furukawa Laborer's Day. The government's apology is part of a compensation order issued by the court last year. The court found that workers at the plantation, owned by Furukawa from 1963 to 2019, were subjected to inhumane treatment, lived in dormitories, and received no safety training, resulting in frequent industrial accidents. The court ordered the company to pay $120,000 in compensation to 342 workers and apologize, but the company has not complied, arguing that the situation changed after the owner changed in 2014 and requesting the government to lift the ban on selling its Ecuadorian properties.

**Maharashtra Government's Decision to Close Animal Markets Ahead of Eid al-Adha Sparks Controversy**
The Maharashtra government has taken a significant decision ahead of Eid al-Adha, which is celebrated on June 7. The Animal Welfare Board of Maharashtra has instructed all Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) to close all animal markets from June 3 to June 8. This move is aimed at preventing the illegal slaughter of animals. In Maharashtra, the slaughter of cows and bullocks is completely banned, and the sale of their meat is also considered a crime. Under this order, all animal markets, including those for goats, sheep, and buffaloes, will be closed for a week. The Animal Welfare Board has issued a circular on May 27 to all APMC, stating that during Eid al-Adha, a large number of animals are sacrificed, so no animal markets should be organized in any village during the first week of June to prevent animal slaughter incidents. The board has implemented this order under the Maharashtra Animal Preservation Act, which imposes strict restrictions on animal slaughter in the state. However, this decision has been met with opposition from various communities, particularly the Muslim community. They have questioned the need to close all markets for a week, as it will not only affect the sale of cows and bullocks but also other animals like goats, sheep, and buffaloes. Farooq Ahmed, the state vice-president of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, has said that the closure of markets will affect the livelihood of farmers, laborers, Kurmi-Khatik community members, and other related professionals. He has also questioned the authority of the Animal Welfare Board, saying that it can only provide advice, not issue direct orders. The Maharashtra government has 305 major and 603 minor APMC, under which there are 292 animal markets in the state. These markets are of great importance to the farming community, where they buy and sell animals during the monsoon season, use them for farming, and then sell them after the harvest due to the cost of their maintenance. During Eid al-Adha, the demand for goats, sheep, and small animals increases in these markets as Muslims buy them. This order will put a stop to all these activities for a week, making it a significant commercial and social issue. In this controversy, the Animal Welfare Board has clarified that its intention is only to prevent the illegal slaughter of cows and bullocks. The board believes that if animal markets are open, the sale of animals for sacrifice during Eid al-Adha will increase, and the chances of illegal slaughter will also increase. However, the closure of markets will affect the income of people involved in the sale of small animals, and a suitable solution needs to be found. The state government needs to make a balanced decision, taking into account the sentiments of all parties, so that both religious faith and the law are respected.

**Ecuador Apologizes to Victims of Modern Slavery on Furukawa Plantations**
The Ecuadorian government apologized publicly to the 342 victims of modern slavery who suffered for over five decades on the Furukawa plantations. The apology was made in Quito's Plaza Grande, in front of the Palacio de Carondelet, and was in accordance with a 2024 court ruling that declared the state and the company responsible for severe human rights violations. The Minister of Labor, Ivonne Núñez, announced that May 31 will be declared 'Día de los Trabajadores de Furukawa' in memory of those who were subjected to conditions of servitude and extreme exploitation. However, the victims are demanding concrete actions and not just promises. As one of the victims said, 'Gracias por las disculpas, pero ¿creen que con las disculpas se sanan las heridas? No. ¿Con las disculpas se reviven los muertos? No. Entonces queremos que esto no quede en la impunidad.' (Thanks for the apologies, but do you think that with apologies the wounds are healed? No. With apologies do the dead come back to life? No. So we want this not to remain in impunity.)

**Ecuador's Apology: Addressing Plantation Slavery | Law-Order**
The Ecuadorian government has publicly apologized to over 300 plantation workers who were subjected to slave-like conditions on a Japanese-owned abaca farm. Labor Minister Ivone Nuñez promised to enhance workers' rights, stating that Ecuador will become a state that upholds human rights. The apology follows a Constitutional Court ruling recognizing modern slavery and ordering reparations. The court highlighted Furukawa's practices from 1963 to 2019, where workers lived in substandard conditions and faced frequent accidents due to inadequate safety training. Former workers claim that Furukawa had not paid due reparations.

**World News | Ecuador Apologises to Plantation Workers Who Were Exposed to 'modern Slavery' Conditions | LatestLY**
Ecuador's government issued a public apology to over 300 plantation workers who were subjected to 'modern slavery' conditions at a Japanese-owned abaca plantation in western Ecuador. The apology, which was one of the reparation measures ordered by the Constitutional Court last year, was made by various members of Ecuador's Cabinet, including Labor Minister Ivone Nuñez, who pledged that Ecuador will strive to 'build a state that guarantees the human rights of workers.' The workers were forced to live in dormitories without basic services and were exposed to common accidents due to lack of safety training between 1963 and 2019. The company, Furukawa, has asked Ecuador's government to lift a ban on the sale of its properties in Ecuador so that it can pay reparations to the workers.

**Ecuador Apologizes to Victims of Modern Slavery and Promises to Defend Their Rights**
The Ecuadorian government has publicly apologized to the victims of modern slavery committed by the Japanese company Furukawa, as established by the Constitutional Court in a 2024 ruling. The government has also promised to work in the 'defense of workers' rights and the right to dignity.' The Minister of Labor, Ivonne Núñez, made the statement on behalf of the government in front of the victims in a ceremony held in Plaza Grande, in front of the Palacio de Carondelet, the seat of the Ecuadorian Executive. The Constitutional Court found that the company was responsible for over five decades of a regime of servitude that anulled the human dignity of the workers. The court identified 342 victims of servitude and also held the ministries of Labor, Health, Economic and Social Inclusion, Education, and Government responsible for not adopting measures to prevent and protect against the violation of the prohibition of slavery by Furukawa. The government has promised to work towards founding a 'guarantor state of workers' rights, human rights, the right to dignity, to live with freedom, to live with one's own thoughts, and to live organized.' The victims received a small plaque recognizing their status as 'victims of grave violations of rights, affected by their poverty and Afro-descendant origin, for over five decades, due to the structural abandonment of state entities.' The victims have demanded that the government not only apologize but also provide reparations and work towards preventing similar situations in the future. 'Thanks for the apologies, but do you think that with apologies the wounds are healed? No. Do you think that with apologies the dead are revived? No. So we want this not to remain in impunity,' said one woman. The victims' lawyer, Alejandra Zambrano, stated that they expected the government to be working on a public policy to address the structural causes that led to the servitude, as ordered by the court. Zambrano emphasized that the victims continue to be affected in their health and without access to housing. 'We have not had knowledge of any concrete and real action from the victims in all these months,' she denounced.

**Ecuadorian Government Apologizes to Victims of Modern Slavery**
The Ecuadorian government apologized to over 300 victims of modern slavery on Saturday, after the Constitutional Court ruled that the Japanese company Furukawa, which has operated in Ecuador since 1963, had maintained a practice similar to slavery on its abacá plantations for over 5 years. The court ordered Furukawa to pay $41 million in compensation to the workers and offer public apologies, which have not been fulfilled. The government also failed to take action, as stated by Labor Minister Ivonne Núñez, who said, 'The State, through the different ministries, made a deaf ear (...) to a situation of this nature.' The victims, who were forced to work for 15 years or more, are demanding that the government fulfill the court's decision and provide reparations. Furukawa has claimed that it does not have the resources to pay the compensation and has criticized the court's decision as 'excessive.' The company also accuses a group of former workers of occupying its property by force. However, the workers' lawyers argue that a court decision allows them to stay on the property to prevent the company from destroying evidence.

**Danish Parliament Reaches Compromise on US Defense Agreement**
A compromise has been reached in the Danish parliament regarding the hearing on the controversial defense agreement with the US, which allows American soldiers access to three airbases in Jutland. The hearing will be held with partially open doors, allowing for a discussion on the sovereignty, jurisdiction, and democratic control of the agreement. Meanwhile, the government has been criticized for not taking sufficient action to address climate change, with a coalition of opposition parties calling for a climate security plan to be developed within the next 100 years. The plan should include measures to help climate-vulnerable citizens, protect critical infrastructure, and establish principles for the placement of government agencies. A 29-year-old man has been sentenced to six years in prison for attempted murder and threats against another man. A 35-year-old man was killed in a shooting in Mørkhøj, Copenhagen, with three men now charged in connection with the case. A 12-year-old girl was in the car with the victim. The police are still searching for unidentified suspects. A new study has found that many Danish pig farms are failing to meet animal welfare standards, with fines issued to one in five farms inspected. The Danish government has launched a new initiative to promote cultural heritage, with a record number of museum visits in 2024. The initiative includes the development of new cultural attractions and the promotion of cultural events. A 33-year-old man was shot by police in Vejle and is being treated in hospital. The police have not released any further information about the incident.

**Around 3,000 farmers can apply for closed nature farming scheme after ‘error’**
The UK Government has apologized for a mistake that caused confusion among farmers who had started applications for the sustainable farming incentive (SFI) scheme. The scheme, which pays farmers for 'public goods' such as insecticide-free farming, was fully allocated for this year, and the Government announced that it would no longer accept new applications. However, a message shown to farmers when they started an application, but had not submitted it, told them they would receive six weeks' notice if the Government needed to close applications. This message was shown in error, and around 3,000 farmers who started applications after January 12 but had not submitted them will now be able to apply for funding up to £9,300 a year. The Government has acknowledged that the restrictions on these new applications are not in the original scheme, but have been put in place to be fair and reasonable to affected applicants. The budget for this year's scheme has already been fully allocated, and the extra applications will have to be funded from other areas of the Environment Department's budget.

**Austrian Government Coalition Reaches Agreement on Pig Farming Regulations**
The Austrian government coalition has reached an agreement on new regulations for pig farming, which will gradually ban full slat floors. The corresponding bill, to be presented to parliament next week, sets an end date for the transition period in 2034, six years earlier than initially planned. This decision comes in response to a constitutional court ruling that deemed the previous regulation, set to expire in 2040, as unconstitutional. The SPÖ Niederösterreich has been advocating for a comprehensive ban on full slat floors for years. SPÖ animal welfare spokesperson Michael Bierbach expressed his satisfaction with the compromise: 'For years, we have been pushing for an end to this animal-cruel system - it was never understandable to us why ÖVP and FPÖ consistently opposed it. It seems that it took the SPÖ's participation in the federal government to finally bring movement to this important issue.' Bierbach emphasized that the new regulation is only a first step: 'It is unbearable that animal suffering has been allowed and even protected by existing framework conditions until now. The new regulation brings improvements, but our goal remains a rapid and complete ban on full slat floors.' Bierbach also highlighted the responsibility towards farmers: 'We have been demanding a package of measures and support for years, which would support agricultural businesses in the transition. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all those in agriculture who already act in the interest of animal welfare, as well as to all those who advocate for an end to this form of housing.'

**Maha agri minister apologises for insulting farmers**
Maharashtra agriculture minister Manikrao Kokate apologized for insulting farmers after a video of his comments went viral. In the video, Kokate accused farmers of defaulting on crop loans and spending the saved amounts on functions like weddings and festivals. He claimed that the comments were made in a light mood and to a friend, but farmers groups and opposition parties criticized him for his remarks. This is not the first time Kokate has faced farmers' ire, as he previously compared them to beggars and was convicted of cheating and forgery in a case dating back over three decades. 'Yesterday, I unintentionally and jokingly said something. If that has hurt the honour and feelings of the Maharashtra farmers, I tender my apology to them,' Kokate said. 'You people take crop loans and then default on them for 5-10 years, so that the loans would be waived. You do not invest money in your farms - the state government gives you financial assistance for everything, from drip irrigation to ponds and pipelines,' he was heard saying in the video. 'Nowadays, even beggars do not accept ₹1, but the government offers crop insurance to farmers for just ₹1,' he had said earlier. Kokate's apology comes after he was convicted of cheating and forgery in a case dating back over three decades, for which he was sentenced to two years in prison.

**Wombat snatcher breaks silence, blasts 'hypocrisy' of Australian government - National | Globalnews.ca**
Sam Jones, a US influencer, has broken her silence after sparking outrage in Australia for picking up a baby wombat and carrying it away from its mother. Jones apologized for her actions, saying she was trying to help the joey, but also attacked the Australian government for its 'hypocrisy' in treating animals. She claimed the government spends 'tens of millions of taxpayer dollars annually' to kill native animals, including wombats, kangaroos, and deer. Jones' comments came after she fled the country as her visa was being reviewed. Australian officials, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, condemned her actions, with Albanese suggesting she should try to 'take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there.' Jones' apology was met with skepticism, with one TV host calling it 'pathetic' that she was unwilling to explain herself. According to reports, wombats are a protected species in Australia, but permits to cull the animals can be obtained in some states.

**'It's pathetic': Wombat woman's final 'lousy' act**
US influencer Samantha Strable, known as Sam Jones on Instagram, has been criticized for her actions in snatching a baby wombat from its mother and has since apologized for her 'mistake'. However, she has also pointed the finger at the Australian Government's 'hypocritical' culling laws, claiming that they allow for the mass slaughter of native Australian animals. The Project hosts Hamish Macdonald and Sarah Harris have slammed her apology as 'pathetic' and 'lousy', with Macdonald describing her as a 'typical' influencer who wants to express her views without taking responsibility or accountability. Strable has since responded to the criticism on Instagram, claiming that she is not calling out farmers or hunters, but rather the media and the lies sold to the Australian public regarding how its wildlife is treated.

**Let us kill beavers if they flood fields, farmers demand**
Farmers are demanding the right to kill beavers if they flood fields, as the government prepares to introduce a new regime allowing licensed introductions of the animals. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) president, Tom Bradshaw, said that any widespread release of beavers must allow farmers to cull them if they are disruptive. Bradshaw stated, 'You've got to have the final control method in place. And if beavers end up in the wrong place, then that lethal control has to be part of being able to have that species reintroduced more widely.' The NFU is concerned that the government's plans do not include provisions for lethal control, which could undermine farmers' flood defences and water carriers. Rob Stoneman, director of landscape recovery at The Wildlife Trusts, said that beavers have been missing from the UK for too long and their return is essential to tackle floods, water pollution, and water scarcity. However, farmers are also facing concerns over inheritance tax, with the government's decision to end exemptions for farmers expected to raise £500 million a year. Environment Secretary Steve Reed apologized for the 'very, very difficult' decision, but farmers remain critical of the policy.

**Immediate Support for Farmers Affected by Bovine Tuberculosis**
The bovine tuberculosis emergency in the province of Isernia, particularly in the area between Pizzone and Montenero Val Cocchiara, requires immediate and extraordinary actions not only from institutions but also from politics. The epidemic has already identified 14 active foci and 9 suspected cases, with the concrete risk that the entire province will lose its status as a disease-free territory. Therefore, with severe consequences for the entire local livestock sector. On this issue, I have submitted a motion in the Regional Council: the Region must demonstrate its full support to the farmers who are seeing their agricultural businesses gradually decimated. We are facing an alarming situation not only from a health perspective but also for the economic repercussions that farmers are suffering due to the forced slaughter of infected animals. It is essential to guarantee immediate compensation and concrete measures for the repopulation of farms, preventing the closure of numerous businesses and the consequent impoverishment of a crucial sector for the Molise economy. Therefore, I ask for a precise commitment from the Regional Government and the Agriculture Minister: we must act urgently, also through the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Sovereignty, and Forests, to ensure the payment of the slaughter indemnity provided by law and identify additional resources for the repopulation of livestock. It is time to demonstrate with facts, not promises, that we are by the side of farmers. Otherwise, the risk that this crisis turns into an irreparable economic damage is extremely high. Dozens of agricultural businesses would go extinct, and we cannot allow that.

**UK Forced Adoption Victims Demand Official Apologies, But Silence Persists**
The victims of forced adoptions in the UK are demanding official apologies from the British government, but the silence persists. Between the 1950s and 1970s, approximately 185,000 women were forced to give up their children for adoption. Many of these women are now elderly and some have already passed away without receiving official recognition for the trauma they experienced. Despite growing public and political support for an official apology, no concrete steps have been taken by the government to address this injustice. Karen Constantine, a leading activist for the Movement for an Adoption Apology (MAA), has stated that 'time is essential'. The women who experienced forced adoptions have suffered immense pain, and an official apology would be an important step in healing the wounds of a generation that is aging. Time is running out, and many of these women may not live long enough to see official recognition. The UK government has rejected a proposal to establish an inquiry into forced adoptions in 2017, considering it unnecessary. However, the demand for justice continues to grow, and the pressure on those in power has increased significantly. Lord Alton, president of the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR), has stated that the government must 'take responsibility for resolving this grave legacy and mitigating the damage that has been done'. According to Alton, it's not about assigning blame, but about recognizing the deep and lasting trauma that has affected millions of people. The situation is further complicated by the death of some of the leading activists for the cause, such as Veronica Smith, who died in 2024 at the age of 83. Smith, co-founder of the MAA, was forced to give up her daughter for adoption in 1964 and dedicated her life to seeking justice for all women involved in this inhumane practice. Other nations have already taken steps, with Scotland and Wales issuing official apologies for the pain caused by forced adoptions in 2023. Nicola Sturgeon, then First Minister of Scotland, emphasized that 'issuing a formal apology is a response to the most serious injustices of our history'. The response of these nations has highlighted the distance between the UK and other countries that have had the courage to publicly acknowledge their past.
