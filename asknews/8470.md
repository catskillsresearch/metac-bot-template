**Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Warns of 'Ostrich-Like' Mentality Amid China's Military Threats**
Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Wang Hsing-huan warned that Taiwan cannot afford to be in a ' ostrich-like' mentality, ignoring the possibility of war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated that China's military action against Taiwan 'may be imminent' and urged allies in the Indo-Pacific region to increase their defense budgets to deter China. Wang pointed out that various US think tanks, frontline Indo-Pacific commanders, and naval combat forces have warned that China will launch an invasion of Taiwan in 2027. China has also set a goal of 'winning a local war' by 2027. Wang emphasized that China's ideal script for invading Taiwan is to 'encircle and blockade' the island, creating pressure on Taiwanese society through localized military actions, and then using pro-China parties in Taiwan to advocate for 'peace talks' and shape international opinion to accept unification. He stated, 'Those who advocate for peace talks are Taiwan's enemies.' To counter China's military threats, Wang suggested that Taiwan must strengthen its military deterrent, solidify its alliances with Indo-Pacific nations, and cultivate an 'unyielding resistance spirit' to prevent China from launching an invasion. 'If China expects a blockade to lead to a long-term war and international sanctions, it will be hesitant to launch an invasion,' Wang said.

**US Warns of Imminent Chinese Attack on Taiwan, China Responds with Fury**
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has warned that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan could be imminent. He stated that Xi Jinping has ordered his army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Hegseth also emphasized that the US is ready to counter China's hegemonic ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. The US has 'returned' to the region and is 'here to stay', but Hegseth urged countries to take responsibility for their own defense without relying on the US. China has responded harshly, saying that the Taiwan issue is 'purely internal' and that no foreign country has the right to interfere. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also warned the US not to 'play with fire' and not to use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had warned that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is increasing its defence spending, aiming to reach 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is on track to receive eight new nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS agreement.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China has warned the US not to 'play with fire' over Taiwan, in response to comments from US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who accused Beijing of preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and attempting to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson in a statement released at midnight. Beijing has expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday warned that the Chinese military 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and hinted at the supposed intention to do so before 2027. 'Let me be clear: any attempt by the Communist Party of China to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world. The Chinese threat is real. And it could be imminent,' emphasized the Pentagon chief on Saturday. China has also warned the US not to 'harbor illusions' about using the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and has announced a formal protest to Washington.

**US Defense Secretary Announces China's Planned Invasion of Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Pita Hegset announced that China will invade Taiwan within two years. He stated, 'The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been instructed to reach the capacity to invade Taiwan by 2027. They are building the necessary military power, training every day, and conducting realistic exercises.' Hegset warned that any Chinese annexation attempt could have devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. 'The threat posed by China is real and could become a reality very soon. We hope it doesn't, but it certainly could.' he said. Chinese Military Academy Vice President Hu Gangfeng responded to Hegset's allegations, saying, 'We do not accept any baseless accusations against China. These accusations are fabrications, distorted facts, and claims made by those who are directly responsible for the crime.' Hegset made these comments in Singapore, where he met with US military personnel and participated in a training session.

**US Accuses China of Preparing to Use Military Force in Asia**
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned that China is 'preparing the potential use of military force' to alter the balance of power in Asia, with the goal of 'dominating and controlling' the region. Hegseth made these statements during the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore on May 31, 2025. He noted that the threat posed by China 'is real and may be imminent', highlighting incidents in the South China Sea, where Beijing has 'illegally militarized' islands claimed by the Philippines, and the situation in Taiwan, which China considers part of its territory. According to the official, Chinese forces are improving their capabilities and training for a possible invasion of Taiwan. In response, the US is strengthening its military presence in the region and has urged its Asian allies to increase their defense spending. Hegseth mentioned that Washington is strengthening cooperation with countries like Japan, the Philippines, and India to deter Chinese aggression. China's embassy in Singapore rejected Hegseth's accusations, calling his speech 'provocative' and stating that the statements are 'imbued with provocations and incitement.' This exchange of statements reflects the growing tensions between the US and China in the Indo-Pacific, amidst commercial disputes and geopolitical rivalries.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**How the US plans to fight off Chinese invasion of Taiwan**
The US Special Forces conducted a drill simulating a war between the US and China over Taiwan. The scenario, which began with Chinese ships crossing the Taiwan Strait with the intention to invade, quickly escalated into chaos with hostile drones and explosions. The drill was a response to Chinese President Xi Jinping's order to be ready to 'reunify' Taiwan with the mainland by 2027. The Chinese military has been building up its forces, boasting one million more troops than the US, a larger navy, and a growing nuclear arsenal set to reach 1,000 warheads by 2030. 'Attention on the floor!' a soldier shouted, 'Sorry to barge in, sir, but you'll want to hear this.' Chinese ships have begun to cross the Taiwan Strait 'with full intention to invade.'

**US Think Tank Warns of Nuclear War if China Invades Taiwan in 2030**
A recent report by the Atlantic Council, a US think tank, has warned that if China were to invade Taiwan in 2030, the Korean Peninsula could become a second battlefield, and a nuclear war may be unavoidable. The report, titled 'Guardian Tiger II', simulated a hypothetical scenario in which China launches a large-scale conventional war against Taiwan, leading to a US-China confrontation. According to the report, North Korea would play a significant role in this conflict, with China and North Korea sharing intelligence and North Korea launching short-range ballistic missiles at US military bases in South Korea. The report warns that the conflict could escalate into a nuclear war, with China using nuclear weapons to cut off Taiwan's external aid and then invoking a military alliance treaty with North Korea to justify its intervention in the Korean Peninsula. The report also suggests that the US may struggle to make a quick decision on whether to use nuclear force in response to North Korea's provocations, given the complexity of the situation. Experts are calling for the US to reorganize its command and control systems in the Indo-Pacific region and to engage in regular trilateral security talks with South Korea and Japan to address the synchronized threats from China and North Korea.

**China's Invasion of Taiwan: The Importance of Port Defense**
According to a recent article by David Axe, a US military expert, if China were to invade Taiwan, it would prioritize attacking ports rather than beaches. The article cites a 2021 report by the 2049 Project, which states that the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) lacks the infrastructure to unload large transport vessels and that landing on beaches would expose them to attack. As a result, the PLA would likely target Taiwan's ports, with five ports - Taichung Port, Kaohsiung Port, Mailiao Port, Taipei Port, and Anping Port - being potential targets. To counter this, Taiwan's military would need to deploy mines, but it is unclear whether the country's leaders are aware of this. According to Ian Easton, a researcher at the 2049 Project, the success of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would depend on the PLA's ability to occupy, control, and utilize Taiwan's large ports. Axe notes that Taiwan's military has a limited number of mine-laying vessels, and that even if all available vessels were mobilized, it may not be enough to create a sufficient minefield to deter the PLA. Axe suggests that Taiwan should rapidly deploy mines, even using commercial ships if necessary, to create a minefield that can effectively deter the PLA. However, it is unclear whether Taiwan's leaders are aware of this and are taking necessary steps to prepare.

**Japan Prepares for Potential Conflict with China Over Taiwan**
Japan is preparing for a potential conflict with China over Taiwan by investing 3.6 billion dollars in new military equipment, including 1,200 missiles and 147 F-35 fighter jets. The country is also participating in joint military exercises with the US and Australia, including the Cope North exercise in Guam, where 250 Japanese airmen and six F-35 fighter jets will be deployed. According to analysts, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan by 2030 is a possible scenario, which would lead to a violent air battle in the skies around Japanese islands. However, China currently has a significant advantage in terms of air power, with a fleet of fighter jets four times larger than Japan's. The involvement of hundreds of American, Australian, and Taiwanese fighter jets could potentially rebalance the forces, but it remains to be seen how the US will react under the leadership of Donald Trump, who has previously defined Canada and Mexico as 'enemies' of the US and threatened to annex territories such as Canada, Panama, and Greenland. 'We are preparing intensively for a potential conflict,' said a Japanese official, 'but we need to know that the US will intervene if China attacks Taiwan.'

**China Challenges Trump with Military Maneuvers, Invasion Barges, and Surprise Exercises**
China has intensified its pressure on Taiwan with massive military exercises, including the use of invasion barges, naval blockade simulations, and air exercises, as a clear challenge to the government of Donald Trump. These actions aim to pressure Taiwan and test the response capabilities of the island and its allies, particularly the United States. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has deployed ground, naval, and air forces around the self-governing island, describing the maneuvers as a 'severe warning' against what it calls 'separatist forces' defending Taiwanese independence. This deployment includes barges designed specifically for massive amphibious operations, capable of transporting large quantities of troops and heavy equipment, which experts interpret as a rehearsal for a possible large-scale invasion. The Taiwanese authorities have strongly condemned these maneuvers, calling them an irresponsible provocation and a risk to regional stability. Meanwhile, the US government has reaffirmed its military support for Taiwan in a context where tensions between Washington and Beijing are escalating. According to the Global Firepower 2025 index, the countries with the greatest military power are: The United States, China, Russia, India, and Japan. The current confrontation between China and the United States over Taiwan not only puts the island's sovereignty at risk, but also the strategic balance in Asia-Pacific. The increasing frequency and intensity of Chinese exercises suggest that Beijing is willing to escalate the situation if it perceives its objectives are threatened. On the other hand, US military support for Taiwan could become a decisive factor in deterring a direct Chinese invasion. However, this support also increases the risk of an open confrontation between the two nuclear powers. For neighboring countries like Japan and South Korea, this scenario reinforces the need to strengthen their regional defenses against Chinese expansionism. In conclusion, while China continues to test the limits with increasingly ambitious military exercises, Donald Trump faces one of the greatest geopolitical challenges of his administration. The immediate future will depend not only on the strategic decisions made by both governments, but also on the role played by other international actors to maintain stability in this critical region.

**China's Military Exercises Raise Concerns About Potential Invasion of Taiwan**
Chinese military analysts believe that China is training to block Taiwan and may be preparing for an invasion. Their predictions are not optimistic. According to the analysts, China's military is conducting large-scale exercises, simulating a surprise blockade of the island. The exercises, which last for 14 days, involve the use of drones, tanks, and American-made HIMARS systems, among other equipment. The US intelligence community considers China to be the 'most comprehensive and serious military threat'. Although the US has not promised to defend Taiwan, it is preparing for the possibility of war with China. The military exercises have identified four key principles for a war over Taiwan: the island must 'hold its ground' against a land invasion; there is no 'Ukrainian model' of gradual escalation, and the US must immediately decide whether to defend Taiwan; military operations must be conducted through Japan; and the US must immediately increase the supply of anti-ship missiles. According to estimates, China may choose 'D-Day' for the invasion in 2026, and North Korea may take advantage of the situation and invade South Korea, using the experience gained in the war in Ukraine. The Chinese military-industrial complex is already working 'in wartime mode', and its shipbuilding capabilities are 230 times greater than those of the US. Analysts predict that China will be ready for a military invasion of Taiwan by 2027. The US is currently following a policy of ambiguity, refusing to say whether it will defend the island or not. China has launched a new type of frigate, scheduled for January 2025. However, some analysts from the RAND Corporation believe that China is not preparing for war, citing the fact that the Chinese military spends up to 40% of its training time on information and propaganda preparation. The Chinese military is also led by political commissars who prioritize loyalty to the party over military effectiveness, making it difficult for military commanders to respond quickly and effectively in combat. China also wants the future war to be 'legally clean' in terms of international law.

**Taiwan's military exercises to focus on invasion preparation**
Taiwan's military is conducting exercises focused on preparing for a potential invasion by China in 2027, a deadline previously mentioned by security experts and military officials. Former US Navy admiral Philip Davidson warned that China could attempt to invade Taiwan by 2027, while Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly instructed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be prepared for an invasion by then. However, Su Tzu-yun, a fellow at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, noted that there is no clear indication a formal decision has been made to resort to force by then. Security analysts worldwide have urged their governments to prepare for a possible conflict, and the Han Kuang exercises' focus on 2027 is a logical response to these concerns, according to Su. 'It could create a perfect storm,' he said, 'if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership.' The defence ministry's 'immediate response drills' were specifically designed to deter China from 'turning exercises into war,' Su added. 'The principle of risk control was followed,' he said. 'It is normal to use timelines as a reference for defence strategy,' Su noted. 'The US military must be prepared for contingencies before then,' said former US Indo-Pacific commander John Aquilino. 'China is accelerating its military expansion, particularly in dual-use shipyards and nuclear weapons launch platforms,' said US Air Force Strategic Commander General Anthony Cotton. 'These developments align with preparations to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027,' he added. 'The US should expedite its own military production in response,' Cotton said. 'It is a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,' said former CIA director William Burns, describing Xi's directive to the PLA. 'China is accelerating its military expansion,' Burns added. 'It will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Davidson. 'Whether or not China launches an invasion in 2027, it will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' he added. 'Alternative deadlines have been proposed, including 2035 and 2049, both of which mark major PLA anniversaries,' Su noted. 'However, if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership,' he warned.

**2027: A High-Risk Period for a Chinese Attack on Taiwan**
Experts warn that 2027 is a high-risk period for a Chinese attack on Taiwan, citing three reasons. First, China's economic and military power is declining due to Western economic and technological encirclement. Second, China wants to take advantage of the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian and Middle Eastern wars to launch a surprise attack on Taiwan. Third, Chinese President Xi Jinping wants to use a successful attack on Taiwan to gain legitimacy for his fourth term. According to former National Defense University Political Warfare College Dean Yu Zong-ji, China has been increasing its military activities around Taiwan, including the deployment of 7 warships in the Taiwan Strait, which is a clear indication of its intention to launch a surprise attack. Yu warns that if China were to launch a large-scale military operation, it would be difficult for the US and Japan to respond in time. He also notes that China's economy and military power are declining, and that it is unlikely to be able to launch a successful attack on Taiwan in the future. The article also mentions that the US has warned that China may attack Taiwan in 2027, and that the US and Japan are taking steps to strengthen their military presence in the region.

**How China is secretly preparing for an invasion of Taiwan**
China is secretly preparing for an invasion of Taiwan, with President Xi Jinping aiming to be in a position to invade by 2027. The US is trying to ramp up its semiconductor chip production, but current projections suggest it won't be anywhere close to self-sufficiency before the end of this decade. China's aggressive shipbuilding strategy and provocative incursions into Taiwan shipping lanes and airspace point to an imminent invasion. The US has not ruled out military action, but so far is confining itself to demands of safe conduct for Taiwan's politicians, journalists and leading businessmen, who are under mass arrest. Japan has offered support to Taiwan, and a hastily assembled task force has set sail from Yokosuka Naval Base. The invasion of Taiwan has now become full-blown war between Japan and China, with the US launching a missile attack on Chinese transport ships in the Taiwan Strait. China has responded with a hypersonic missile attack on the US fleet, badly damaging one Constellation class frigate defending the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. President Xi has threatened to use a nuclear warhead if the US does not withdraw its Navy, and the situation has escalated into a global conflict.

**'2045': A Board Game Simulating a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan**
The Taiwanese board game '2045' simulates a Chinese invasion of Taiwan 20 years in the future. Players must make strategic decisions to prevent the Chinese forces from taking over the island. The game's creator, Chang Shao-lian, explains that '2045' is different from their previous game, which required players to cooperate to win. 'We decided to move away from romanticism and create a game rooted in realism,' he says. The game has raised $122,160 through a crowdfunding campaign and has consulted with experts, including military personnel, political analysts, and national security specialists, to make the game as realistic as possible. Ruth Zhong, a 36-year-old player, says, 'I thought (using a nuclear bomb) was a necessary action to ensure the survival of the island.' The game's creator, Lai Boyea, notes that the game's scenarios are based on real-life exercises conducted by the Chinese military and that the game's developers have studied real attacks to enhance the game's technical credibility.
