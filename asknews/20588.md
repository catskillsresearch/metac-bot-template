**Russia Prepares for War with NATO, Says Danish Prime Minister**
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated that Russia is preparing for war with NATO. According to Danish intelligence, the Russian government believes that Russia is in conflict with Western countries and is preparing for war with NATO. Frederiksen said, 'Today's meeting was dedicated to only one topic - the security of our countries and the security of our continent, restraint and defense. The threat from Russia against all of us is real and serious. Russia continues to wage war in Ukraine. Putin talks about peace during the day, but bombs Ukraine at night. We see a more aggressive Russian approach in the Baltic region.' Frederiksen believes that European countries and Nordic countries need to actively invest in collective security. She stated, 'Therefore, the key (in the face of Russian threats - ed.) is to make tough and necessary decisions at the NATO summit in The Hague, which will be only three weeks from now. In my opinion, what we discussed today - there is only one way to move forward. We need to invest huge amounts of money in our collective security.' The New York Times reported on May 19 that Russia is actively increasing its military presence near the Finnish border. Satellite images show massive construction of new military infrastructure. Finnish military intelligence believes that after the high-intensity phase of the war in Ukraine, Russia will focus its resources on the northern direction. NATO confirmed that Moscow's activity has strategic significance. The border with Finland, which joined the Alliance two years ago, is now the longest line of contact between NATO and Russia - over 1300 km.

**Denmark's PM Warns of Russian Threat, Calls for Collective Security**
Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated that Russia is preparing for war with NATO. According to Danish intelligence, Russia views the conflict with Western countries as a war and is preparing for a conflict with NATO. Frederiksen said, 'Today's meeting was only about one topic - the security of our countries and our continent, deterrence and defense. The threat from Russia is real and serious for all of us.

Frederiksen believes that European countries and Nordic countries need to actively invest in collective security. She stated, 'Therefore, the key (in the face of Russian threats -- ed.) is to take firm and necessary decisions at the NATO summit in The Hague, which will be just three weeks from now.

**Professor Sax: NATO Expansion Will Stop if Ukraine Conflict is Resolved through Negotiations**
Professor Sax believes that if the conflict in Ukraine is resolved through negotiations, Western countries will abandon the idea of NATO expansion to the east, as this would be a necessary condition for a peaceful resolution. However, if the conflict ends in a military victory, it is likely that Ukraine will lose and the idea of its NATO membership will be put to rest. Sax noted that the rhetoric surrounding NATO expansion may either disappear or remain, citing the example of Western leaders' broken promise in 1990 to not expand NATO. Sax also referenced the words of American diplomat George Kennan, who in 1997 called NATO expansion 'the worst decision we made since the end of the Cold War.' Sax concluded that NATO expansion should stop after the war, but cannot guarantee that US or European foreign policy will change. 'If you ask me whether NATO expansion will stop after the war, I would say it must stop. It can stop. But no guarantees can be given that US or European foreign policy will change,' Sax said.

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**Israel to Regional War**
A potential regional war is looming in the Middle East, with various conflicts and issues affecting the region. In Libya, the military situation is frozen due to a geostrategic balance between Turkish support for the Libyan government and Western Libya, and Egyptian and Emirati support for Khalifa Haftar. The Libyan file will be moved slowly or through war, depending on the development of other conflicts in the region. In Syria, President Ahmad Sharif's intentions, backed by the HTS, are unclear, despite reassuring messages to all parties, including Israel. His Islamist background and Turkish affiliation remain present in the minds of many. As a result, Syria's new directions and ambiguity towards any armed conflict in the region are numerous. The Iranian factor is a common denominator in the region's files and issues, from Yemen and the Red Sea in the south to Iraq and Lebanon in the north, with the Gulf and Gaza in the middle. Despite signs of a nuclear agreement between Tehran and Washington, any understanding between them will be limited to the nuclear field. Therefore, Iran will remain the dominant power in the region, particularly in Arab countries, and the confrontation between them and Israel will be likely and open. The Palestinian file remains the main issue in the region's crises and instability since decades. Israel believes it has gained empowerment and capability to build its biblical state, and to subjugate the entire region. The brutal practices against Palestinian civilians in Gaza are a declaration of the launch of 'Greater Israel' in practice. Tel Aviv does not care about any position that does not follow its policies, and it continues to destroy the Gaza Strip and displace its people southward towards the Egyptian border, and to kill and settle in the West Bank, and to prevent foreign ministers from entering the West Bank to meet with Mahmoud Abbas. Israel is pushing Arabs into a corner, as if it is forcing them to choose between two bitter options: either to engage in a catastrophic war with it, or to completely and finally settle the Palestinian issue and surrender to its regional plans. Some Arab countries may accept the second option, but the Palestinian rejection will be decisive and will direct the conflict towards a decisive option, and here the connections between the files and the interests of the parties and their accounts will be quickly revealed. The displacement of Palestinians from the West Bank will pose a significant existential threat to Jordan, and the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza southward will put Egypt in a critical situation, between accepting the refugees or confronting Israel. The confrontation will not be limited to Egypt or Jordan or both, but there will be a crucial and likely stance from the rest of the Arab countries, Iran, and Turkey. Some will surrender, or perhaps the majority, but not all. A simple anthropological analysis is enough to know that the people of powerful countries in the region (before their governments) will rush to stand together when necessary. The collective mind and deep state in countries like Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, Lebanon, Sudan, Iraq, Yemen, and Iran have a deep conviction that the conflict with Israel is over existence, not borders. Similarly, the military doctrine of the armies of most of these countries considers Israel the main enemy. Therefore, from a strategic perspective, Israel's imposition of its control over the region and the settlement of the Palestinian issue poses a vital and direct threat to all countries in the region. However, this threat may be more clear and tangible to the strategic mind in the mentioned countries than others. Israel's expansionist behavior and Washington's support for it will revive an inter-Arab alignment that combines cultural and pragmatic components. The only thing left is to know the timing of this regional war, which will be a direct result of Tel Aviv's arrogance and its lack of control.

**NATO Must Prepare for Possible Russian Attack, Warns German Defense Minister**
German Defense Minister Carsten Breuer warned that NATO must be prepared for a possible Russian attack in the next four years. Breuer stated that Putin's government represents a 'very serious threat' to the Western defense bloc, especially for the Baltic countries, as he has never seen in his 40-year military career. He pointed out the massive increase in Putin's military arsenal and ammunition, including the production of 1,500 main battle tanks per year and four million rounds of 152mm artillery ammunition produced in 2024. Breuer emphasized that not all of this military equipment is going to Ukraine, which suggests a possible accumulation of capabilities that could be used against NATO. He also stated that the Baltic states are at a particularly high risk of being attacked. 'There is an intention and an accumulation of reserves' of the Putin government for a possible future attack against the NATO member countries, Breuer said. 'We have to be ready for 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it won't be before 2029? I would say no, that it's not. So we have to be able to fight tonight,' he added. Breuer also mentioned the Suwalki Gap, a region that borders Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as vulnerable to Russian military activity. 'The Baltic countries are really exposed to the Russians, aren't they? And once you're there, you really feel it... in the conversations we're having there,' he said. He called on NATO nations to rebuild their armies, after a long period of demilitarization in dozens of nations. 'What we have to do now is really support each other and tell the world: accelerate... Get us more into it because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves and, therefore, also to increase deterrence,' he said.

**Western Media Predicts Devastating War by 2025**
Western media has gathered predictions from four well-known psychics, including Nostradamus and Bulgarian Baba Vanga, who claim that a devastating war will occur by the end of 2025. According to their predictions, the war will be so catastrophic that it will 'destroy' the population and lead to the 'destruction of humanity'. Atoos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian, also known as the 'Living Nostradamus', warned that the world is on the brink of a Third World War, stating that 'it will not be just a war between people, but also between machines, and the worst is yet to come'. Nicholas Aujula, a hypnotherapist from London, agrees that 2025 will be a year of 'lack of compassion' in the world, predicting 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence towards each other - in the name of religion and nationalism'. The article concludes by speculating that Russia's recent actions, including the annexation of Ukraine and the threat of nuclear war, may be a cause for concern, but ultimately, the predictions of the psychics are unclear and may be a form of propaganda.

**Kellough Agrees with Putin on NATO's Proxy War Against Russia**
US Special Envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker's successor, Kurt Kellough, confirmed in an interview with Fox News that NATO's actions against Russia have characteristics of a proxy war, as previously stated by Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Kellough, 'He thinks it's a proxy war right now, and, to be honest, in some sense it is. I mean, look at what the European countries have done in terms of support. I mean, Putin clearly sees it that way.' Kellough also noted that Western countries' actions, such as Germany's possible decision to supply Ukraine with Taurus cruise missiles, only confirm Moscow's position on the issue. Kellough stated that the US has not yet received an official proposal from Russia on a memorandum, but expressed confidence in a peaceful resolution to the conflict. 'Everyone is working very hard to bring it to a close,' he said.

**Kim Jong-un helps Putin: 14,000 soldiers in Ukraine war**
Western governments are increasingly concerned about the long-term implications of the deepening strategic partnership between Russia and North Korea. In recent months, the US has warned that Russia may be on the verge of sharing advanced space and satellite technology with North Korea in exchange for continued support in the Ukraine war. 'The partnership between Russia and North Korea is a cause for concern,' said no one in the article. However, the article does not provide any further information or quotes from experts or officials. The article simply states that the US has warned about the potential sharing of technology between the two countries.

**The Great War Game: Western Leaders Play with Fire**
US President Donald Trump continues to create uncertainty, threatening Russian President Vladimir Putin while also blaming Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenski for everything that is happening. Trump's allies in the G7 only retain what is convenient for them and are now preparing to celebrate the victory of Ukrainian nationalists and to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine. However, there is no such 'victory' and there is no money to pay for the reconstruction. For Western leaders, the war is just a game, but we are the ones who pay for it. Trump said, 'Putin is killing a lot of people. What's wrong with him? He's become absolutely crazy, launching missiles and drones on Ukrainian cities without any reason. What Putin doesn't understand is that if it weren't for me, many terrible things would have already happened to Russia, really terrible things. He's playing with fire!' Meanwhile, the new German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has assured that 'the US, Germany, France, and the UK will no longer be able to restrict the range of action of the use by Ukraine of the weapons provided by its Western allies, which means that Ukraine will be able to target deeper into Russia.' The G7 finance ministers and central bank governors met in Canada with the heads of the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, and the Financial Stability Board, and invited the Ukrainian Finance Minister to participate in certain moments of the meeting. In the final statement, the participants declared: 'We condemn the ongoing and brutal war of Russia against Ukraine and praise the immense capacity for recovery of the Ukrainian people and economy. The G7 maintains its commitment to unconditionally support Ukraine in the defense of its territorial integrity and its right to exist, as well as its freedom, sovereignty, and independence towards a just and lasting peace. We agree that the mobilization of the private sector will be important for the recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine, with costs estimated by the World Bank at $524 billion.'

**Russia Accuses Western Countries of Trying to Ignite War in Asia**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed that Western countries want to ignite a war in Asia. He stated that Western countries are trying to pit India and Pakistan against each other. Lavrov made this comment at a diplomatic club meeting in Moscow on the topic of 'Culture: Diplomacy's Role and Development'. He said, 'The recent developments in the Asia-Pacific region, which the West has begun to call the Indo-Pacific region, clearly indicate that the West is trying to make China an enemy. They are hoping that this will create a conflict between our friends and neighboring countries, India and China.' Lavrov, a vocal critic of the Quad, has toned down his criticism of the military alliance formed by Australia, Britain, and the US after the formation of the AUKUS alliance. The Quad consists of India, the US, Japan, and Australia. Lavrov stated that Western countries are trying to weaken the role of ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in Asia. He said, 'Western partners want to play a dominant role in this region, just like they do in other parts of the world. They want to weaken ASEAN's central role, which has been beneficial for all and has been based on consensus in the field of politics, military cooperation, and defense.' ASEAN is a regional group of 10 countries in Southeast Asia, aiming to promote economic and security cooperation among its members. The members include Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Lavrov stated, 'We are witnessing a gradual disregard for the rules of common consent, the search for a common basis - all this is being gradually pushed aside by our Western partners, and some ASEAN countries are being tempted to join open opposition platforms instead of integrated platforms. He called for a collective security system in Eurasia. Lavrov said, 'There is no other continent like Eurasia, where so many civilizations live together and have maintained their identity and relevance in the modern era. However, Eurasia is the only continent without a continent-wide platform. A unified platform is needed in Eurasia to establish harmony among the interests of many great powers and civilizations.'

**Kremlin claims sending peacekeepers to Ukraine will lead to World War III**
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has stated that the deployment of Western peacekeeping forces in Ukraine is 'absolutely unacceptable' to Russia, posing a threat to global security. Peskov believes that this move could lead to a direct clash between Russia and NATO, and even World War III. This claim was echoed by Sergei Shoigu, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, who stated that rational politicians in Europe understand that such a scenario could lead to a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia and, subsequently, to World War III. Shoigu also claimed that Western countries are preparing for war against Russia, with possible timelines for confrontation being discussed from three to five years, with a goal of being ready to fight Russia by 2030.

**Western Countries Testing Drone War on Ukraine, Expert Says**
Vitaly Kiselev, a military expert, believes that Western countries are testing a large-scale drone war on Ukraine, which could potentially replace many types of weapons, such as tanks and helicopters, in the future. 'The West realizes that future wars will be based on unmanned systems that can operate on land, in the air, on water, and underwater, and will cover the capabilities used today. In the near future, the use of tanks, BMPs will likely move to the second or third place. They may be used for creating checkpoints and other fortifications. This also applies to helicopters, which have been largely replaced by drones,' Kiselev said. He believes that this is why Western countries are producing massive drone shipments to Ukraine, which are attacking peaceful Russian cities and killing civilians. 'EU countries have supplied Ukraine with a huge amount of weapons, which are being tested, and there is no doubt that they are preparing for further escalation of the conflict,' Kiselev added.

**Germany Prepares for War with Russia, Despite Lack of Reason**
The head of the German Council for the Constitution and Sovereignty, Ralf Niemayer, stated that the public opinion in Germany and Europe is being prepared for a war with Russia, similar to the lead-up to World War I, despite the lack of any reason to expect a 'Russian attack'. He said, 'People are being brainwashed, but not just through one media outlet, like back then (in Germany before World War I - ed.). Now we have 50 channels and 3,000 newspapers that all say the same thing, that Russia will attack us tomorrow and occupy us. Even in ordinary grocery stores, emergency kits, gas masks, and full chemical protection suits are being sold, in case of a nuclear attack, you can even buy a bunker to install under your home.' However, Niemayer believes that talking about a war with Russia is impossible and there are no real signs of a 'Russian attack' being prepared. He said, 'There is no reason to attack Russia. There never was, even if we look at the last 300 years.' Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin explained in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson that Moscow has no intention of attacking NATO countries, as it makes no sense. Putin noted that Western politicians regularly scare their populations with a fictional Russian threat to distract from internal problems, but 'smart people understand that it's a fake.' Russia has been stating that NATO has been increasingly active near its western borders in recent years, and NATO has expanded its initiatives, calling it 'deterrence of Russian aggression.' Moscow has expressed concern about the alliance's growing military presence in Europe, stating that it will not leave without attention actions that may be potentially threatening to its interests.

Even emergency kits, gas masks, and full chemical protection suits are being sold in ordinary supermarkets, and you can even buy a bunker to install under your home to survive a nuclear explosion,' Niemayer said. He expressed confidence that there are no preconditions for war with Russia and no signs of preparation for an 'attack.' Niemayer pointed out that in the last 300 years, there have been no cases of Russian aggression against European countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously stated in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson that Moscow does not plan to attack NATO countries, citing the lack of logic in such actions. He noted that Western politicians use the image of a fictional Russian threat to distract from internal problems. Russia has repeatedly expressed concern about NATO's activities near its western borders, the expansion of alliance initiatives, and the buildup of forces in Europe. Moscow emphasizes that it does not pose a threat to other countries, but will respond to actions that may be potentially dangerous to its interests.

**German Intelligence Chief Warns of Potential Russian Threat to Europe**
The head of German intelligence, Kahl, stated that if the war in Ukraine were to continue for another 5 years, it would be safer for Europe. He made this statement in an interview with Deutsche Welle. Kahl previously warned that Russia could attack NATO by the end of this decade, but now suggests that if the war between Russia and Ukraine ends before 2029-2030, Russia could use its resources to create a threat to Europe sooner. 'A quick end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to use their energy where they really want to, namely against Europe', Kahl said. According to Kahl, Russia aims to restore the global order that existed in Europe in the late 1990s, with no American troops on the continent and an expansion of Russian influence in the West. Additionally, Kahl stated that Russia wants to test the unity of Western countries and the effectiveness of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which considers an attack on one NATO member country as an attack on all. 'We very much hope that this will not happen... But we must assume that Russia wants to test us, check the unity of the West', Kahl noted. The head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, Andrey Kovalenko, reacted to Kahl's statements. 'No, respected, you will still not avoid war with Russia in four to five years because you are lazy and do not want to change your society. Only the Nordics, Poland, and France are ready to resist. But Germany is not capable of even making a Taurus move faster than a year and a half', Kovalenko wrote in Telegram. He also noted that 'it will never be safer' and urged to prepare 'already now'. 'I understand the psychology of the Russians - they will attack NATO countries regardless of us, as long as you are weak', Kovalenko emphasized.

**Russia 'Wants to Test Article 5 of NATO': What It Means and Why It Could Spark a European Crisis**
Russia is planning to test the unity of the Western world, particularly with regards to NATO's collective defense clause, according to Bruno Kahl, head of the German intelligence service BND. In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Kahl stated that Russia is evaluating whether to test the reliability of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on an ally must be treated as an attack on all. 'We hope this is not true and that we will not be put in this difficult position,' Kahl said, acknowledging that 'however, we must assume that Russia wants to put us to the test, test the unity of the West.' The timing of this potential Russian test of the collective defense clause depends on the progress of the war in Ukraine, according to Kahl. If the war were to end before 2029 or 2030, this would allow Russia to use more resources, technical, material, and human, to create a threat against Europe, he observed. 'It is also possible that a concrete threat or a Russian attempt to blackmail Europeans will occur before what was previously calculated,' Kahl added. 'An early end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to direct their energy where they really want, namely against Europe,' according to the head of German intelligence. For Kahl, Russia imagines a future world order that resembles the situation in Europe at the end of the 1990s, when after the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a significant reduction of US forces in the Old Continent began.

**Russia's Plans to Test Western Unity and NATO's Article 5**
According to Tysklands etterretningssjef Bruno Kahl, Russia has intentions to test Western unity and NATO's Article 5 with an attack on a NATO country. Kahl said, 'We hope it's not true and that we won't be put in the difficult situation of it being tested. But we must assume that Russia will test us, that Western unity will be tested.' The timing of a test of NATO's collective defense clause depends on the outcome of the war in Ukraine. If the war ends earlier than 2029 or 2030, Russia may use its technical, material, and human resources to build a threat to Europe earlier, Kahl said. 'It's also possible that concrete threats or extortion attempts from Russia against European countries can occur earlier than expected,' he added. Kahl believes that a earlier end to the war in Ukraine would allow Russia to focus on its main goal, which is Europe. According to Kahl, Russia wants a future power balance that resembles Europe in the 1990s, but with weakened NATO influence and stronger Russian influence westward - ideally without American presence in Europe.

**Ensuring Lasting Peace in Ukraine: The West's Political Will is Key**
According to political technologist Mikhail Sheytelman, the West's political will is crucial in ending the war in Ukraine. If the West had the political will, it could have stopped Putin firmly, but it is not ready to do so. Sheytelman noted that former NATO military committee head Rob Bauer said that NATO would have destroyed Russian forces in Ukraine if they didn't have nuclear weapons. This somehow restrains the West from taking harsher measures. Some Western countries do not believe that Russia's next target will be their allies, the Baltic countries. However, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, and Scandinavian countries understand this well. Western Europe, on the other hand, tries not to think about it. 'They believe that Putin will stop when he takes enough land. For Putin and Russia, there will never be enough. Russia will not stop until it is destroyed as a state, just like Nazi Germany during World War II. This is the only way to establish a lasting peace in Europe,' said Sheytelman. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized Trump's concessions to Putin before the negotiations, and Ukraine will not accept bilateral negotiations with Russia.
