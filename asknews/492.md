**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**UK Defense Reform and Nuclear Potential: Britain Enters 'War Readiness Mode'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive defense reform for the UK's armed forces, which includes expanding the country's nuclear capabilities. According to Starmer, 'the world has changed', and the growing threats from Russia cannot be ignored. The best way to prevent conflict is to prepare for it. The principles of the reform, as stated by the Prime Minister, are readiness for combat, integrated armed forces, and an approach aligned with NATO. The British government has agreed to build at least six new ammunition factories, create a hybrid royal fleet, build 12 attack submarines as part of the AUKUS defense pact with the US and Australia, invest £15 billion in nuclear weapons, and improve living conditions for military personnel. However, Starmer did not specify when the UK will start spending 3% of its GDP on defense, only mentioning the planned increase to 2.5% by 2027. The rise to 3%, according to Starmer, may be possible by 2034. UK Defense Minister John Healey noted that the new nuclear investments will be 'a signal to Moscow', and the country plans to purchase 7,000 long-range missiles and invest in cybersecurity.

**Britain announces $20B boost to make armed forces 'battle ready' - UPI.com**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced plans to inject $20.3 billion into the country's nuclear weapons program to combat the 'threat from Russia' and China and build 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines. The new spending is part of a major Strategic Defense Review aimed at restoring Britain's fighting capability and making it 'war-ready' within two years for a conflict in Europe and/or the Atlantic. Starmer said, 'We are moving to war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces. When we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready, and frankly, to show them that we're ready to deliver peace through strength.' The plan includes six new munitions plants, adding 7,000 new long-range weapons to Britain's arsenal, and investing in improved housing and equipment for members of the armed forces. However, the opposition has criticized the plan, with some questioning the government's commitment to reaching the goal of 3% of GDP in defense spending by 2034.

**Britain's 'War Readiness': £15 Billion Investment in Nuclear Programs**
In light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, British Prime Minister Starmer stated that 'the things have changed' and that the 'frontline' is 'here'. To address this, the government plans to invest £15 billion (approximately €18 billion) in programs for producing nuclear warheads, creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country. The British military is expected to be ten times more powerful by 2035, with Starmer emphasizing that being 'prepared to secure peace through strength' is the most effective way to deter countries that directly threaten the UK.

**Britain to get defence boost to send message to Moscow  --  and possibly Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with the UK building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would 'transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment' and that the 3% goal is 'on track' to be met. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks. The UK will also invest £15 billion in its nuclear arsenal and increase its conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons. Mr. Starmer said re-arming would create a 'defence dividend' of well-paid jobs, and the move is also a message to President Donald Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defence.

**New twist in Russia-Ukraine war as Britain asks for US nuclear-capable fighter jets to..., Starmer govt accuses Putin of...**
The UK is reportedly in talks with the US to acquire a fleet of nuclear-capable fighter jets to enhance its nuclear deterrence against Russia. According to reports, the UK plans to equip US-made fighter jets with nuclear missiles, which could be the largest expansion in UK's nuclear deterrence capabilities. The move has the support of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who believes the world faces its worst nuclear threat since the Cold War era. The UK currently lacks the capability to launch nuclear strikes from the air, but acquiring the US-made F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets would allow it to do so. The deal would also enable the UK to launch nuclear strikes from air, vastly enhancing its deterrence capabilities. Additionally, the Starmer government plans to manufacture 7,000 long-range weapons and increase its defense spending to 3% of the country's GDP by 2034.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. This move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks across the globe. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, has also called for a transformation in how the UK defends itself, saying, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey, is planning to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War. This move includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. The goal is to increase the resilience of Britain in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The funding will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. Sir Keir Starmer said, 'In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests, is vital.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also set to meet with NATO heads of government in The Hague next month to discuss defence spending targets, with NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte suggesting a high defence spend target of 5%.

**Iran and the Nuclear Bomb: 2025, the Year of Diplomacy... or War?**
The West, led by the US, has long suspected Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons. An international agreement was reached on July 14, 2015, to limit Iran's nuclear program. However, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran currently possesses 275 kg of uranium enriched to 60%, exceeding the 2015 agreement's limit by more than 41 times. 'The Iranian nuclear program has never been as advanced,' warns Naysan Rafati, a specialist on Iranian nuclear issues at the International Crisis Group. Experts believe Iran may be just weeks away from having a nuclear bomb. This scenario is concerning, as Iran could use the bomb as a deterrent or to attack its enemies, including Israel. According to Frédéric Encel, a professor of geopolitics, it could also prompt neighboring countries, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey, to develop their own nuclear capabilities. To prevent this scenario, new negotiations are underway. Will it be an agreement or war? Our new video analysis explores the two possibilities.

**US Finds Recipe for China's and Russia's Nuclear Advancement: Project 25**
The US has found the recipe for China's and Russia's nuclear advancement: Project 25, which reintroduces a bomb from the past, the B83. In the US elections, the 'nuclear question' was a recurring topic. Trump will have to face a complex scenario, with growing tensions and imminent deadlines for important treaties. Russia has suspended inspections of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which limits nuclear warheads to 1,550, and its renewal is due in 2026 to avoid an arms race. Additionally, the international agreement with Iran expires in 2025, leaving open the possibility of the country developing nuclear weapons. China may double its nuclear arsenal by 2030, according to the Pentagon. The US already knows what to do. Under this pseudonym, a plan developed by the Heritage Foundation and a group of former Trump government officials is hidden, serving as a political roadmap. The plan proposes radical measures to reform various areas of the US government, with a prominent focus on military and national security policies, and importantly, including the expansion of the country's nuclear arsenal. Among its proposals, it includes the resumption of nuclear tests, the development of new weapons, and the modernization of the nuclear program, challenging international treaties such as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).

**Hiroshima Report 2025: Nuclear Disarmament Progress Minimal, Nuclear Arms Race Underway**
The Hiroshima Report 2025, released on April 18, evaluated the efforts of 34 countries towards nuclear disarmament last year. The report found that nuclear disarmament progress has been minimal, and a practical nuclear arms race is underway. It also expressed concern that the risk of nuclear weapon use is increasing, citing the Russian invasion of Ukraine and rising regional tensions. The report analyzed the trends of the 34 countries, including nuclear-armed states, in three areas: nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, and nuclear security. Russia received the lowest rating in all three areas, with concerns about its nuclear intimidation and the possibility of nuclear weapon use. The US was also criticized for not making progress in nuclear disarmament talks with Russia and China. Kazakhstan, which chaired the third session of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, received the highest rating in the nuclear disarmament category. Japan, as a country that has experienced nuclear bombings, was criticized for being hesitant to participate as an observer in the treaty's conference, earning a 9th place rating. Hiroshima Prefecture Governor, Shigeki Agui, stated at a press conference, 'The taboo against nuclear weapons is on the brink of crisis. I hope the Japanese government will use the momentum of the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the Hibakusha and the 80th anniversary of the bombings to push for nuclear disarmament and abolition.'

**France to Upgrade Airbase to Deploy Nuclear Weapons, Enhance Nuclear Deterrence**
French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday (March 18) that France will invest approximately €1.5 billion (around $1.6 billion) to upgrade a military base, enabling it to deploy nuclear weapons, which will increase the number of nuclear warheads in France. This will be France's fourth nuclear-capable airbase. Macron made the announcement during a visit to Luxeuil, which is also known as the 'Ariane 116' base, located less than 200 kilometers from the German border. Previously, German candidate for Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed his desire to discuss nuclear deterrence with France due to growing concerns about the US withdrawal from the European continent. France's nuclear arsenal is developed independently of NATO and includes submarine-launched ballistic missiles and air-launched nuclear missiles. According to the website of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, France has the world's fourth-largest nuclear warhead stockpile, with approximately 290 warheads as of July 2023. The Luxeuil base plans to deploy the new ASN4G (fourth-generation air-to-ground nuclear missile) hypersonic missile, which will be equipped with nuclear warheads, by 2035. The missiles will be used by two advanced Rafale F5 fighter jet squadrons, consisting of 40 aircraft. The first squadron will be deployed in Luxeuil in 2032 and will enter service in 2033, while the second squadron will enter service in 2036. The two squadrons will be equipped with the ASN4G missile, which will be able to carry a new generation of nuclear warheads and a new type of super-combustion rocket engine, providing stealth capabilities and a flight speed of 6-7 Mach. The planned range of the ASN4G missile will exceed 1,000 kilometers, twice that of the current ASMP-A missile.

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**
According to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.

**Third World War with Nuclear Weapons Inevitable by 2035, Study Warns**
According to a study by the Atlantic Council, a third world war involving nuclear weapons may be inevitable by 2035. The study, which polled 357 political strategists and experts, found that 30% of respondents believed a large-scale conflict would occur by 2035, with 3 out of 10 experts citing the use of nuclear weapons as a major concern. Other major threats to the world community by 2035 include climate change (30%), a new pandemic (1.7%), and increasing financial debt (5.1%). As one respondent noted, 'The world is on the brink of a major crisis, and it's not just about the economy or politics, but about the very survival of humanity.'

**Nuclear Weapons Numbers Continue to Rise, ICAN Reports**
The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has reported that the number of nuclear weapons has continued to increase, from 9,585 in early 2024 to 9,604 in 2025. This is equivalent to just a little more than 146,500 bombs, which is the number that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 and killed 140,000 people. According to the report, 40% of these weapons are deployed, and are ready for immediate use on submarines, land-based missiles, and bomber bases. The report also notes that the total number of nuclear warheads has decreased since the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in 2017, due to the retirement of old nuclear warheads. However, the number of usable warheads has increased steadily since 2017. The report highlights the risks posed by Russia and North Korea's threats to use nuclear weapons in violation of the TPNW. It also notes that 9 countries possess nuclear weapons, and 34 countries use nuclear-armed states as a 'shield' to prevent disarmament. The report calls on the European Union to take action on this issue and urges countries to join the TPNW and work towards global nuclear disarmament. ICAN Executive Director Melissa Parke said, 'This is a moment for nuclear-armed states and their nuclear-armed allies to join the majority and end their opposition to this treaty.'

**Nuclear Weapons Numbers Continue to Rise, ICAN Reports**
The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has announced that the number of nuclear weapons has increased, with 9,585 nuclear weapons in 2024 and 9,604 in 2025. This is equivalent to a small fraction more than the 146,500 bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, killing 140,000 people. The report states that 40% of these weapons are deployed, with some on submarines, land-based missiles, and bombers. Despite the decrease in the total number of nuclear warheads since the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) was adopted in 2017, the number of usable warheads has increased steadily since then, from 9,272 in 2017 to 9,272 in 2025. The report also highlights that Russia and North Korea have threatened to use nuclear weapons in violation of the TPNW. ICAN Executive Director Melissa Parke stated, 'It is time for nuclear-armed states and their nuclear-allying partners to give up their opposition to the TPNW and join the global majority.' Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, added, 'As countries modernize and in some cases increase their arsenals, we can expect this trend to continue unless there is a breakthrough in arms control and disarmament efforts.'
