**EU Climate Advisors Warn of Weak Climate Goal for 2040**
The European Union's (EU) climate advisors are warning that a weak climate goal for 2040 will make it difficult for the EU to achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2050. The EU's climate goal for 2040 is currently being negotiated, and some powerful countries are pushing to lower the ambition level. Ottmar Edenhofer, chairman of the EU's climate council, says that a low goal will 'take the wind out of the transition' and make it difficult to reach the 2050 goal. The EU's climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, argues that flexibility is needed, including the possibility of buying climate credits from poor countries. However, this is seen as a watering down of the EU's climate goals. Jette Bredahl Jacobsen, a Danish economist and member of the EU's climate council, warns that buying climate credits will make the transition more expensive and inefficient. She also points out that the EU has a historical responsibility for climate pollution and should not lower its ambitions. The use of climate credits has also been criticized for being unreliable and even fraudulent. The EU has previously allowed companies to buy climate credits from other countries, but this has caused problems. The UN is currently working on a new set of rules to address these issues. Minister Lars Aagaard (M) wants the EU to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 90% in 2040, but will not comment on whether foreign credits should be included.

**European Climate Change Advisory Council Recommends 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Change Advisory Council recommends that the European Union set a new, ambitious intermediate goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 90-95% by 2040. This is the only value that keeps the EU on a 'solid', 'viable', and 'credible' path to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, as required by the Climate Law. 'We must reduce emissions significantly and quickly. It's the only way to stop and reduce global warming,' said Ottmar Edenhofer, president of the European Climate Change Advisory Council. The council's report, released on Monday, reiterates that the legally binding goal of zero emissions by 2050 can only be realistically achieved with a 90-95% reduction in internal CO2 emissions relative to 1990 levels. This conclusion was reached after analyzing 1,000 possible scenarios of climate impacts and risks caused by increasing greenhouse gas levels. Only five scenarios survived the exhaustive evaluation of compliance with European climate goals and the Paris Agreement targets by 2040, precisely those that predicted a cut above 90% in emissions. According to Edenhofer, the models 'highlight the urgent need for a deep and sustained reduction in emissions and a significant increase in CO2 removal.' The council recommends that the European Commission send a signal to member states to intensify their efforts and establish the 'national emissions reduction target of 90-95% by 2040.' 'The uneven progress between sectors and member states requires a renewed political commitment. What's at stake is the credibility of climate neutrality,' emphasized Edenhofer, when asked about the pressure from European Parliament lawmakers to lower the cut to 85% to avoid compromising the continent's reindustrialization strategy. The scientists consider that defining a more ambitious goal provides greater security and predictability for economic agents, to reduce fossil fuel use and accelerate investment in clean technologies, modernization, and expansion of infrastructure, and electrification. 'The good news is that the EU has made progress in reducing emissions over the past five years, driven by the energy sector transition and the rapid deployment of renewable energies, such as wind and solar. This means that the goal of reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 is within reach, and that the EU is largely aligned with the scenarios that support the recommended interval for 2040,' points out Edenhofer. The Advisory Council also opposes the suggestion from MEPs to include international carbon credits in the calculation of the EU's effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 'We discourage the use of international carbon credits to meet the 2040 target, as they risk diverting resources from national investments and may compromise environmental integrity,' says the report published on Monday. In addition to the new 2040 intermediate goal, the panel of experts recommends establishing three separate objectives for the reduction of raw emissions and for temporary and permanent CO2 removals. Two additional recommendations aim at the bet on cooperation and partnerships for promoting climate action beyond EU borders - not to replace but to complement national efforts -; and the reinforcement of the EU's adaptation policy to climate change, namely through the approval of new legal instruments and measurable objectives. 'The coordination and political action at the EU level are not commensurate with the growing scale of climate threats. Therefore, we recommend strengthening the EU's adaptation framework, not only through the Climate Law but also through future legislation aligned with global objectives for preparation, adaptation, and mitigation,' referred Ottmar Edenhofer, recalling that Europe is the continent that records the fastest warming on the planet. 'Climate change is already affecting Europe. Rising temperatures threaten public health and cause avoidable losses of life and economic damage. And all scientific literature consistently shows that limiting global warming produces global social and economic benefits far superior to the costs of mitigation,' observed.

**EU Experts Call for Ambitious Climate Goal of 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Advisory Council recommends reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 90-95% by 2040, which would also benefit the economy and energy security, according to the experts. The council has reiterated its call for an ambitious climate goal for 2040, which would keep the EU on a credible path to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. If the goal is set too low, it would undermine the EU's long-term competitiveness and energy security, especially in a time of geopolitical uncertainty, the experts warn. The EU currently aims to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990, and the Commission has concluded that this goal is achievable. The EU also aims to become climate-neutral by 2050, but a binding intermediate goal for 2040 is still missing. The Commission had recommended reducing net emissions by at least 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 in 2024, and a draft law is expected in early July. The EU member states and the European Parliament will then negotiate the proposal, which is expected to be contentious. Some in the European Parliament and among the EU member states consider 90% to be too ambitious, and the Commission is expected to introduce more flexibility to achieve the goal, such as recognizing carbon credits from non-EU countries. The Climate Advisory Council advises against international emissions credits, instead recommending that the reduction be achieved through domestic EU measures.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**UK to Boost Naval Fleet with 12 New Attack Submarines**
The British government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is increasing its naval fleet with the addition of 12 new attack submarines by the end of 2030. According to Defense Minister John Healey, 'We know that threats are increasing. We must act decisively to defend against Russian aggression.' The new submarines will be nuclear-powered and equipped with conventional weapons, replacing the current fleet of seven submarines. The project is part of the Aukus security partnership between the UK, US, and Australia. This move comes as other European leaders, including Starmer, are strengthening their defense capabilities following US President Donald Trump's call for European countries to take more responsibility for their own security. The EU has also established a 150 billion euro defense fund to support member states' defense investments, aiming to reach up to 800 billion euros by 2030.

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**State Secretary Implements 88 Million Euro Cut in Care for People with Disabilities**
Dutch State Secretary Vicky Maeijer has decided to implement a 88 million euro per year cut in the care for people with disabilities. This decision has been met with anger from the sector, with the Vereniging Gehandicaptenzorg Nederland (VGN) calling it 'unacceptable and unbearable'. The cut was previously announced by the previous cabinet, but not implemented due to controversy. Maeijer writes that the measure is 'necessary in the light of sustainable government finances'. According to VGN director Theo van Uum, this will have significant consequences for his sector, including 1500 fewer people providing care and support. The VGN calls the cut 'extremely painful', as zorgorganisaties are already struggling financially. They may have to cut back on treatments such as physiotherapy, ergotherapy, or guidance. The cut comes at a time when the sector is already struggling with personnel problems, with a shortage of 8400 people last year, and predicted to rise to 32,000 by 2033. Van Uum says the cabinet is making a wrong choice, as it will make the care more difficult to access for those who need it most. He predicts that people with an intensive care need will be disproportionately affected, and that the waiting lists will continue to grow. 'Explain that to people who have been waiting for a long time for a place in an institution for their disabled child.'

**EU nears 2030 climate targets with improved NECPs**
The European Union (EU) is on track to meet its 2030 climate and energy targets, according to the European Commission's (EC) latest assessment. Member states have made significant strides in enhancing their National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs), which could lead to a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a 42.5% share of renewable energy. EC Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said, 'Emissions are down 37% since 1990, while the economy has grown nearly 70% — proving climate action and growth go hand in hand.' The EC is urging member states to continue implementing their plans and filling any remaining gaps, and is evaluating Slovakia's final NECP. The EU aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and is working towards allocating public funds to support transformative investments and stimulating private investment.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**EU Expansion: Costa Says Countries Can Join Before 2030 if They Implement Reforms**
According to European Council President Antonio Costa, the stability and prosperity of Europe depend directly on the expansion of the EU. He stated this before his diplomatic tour to six Balkan countries, which are candidates for EU membership. Costa emphasized that his mission in the Western Balkans is to ensure that Brussels maintains strategic control over the region. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the accession process for Ukraine and Moldova, but this is unfair to Western Balkan countries, which should therefore speed up their reforms, Costa explained. European institutions have previously mentioned 2030 as the target date for the accession of countries such as Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia. However, now in Brussels, they only mention Albania and Montenegro. 'I don't have a fixed date. Why 2030? And why not earlier? Accession is a merit-based process. If countries implement reforms, they can join even before 2030,' Costa concluded. Additionally, it was recently announced that the EU plans to provide Ukraine with an additional 900 million euros for the purchase of arms and ammunition. The funds will be allocated from the profits obtained from frozen Russian assets under EU jurisdiction, as per Costa.

**EU Launches Recruitment Drive to Attract Scientists Leaving the US**
The European Union (EU) has launched a recruitment drive to attract scientists who are considering leaving the United States. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, announced a comprehensive support plan for scientists, dubbed 'Choose Europe', at a conference in Sorbonne University in France. The plan includes a new package of 5 billion euros (approximately 8 trillion KRW) for researchers from 2025 to 2027. The EU also plans to establish a new 7-year grant program, called 'Super Grant', for the European Research Council (ERC). Existing research funding for scientists who have moved to Europe will also be increased by 2027. The EU aims to support young scientists and increase funding for researchers with less experience. Von der Leyen emphasized that scientists who choose Europe will receive higher salaries and longer contract benefits. The EU aims to increase research and development investment to 3% of GDP by 2030. The EU has also promised to simplify the process of moving to and living in Europe, and to reduce administrative burdens. This comes after Donald Trump's administration cut research funding, leading to a brain drain of scientists from the US. Von der Leyen criticized the Trump administration, saying that the investment in basic and open research is being challenged, which is a 'huge mistake.' She emphasized that diversity is a valuable asset for humanity and science. The EU plans to establish the 'European Research Area Act' to legally guarantee the 'freedom' of scientific research across Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron criticized the Trump administration, saying that a great democratic country that relies heavily on free science and innovation would not make such a mistake. The conference was attended by representatives from the EU, member states, and non-member states such as the UK, Switzerland, and Norway, as well as academics.

**Kubilius believes Russia could challenge NATO before 2030**
European Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius believes that Russia could challenge the collective defense commitment of NATO before 2030, according to a speech he gave to the Lithuanian Parliament. Kubilius presented the 'White Book on European Defense / Preparation 2030' to the Parliament in Vilna, which was published by the European Commission this month. The idea that Russia could challenge NATO before 2030 reflects the White Book's view that Moscow poses 'a significant strategic threat on the battlefield', which has forced Europe to face 'a high-intensity war on the European continent at a level not seen since 1945'. Kubilius admitted that 'it seems that the general trend is that the US will focus mainly on China and ensuring security in its continent'. As a result, European countries must consider that 'the presence of the US in terms of defense could decrease over time', so it is necessary to assume 'complete responsibility' for their own defense. Kubilius emphasized that the White Book urges all member countries to increase defense spending and improve transnational coordination of the defense industry, and noted that the Baltic states, which border Russia and Belarus, have already taken significant measures in this regard. 'I want to congratulate the Lithuanian government and welcome their decision to reach 5% of GDP in defense by 2026. Because this shows that Lithuania understands the situation very well. And in this regard, Lithuania acts as an example of how to react to the situation,' he said. Kubilius also emphasized that supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia and the future integration of Ukraine's defense industry with the European one are fundamental parts of the White Book. 'It is important that the White Book on European defense includes the defense of Ukraine as part of European defense,' he said, and called for measures to sharply increase European defense spending and the capacity of its industry in this sector. 'We cannot work slowly to increase our capabilities slowly. On the contrary, we need large increases and systematic support,' he stated to the Lithuanian deputies.

**Ukraine's EU Accession Could Happen Before 2030, Says von der Leyen**
Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, has praised Ukraine's progress in implementing reforms and its potential for joining the EU before 2030. 'Ukraine is an example of merit, quality, and speed in the reform process,' von der Leyen said in Kiev. 'If it continues at this pace, its accession to the EU could be before 2030.' Antonio Costa, President of the European Council, added that Ukraine's accession to the EU would be 'the most important guarantee of security for its future' and that the EU has already decided that the next institutional cycle will be one of enlargement. 'What Ukraine is doing is impressive, as it is writing a new manual on how to make reforms during wartime,' Costa said, also referencing the work done by Western Balkans and Moldova to achieve enlargement. However, Costa noted that the 27 EU member states must also work to make the necessary reforms to welcome new member states. 'It is essential that Europe participates in peace talks not only to represent the position of the 27 member states, but also that of our partners, such as Norway, Iceland, and the United Kingdom,' Costa added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated the importance of maintaining unity between the US and Europe, saying 'if Ukraine falls, all similar countries, such as Estonia, are at risk due to the Kremlin's policies.'

**EU President von der Leyen: Ukraine may join EU before 2030 if it continues to implement reforms**
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that if Ukraine continues to implement reforms at its current pace and quality, it may become an EU member before 2030. She praised the initiative of Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, calling it 'a very noble initiative, showing great political will and remarkable support'. Von der Leyen emphasized that the process of joining the EU always considers achievements and merits. 'It means having certain conditions and reforms that you must fulfill. You must implement them. Therefore, the conditions for accession must be correct and proper for both the European Union and the country joining. This is always necessary,' she noted. However, she warned that if a specific date for accession is set, other candidate countries will immediately ask for a similar date and will not consider the process. 'But I truly value the existing political will. I would even say that the process based on Ukraine's merits - if they [Ukrainians] continue at the same speed and quality, it may happen to them before 2030,' she said. Von der Leyen also thanked for 'providing a boost' and called for continued hard work from all sides: 'We need to maintain the dynamics.' European Council President Antonio Costa added that Ukraine's accession to the EU would be the most important guarantee of security for Ukraine's future. 'We have already decided that this new institutional cycle [the 2024-2029 period, - UNIAN] will be an expansion cycle for Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans, and we do not know how it will be with Georgia,' he said. He confirmed that this process takes into account the achievements of candidate countries. 'We are working hard from the European Commission to various candidate countries. And it is very impressive what Ukraine is doing,' he added. Costa believes that Ukraine is writing a new manual on how to implement reforms during a war. 'It's hard to imagine, but 'we are very motivated,' he said. He is confident that various EU member states, the European Commission on one side and Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkan countries on the other are working very hard to show results for this expansion.
