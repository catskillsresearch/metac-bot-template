**Russia Presents Ukraine with Nuclear Weapons Requirement**
Russia has presented Ukraine with a requirement regarding nuclear weapons, according to a document obtained by RIA Novosti. The document, which outlines the terms of the Russian-Ukrainian memorandum, states that Ukraine must confirm its status as a non-nuclear state and establish a direct ban on the reception, transit, and placement of nuclear and other WMDs on its territory. This is one of the main parameters of the final settlement of the conflict, as stated in the text of the memorandum. 'The confirmation of Ukraine's status as a state not possessing nuclear and other WMDs, with the establishment of a direct ban on its receipt, transit, and placement on the territory of Ukraine,' is specified in the text of the memorandum.

**Ukraine's Nuclear Option: A Difficult and Costly Endeavor**
Ukraine may consider developing its own nuclear weapons to counter Russia, but it would be a difficult and costly endeavor. According to Alexander Bollfrass, an expert in nuclear armament at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London, 'Ukraine may have the temptation to go nuclear in the long term, without credible security guarantees of the kind that membership in NATO provides.' Ukraine has access to plutonium from the Chernobyl disaster and could use its nuclear power plants to extract material for a bomb in about a year. However, the process would be difficult to keep secret, as both processes are subject to international monitoring. Bollfrass notes that 'any fissile material in Ukrainian territory is under strict supervision by the IAEA' and that 'inspectors would detect immediately the diversion of fuel or plutonium towards an armament program, alerting Russia.' Additionally, building centrifuges clandestinely 'would be difficult to hide from Russian intelligence services,' which already identify daily targets in Ukraine. Retreating from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and expelling inspectors would be a public confession of intentions, triggering immediate sanctions. Bollfrass concludes that 'this option is unviable during a war and would only increase destruction.'

**Russia's Nuclear Doctrine: A Guide to the Country's Nuclear Policy**
Russia's nuclear doctrine, officially known as 'The Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Sphere of Nuclear Deterrence', is a document that reflects the Russian perspective on nuclear deterrence and defines the conditions under which Russia would consider using its nuclear arsenal. The doctrine has undergone several revisions, with the most recent one in 2024, which relaxed the conditions for using nuclear weapons to deter adversaries. According to the doctrine, Russia would consider using nuclear weapons in response to a conventional attack that threatens its existence, a nuclear attack, or the deployment of weapons of mass destruction. The doctrine also emphasizes the importance of maintaining uncertainty and ambiguity among potential adversaries regarding the size and location of Russia's nuclear arsenal. The 2024 revision of the doctrine includes new scenarios for using nuclear weapons, including a conventional attack by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state, or the deployment of ballistic missiles near Russian borders. The doctrine also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent to prevent the escalation of conflicts. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that he has the authority to make the decision to use nuclear weapons, and that he can inform international organizations and countries of Russia's readiness to respond. The doctrine is part of Russia's broader national security strategy, which aims to maintain its position as a major world power. 'Russia will use its nuclear arsenal to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,' said Putin. 'We will not hesitate to use nuclear weapons if our existence is threatened.'

**Netanyahu will obliterate Iran's nuke empire on own terms... and may snub Trump**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly planning to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, with his former advisor stating that 'number one is Iran before everything else' and that Netanyahu's 'main goal is to stop Iran and he needs to put every pressure he can.' The advisor, Shtrauchler, said that Netanyahu would want to do it with US backing, but 'if he sees it's not going, he will find a solution to change the equation with Iran and make sure that they don't have any nuclear weapon at all costs.' This comes as Iran has secretly amassed near weapons-grade levels of uranium and could soon have enough for nine bombs. Trump has cautioned Netanyahu to refrain from striking, arguing that negotiation coupled with the back-up threat of bombing is the ideal exploitation of Iran's vulnerability. However, a source close to the French government has insisted that Iran must be bombed 'immediately' if they develop the capacity to explode a nuke. Former Israeli foreign affairs minister Gabi Ashkenazi warned that military force will be the only alternative if talks hit a wall, stating that 'this is the only potential existential threat to the state of Israel.'

**'A Lot Of Space Before Nuclear Threshold Is Crossed': CDS Chauhan On Operation Sindoor**
Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan stated that there is considerable space before the nuclear threshold is crossed between India and Pakistan, referring to the recent conflict following Operation Sindoor. General Chauhan emphasized that there is a lot of space for conventional operations and that the use of nuclear weapons was never considered during the conflict. He also noted that India has politically established a new 'red line' for its tolerance towards terrorism, in a message to Pakistan. General Chauhan acknowledged that India suffered losses in the early phase of Operation Sindoor, but emphasized that the armed forces swiftly analysed the 'tactical mistakes', corrected them, and carried out further strikes. 'I think there's a lot of space before that nuclear threshold is crossed, a lot of signalling before that, I think nothing like that happened,' General Chauhan said. 'There's a lot of space for conventional operations which has been created, and this will be the new norm.'

**IAEA Expresses 'Serious Concern' Over Iran's Rapid Uranium Enrichment**
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed 'serious concern' over Iran's rapid accumulation of highly enriched uranium, which is nearly enough to manufacture nuclear bombs. According to the IAEA, Iran has stockpiled 408.6 kg of 60% enriched uranium, up from 274.8 kg in February. This represents a nearly 50% increase in just three months. The IAEA has called on Iran to cooperate fully and effectively with its investigation. IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi stated, 'The rapid accumulation of highly enriched uranium is a serious concern.' He noted that no other non-nuclear-weapon state has achieved this level of enrichment. The IAEA also reported that Iran has been conducting nuclear-related activities at three undeclared sites, which could be used as evidence to refer Iran to the UN Security Council. The IAEA's findings come as Iran is engaged in nuclear talks with the US, facilitated by Oman. The US, UK, France, and Germany are planning to submit a draft resolution to the IAEA Board of Governors next month, condemning Iran's non-compliance with the nuclear deal. Israel has warned that Iran's nuclear program is a 'clear warning signal' and called on the international community to take immediate action to stop Iran.

**IAEA Warns: Iran Fails to Declare Secret Nuclear Activities at Three Locations**
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has released a report stating that Iran has been conducting secret nuclear activities at three locations without declaring them. The report, submitted to the United Nations, claims that these locations are part of a coordinated, undeclared nuclear plan implemented by Iran in the early 21st century, which includes the use of undeclared nuclear materials. The IAEA estimates that Iran has 408.6 kg of 60% enriched uranium, an increase of 133.8 kg from the previous report in February, which raises 'serious concerns.' Iran has consistently denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but according to the IAEA, it is the only non-nuclear-armed state to have enriched uranium to 60%. The IAEA claims that Iran has failed to declare nuclear materials or activities at three locations: Lavisan-Shian, Varamin, and Turquzabad. The agency also states that Iran's cooperation with the IAEA is 'not satisfactory' in many areas. The report suggests that Iran's uranium stockpile, concentrated at 60%, has grown rapidly and now exceeds 400 kg, enough to produce nine nuclear bombs if enriched to the military-grade purity of 90%. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has issued a statement saying, 'The international community must take immediate action to stop Iran.' The statement adds that Iran's enriched uranium level 'only exists in countries actively seeking nuclear weapons, with no civilian justification.'

**UN watchdog warns Iran's uranium stockpile nears weapons-grade levels**
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned that Iran's uranium stockpile is nearing weapons-grade levels, with 408.6 kilograms (900.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% as of May 17. This is a short technical step away from the 90% level required for nuclear weapons. The IAEA report stated that Iran is 'the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material,' which is of 'serious concern.' According to the report, approximately 42 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium is enough to produce one atomic bomb if enriched further to 90%. The IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make 'several' nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. Iranian officials have suggested that Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb, while U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program but has 'undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.' Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the report a 'clear warning sign' that 'Iran is totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons program.' Grossi reiterated his urgent call for Iran to cooperate fully and effectively with the IAEA's investigation into uranium traces discovered at several sites in Iran.

**Nuclear Power Reactors and the Next War**
The Nonproliferation Policy Education Center (NPEC) conducted two war games to test the conventional wisdom that targeting nuclear power reactors in a conflict would harm not just the aggressor but also nearby countries. The results suggest that hitting reactors could be a significant event, potentially derailing alliances and disrupting military operations. In the first game, set in 2037 in Eastern Europe, Russia attacked Ukraine's nuclear power plants, resulting in a significant radiological release that drifted into NATO states. In the second game, set in 2026 in East Asia, China nudged North Korea to target South Korea's Kori nuclear plant, causing a massive radiological release and fallout into Japan. The analysis of similar attacks against Bushehr, Iran's large power reactor, yielded dire results. The study concludes that power reactors in wars can make attractive military targets, and that governments need to clarify the military vulnerabilities of large and small reactors and consider effective ways to defend them. 'In the wars ahead, there is no reason to think that nuclear plants won't be off-limits. They'll be targets of consequence,' says Henry Sokolski, executive director of the NPEC.

**Expert Evaluates the Rushed Development of the New American Thermonuclear Bomb**
According to Mikhail Khodaryonok, an expert, the new American thermonuclear bomb is likely to be used against a non-nuclear state, particularly to destroy deeply buried bunkers that cannot be damaged by conventional weapons. The bomb's power, in terms of tritium equivalent, is estimated to be adjustable and could range from several kilotons to 10-15 kilotons, which is sufficient for specific tasks. However, Khodaryonok does not believe that this weapon can be used in a large-scale nuclear war. He thinks that such bombs will make up a small part of the US nuclear arsenal and will be used only in exceptional cases. The accelerated production and adoption of the bomb indicate that the US military-political leadership considers a potential conflict with a non-nuclear state as a relatively real possibility.

**'15 Times More Powerful': China's New Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb Sparks Concern**
Chinese scientists have developed a 'non-nuclear hydrogen bomb' that can cause devastating chain reactions without using any nuclear material. The 2-kilogram bomb, developed by the 705 Research Institute of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, uses a solid-state hydrogen storage material called magnesium hydride. When activated by conventional explosives, the magnesium hydride rapidly decomposes thermally, releasing gaseous hydrogen that ignites in a prolonged inferno. According to Wang Xuefeng, the head of the defense science team that conducted the explosion test, the hydrogen gas explosions ignite with minimal ignition energy, have a wide range of explosion, and trigger flames that rapidly spread outward, spreading widely. The reaction chain begins when the shock waves of the detonation fracture the magnesium hydride into microscopic particles, exposing new surfaces. The thermal decomposition rapidly releases gaseous hydrogen, which mixes with the ambient air. At the lower explosive limit, the mixture ignites, initiating an exothermic combustion reaction. The bomb can cause prolonged thermal damage because the incandescent fireball it produces, sufficient to melt aluminum alloys, lasts much longer than the fleeting 0.12-second flash of TNT. In forced detonation conditions, the maximum overpressure reached 428.43 kilopascals at two meters from the bomb, about 40% of the explosive force of TNT, but with a much wider range of heat projection. Researchers have also examined other potential military applications of the weapon, such as using it to cover a wide area with intense heat and concentrate its power on high-value targets to destroy them.

**China Successfully Detonates Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Warhead in Field Test**
China has successfully conducted a military experiment, the first of its kind in the world, by detonating a non-nuclear hydrogen warhead in a field test within the country. The warhead was able to initiate a series of destructive chemical reactions that resulted in a massive explosion that exceeded the power of traditional explosives made of 'TNT' material. According to the 'Millitary Watch' magazine, the 2 kg warhead caused a fireball that reached 1000 degrees Celsius for two seconds, which is 15 times more powerful than a similar amount of 'TNT' explosives. This is a significant increase in power for many Chinese armaments and ammunition, including ballistic missiles, artillery shells, and air-to-air missiles. The magazine stated that the 'Institute 705 for Research' under the 'Shipbuilding Foundation', a state-owned entity, developed the unique detonation device, which uses solid-state hydrogen stored in magnesium hydride, a material that can store much larger amounts of hydrogen than compressed hydrogen tanks. This compound is ignited using traditional explosives, causing a rapid thermal decomposition that releases hydrogen gas, which ignites in a massive and sustained fireball. Researchers at 'Institute 705 for Research' commented on the results, saying: 'Hydrogen gas explosions can be initiated with minimal ignition energy, causing widespread destruction and releasing massive flames that quickly spread to the surrounding environment. This combination allows for precise control over the intensity of the explosions and facilitates uniform destruction of targets over large areas.' China is the only country in the world capable of producing magnesium hydride on a large commercial scale, with an annual production capacity of over 150 tons.

**China's 'Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb' Misunderstanding: Separating Fact from Fiction**
A recent report by South China Morning Post claiming that China tested a 'non-nuclear hydrogen bomb' has sparked controversy and misinterpretation in the Chinese media. However, a detailed analysis of the scientific article cited by the publication reveals that such claims are far from reality. According to the source, no uranium or plutonium was used in the tests, but rather the activation of magnesium hydride, a substance that releases hydrogen gas upon detonation, which burns and releases a large amount of heat. The reaction is characterized by a brief temperature increase to 1000°C and lasts for approximately 15 seconds, more akin to a controlled sequence of chemical explosions than a thermonuclear synthesis. In contrast, real hydrogen bombs use deuterium and tritium isotopes of hydrogen, which can only react at extreme conditions, requiring temperatures achievable only through the detonation of an atomic charge triggering a thermonuclear chain reaction. The 'non-nuclear' version of the device is purely chemical, not accompanied by energy release comparable to nuclear reactions. It would be more accurate to describe it as an improved thermobaric warhead. The device operates on a double explosion principle: first, a cloud of flammable material is released, and then it ignites, creating a shockwave and high-temperature effects. Such systems are typically effective against targets in enclosed spaces - caves, tunnels, and fortified structures. They not only cause damage through temperature and explosion, but also create a lack of oxygen, leading to asphyxiation. The new Chinese development is distinguished by its longer active phase of burning, lasting up to 15 seconds, which allows it to exert its effects on the target for a longer period in confined spaces, expanding its tactical capabilities. However, even with its unique features, it is incorrect to place this device in the same category as nuclear charges. The power of a nuclear explosion can reach tens and hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius, while in this case, the temperature is comparable to that of kiln for firing ceramics. Therefore, statements in the media about the 'non-nuclear hydrogen bomb' should be viewed with caution. This is a new type of conventional weaponry, not a breakthrough in the nuclear field. Such misunderstandings arise from the coincidence of terms, but their physical and destructive nature are fundamentally different.

**Chinese Scientists Conduct Test of Non-Nuclear Hydrogen Bomb**
Chinese scientists have conducted a controlled test of a non-nuclear hydrogen bomb, causing destructive chemical chain reactions without using any nuclear materials, according to a report by the South China Morning Post, citing a study published in the Journal of Projectiles, Rockets, Missiles and Guidance. The test involved a 2-kilogram bomb that, after detonation, produced a fireball of over 1,000 degrees Celsius for more than two seconds, 15 times longer than equivalent explosions of TNT. The device, developed by the Chinese State Shipbuilding Corporation's Research Institute 705, used magnesium hydride as a material for storing solid hydrogen fuel. According to the study, when activated by conventional explosives, magnesium hydride undergoes rapid thermal decomposition, releasing hydrogen gas that ignites, forming a stable flame. 'Hydrogen gas explosions ignite with minimal ignition energy, have a wide range of explosion, and release a flame that quickly spreads outward,' said a group of scientists led by CSSC researcher Wang Xuefeng. The researchers noted that 'this combination allows for precise control over the intensity of the explosion, easily achieving uniform damage to targets over a wide area.' The hydrogen bomb can cause prolonged thermal damage as the scorching hot fireball it creates lasts much longer than the brief flash of 0.12 seconds after a TNT explosion. Wang Xuefeng and his team conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated the potential of directed energy of this weapon. The study highlighted that with limited detonation, the peak excess pressure reached 428.43 kilopascals at a distance of two meters from the bomb. The researchers also considered other potential military applications of the weapon, including focusing its power on key targets for their destruction. The South China Morning Post notes that the scientific article does not reveal the source of the large amount of magnesium hydride used in the test, nor the conditions under which the People's Liberation Army of China may use this weapon. The newspaper writes that until recently, magnesium hydride could only be produced in laboratories at a rate of a few grams per day.

**Volodin: Union State Security Project to be Considered in February**
The Speaker of the State Duma, Vyaacheslav Volodin, stated that the project on the security of the Union State will be considered in February. He emphasized that 'in the conditions of challenges and threats facing the Union State, questions of ensuring our common security acquire key importance.' Volodin believes it is essential to take all necessary measures to protect the sovereignty of Russia and Belarus, which is crucial for the successful development of our countries and the well-being of our citizens. The State Duma's Council has set a deadline for submitting reviews to the relevant Committee on CIS, Eurasian integration, and relations with compatriots by February 14, 2025. The agreement on mutual security guarantees between Russia and Belarus was signed by Presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko in December 2024 in Minsk as part of the Supreme State Council of the Union State. The agreement highlights the role of Russia's nuclear weapons as a key tool for preventing both nuclear and conventional armed conflicts, as well as a means of deterrence. The parties consider nuclear weapons as an extreme measure that is only applied in case of an immediate threat to sovereignty or territorial integrity. Specific conditions for the use of nuclear weapons are outlined in the agreement, including the possibility of using them in response to the use of nuclear or other mass destruction weapons against either side, or in case of aggression against either side using conventional weapons that poses a critical threat to sovereignty or territorial integrity.

**FAQ: Is Turkey the Next Nuclear Proliferant State?**
Turkey is taking steps towards acquiring nuclear weapons, according to experts. The country has secured a provisional mining agreement with Niger to access uranium, which could be used to produce enriched uranium fuel. Turkey is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), but its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has long suggested that countries have a 'right to enrich' uranium. Erdogan's recent efforts to strengthen Turkey's influence in the region, particularly in Syria, increase the possibility that Ankara will seek nuclear weapons. Turkey's current capabilities regarding nuclear energy production are primarily reliant on Russian assistance, but it is developing a vast nuclear energy production program that could assist a nuclear weapons effort. Experts warn that Turkey would require time to acquire and develop key nuclear weapons capabilities, such as a source of fuel, expertise, and a means to integrate a nuclear warhead on a deliverable missile. Erdogan's aspiration to elevate Turkey as a great power and his emphasis on strengthening conventional military capabilities may also drive his interest in acquiring nuclear capabilities.

**State Duma to Consider Ratification of Security Guarantees Agreement 'Operatively'**
The State Duma (Gosduma) will consider the ratification of the agreement on security guarantees in the Union State 'operatively', according to the Chairman of the State Duma, Vyaacheslav Volodin. Volodin explained that security issues are 'key' for them, and the measures outlined in the agreement will provide additional protection for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the states. This is particularly important in the face of constant provocations from European Union countries, including those bordering Belarus, Volodin emphasized. The agreement on security guarantees between Russia and Belarus was signed by Presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko in December 2024 in Minsk as part of the meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State. As previously reported by 'RG', the agreement highlights the role of Russia's nuclear weapons as a key tool for preventing both nuclear and conventional armed conflicts, as well as a means of deterrence. The parties consider such weapons as an extreme measure that is only used in the event of an immediate threat to sovereignty or territorial integrity. Special conditions for the use of nuclear weapons are specified. They can be used in response to the use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction against either side, as well as in the event of aggression against either side using conventional weapons that creates a critical threat to sovereignty or territorial integrity, as stated by Volodin, 'It was a great day'.
