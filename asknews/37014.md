**Mustafizur gets NOC for IPL after one game in UAE**
The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has granted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to national team pace bowler Mustafizur Rahman for his participation in the ongoing IPL 2025 in India, from May 18-24. This means Mustafizur will be available for Bangladesh's first T20 international against the UAE on May 17, but not for the second match on May 19. He will join Delhi Capitals after their first match and be available for the last two group-stage matches. If Delhi makes it to the playoffs and either Bangladesh or Mustafizur does not travel to Pakistan for a five-match series, he will be available for more matches with the Delhi franchise.

**Elizabeth Warren leads fury at 'crony capitalism' she says hands fortune to Trump buddy**
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and her colleagues are demanding an investigation into how Elon Musk's satellite internet service, Starlink, has benefited from President Donald Trump's policies and actions. The senators claim that Musk has received favorable treatment from foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, Lesotho, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, in exchange for tariff favors. They accuse the administration of engaging in 'crony capitalism' and 'quid pro quo' exchanges, which could be a violation of federal ethics law. Warren and her colleagues have written to top Trump administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and the State Department inspector general, calling for an investigation into the matter. 'The administration had already begun freezing foreign aid projects, and early in the meeting, Cromer... said something that rattled Gambian officials in the room,' reported ProPublica. 'She listed the ways that the U.S. was supporting the country, according to two people present and contemporaneous notes, noting that key initiatives -- like one that funds a $25 million project to improve the electrical system -- were currently under review.' 'The clear implication in Cromer's comments 'was that they were connected,' said Hassan Jallow, a top deputy to Jabbi. Similar discussions have taken place between U.S. officials and the government of Cameroon, where leaders were told they could prove their 'commitment to Trump's agenda by letting Starlink expand its presence there' and warned of the potential 'impact of U.S. aid cuts and deportations.' 'Kenneth Fairfax, who served as U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan, told ProPublica the conversations pushing countries to approve deals with Musk 'could lead to the impression that the U.S. is engaging in a form of crony capitalism.' The senators wrote that the Public Integrity Section at the Department of Justice (DOJ) 'is responsible for investigating potentially criminal conflicts of interest like this,' and called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to initiate a probe. 'The White House's Designated Agency Ethics Official can similarly investigate potential ethics violations by White House officials,' they wrote. 'We ask that the DOJ and the White House investigate whether any officials have pursued a quid pro quo exchange of Starlink access for tariff favors in violation of federal ethics law.'

**Elon Musk Offers Free Internet: Starlink to Connect Smartphones Without Cost Until July 2025**
Elon Musk announced that some smartphone models will be able to connect to the Starlink satellite internet network for free until July 2025. This initiative aims to eliminate barriers to internet access in rural, remote, or areas with poor infrastructure, allowing more people to connect without relying on traditional mobile phone networks. Starlink, developed by SpaceX, has been recognized for its ability to provide connectivity in areas where terrestrial networks do not reach. The new feature will allow users in remote areas without access to traditional mobile networks to send text messages, share their location, and even contact emergency services without the need for a nearby mobile phone tower. This improvement will make a significant difference in rural areas and other remote regions where internet connections are limited or non-existent. However, not all devices will have access to this free service, and it will depend on the device model and software update installed. 'T-Mobile SpaceX' will appear on the screen when the phone connects to the Starlink satellite network. It is essential to note that devices must have the latest software version installed to access this network. Initially, this connectivity will only allow text messaging, location sharing, and emergency service contact. In a second phase, the functionality is expected to expand to include voice calls and internet navigation, increasing the utility of the Starlink network.

**As Elon Musk Secures Saudi Starlink Deal, Elizabeth Warren And Senate Democrats Demand Probe Into Possible Ethics Violations And Accuse Trump Administration Of Helping SpaceX Secure Foreign Deals**
Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are demanding a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration is helping Elon Musk's company, SpaceX, secure foreign deals, potentially violating ethics rules. The call comes after Musk announced that Saudi Arabia has approved Starlink services for aviation and maritime use. The senators argue that Musk may be using his official role and proximity to the President for personal financial gain, potentially harming American consumers and foreign policy interests. They point to Starlink's rapid expansion into countries like Bangladesh and India, where permissions were granted soon after interactions with Musk or during larger U.S. trade negotiations. 'Suggesting that a foreign government adopt Starlink in exchange for relief on tariffs appears to be a textbook case of corruption,' they wrote, urging the Justice Department and the White House ethics office to launch an investigation.

Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, announced that the country will sign a contract with Starlink to provide a reliable internet service within three months.

Griffiths believes that Bangladesh may be the fastest country in the world to implement Starlink, and that it will be a catalyst for other US firms to enter the market. He also mentioned that another multi-billion dollar US firm will be coming to Bangladesh, and that Prof Yunus will be involved in supporting these efforts. Griffiths noted that Starlink's business model in Bangladesh is still being worked out, but that they will need to work directly with the government to get the necessary licenses and spectrum.

**Starlink may soon launch in Bangladesh, following Bhutan**
Bhutan and now Bangladesh may be the next countries to get Starlink, a satellite internet service by Elon Musk's company. The service is already available in around 100 countries and Bangladesh may soon join the list. According to a tweet by Bangladesh's Chief Advisor, Mohammad Yunus, he has discussed the possibility of cooperation with Musk to start the service in Bangladesh. Yunus expressed hope that the service will be launched soon in his country. He wrote on X, 'Musk has given a positive response to starting Starlink services in Bangladesh. High-speed and low-cost internet connectivity can bridge the digital divide in Bangladesh. It can empower education, health services, and economic growth in backward areas. It can also provide a global platform to millions of small entrepreneurs, creating new opportunities for millions of people and integrating the country more closely into the global digital economy.' Starlink has already started its services in Bhutan and has applied for a license in India. Musk has recently met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and it is believed that Starlink and Tesla may soon enter the Indian market. Starlink and Amazon are planning to use their low-earth orbit satellites to provide satellite broadband services in India. However, satellite broadband services have not yet been launched in India as the government is working on the rules for pricing and spectrum allocation.
