**OpenAI to Maintain Non-Profit Structure, Establish Public Benefit Corporation**
OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has announced that it will maintain its non-profit structure, despite speculation about a possible shift towards a more profit-driven approach. The company's for-profit division, established in 2019 to fund AI development, will be transformed into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). This decision comes after intense public and legal pressure, including a lawsuit filed by co-founder Elon Musk, who accused OpenAI of straying from its original mission. The reorganization aims to ensure access to significant capital while maintaining a governance structure anchored to the goal of developing safe and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization with the explicit mission of developing AI for the common good. In 2019, it introduced a for-profit subsidiary to support growing research costs. The new entity raised suspicions about a possible departure from its initial vision, particularly after a significant investment by Microsoft. Tensions within the company escalated in late 2023, when the non-profit board temporarily removed CEO Sam Altman, citing vague issues with transparency and communication. Altman was reinstated five days later, following protests from employees and investors. In September 2024, rumors emerged about a possible complete transformation into a PBC, with the possibility of ceding control of governance and issuing shares to Altman. These rumors sparked criticism, particularly from Musk and Meta, due to potential conflicts with the original mission. Despite this, OpenAI has confirmed that it will 'continue to be controlled by the current non-profit organization.' The non-profit board, responsible for ensuring AGI has a positive impact on humanity, will remain the primary decision-making body and appoint members of the new PBC's board. This configuration, according to OpenAI, will allow for maintaining priority on safety and collective well-being, avoiding the interests of shareholders from prevailing over social objectives. Bret Taylor, president of the non-profit board, emphasized that the decision, made after consultations with regulatory authorities and civic leaders, maintains a structure 'extremely similar' to the current one. However, uncertainties remain about the concrete mechanisms for ensuring effective control by the non-profit. The conversion of the for-profit division into a PBC represents a strategic shift. PBCs, unlike traditional companies, are legally required to balance profit with the pursuit of positive social impact. This allows OpenAI to move beyond the 'limited profit' model that characterized the 2019-born company, while maintaining a public vocation. The PBC structure also provides greater protection against hostile takeovers or pressure from activist shareholders, a crucial advantage in an increasingly competitive AI market. The non-profit will control the PBC and hold a significant portion of the new entity's capital, effectively becoming one of the best-funded non-profits in the world. The value of the stake, to be determined by independent financial consultants, could reach several billion dollars. These resources will be used to support long-term social initiatives in the fields of healthcare, education, and science. The goal is to ensure operational continuity for the non-profit and allocate part of the PBC's profits to projects consistent with the original mission. Some observers, however, question the non-profit's ability to negotiate truly equitable conditions with the commercial side. Both the non-profit and the new PBC will operate under a single mission: to develop an AGI that equals or surpasses human cognitive abilities and serves humanity as a whole. This strategic coherence has become a central theme in OpenAI's narrative. Sam Altman stated he is 'very happy' that both entities share the same vision, as this unites all stakeholders. The PBC's statute will formally integrate the obligation to consider social impact alongside economic returns. However, the real challenge will be maintaining this direction over time, especially in the face of growing commercial pressures and competition from companies like Anthropic and xAI, founded by Musk, which adopt similar structures but lack non-profit supervision.

**OpenAI’s For-Profit Plans: Altman Queries Musk on Coalition Link**
OpenAI has canceled its plans to restructure as a for-profit entity due to public and regulatory pressure. The company will instead become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), taking into account its original mission alongside shareholder interests. OpenAI is querying a group behind a bill that had the potential to threaten its for-profit restructuring plans, asking if they have ties to former co-founder Elon Musk. The group denies receiving financing from Musk, stating it's a 'grassroots' organization funded from various sources. Experts are calling on regulators to prevent OpenAI's proposed restructuring, citing concerns over the potential risks of developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) under a for-profit company's control. They argue that a for-profit entity would prioritize profit over safety, ethics, and benefits to society. OpenAI's recent track record shows worrying patterns of seeming carelessness, including rushing through safety testing and slashing its safety testing time. The company's original mission was to advance digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity, unconstrained by the need to generate financial return. Regulators are being urged to protect the charitable purpose of OpenAI at a 'potentially pivotal moment' in the development of AGI, safeguarding the public.

**Former OpenAI Employees Urge State AGs to Block Sam Altman's Shift to For-Profit Status**
A group of former OpenAI employees, backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other experts, has sent a letter to the attorneys general of California and Delaware, urging them to block the company's planned shift from a nonprofit to a for-profit company. The group is concerned that the transition could lead to a loss of control and accountability over OpenAI's powerful AI technology, particularly if it develops artificial general intelligence (AGI) that surpasses human capabilities. Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, stated, 'Ultimately, I'm worried about who owns and controls this technology once it's created.' OpenAI has responded, asserting that the transition will ensure that the broader public can benefit from AI, and that its for-profit arm will be a public benefit corporation. However, the company's co-founder Sam Altman has been met with challenges, including a lawsuit from Elon Musk, who accuses him of betraying the founding principles of the charity.

**Musk's Consortium Offers $97.4 Billion to Acquire OpenAI**
Elon Musk's investment consortium has offered $97.4 billion to acquire OpenAI, a non-profit organization that controls the startup company for artificial intelligence. Musk stated, 'It's time for OpenAI to return to being the open-source and safety-oriented force for good that it once was.' The offer is supported by Musk's AI company xAI, which could potentially merge with OpenAI after a transaction. Musk was one of the co-founders of OpenAI, but left the company before the rise of ChatGPT, which is now one of the most well-known AI systems. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a non-profit research institution for AI, and four years later, OpenAI LP was established as a for-profit subsidiary, which received investments from Microsoft. The company's unusual ownership structure was intended to ensure the development of 'safe artificial general intelligence' (AGI), which would serve humanity. However, OpenAI is now attempting to convert from a non-profit to a for-profit company to secure the necessary capital for developing the best AI models. Last year, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI's plans.

**Sickening Profits: The Global Food System's Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth - Global Research**
Colin Todhunter's new e-book, 'Sickening Profits: The Global Food System's Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth', examines the capitalist imperative for profit in the modern food system. The book focuses on the situation in Ukraine, where the world's most powerful investment management firm, BlackRock, is heavily invested in the food industry. The e-book describes how people, including children, are being sickened by corporations and a system that thrives on the promotion of 'junk' food laced with harmful chemicals and the use of toxic agrochemicals. BlackRock and other investment firms profit from illnesses and diseases resulting from the food system by having stakes in the pharmaceuticals sector. The book also discusses how lobbying by agri-food corporations and their front groups ensures this situation prevails, and how they are pushing a fake-green, ecomodernist narrative to roll out their new proprietary technologies. The final chapter looks at the broader geopolitical aspects of food and agriculture in a post-COVID world, characterised by food inflation, hardship, and multi-trillion-dollar global debt. The e-book concludes that a paradigm shift is required to address the huge environmental, social, and health issues stemming from the current food system. The People's Autonomous Response to the UNFSS calls for a mass mobilisation to challenge the power that major corporate interests wield, and to privilege the common good over corporate interests. The e-book highlights the need for a more sustainable, equitable, and just food system that prioritises the public interest over profit making.
