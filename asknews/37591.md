**Here's Who Will Probably Win at the 2025 Tony Awards**
ELLE's theater expert has made predictions for the 2025 Tony Awards. The expert believes that 'Maybe Happy Ending' will likely win Best Musical, citing its unique concept, effective use of projections, and strong performances from Darren Criss and Helen J. Shen. However, 'Dead Outlaw' is a possible upset, with its fascinating plot and inventive storytelling. In the play category, 'Oh, Mary!' is expected to win, with Cole Escola's masterpiece being an unequivocal hit. 'John Proctor is the Villain' is the expert's personal favorite, but 'Sunset Boulevard' is likely to take home the prize. In the acting categories, Audra McDonald is expected to win for her performance in 'Gypsy', while Darren Criss will likely win for his role in 'Maybe Happy Ending'. In the directing category, Michael Arden is expected to win for his work on 'Maybe Happy Ending', while Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck's choreography in 'Buena Vista Social Club' is a possible upset. The expert also believes that 'Eureka Day' will win in the play category, and that 'Aronson and Park' will win for their score in 'Maybe Happy Ending'.
