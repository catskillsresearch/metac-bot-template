**Russia Announces Plans for New Generation of Nuclear-Powered Submarines**
The Russian government has announced plans to develop a new generation of nuclear-powered submarines. According to the Russian regime, the program is being developed 'in view of current threats.' The Russian Federation is 'working on the creation of a strategic nuclear-powered submarine of a new generation.' This is stated in the updated Russian government strategy for the development of the shipbuilding industry, reported by the propaganda news agency Interfax. The program is being developed 'in view of current threats.' The creation of main models of surface ships, multi-purpose nuclear-powered submarines, and non-nuclear submarines 'is not currently provided for in the state armament program for the period 2027-2036.' 'Enterprises of the Russian shipbuilding industry are capable of meeting up to 30% of the world market's demand for non-nuclear submarines, which will be 60-70 units in the next decade, including the construction of small and mini-submarines, as well as deep-sea vehicles,' the document states. Within the construction of ships for the far sea and ocean zone, including for the solution of tasks of the Navy in the Arctic, 'surface ships and support vessels of enhanced ice class are being developed and built.' Earlier, it was reported that Russia has begun building mobile storage facilities to protect against a nuclear strike.

**US Navy Announces New Submarines with Nuclear Survival Capability**
The US Navy has confirmed plans to acquire a new nuclear-capable submarine-launched cruise missile system (SLCM-N) by 2034. Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, responsible for the Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, outlined the timeline during a hearing of the House Armed Services Subcommittee. 'We've done a day-to-day of the industry,' he said, referring to the initial contact with contractors. The new missile, designed to be launched from Virginia-class attack submarines, is one of the three main strategic priorities for Wolfe. Currently, the project is in the architectural design phase, focusing on integrating the missile, ensuring compatibility with submarines, designing the nuclear warhead, and training infrastructure. Wolfe emphasized the need for a 'careful balance of resources' to avoid interfering with existing submarine fleet operations. The Navy is working closely with the Strategic Command and Indo-Pacific Command to define an operation that minimizes the impact on attack units. One of the SLCM-N's objectives is to provide the President with a nuclear retaliation capability from the sea in the event of an enemy first strike. 'Over the past year, the SLCM-N program has focused on understanding and determining the system's architectures,' Wolfe explained, mentioning aspects such as telemetry, testing, and platform integration. The Congress strongly supports the development of the missile, including $2 billion in its defense budget proposal for the system and $400 million for the nuclear warhead. The design will follow an 'All Up Round' configuration, compatible with Virginia-class submarine tubes and payload modules, and will have a modular approach to facilitate future updates without modifying nuclear components.

**Russia Works on Development of New Generation of Strategic Nuclear Submarines**
Russia is working on the development of a new generation of strategic nuclear submarines, according to the updated government strategy for the development of the shipbuilding industry. 'Work on the creation of a new generation of strategic nuclear submarines is being carried out within the framework of the interdepartmental comprehensive target program,' the document states. The program takes into account modern threats. Additionally, it is reported that the creation of lead samples of surface ships, multi-purpose nuclear-powered submarines, and non-nuclear submarines 'is not currently provided for in the state armament program for the period 2027-2036.' The document also states that Russia offers a wide range of military equipment and special equipment for export, including submarines, patrol boats, corvettes, and other types of ships. 'Enterprises of the Russian shipbuilding industry are capable of meeting up to 30% of the world market's demand for non-nuclear submarines, which will be 60-70 units in the coming decade, including the construction of small and super-small submarines, as well as manned deep-sea vehicles,' the document states. The document also mentions that the development and construction of surface ships and support vessels for the Navy's operations in the Arctic are underway. In March 2022, Admiral Nikolai Evmenov, then Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, said in an interview with the Ministry of Defense newspaper 'Red Star' that Russia is developing new fifth-generation atomic strategic and multi-purpose submarines. According to official data, the Russian Navy is currently equipped with fourth-generation nuclear and non-nuclear submarines. The series of fourth-generation atomic submarines of the 'Borey' and 'Borey-A' projects, armed with 'Bulava' intercontinental ballistic missiles, will be the basis of the country's maritime strategic nuclear forces for the coming decades, Russian military officials said. The fourth generation includes multi-purpose nuclear-powered submarines of the 'Yasen-M' project, which are carriers of 'Onyx' and 'Kalibr' cruise missiles. It was officially reported that the equipping of these submarines with hypersonic 'Zircon' missiles (Taktycheskoye Raketnoye Vooruzheniye, KTRV) has begun.

**US Interested in Indian Rockets for Orbital Laboratory**
American company Vast, which plans to launch the first commercial space module, a space station, in 2026, is interested in using Indian rockets to transport crew to its orbital laboratory. According to the India Times, Vast's CEO Max Hoat met with the leadership of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) at the World Space Conference to discuss possible cooperation in space technologies. The company is participating in the competition to create a successor to the International Space Station (ISS), which is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2031. Vast plans to launch its Haven-1 space station using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in May 2026. 'We are strictly adhering to the launch schedule for May 2026,' Hoat said in an interview with PTI. The company plans to conduct a series of tests before sending astronauts to the orbital station in July next year. The first module of the larger Haven-2 station will be launched in 2028. Hoat also expressed admiration for the Gaganyaan project, which aims to send a manned mission to space in early 2027 and could be used to transport astronauts to the Vast station. The Indian LVM-3 super-heavy rocket will be used to send the Gaganyaan mission to low Earth orbit. This rocket has already been used for commercial launches of OneWeb satellites. In 2023, NASA signed a five-year free agreement with Vast to help the company develop and implement modules for the future station. Haven-1 has a volume of 45 cubic meters and is designed to accommodate four crew members for two weeks. It includes four sleeping places, several compartments for scientific modules, a common area with a folding table and interfaces for the crew's work. 'We are currently focused on proposals from SpaceX, but we are interested in hearing if there will be a reliable and safe alternative that can be used to transport our clients to our station using Gaganyaan,' Hoat said. As India plans to create its own space station, Vast has stated its willingness to cooperate with ISRO and share its objects. 'Space is one of the most surprising areas of cooperation in the world. Therefore, we are open to ideas. We discussed the possibility of providing access to our station and receiving access to the Indian station in exchange, with subsequent power exchange,' Hoat said. Hoat emphasized that Russia and China, despite having opportunities for manned flights, are not suitable for the US due to the political situation. This makes the situation unique, where only the US and India can become partners in the new space program.

**Turkey Aims to Develop Nuclear-Powered Submarine**
Turkey's Defense Minister, Oramiral Ercüment Tatlıoğlu, has stated that the country aims to develop a nuclear-powered submarine. According to Devrim Yaylalı, an expert on defense industries, this move would put Turkey among the select group of countries that can design, build, and maintain nuclear-powered submarines, including the US, Russia, China, France, the UK, and India. Yaylalı notes that this would not only enhance Turkey's military capabilities but also its global prestige. He also emphasizes the importance of economic and human development in the design, production, and operation of nuclear-powered submarines. Yaylalı believes that Turkey's current projects, such as MİLGEM and MİLDEN, will serve as a foundation for future developments. However, he also warns that Turkey will need to collaborate with other countries or transfer technology to achieve this goal, as it currently lacks the necessary expertise and infrastructure. 'Turkey will be able to project power, conduct reconnaissance, and exert global influence in a more flexible way,' Yaylalı said. 'This strategic access will enable the Turkish Navy to operate in high-risk areas such as the Eastern Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Indian Ocean.'

**AUKUS Submarine Project Advances: UK Representative Briefs US Officials**
The UK's AUKUS Special Representative, Stephen Lovegrove, has been briefing US officials on the project review situation he submitted to the UK government this year. According to the AUKUS agreement, the US plans to sell three Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines to Australia in the early 2030s, with the option for Australia to purchase two additional submarines if needed. The UK will also collaborate with Australia to develop and build a new type of submarine, SSN-AUKUS, using US technology, with deployment starting from 2040. The three countries will also jointly develop advanced weapons such as hypersonic missiles. Australia has paid the first $5 billion installment for the AUKUS nuclear submarine project in February, which is part of the $30 billion investment provided by Australia to the US to enhance US submarine manufacturing capabilities. US Defense Secretary Hagel said he hopes to deliver the nuclear submarines to Australia on time, adding that 'President Trump is very familiar with and supports the AUKUS program and Australia's investment.' Lovegrove has briefed Pentagon officials and congressional members on his report and will meet with US State Department officials. He has also discussed the report with Australian officials in London and Washington and will soon travel to Australia to brief them. Australia will hold a national election on Saturday, with both major parties supporting the AUKUS nuclear submarine project, but the opposition Liberal Party has openly called for increased defense spending. Before Australia acquires the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarines, four US and one UK nuclear submarines will be deployed to the naval base in Perth, Western Australia, to enhance control capabilities over the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific. The US Navy's Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine, USS Minnesota, has already arrived in Perth in March 2025 to begin its deployment under the AUKUS agreement.
