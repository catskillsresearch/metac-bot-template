**10 Trends That Will Shape the Future of Food by 2050**
By 2050, the world's food system will be under pressure due to the need to reach net-zero emissions and a projected global population of over 10 billion people. To reduce food waste, companies will need to rethink the food chain. According to food futurists Morgaine Gaye and Joseph Poore, there will be 10 key trends in food production, consumption, and preparation. These include: 1) 'community meals' where food is shared and valued for its emotional and relational aspects; 2) the end of weekly grocery shopping, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and home delivery; 3) clothing that can grow food, such as shirts with built-in gardens; 4) urban agriculture, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and local food systems; 5) food that absorbs CO2, such as seaweed and shellfish; 6) AI-powered food planning to reduce waste and use 'imperfect' fruits and vegetables; 7) climate-resilient crops, such as quinoa and soy in northern Europe; 8) a return to ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion; 9) 'niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, becoming mainstream; 10) personalized nutrition, with AI-powered meal planning to prevent disease. According to Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Gaye added, 'in the future, we will see significant changes in our daily habits and food models.'

**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Reorganization of Civil Service and Public Employees in 34 Provinces and 3,321 Communes**
The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a directive on the reorganization of the civil service and public employees in 34 provinces and 3,321 communes after the merger. According to the directive, 11 provinces and cities that did not undergo merger will reorganize their civil service and public employees based on the allocated quota for the 2022-2026 period. Meanwhile, 23 provinces and cities that underwent merger will reorganize their civil service and public employees based on the allocated quota, with a focus on improving the quality of the workforce. For communes, the number of civil service and public employees will remain the same as before the merger, and will be reorganized to work in the new communes. The directive also emphasizes the importance of improving the quality of the workforce and reducing the number of civil service and public employees who do not meet the required standards. Specifically, the directive states that each commune will have 32 civil service and public employees, and that the number of employees will be adjusted based on the population size of the commune. The directive also emphasizes the importance of improving the quality of the workforce and reducing the number of civil service and public employees who do not meet the required standards. According to the directive, the Ministry of Home Affairs will work with the Organization Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam to develop a framework for determining the number of civil service and public employees, and will provide guidance to local authorities on how to reorganize their civil service and public employees. 'By 2026, we will have a framework for determining the number of civil service and public employees, and will work with local authorities to reorganize their civil service and public employees,' said Minister of Home Affairs Phạm Thị Thanh Trà.

**Muslims to rule in 44 countries by..., list includes names like..., know about chilling predictions made by Baba Vanga; India's fate will be...**
Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic known for her accurate predictions, claimed that by 2043, Europe would come under Muslim rule, with all 44 European countries falling under Islamic control. According to Vanga, the influence of Muslims in Europe will begin to rise in 2025, gradually growing stronger until a dominant Islamic presence is established in European power structures by 2043. Vanga also predicted that Europe's population would decrease significantly by 2025 due to environmental and geopolitical factors, but this prediction appears to be off the mark. Additionally, Vanga predicted that communist rule will return across the world by 2076 and that the world will ultimately end in 5079 due to a natural event. However, Vanga did not make any similar predictions for Asian countries, including India and Nepal.

**New wave of smaller, cheaper nuclear reactors sends US states racing to attract the industry - Washington Examiner**
The US is witnessing a new wave of smaller, cheaper nuclear reactors, which could be operational as early as 2030. States are racing to attract the industry, with 25 states passing legislation to support advanced nuclear energy last year and over 200 bills introduced this year. Tech giants Amazon and Google are investing in nuclear reactors to meet their power needs. However, the devices face an uncertain future due to lingering public skepticism about safety, growing competition from renewables, and supply chain challenges. The US Department of Energy estimates the country will need an additional 200 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. More than 30 advanced nuclear projects are under consideration or planned to be in operation by the early 2030s, but those would supply just a fraction of the 200 gigawatt goal. According to Marc Nichol of the Nuclear Energy Institute, 'We’ve seen states taking action at ever-increasing levels for the past few years now.'

**China's 'leftover men' drive sick trend**
China's 'leftover men' are turning to mail-order brides due to a shortage of women caused by the one-child policy. Between 2020 and 2050, 30 to 50 million Chinese men will be doomed to bachelorhood. The Communist Party is aware of the implications of the bride crisis, including a looming collapse in the labour force and Party membership. However, importing women remains unpalatable to the predominantly Han ethnic group that dominates the CCP's ranks. Dr Ming Gao, a researcher at Lund University, warns that the large number of leftover men could pose a serious threat to social stability and has been linked to rising crime, especially sexual harassment and assault. The Party hopes to find an alternative to raising a new generation through improved education and automation, but Dr Gao believes this will not be enough to address the issue.

**The Countries Losing Population Fastest**
In 2023, Ukraine was the country losing population the fastest due to the Russian invasion. However, Europe as a whole is the only continent losing population, with a 0.2% decline in 2023. Six European countries are among the 10 fastest shrinking places on Earth: Greece, San Marino, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, and Kosovo. Greece is expected to lose 1 million people by 2050, which could severely impact government revenue, the labor market, and services. Birth rates have fallen significantly in these countries, with Greece's birth rate declining by 30% between 2011 and 2021. Traumatic events, such as the Greek financial crisis and the collapse of communism in the Balkans, have contributed to these declines. Other countries, like Tuvalu, are also experiencing significant population declines due to climate change, economic stagnation, and emigration. 'The country of just around 10,000 people in the Pacific is believed to be one of the first places on Earth to disappear due to a changing climate and rising ocean levels,' said the country's foreign minister in 2021.

**Multiple Apocalyptic Predictions for the End of the World**
According to various predictions, the end of the world is approaching. A solar flare is expected to hit the Earth in 2025, causing a 'total blackout' and internet shutdown worldwide. However, some scientists disagree, citing that the most active phase of the solar cycle will occur in late 2023 to early 2024. Bulgarian mystic Vanga predicted that a conflict in Europe in 2025 will have a devastating impact on the continent's population, followed by the exploration of Venus for energy sources in 2028. By 2033, the polar ice caps will melt, causing a significant rise in sea levels, and by 2076, communism will spread across the planet. Vanga also predicted that humans will make contact with aliens in 2130, followed by a global drought that will affect most countries. The final stage of the apocalypse is expected to occur in 3005, with a war against a Martian civilization, and by 3797, the last humans will leave the planet due to its uninhabitability. Additionally, an Austrian scientist, Heinz von Förster, predicted that the world will end on November 13, 2026, due to overpopulation, and the French Institute of Demographic Research predicts that the world's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, leading to a shortage of natural resources, food, and water. Finally, there are concerns about potential asteroid collisions, including one in 2028 and another in 2029, which could have catastrophic consequences.

**'Revolution': Communist Vietnam seeks to cut 1 in 5 govt jobs | Macau Business**
Vietnam is planning to cut one in five public sector jobs, slashing billions of dollars from government budgets, as part of a 'revolution' to streamline the bureaucracy. The reforms, which will see the number of government ministries and agencies reduced from 30 to 22, are aimed at making state agencies 'safe havens for weak officials' according to Communist Party general secretary To Lam. The cuts will affect almost two million people, with 100,000 already being made redundant or offered early retirement. Some have expressed concerns that the most capable staff may be the ones who leave, while others see the drive as a way for Lam to bolster his legitimacy ahead of the next Communist Party congress in 2026. The reforms are part of Vietnam's push to become a middle-income country by 2030 and leap into the high-income ranks by 2045, despite concerns about the country's potential vulnerability to tariffs under the new US administration.

**'Revolution': Communist Vietnam seeks to cut 1 in 5 government jobs**
Vietnam is planning to cut one in five public sector jobs and slash billions of dollars from government budgets, a move described as 'a revolution' by senior officials. The reforms, aimed at reducing a bloated bureaucracy, will see the number of government ministries and agencies slashed from 30 to 22. Almost two million people worked in the public sector as of 2022, and one in five of these jobs will go over the next five years. According to the government, 100,000 people will be made redundant or offered early retirement, but it has yet to offer clarity on how the much larger target will be reached. Vietnam's top leader To Lam has said that state agencies should not be 'safe havens for weak officials' and that the reforms are necessary to achieve the country's goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2030 and a high-income country by 2045. However, some have expressed concerns that the most capable staff may be the ones who leave, and that the reforms could cause short-term chaos. 'It is painful to talk about,' said Mr Thanh, a pseudonym to protect his identity, who had his 12-year career as a TV producer 'aggressively' terminated last month. 'I used to feel proud telling people about my job. Now I feel like I've lost my honour.'

**Developing economies need immediate and fresh game plan to kickstart growth**
The World Bank has released a report stating that without a sustained improvement in growth rates, only six of today's 26 low-income countries are likely to attain middle-income status by 2050. The report notes that the long-term growth outlook for developing economies is the weakest it has been since the start of the century. By 2030, 622 million people will remain in extreme poverty, and hunger and malnutrition will continue to affect roughly the same number. The World Bank emphasizes that developing economies need an immediate and fresh game plan to kickstart growth, strengthen their capacity to fend for themselves, and seize growth opportunities. With the right policies, some challenges can be turned into opportunities, and developing economies can reap significant rewards by increasing reforms to attract investment and deepen trade and investment ties with other economies.
