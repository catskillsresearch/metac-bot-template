**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**The Lancet Warns of a Critical Point for Generation Z's Health in 2030**
The Lancet has issued an urgent warning about the health of Generation Z in 2030, stating that 'it's at a critical point.' According to the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, which involved young people from 36 countries, the health of future generations is at risk due to various factors. By 2030, problems such as HIV, unwanted pregnancies, and a significant increase in sexually transmitted diseases are expected to return. The commission's co-president, Sarah Baird, notes that 'while alcohol and tobacco consumption have decreased and access to education has increased, obesity and overweight have grown eightfold in some African and Asian countries over the past 30 years.' Mental health issues are also expected to worsen, with a loss of healthy life years due to mental health disorders. The Lancet warns that by 2100, approximately 2 million adolescents will be at risk of catastrophic health risks due to climate change, as well as food and water insecurity. 'The ecoanxiety is a feeling of fear due to the fear of a world collapse due to the impact of climate change.'

**European Week of Testing: A Call to Action for Early Diagnosis and Treatment**
The European region of the World Health Organization reported 112,883 HIV diagnoses and 28,622 cases of hepatitis C, 37,766 of hepatitis B, and 41,051 of syphilis in 2023. However, many cases remain undiagnosed or discovered in advanced stages. To raise awareness for early diagnosis, the European Week of Testing is taking place from May 20 to 26, with over 50 countries participating. In Italy, the Lila - Lega Italiana per la Lotta contro l'Aids organization has increased the availability of rapid, anonymous, and free saliva or capillary tests in 6 cities, with 25 appointments and 96 hours of testing. Dr. Lila said, 'Testare, Trattare e Prevenire' (Test, Treat, and Prevent) is the slogan for this initiative, which aims to promote the importance of timely diagnosis. Early diagnosis allows for timely access to treatments, which have shown excellent results. For HIV, antiretroviral treatments can reduce the viral load to undetectable levels, making the virus non-transmissible. Effective treatments also exist for hepatitis B, and hepatitis C is now curable in almost all cases with antivirals. This initiative aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals Agenda 2030, which aims to eliminate major global infectious threats.

**Yearly blood tests could stop half of cancer cases becoming advanced**
Annual blood tests for early cancer detection could prevent around half of cancer cases from reaching an advanced stage, research suggests. Scientists trialed a multi-cancer blood test on a group of people aged 50-79 and found that yearly screening led to a higher number of diagnoses than usual care, with 370 more cancer signs detected per year per 100,000 people screened. This resulted in 49% fewer late-stage diagnoses and 21% fewer deaths within five years. Study author Peter Sasieni said, 'I am very excited about the science behind these tests, but we need to ensure that the technological game-changer translates to clinical benefit.' He hopes that by 2032, there will be sufficient evidence to determine how many lives can be saved by annual screening, which could lead to a national rollout within the next ten years.
