**Low Hashprice Forces Bitcoin Miners to Sell Record BTC Ahead of $109k ATH**
Public miners sold 115% of their bitcoin production in April, the highest ratio since the 2022 bear market. Despite bitcoin reaching a new record high above $109,000, hashprice has failed to follow suit, standing at $55 per petahash per second. Top players in the mining space, such as CleanSpark and IREN, are expanding their hashrate, with IREN targeting 50 EH/s by June. Meanwhile, miners are shifting to secure new hardware by paying in bitcoin and retaining the right to repurchase at a predetermined price. Mining stocks have bounced back in April, with some increasing by over 60%, but most remain down year-to-date.

**A long shot options trade is wagering on bitcoin to hit $300,000 by the end of June**
A long-shot options trade is betting on bitcoin to reach $300,000 by June 27th, implying a 181% upside from its current price. According to Deribit, trading in call options at this strike price was the second most popular activity on Tuesday. While some analysts, such as Standard Chartered, predict bitcoin to reach $120,000 in the second quarter, Nic Puckrin of The Coin Bureau notes that 'the market needs a catalyst for prices to go parabolic, and while there are many potential catalysts on the horizon, uncertainty still reigns supreme.' Betting odds on Polymarket show that bitcoin reaching $250,000 this year is just 9% likely.

**Bitcoin (BTC) News: 'Buy in May and Go Away' as Crypto Bucks Summer Lull, Analysts Say**
Analysts are predicting a 'buy in May and go away' scenario for Bitcoin, as positive regulatory developments and increasing institutional buying are expected to push the cryptocurrency higher in the coming months. According to Paul Howard, director at crypto trading firm Wincent, a confluence of factors, including U.S.-traded spot bitcoin ETFs and companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury, will drive the price up. Howard noted that the total crypto market cap is poised to reach $4 trillion, which will see Bitcoin cross all-time highs in the coming weeks. Historically, summer months have been slow for crypto assets, but macro and political forces are converging to disrupt the typical seasonal lull. Bitcoin options markets are already flashing signs of investor anticipation, with strike prices at $110,000 and $120,000 for the June 27 expiry drawing heavy volume.

**Bitcoin's Fate Could Be Sealed on June 9, Warns Analyst Dr. Cat**
Market analyst Dr. Cat warns that Bitcoin's fate could be sealed on June 9, when the Tenkan-sen is expected to cross over the Kijun-sen in the Ichimoku chart. According to Dr. Cat, this 'TK golden cross' is a significant indicator that the short-term momentum has finally overcome the long-term trend. As long as the price remains above 99,000 $ and the Chikou-span remains above the price, Dr. Cat sees no reason to abandon the all-time high thesis. However, he notes that if the price is still above the Tenkan Sen at the time of the cross, but has not yet reached the all-time high, it should be considered a warning sign. The June 9 date is also significant for discretionary traders and systematic funds, who see it as a potential turning point for the bull cycle in 2025.

**Bitcoinâ€™s Dominance Could Push MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano to the Next 1,000x Run**
As Bitcoin's dominance continues to grow, analysts are predicting a potential 1,000x run for select altcoins, including MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Cardano. Bitcoin is holding firm above $95,000-$104,000, with analysts projecting a run to $200,000 or even $250,000 by the end of 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling early-stage play, with over $8 million raised and a presale price under $0.001. Industry experts are setting conservative targets at 35x returns, while some models suggest the potential for 50x or more. XRP is trading around $2.60, propelled by regulatory wins, ETF speculation, and a technical breakout. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85 in June and a retest of $3.40 soon after. Cardano is gaining renewed attention, with forecasts for 2025 ranging from $0.83 to a bullish $5.66. Analysts point to advances like Hydra's scaling solution and increased dApp usage as key drivers.

**Germany Sold 50,000 Bitcoin Below $60,000: Here's How Much It Missed Out On**
Germany sold nearly 50,000 Bitcoin at an average price of $57,600 between June 19 and July 12, 2024, netting $2.87 billion. However, if they had held onto the Bitcoin, it would be worth approximately $5.33 billion today, resulting in a staggering $2.46 billion loss in potential profit. Bitcoin prices quickly rebounded after the sale, surpassing $65,000 within a week and $75,000 by October 2024, and have since continued to rise, nearing its new all-time high of $108,000. This highlights the crucial role of timing in crypto markets and raises questions about whether Bitcoin should be treated as a volatile asset to sell quickly or a strategic reserve asset, akin to gold.

**FXNEWS24 |How high can Bitcoin price go? | UK Forex Reviews**
Bitcoin has gained 14% since May 5, breaking $108,000 for the first time since January. Analysts are predicting targets of $140,000 and even $200,000 for 2025. According to popular analyst AlphaBTC, Bitcoin is 'going to all-time highs today', with a chart showing the price trading within an extended ascending parallel channel. Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, said 'Bitcoin is going to an all-time high faster than I expected', with a possible top around $200,000 due to the devaluation of the dollar. Fellow analyst Mags projected a possible top around $215,000 based on Bitcoin's four-year halving cycle. Network economist Timothy Peterson used statistical analysis to assume a trip to at least $115,000 by the end of June, setting a possible top under $130,000. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin's price has formed a rounded bottom chart pattern, with bulls focused on pushing the price above the neckline of the prevailing chart pattern at $106,000. A daily candlestick close above this level would confirm a bullish breakout, ushering BTC into price discovery with the technical target set at $140,956.

**Analyst who nailed 2021 market collapse has a surprising prediction**
Pseudonymous crypto analyst Dave the Wave, who accurately predicted the 2021 crypto market collapse, has made a surprising prediction for Bitcoin's price. According to his analysis, Bitcoin will experience a correction to $90,000 in early June, followed by a rise to $105,000 in late June and then a dip to $100,000 in early July. However, after this correction, Bitcoin is expected to continue rising and break out to $160,000 by the end of September. To meet this target, Bitcoin needs to grow at a monthly compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.22% over the next 4.5 months. Dave the Wave wrote, 'We all want BTC price higher here and now. But if I were a betting man, I'd say the orange not the yellow.' As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $103,087, according to Kraken's price feed.

**Bitcoin Surges Past $107K Before Sharp Pullback as $138M in Futures Liquidated - NullTX**
Bitcoin's price surged past $107K, triggering a liquidation event in the futures market, with over $138 million in long and short positions vaporized. The rapid price swings highlighted Bitcoin's reliance on liquidity and resistance levels. Despite reaching an intraday high, Bitcoin fell short of a critical resistance level at $106.6K, which has become a significant supply zone. On-chain data indicates that approximately 31,000 BTC were picked up at or near this price point on December 16, 2024, and that a large concentration of unspent coins now exist with this cost basis. The correlation between Bitcoin and gold has turned negative in the short term, with a correlation of -0.54, the lowest level seen since February 2022. However, the partial correlations over the medium and long terms remain in place. Traders and investors are anticipating increased volatility in the next few days, with the main level of resistance at $106.6K. If Bitcoin cannot keep the uptick intact, it could slide back toward the $103K level.

**Bitcoin Could Reach New Heights Soon, Experts Say**
Despite the current lack of a crypto rally, experts believe that new highs for Bitcoin are possible soon. According to Timothy Peterson, a crypto expert, Bitcoin is near the lower end of its historical seasonal range and is likely to reach a new all-time high before June. Another expert, 'PlanB', notes that Bitcoin has doubled in value every year since 2023, from $20,000 to $40,000 in 2023, and then to over $80,000 in 2024. Based on this logic, Bitcoin could reach $160,000 by the end of 2025 and $640,000 by 2027. However, experts caution that past performance is not a guarantee of future success and that Bitcoin's volatility is higher than the broader stock market. 'It is throughly possible that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high before June,' said Timothy Peterson. 'Bitcoin has doubled in value every year since 2023, and it's not impossible that it will continue to do so,' added 'PlanB'.

**Bitcoin Today 17/03: Targets $126K by June (Chart)**
Bitcoin is showing signs of a bullish trend, with one analyst predicting it could exceed $125,000 per coin as early as this summer. According to network economist Timothy Peterson, Bitcoin is trading near the low end of its historical seasonal range and has the potential to hit new all-time highs by June. Peterson suggests a median target of $126,000 by June 1, 2025, and notes that corrections in bull market performance have always been temporary. Bitcoin's price has painted a V-shaped recovery chart pattern, projecting a massive move upward, and its relative strength index has increased from an oversold condition to 43, suggesting that bullish momentum is picking up. 'Bitcoin is trading near the low end of its historical seasonal range,' Peterson said. 'Nearly all of Bitcoin's annual performance occurs in 2 months: April and October. It is entirely possible Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June.'

**Bitcoin gets $126K June target as data predicts bull market comeback**
According to Timothy Peterson, Bitcoin's recent decline of 30% after topping out in mid-January is characteristic of a bull market correction. Peterson believes that April could spark a 50% BTC price upside, and nearly all of Bitcoin's annual performance occurs in 2 months: April and October. He predicts that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June, with a median target of $126,000. Peterson's Lowest Price Forward metric has successfully predicted levels below which BTC/USD never falls after a crossing above them. Rekt Capital also emphasizes that Bitcoin's recent trip to $76,000 is standard corrective behavior, and that the current cycle has seen five major pullbacks since the start of 2023.

**Crypto: Is the lowest sentiment the best moment to buy? - South Africa Today**
The Fear and Greed Index has fallen to 10, indicating extreme fear in the crypto market, a level not seen since June 2022. This could be a good buy point, but experience suggests it may not be the lowest price point. Bitcoin is trading around $86,000, having previously touched its 200-day moving average. Experts warn that in volatile markets, cryptocurrencies are often the first to be liquidated, and investor caution is growing, with open interest in Ethereum options contracts with a $2000 strike increasing. Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice is allegedly investigating Argentine President Javier Miley's role in promoting LIBRA.

**Harte Bitcoin-Korrektur: Extreme Angst & Panik Ã¼bernehmen den Kryptomarkt!**
The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant correction, with Bitcoin losing value and altcoins also affected. The Bitcoin price briefly fell to around $82,000, breaking through a key support level of around $85,000, but later rebounded. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at over $86,000. The recent market correction is influenced by several factors, including US President Donald Trump's announcement of a trade war with the European Union, which will impose a 25% tariff on auto imports and other goods from April. Investors were also concerned about potentially disappointing quarterly earnings from Nvidia, but the chipmaker exceeded expectations and set a new sales record, contributing to market calm. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin lost over 3% in value, while Ethereum lost more than 5%. However, some cryptocurrencies, such as Kaito AI and Litecoin, gained value. The Fear-and-Greed-Index fell to 10, the lowest level since June 2022, reflecting the strong market correction. Despite a current drawdown of 'only' about 25% and positive fundamental developments, there is strong fear in the market. As one analyst said, 'They will liquidate their positions during US trading hours, and Bitcoin will fall to $70,000.'

The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has dropped to 10, its lowest level since June 2022, indicating intense market panic. Despite this, the official website suggests that extreme fear levels can be seen as buying opportunities. Bitcoin's price has decreased significantly, from $109,114 to $82,256, and has only recovered slightly to $86,134. Many leading cryptocurrencies, including $AUCTION, $ETH, and $WBETH, have also experienced declines. However, experts believe that the market may recover quickly when the Fear and Greed Index reaches historically low levels, and some investors are considering buying opportunities.

**Will Bitcoin Reach $125,000 in 2025?**
The price of Bitcoin has been fluctuating around $100,000, but new forecasts suggest it may reach $125,000 by June. According to an analysis by Dr. Sean Dawson, President of Research at Chain Options Protocol, the probability of this happening is 44.4%. A report from the market on February 13 showed that the probability of Bitcoin surpassing $75,000 before June decreased to 12.1% from the previous estimate of 17.8%. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, expressed a more cautious view, predicting that the currency will drop to a range of $70,000 to $75,000, which he believes may lead to a 'small financial crisis'. The price of Bitcoin last reached $75,000 on November 8, coinciding with Donald Trump's presidential election win. Analysts say this was a key factor in the rapid increase in the cryptocurrency above $100,000 on December 5. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is currently trading at $96,790, with investors waiting for new signals to guide future market movements. Gili, a cryptocurrency trading expert, believes that volatility will continue until Bitcoin reaches $100,000 again. The cryptocurrency fear and greed index also confirms this, showing that market sentiment remains 'neutral' at 48 out of 100.

**Bitcoin's Chance of Reaching $125,000 by 2025 Increases to 44.4%**
Recent market analyses indicate that the probability of Bitcoin reaching $125,000 by June 2025 is increasing. According to Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive protocol, a cryptocurrency trading platform, this chance has risen to 44.4%, surpassing the previous 41.9%. Dawson attributes this increase in investor confidence to market stability and long-term optimistic predictions, attracting both experienced and new traders. The probability of a significant price drop, taking Bitcoin to between $75,000 and $70,000, has decreased to 12.1%, down from 17.8% previously. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, warns that a sharp drop could trigger a 'mini financial crisis', leading to massive liquidations and high volatility. Despite recent performance, with Bitcoin staying below $100,000 since February 7, some estimates predict it could reach $180,000 by the end of the year, with Ethereum potentially surpassing $6,000.
