**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**From Earth to Mars: SpaceX Continues its Quest for the Big Dream**
Despite a series of rocket tests that ended in explosions, SpaceX is still planning to send its Starship to Mars by next year. During a presentation on May 29 on the X platform, Elon Musk emphasized that true progress is measured by how close humanity is to creating a self-sustaining civilization on the red planet. He said, 'Every new Starship launch is a step towards making life multi-planetary'. The Starship consists of two stages: the booster 'Super Heavy' and the upper stage known as 'Ship', which is 121 meters long, making it the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. The third version of the Starship is planned to be 124.4 meters long, with advanced capabilities including in-orbit refueling, a crucial step for long-distance travel. The Starship has undergone nine test flights, with the last one on May 27 reaching space but losing control and crashing into the Indian Ocean due to a fuel leak. However, Musk sees each attempt as providing a vast amount of data to improve the spacecraft, saying that the performance in the last test was better than its predecessors. According to Musk, the third version of the Starship will be ready for launch by the end of 2025. If things go as planned, the first uncrewed missions to Mars could be launched as early as 2026. This will include sending five 'Ship' uncrewed spacecraft, equipped with Tesla-developed Optimus robots. Musk commented, 'It will be thrilling to see Optimus robots walking on Mars'. The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to build a self-sustaining city on Mars, capable of supporting over a million people and surviving even if contact with Earth is lost. Hundreds of spacecraft will transport thousands of tons of cargo and people through space during each future launch window. Musk mentioned that the potential site for the city is 'Arcadia Planitia' in the northern hemisphere of Mars, due to its flat surface and potential sources of frozen water. Musk concluded his speech by saying, 'It's a monumental project. A new city on a new planet, it's a chance to reimagine civilization, and we'll do it'.

**Forget rockets - space elevators could soon carry astronauts to the Moon**
A revolutionary study by researchers from the University of Cambridge and Columbia University proposes a 'lunar space elevator' - a vast cable extending from the Moon to Earth's geostationary orbit. Built from existing materials like carbon-based polymers, this 'spaceline' could drastically slash the cost and energy required for lunar missions. The traditional concept of an Earth-anchored elevator has remained out of reach, but Penoyre and Sandford's idea flips the script by anchoring the elevator on the Moon and extending it toward Earth's orbit. This moon-to-orbit design takes advantage of the natural gravitational balance between Earth and the Moon, drastically reducing tension on the cable. The elevator would also provide reliable access to the Earth-Moon Lagrange point, a gravitational sweet spot where objects remain stable. Scientists envision it as a future 'space hub', ideal for telescopes, orbital laboratories, and as a launchpad for interplanetary missions. The economic implications are massive, with the spaceline potentially reducing fuel use by up to two-thirds, allowing lunar expeditions, scientific missions, and even private space ventures at a fraction of today's costs.

**We Might Soon Send Astronauts to the Moon Using... Elevators!**
The high cost of escaping Earth's gravity has long been a barrier to expanding human presence in space. Launching just one kilogram into orbit can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Researchers are rethinking space travel with a lunar space elevator, which could significantly reduce costs. According to the study, the Lagrange point is an ideal location for building and maintaining space infrastructure due to its relatively low amount of meteoroids. This could be used for building a space elevator, as well as other facilities such as particle accelerators, gravitational wave detectors, and power generation facilities.

**Cosmic Climb: Space Elevators are closer than you think**
A space elevator is a concept that has been around since 1895, when Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky proposed the idea of a 'sky ladder'. The idea is to use a very long cable that stretches from space down to Earth, allowing people to travel up the cable in a cabin to space, using much less energy and creating no pollution. The first challenge is finding something in space to attach the cable to, which can be solved by using satellites in geostationary orbit. A long cable needs to be dropped from a satellite down to Earth, and a heavy weight can be attached to the other end of the rope to keep it steady. The cable has to be secured to the ground with a strong anchor, and newer ideas suggest using a moving base, such as a ship or a floating platform, out into the ocean. Experts believe that a space elevator can safely carry a load that is up to 1% of the cable's weight, and scientists are working on creating a material strong enough for the cable, which would have to be about 50 times stronger than steel. Recent reports suggest that materials such as carbon nanotubes or graphene may be strong enough for a space elevator cable, and experts believe this technology could become a reality within the next few years.

**How Close Are We to Building a Space Elevator?**
The concept of a space elevator, a tower that connects Earth's surface to space, has been around for over a century. It has the potential to revolutionize space travel by making it cheaper, safer, and more effective. However, constructing a space elevator is a challenging task, primarily due to the need for a material that can hold up the tether. Researchers and firms are working on developing such materials, with some private industry firms and space agencies like NASA and JAXA commissioning research. Japan has even tested a small-scale space elevator experiment in 2018, and some scientists hope that we can expect to have early forms of a space elevator within the next 50-100 years, possibly starting with lunar or Martian ones. As one researcher noted, 'Rockets will keep taking us to space for the time being, but one day, entering an elevator could be the simplest way to depart Earth.'

**Building a Space Elevator Today: A Practical Guide**
The author proposes a new concept for space exploration, a 100 km altitude space station that can launch cargo into space using a maglev tunnel and a carrier. The station would be powered by flywheels or mobile reactors, and would be able to launch cargo at a speed of 8 km/s. The author argues that this concept is more feasible than the classical space elevator, which requires materials of unprecedented strength and is limited to launching cargo into low Earth orbit. The author also proposes using the Moon as a production site for metal smelting and launching these products into orbit using a magnetic catapult. This would provide a source of resources for future space settlements and enable interplanetary trade. The author believes that this concept has the potential to revolutionize space exploration and make it more sustainable and cost-effective.

**Japan's Ambitious Plan to Build a Space Elevator to Mars by 2050**
Japanese scientists are working on a revolutionary project to build a space elevator that will connect the Earth to Mars in just 40 days. The ambitious plan, led by the Obayashi Corporation, aims to start development in 2025 and be operational by 2050. With an estimated budget of $100 billion, the space elevator could reduce the travel time to Mars from six months to just 40 days, making it a viable alternative to traditional rockets. The idea of a space elevator is not new, but advances in materials like carbon nanotubes have rekindled interest in its construction. The space elevator will be built from a terrestrial port on the Earth's equator, extending to a geostationary terminal at an altitude of 36,000 kilometers. This design will allow the counterweight in space to maintain the structure's position thanks to the Earth's centrifugal force. Christian Johnson, a researcher, has highlighted that this system will facilitate the placement of satellites in orbit and allow for the transportation of cargo to space stations. However, the main challenge lies in finding the right material for the elevator's cable, with carbon nanotubes being the most promising option. The space elevator could overcome the limitations of rockets, which often face friction and combustion problems when entering the atmosphere. With solar-powered modules, costs will be reduced and the environment will be protected. Despite operating at a speed of 155 kilometers per hour, the design will ensure the safety of the transported cargo. Additionally, traveling in a space elevator will be much more comfortable than in a rocket, as the ascent will be gradual, avoiding intense acceleration and gravitational forces experienced during a conventional launch.
