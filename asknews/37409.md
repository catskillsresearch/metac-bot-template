**Tesla faces collapsing sales in Canada's Québec province, with new registrations tumbling 85%**
Tesla's sales in the Canadian province of Québec have plummeted by 85% in the first quarter of 2025, with only 524 new vehicles registered. The Model Y and Model 3 saw the steepest drops, with 360 and 96 units registered, respectively. This decline mirrors similar issues in Europe, where Tesla sales fell by nearly 50% in April. Several factors are contributing to this slump, including Tesla's exclusion from Canada's federal EV rebate program and provinces removing the company from their rebate programs. Additionally, CEO Elon Musk's involvement in right-wing European politics and his role leading the Department of Government Efficiency have led to a global backlash, including protests, boycotts, and vandalism of Tesla dealerships. Musk has since stepped away from DOGE and announced he will focus on his companies, but Tesla's shares had already begun rebounding in April.

**Why it's more than just Musk driving down Tesla sales in Quebec | CBC News**
Tesla sales in Quebec plummeted by 90% in the first quarter of 2025, with only 524 vehicles registered in the province. According to Daniel Breton, president of Electric Mobility Canada, the decline is not solely due to a general dislike of Elon Musk, but also due to tariffs and rebate cutbacks. The federal EV rebate program ended on March 31, and Quebec's program was paused between Feb. 1 and April 1, making it difficult for buyers to stack rebates. Breton believes that more fulsome data will show that Tesla isn't the only EV maker to take a hit in Quebec's market. The 25% tariff on U.S.-made EVs, including Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid cars, imposed by the federal government, is also hurting sales. 'Now that the [Quebec] rebate is back, we'll see what happens with the sales of EVs in general and Tesla in particular,' said Breton. 'I'm really disappointed in what Elon Musk has been doing for the past year or two. So I hope that they find a way to resolve this,' he added. 'To me, Elon Musk is really hurting the brand.'

**VIDEO: Protesters picket B.C. Tesla dealership, call for Musk boycott**
About a dozen protesters gathered at a Langley Tesla dealership on March 23, 2025, to call for a boycott of the electric vehicle manufacturer. Local organizer Pat McCutcheon stated that the protest was not about the cars, but about company owner Elon Musk's involvement with U.S. president Donald Trump and their perceived threat to democracy. McCutcheon said, 'President Trump, Elon Musk and the other oligarchs are dismantling democracy down there at a rapid rate.' The protesters waved the Canadian flag and held signs that read 'Elon + Musk = Evil' and 'Musk can go to Mars, we don't need his Swasticars.' While some drivers showed support by honking their horns, at least one driver displayed opposition. McCutcheon defended the driver's right to protest, saying, 'It's a free country. He's allowed to do that, just as we're allowed to do this peacefully.' The protest was part of a larger movement against Musk's company, with previous protests in the Lower Mainland and Vancouver attracting hundreds of people. Tesla has seven dealerships in B.C. and has been involved in controversy, including the removal of rebates for electric vehicle chargers and being dropped from the Vancouver International Auto Show lineup due to safety concerns.

**Car shoppers pessimistic about Canada's zero-emissions vehicle sales target: survey**
A recent survey by J.D. Power found that 75% of new-vehicle shoppers in Canada are not confident that the government will meet its target of 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035. The survey also found that interest in electric vehicles remains largely unchanged from last year, with 28% of respondents considering an EV for their next purchase. J.D. Ney, director of automotive practice at J.D. Power Canada, stated that Canadians are hesitant to adopt EVs due to anxiety about driving range, affordability, and lack of charging infrastructure. He said, 'Based on the type of vehicle that most Canadians want to drive, they're expensive vehicles in this market.' The survey found that the pause of a federal incentive program offering rebates of up to $5,000 for EV purchases had a negative effect on 42% of those considering an EV. The survey also found that Canadian car buyers' most-considered EV brands have changed, with Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet now occupying the top five spots, while Tesla dropped from second to eighth place.

**General Motors Is Now Canada's Best-Selling EV Maker, As Tesla Sales Crater**
General Motors has surpassed Tesla as the best-selling electric vehicle (EV) brand in Canada, according to data from GM Canada. The company sold around 15,000 EVs in the last quarter of 2024 and 6,000 in the first quarter of 2025. In contrast, Tesla's registrations in Quebec, Canada's largest EV market, dropped by 90% from 5,097 in Q4 2024 to 524 in Q1 2025. The decline is attributed to the Canadian government's halt of the iZEV rebate program and Quebec's regional incentive program. Additionally, Elon Musk's comment that 'Canada is not a real country' has likely contributed to the decline in Tesla's popularity among Canadians. GM's extensive brand portfolio, including three brands selling EVs in Canada, has helped it overtake Tesla as the top EV seller in the country.

**Newsom's 100% EV dream is stuck in traffic**
California's goal to ban sales of all new gas or diesel-powered passenger cars and light trucks by 2035 is facing challenges. According to the California New Car Dealers Association's 2025 Auto Outlook Report, just 20.8% of new cars were zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in Q1 2025, a decline from 22% in 2024. Robb Hernandez, the association's chairman, said, 'Dealers sell what customers want to buy. No mandate can force consumers to choose otherwise.' Tesla's market share decreased to 43.9% in Q1 2025, down from 55.5% in Q1 2024, due to declining registrations. The state's expired EV tax credit, which excluded Tesla, has not been extended. Consumer Reports found that car buyers can still benefit from federal EV tax credits and rebates from local utility providers. The next governor may not continue Newsom's signature issue, as former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has pivoted towards the oil industry in his campaign for governor. The 35% goal for 2026 and the 100% EV mandate by 2035 may be postponed due to these challenges.

**Ottawa's halted $5,000 rebate won't sway most EV shoppers, says J.D. Power**
The federal government's halt on rebates worth up to $5,000 for electric vehicles (EVs) has not deterred most Canadians from purchasing an EV, according to J.D. Power Canada. The study found that only 42% of new vehicle shoppers likely considering an EV say Ottawa's rebate halt had a 'negative effect' on their decision. J.D. Power Canada notes that EV shoppers remain a slim segment of the overall market, with 72% of new vehicle shoppers not considering an EV regardless of the incentive landscape. The federal government is targeting 100% ZEV sales by 2035, but J.D. Power Canada found that the percentage of new vehicle shoppers who say they are 'very likely' or 'somewhat likely' to consider an EV for their next purchase has held steady at 28% year-over-year. 'The disappearance of incentive dollars certainly won't make the targets more achievable,' said J.D. Ney, director of the automotive practice at J.D. Power Canada.

**VinFast VF 8 Offers Rare Value in 2025 with Provincial Incentives**
As federal incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) have been eliminated and Quebec is offering up to $4,000 in 2025, Canadians considering purchasing EVs, such as the VinFast VF 8, face a narrowing window of opportunity, but still a lucrative one, as provincial incentives tighten and the market shifts towards a long-term policy. According to a recent AutoTrader survey, 68% of potential EV buyers consider government incentives in their purchasing decision. As these incentives evolve, consumers may adapt their strategies, particularly in provinces with generous, but changing, rebate structures. The same survey shows that 42% of Canadians plan to buy an EV for their next purchase, indicating that the market is maturing and no longer limited to early adopters. The VF 8, a high-end, affordable crossover, offers a range of 380-412 km, rapid charging capabilities, advanced safety features, and a 10-year or 200,000 km warranty, making it a rare value in 2025. With the right timing and provincial incentives, potential buyers can save thousands of dollars, making the VF 8 an attractive option. As the market continues to evolve, with improved technology, expanding charging infrastructure, and more diverse model offerings, 2025 presents a favorable alignment of factors for Canadians considering EVs.

**Tesla Products To Be Deprived Of Rebates In Canadian Province Amid US-Canada Trade Tensions - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)**
Tesla's electric vehicle charging stations and home batteries have been excluded from rebates in the Canadian province of British Columbia. This decision comes after the U.S. imposed tariffs on Canada. According to BC Hydro, the exclusion is due to the fact that Tesla products are made in the U.S. and the program prioritizes Canadian goods. However, customers who received pre-approval for Tesla products before March 12 will still be eligible for their rebates. This move is part of a larger trend of backlash against Tesla in Canada, including the province of Ontario terminating a contract with Musk's Starlink and the city of Toronto leaving Tesla out of its driver incentive program.

**Canada excludes Tesla chargers from government EV rebates**
The Canadian power provider B.C. Hydro has made Tesla chargers ineligible for EV rebates in British Columbia, citing a desire to include more Canadian goods in its rebate programs. This move comes as a response to Elon Musk's growing political influence, particularly his support of right-wing movements. The decision affects not only Tesla chargers but also the company's energy storage batteries and inverters. Meanwhile, a Canadian parliament member has suggested imposing a 100% tax on all Tesla products if his party comes to power. The move is seen as a backlash against Musk's growing political reach, which has also led to vandalism and protests against Tesla dealerships and charging stations.

**BC Hydro Removes Tesla Products from EV Rebate Program * iPhone in Canada Blog**
BC Hydro has removed Tesla products from the province's Electric Vehicle (EV) rebate program, as part of an effort to prioritize Canadian-made goods over products from the United States. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla's electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters are no longer eligible for rebates under the CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. However, if you purchased a Tesla product or received pre-approval before this date, your rebate will still be processed. This move is aimed at supporting local manufacturers and reducing reliance on U.S.-produced goods, according to BC Hydro. The rebate amount for EV chargers is up to 50% of the cost, to a max of $350. BC Hydro stated, 'This change is aimed at aligning rebate programs with the province's goals of supporting Canadian products wherever possible.' The province has also removed U.S. liquor from shelves in BC liquor stores. The tariff wars between Canada and the U.S. continue to escalate, with Canada imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs and China retaliating with tariffs on rapeseed oil, pork, and aquatic products.

The decision is part of the province's effort to preference Canadian goods in its rebate programs and exclude US-produced goods, as stated in the notice: 'The Government of BC and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, US produced goods.'
