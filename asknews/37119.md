**After Operation Sindoor, India to give intel on Pak camps to anti-terror watchdog**
Following the success of Operation Sindoor, India plans to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF regarding terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This move comes after Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022, but FATF emphasized the need for ongoing cooperation to strengthen Pakistan's AML/CFT framework. Historically, Pakistan has been greylisted multiple times due to strategic shortcomings in targeting UN-designated terrorist groups. India has already appealed to global economic bodies to stop funding Pakistan, claiming that Islamabad has used these funds to support terrorism. India intends to raise this issue in international forums, citing new evidence of continued state patronage of terror groups by Pakistan's government apparatus. As one source said, 'India plans to submit fresh intelligence to the global terrorist financing watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), regarding terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan.'

**India to apprise FATF of the latest evidence on terror infrastructure in Pakistan**
India is set to share the latest evidence of Pakistan's terror infrastructure with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the coming days. According to a government official, the gruesome killings in Pahalgam have necessitated the sharing of information about the existing terror infrastructure in Pakistan with the international watchdog. India will highlight the latest evidence about the patronage being given by the Pakistani State machinery to banned terrorist organisations at all international forums. This comes after the FATF Plenary removed Pakistan from the Grey List in October 2022, but reminded them to continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing system. Pakistan was previously placed on the Grey List in June 2018 and was told to implement an action plan, which included demonstrating effective action against UN-designated terror outfits. However, Pakistan failed to implement all the action points fully and was again retained on the Grey List on October 21, 2021. The FATF Plenary noted that Pakistan had completed 26 of the 27 action items in its 2018 plan, but was still required to demonstrate that terror financing investigations and prosecutions targeted senior functionaries and commanders of UN-designated terror outfits.

**ARCA's Blacklist: Bank Accounts and Credit Cards to be Suspended in May 2025**
The Argentine Revenue and Customs Agency (ARCA) is investigating individuals who may be on a 'blacklist' due to their banking history. As a result, they may have their bank accounts closed and their credit and debit cards deactivated starting in May 2025. According to ARCA, individuals and entities on the 'Base of Non-Confident Contributors' will face severe penalties. ARCA aims to prevent illegal activities, such as tax evasion, and improve economic operations by strengthening fiscal control. The blacklist includes individuals who have committed irregularities, such as failing to pay taxes or having a limited CUIT (Unique Taxpayer Number). To check if they are on the list, individuals can log in to the official portal with their fiscal key and view their CUIT status. If their CUIT is limited, they will be notified of the reasons and can begin the process to regularize it through the 'Administrative Status of CUIT. Reactivation in person' procedure.
