**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Over 1 Billion Young People to Face Adverse Health Conditions by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, over 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity has increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The report also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. By 2021, over 1.1 billion adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, up from less than 1 billion in 2016. The study also warns that climate change and technology will play a significant role in the health of this generation. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with a mean annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. By 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24, facing a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**40% of glaciers "are doomed" even if we were to stop global warming and sea levels would rise by 10 centimeters**
Even if global warming were to stop, 39% of the world's glacier mass would still disappear, and sea levels would rise by over 10 centimeters, according to a study led by Harry Zekollari. The study, which simulated the long-term impact of current climate policies, found that glaciers would continue to melt for centuries, even without additional warming. 'Most glacier studies stop at the year 2100, which is problematic when simulating the long-term impact of current climate policies, given the glaciers' long-term response over time,' explains Zekollari. The study also found that around 20% of the current glacier mass would be lost regardless of future warming. The researchers note that the retreat of glaciers allows us to see the effects of climate change with our own eyes.

**Joscha Bach Warns of Humanity's 'Fatal' Future**
Renowned cognitive scientist Joscha Bach has issued a dire warning: 'Humanity is already dead.' Bach, who participated in the 'How the Light Gets In' festival in The Hague, emphasized the urgent need for governments to take action on climate change and leverage artificial intelligence to address the crisis. He stated, 'We really don't know how to reform our institutions to update them and make them work. And that's a pretty terrifying situation. So, basically, by default, we're already dead.' Bach believes that AI can be a valuable tool in resolving some of the world's problems, but the lack of a contingency plan for resource overexploitation and climate change is a major concern. He noted, 'The situation is that we're facing global warming and the imminent depletion of resources, and we don't have a solution. None of our civil institutions plan more than a few decades in advance, and all our projections somehow end in 2100.' Bach's prediction for humanity's future is bleak, and he remains uncertain about how current leaders will address the pressing issues facing the planet.

**AI Predicts a Bleak Future for Humanity in 2100**
A study by artificial intelligence predicts a bleak future for humanity in 2100. The analysis is based on current technological, environmental, and social developments. According to the AI, some people will have merged with technology to improve their physical performance and reduce suffering, while others will choose simpler ways of life, living in small communities connected to the earth and ancestral knowledge. Cities will float, but many regions will be destroyed by natural disasters. The AI predicts the disappearance of countries as we know them, replaced by digital borders. The main struggle will be for access to essential resources like water, air, and data. The AI also suggests that children may not always be born naturally, but rather in laboratories or through guided processes by 'ancient souls' to restore balance. However, the vision is not entirely pessimistic, as a new generation is said to emerge, guided by memory and spiritual connection, and living in harmony with nature. 'They talk to trees. They listen to the dead. And they walk without haste, knowing that time is no longer a line, but a spiral,' the AI concludes.

**ChatGPT Predicts Humans Will Be Irrelevant by 2100**
ChatGPT, a conversational AI, was asked about the fate of humanity by the year 2100 and responded, 'Yes, but they will be irrelevant.' According to ComputerHoy, this response is precise, as technology will continue to advance, bringing us closer to what was once considered science fiction. The AI does not foresee a physical or biological collapse of the human species or a large-scale extinction. However, it does predict that humans will have minimal influence in key processes by the year 2100. This statement is not optimistic, as the AI does not envision a future of prosperity or ethical progress, but rather a species that has been marginalized from the center of the system it created. 'In a time marked by automation and the increasing delegation of decisions, it's not surprising that we start to question the place of people in the next few decades,' says ComputerHoy. 'The future is already a cultural and philosophical question.'

**The Alarming Future of Human Evolution: Experts Warn of Radical Changes by 2100**
Experts have examined the impact of technology on the human body and have predicted that by 2100, we may see radical changes. They conducted a scientific study to build a 3D model, called 'Mindy', of the physical changes they believe humans may experience. According to the model, spending hours on computers or phones will lead to a curvature of the spine, larger neck muscles, a thicker skull to protect against radiation, and a smaller brain due to a sedentary lifestyle. Caleb Backe, an expert in health and wellness, stated, 'Spending hours looking at phones fatigues the neck and unbalances the spine. As a result, the neck muscles must work harder to support the head.' The experts also predict that in less than 100 years, humans may develop hands like claws due to the time spent holding their phones. Dr. Nikola Djordjevic, of Med Alert Help, stated, 'The way we hold our phones can cause tension in certain points of contact, leading to cubital tunnel syndrome.' Additionally, the scientists have hypothesized that humans may develop a double eyelid to protect their eyes from harmful light.

**From Face To Neck To Hand: Technology Will Change How Humans Look Like By 2100**
Experts predict that by 2100, daily tech use will lead to significant changes in the human body, including larger neck veins, claw-like hands, and thicker skulls due to poor posture and radiation. According to Caleb Becke, a health and wellness expert, prolonged phone use will cause neck tension and spinal alignment deterioration, leading to larger neck veins. Jason O'Brien, head of tollfreeforwarding.com, notes that we will have to pay the price for the benefits of technology, including convenience, entertainment, and easy contact, which will adversely affect our health. The model, named 'Mindy', shows the predicted changes, including cubital tunnel syndrome, brain shrinkage, and skull thickening due to radiation. While the model is exaggerated, it raises concerns about modern life habits and their consequences.

**Future Humans: A Hunched Back, Smaller Brain, and Claws - Scientists Predict**
Scientists have created a 3D model of a person in 2100, named MinDi, to show how human appearance will change due to technological advancements. According to the study, people living in 2100 may have a hunched back from constant smartphone and computer use, a smaller brain, and hands resembling claws. Experts also predict that people will develop a double eyelid to protect their eyes from harmful light. 'Prolonged phone use strains the neck and throws the spine out of balance, causing the neck muscles to work harder to support the head,' said Caleb Buke, an expert on health and well-being who created the model. 'Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end also means that your torso is stretched forward, rather than being upright.' The study also notes that a similar phenomenon occurred around 110,000 years ago, when our prehistoric ancestors faced a catastrophic population decline, known as a 'genetic bottleneck,' which threatened their survival.

**How Our Bodies Will Change in the Future**
Researchers have used digital tools to explore how technology and climate change might shape human evolution. According to their studies, by 2100, humans may develop a 'text claw' grip, with hands molded into a claw-like shape due to prolonged smartphone use. Additionally, people may grow a second set of eyelids to filter out excess light from technology devices. Climate change could lead to humans growing webbed feet and bigger toes, as well as larger noses to warm cold air when inhaled. On the other hand, humans may live longer, grow taller, and develop a leaner build, with a more agreeable temperament and less aggressive behavior. However, their brains might shrink, making them less complex. As one researcher noted, 'We don't know what the climate will be like even 100 years from now or if technology and the sea levels rising will be the main reasons for evolution, but at least now we can start doing everything to stop global ecological problems in the future.'

**Expert Predicts 'Only Two Years Left Before the End of the World'**
A study by Heinz von Foerster, published in 1960 in the Science journal, predicted that the world would reach a critical point on November 13, 2026, due to an exponential growth of the world population. According to the study, the population growth would lead to a collapse, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to human decisions and actions. The study used a mathematical formula that projected the population would reach near-infinite levels by 2026, even if a constant food supply and natural disasters were avoided. The study warned that the overpopulation could trigger the collapse of social and environmental systems. The true threat is overpopulation, not climate change, and the study attributed the responsibility to humans, not external factors. The research advised that if the population continued to grow at this rate, we would reach an unsustainable threshold where societies could not preserve their stability or sustainable development. Although this prediction is now viewed with skepticism, the dialogue about the limits of human growth remains relevant, and institutions like the UN estimate that the world population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, raising questions about resource management and environmental protection in a world with a constantly increasing population.
