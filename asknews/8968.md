**Fed can be patient, ready to respond if needed: Logan**
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Lorie Logan stated that the Federal Reserve can be patient and prepared to respond if necessary, given the stable labor market and inflation running above target. Logan emphasized the importance of monitoring data to determine the appropriate response, saying, 'Monetary policy is really well positioned for us to wait and be patient and watch the data, knowing that if the risks are to materially change on either side, we're well positioned to act.' The Fed's target for inflation is 2%, and Logan noted that the current PCE inflation rate is 2.1%. However, most analysts believe that the impact of Trump's tariffs has yet to be reflected in the data, and Logan warned that higher expectations for inflation could become entrenched. Tariffs, uncertainty over national economic policies, and financial market volatility may also slow the economy, Logan said. The labor market has remained stable, and a reading on May's job market health is expected to show employers added about 130,000 jobs, down from 177,000 the prior month, but the unemployment rate to remain at its current 4.2%.

**Federal Reserve Chairman Open to Lowering Interest Rates This Year**
Federal Reserve Chairman Christopher Waller said on Monday that lowering interest rates is still possible later this year, despite the possibility that the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration may temporarily increase price pressures. Waller said in a meeting in Seoul, South Korea: 'I would support considering any trade-related effects on inflation in the near term when determining interest rates.' He added: 'If tariffs settle at the lower end of the probability range and 'the core inflation continues to make progress towards our 2% target with a still-strong labor market', 'I would support lowering interest rates 'because of the good news' later this year.' Waller also said: 'Fortunately, the strong labor market and progress in inflation until April give me more time to see how trade negotiations and the economy develop' before needing to make a decision on what the central bank should do with interest rates. Waller's comments on the economy and monetary policy come as the president's trade policy is shrouded in uncertainty. Trump made significant and unexpected changes to tariff rates and their timing. At the same time, the tariff system faces legal challenges that could block its implementation in its entirety. Economists and Federal Reserve officials generally believe that tariffs will raise unemployment and inflation rates, with a slowdown in growth. The tax increases have also raised questions about the central bank's ability to make any targeted interest rate cuts this year, given the target range of 4.25% to 4.5% for the federal funds rate.

**Federal Reserve Chairman Open to Lowering Interest Rates Later This Year**
Federal Reserve Chairman Christopher Waller said on Monday that lowering interest rates is still possible later this year, despite the potential for temporary price pressures due to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Waller stated, 'I support considering any effects of tariffs on inflation in the short term when determining interest rates.' If tariffs remain at the lower end of the probability range, and 'the core inflation continues to move towards our 2% target' with the labor market 'remaining tight,' Waller said he would support positive interest rate cuts later this year. He added, 'Fortunately, the strong labor market and the progress made in inflation until April (Nisan) last give me extra time to see how trade negotiations and the economy develop,' before deciding what the central bank should do about interest rates. Waller's comments on economic and monetary policy expectations are similar to his previous statements, and come amidst uncertainty about the president's trade policy. Trump made significant and unexpected changes to tariffs and their timing. At the same time, the tariff system faces legal challenges that could ultimately undermine the entire effort. Economists and Fed officials generally believe that tariffs will lead to higher unemployment and inflation, with slower growth. The tax increases have raised questions about the Fed's ability to implement any targeted rate cuts, currently targeted at 4.25% to 4.5% this year. Waller's openness to lowering interest rates later this year, if economic conditions permit, contrasts with the cautious stance of other central bank governors, according to Reuters. Short-term disruptions Waller said the economy has not yet seen a significant impact from tariffs, but this situation could change. He said, 'I expect negative risks to economic activity and employment, and positive risks to inflation, in the second half of 2025, but how these risks develop is closely related to how trade policy develops.' He added, 'High tariffs will reduce spending, and companies will respond, partially, by reducing production and reducing wages.' A Fed official pointed out that while tariffs will be the main driver of inflation, one-time increases 'will be more evident in the second half of 2025.' If tariffs are reduced to 10%, not all of the increase will be passed on to consumers. Waller also noted that the risk of imposing large tariffs has decreased. He also pointed out that one of the reasons for concern about the impact of tariffs on inflation is the misplaced confidence during the pandemic that the price pressures we saw at the time would be short-lived. Waller said, 'What people often worried about is that we agreed in 2021 that all these things were transitory, and they were just a temporary effect, and then they would go away. It turned out that this view was wrong.' However, he pointed out that the factors that made inflation gains persistent at the time are no longer present now. Waller also pointed to the divergence of views on inflation expectations. He said he is closely monitoring the views of the market and professional forecasters, who expect inflation pressures to remain under control, more than opinion polls. Waller pointed out that actual data does not show a significant deterioration in the expected path of inflation. He also touched on the rise in bond yields, which came amidst a broader increase in caution about dollar-backed assets, in the face of Trump's trade measures. He linked the rise in borrowing costs to concerns about government borrowing and the openness of the United States to foreign investment. He said, in reference to some government officials' statements: 'It seems that there is a view that foreign buyers of assets are not welcome to some extent.' He added, 'There is a tendency to avoid risk from foreign buyers of Treasury bonds, and all US assets... This tendency is not large in reality, but it exists, of course.'

**Federal Reserve Director Open to Interest Rate Cuts This Year**
Federal Reserve Director Christopher Waller stated on Monday that further interest rate cuts are still possible this year, despite the possibility of temporary price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs. Waller said, 'I support the analysis of any tariff effects on inflation in the short term when setting interest rates.' He added, 'If tariffs establish at the lower end of the possible range and 'underlying inflation continues to progress towards our 2% target with a solid labor market', 'I would support the 'good news' of interest rate cuts this year.' Waller also mentioned that the strong labor market and inflation progress up to April give him more time to see how trade negotiations unfold and the economy evolves before deciding what the central bank should do with interest rates. His statements on the economy and monetary policy prospects are in line with his recent comments and occur amidst considerable uncertainty over the US president's commercial policy. Trump has made significant and unpredictable changes to import tariffs and schedules, as well as facing legal challenges that may ultimately weaken the entire effort. Economists and Fed officials generally believe that tariffs will increase unemployment and inflation, as well as slow growth. The tax increases have also raised doubts about whether the central bank will be able to make any interest rate cuts this year, with the current rate in the 4.25% to 4.5% range. Waller's openness to cutting interest rates this year, if economic conditions permit, contrasts with other central banks, which have adopted a cautious approach of waiting to see. So far, the economy has suffered little impact from the tariffs, but this could change, Waller said. He sees negative risks for economic activity and employment and high risks for inflation in the second half of 2025, but the evolution of these risks is strongly linked to the evolution of commercial policy. He said that higher tariffs will reduce spending, and companies will respond by reducing production and payroll, although he noted that tariffs are the primary driver of inflation, and it is likely that they will be unique 'more apparent in the second half of 2025.' In the case of lower tariffs, in the range of 10%, a part of the increase will not be fully passed on to consumers.

**Fed's Waller: Interest Rate Cuts Possible This Year Despite Trade Tariffs**
Federal Reserve Deputy Chairman Christopher Waller stated that interest rate cuts are possible this year, despite the potential for temporary inflationary pressures due to Trump's trade tariffs. Waller said, 'I support examining the impact of any tariff on inflation in the near term when setting the policy rate.' He added, 'If tariffs settle at the lower end of the probability range and the labor market remains strong and the core inflation rate continues to move towards our 2% target, I will support interest rate cuts later this year.' Waller noted that the economy has so far been relatively unaffected by tariffs, but this could change. He said, 'I see downward risks to economic activity and employment in the second half of 2025, and upward risks to inflation, but these risks will depend heavily on the outcome of trade policy. Higher tariffs will reduce spending and businesses will respond by reducing production and wages.'

**Fed Member Waller: Economy Meets Three Conditions, Rate Cut Possible This Year**
Federal Reserve (Fed) member Christopher Waller stated at the Bank of Korea's International Conference on Monday (June 2) that, despite the potential short-term increase in domestic prices due to the US government's tariffs, he believes there is still a possibility of a rate cut this year if the economy meets three conditions. Waller stated that, given the temporary nature of the inflationary pressure caused by the US's increased import tariffs, he supports ignoring temporary factors when making monetary policy decisions and not considering the recent inflationary impact. Waller said, 'If the tariff rate remains stable at the low end of my expected range, the core inflation rate continues to move towards our 2% target, and the labor market remains solid, I will support the Fed to release the 'good news' of a rate cut later this year.' 'Fortunately, as of April, the US labor market remains strong and inflation has eased, giving me more time to observe the progress of trade talks and economic development before deciding whether the Fed needs to adjust its monetary policy.' Waller's views on the economy and monetary policy are generally consistent with his previous comments. Waller reviewed the two trade policy scenarios he previously proposed: one with a high tariff rate of around 25% and another with a low tariff rate of around 10%, which would be gradually reduced through negotiations with other countries. In both scenarios, Waller expects the tariff's impact on inflation to be temporary, and he also expects the tariff to lead to an increase in unemployment, which 'may persist for a while.' However, he noted that under the lower tariff scheme, the scale of layoffs may be 'relatively limited.' Based on the current progress of trade talks, Waller estimates that the average trade-weighted tariff rate is around 15%, between the two scenarios he proposed. However, Waller also pointed out that there are many uncertain factors in future tariff policies. Waller said, 'I currently believe that economic activity and employment may be negatively affected in the second half of 2025, and inflation may worsen. However, the development of these risks is largely dependent on how trade policies will evolve in the future.'

**Fed Member Waller: Economy May Meet Conditions for Rate Cut This Year**
Federal Reserve Board member Christopher Waller stated on Monday that despite the potential short-term increase in domestic prices due to the US government's tariffs, he believes there is still a possibility of a rate cut this year if the economy meets three conditions. According to Waller, these conditions are: 'if the tariff rate remains stable at the low end of my expected range, the core inflation rate continues to move towards our 2% target, and the labor market remains solid, then I will support the Fed to release 'good news' about a rate cut later this year.' Waller also stated that the current strong labor market and easing inflation have given him more time to observe the progress of trade talks and economic development before deciding whether to adjust the Fed's monetary policy. Waller's views on the economic outlook and monetary policy are largely consistent with his previous comments. He expects the impact of tariffs on inflation to be temporary in both high-tariff and low-tariff scenarios, and predicts that tariffs will lead to an increase in unemployment, which may persist for a period of time. However, he notes that the scale of layoffs may be relatively limited in the lower-tariff scenario. Based on the current progress of trade talks, Waller estimates that the average trade-weighted tariff is around 15%, between the two scenarios he proposed.

**Gold Prices May Rise as US Economic Data and Interest Rate Hopes Boost Market**
Gold prices in the local market recorded a significant decline last week, and with the opening of the new week, gold may change its path towards an increase. The gold price was under negative pressure last week after Trump's announcement to postpone the implementation of the 50% tariffs on the European Union, which will be implemented by July 9 to allow for negotiations between Washington and the 27-member EU to reach an agreement. This move provided some relief to the markets, which were concerned about the deterioration of global trade conditions, and encouraged the purchase of assets that rely on risk-taking at the expense of gold. Additionally, the recovery of the US dollar last week increased the negative pressure on gold. In terms of economic data, the US personal consumption expenditures price index rose 2.1% annually in April compared to a forecast of 2.2%. After the report was released, traders continued to bet that the Federal Reserve Bank will lower interest rates in September. Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, stated on Thursday that policymakers are still able to lower interest rates twice this year, but interest rates should remain stable for now to ensure that inflation is on the right track to reach the central bank's target of 2%.

**Federal Reserve Considers Changes to Policy Framework**
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced that the central bank's leaders are considering changes to key parts of their policy framework, including how they evaluate the US labor market deficit and how they approach their 2% inflation target. In 2020, the Fed revised its approach to conducting the economy in two important ways: after periods of persistent inflation below 2%, they would allow it to rise moderately for 'some time'. They also signaled that they would not raise interest rates preemptively during periods of low unemployment to avoid potential inflationary pressures, an effort to mitigate 'deficits' relative to their maximum employment goal. Powell stated that the current structure was developed in a time of persistently low interest rates and low inflation, and that critics argued it was overly adapted to a narrow set of economic conditions. 'We will ensure that our new statement of consensus is robust to a wide range of economic environments and developments,' he said. The Fed has initiated a periodic review of its long-term strategy for implementing monetary policy and its communication tools. The structure serves as a guide for the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates while seeking to achieve the broad goals assigned to the committee by Congress of promoting stable prices and maximum employment. The Fed's goal is a 2% inflation rate. After the last review, concluded in 2020, the Fed adopted a new structure that aimed to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for 'some time' after periods of persistent inflation below that level -- a flexible inflation target approach. Powell said that an important consideration in 2020 was maintaining Americans' long-term expectations for inflation near 2%. 'Anchored expectations are essential for everything we do, and we remain fully committed to the 2% target today,' he said. However, he stated that the economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, and the current review of the structure will reflect the Fed's leaders' assessment of these changes. 'We may be entering a period of more frequent and potentially more persistent supply shocks -- a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks,' he declared. Powell added that the idea that central bank leaders are limited by the so-called zero lower bound -- when already low interest rates offer little room for authorities to reduce them to support the economy when needed -- 'is no longer the base scenario.' But he added that 'it is prudent that the structure continues to address that risk.'

**Federal Reserve Keeps Rates Unchanged, S&P 500 Points Towards Resistance**
The Federal Reserve has decided to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25-4.50%, expressing concern about the risks of stagflation due to the Trump administration's tariff policies. Despite pressure for a monetary easing, Jerome Powell emphasized the importance of a wait-and-see approach, highlighting the economic uncertainty related to international tariffs and the need to closely monitor economic developments. The Fed has signaled growing risks for the US economy, including rising inflation and potential job losses, primarily attributed to the Trump administration's trade strategy. Powell noted that if the announced tariffs were to be maintained, they could lead to price increases, economic growth slowdown, and job losses. Despite operator concerns and geopolitical uncertainty, the S&P 500 closed with another bullish price pattern, pointing decisively towards the first short-term resistance at 5724, which, if surpassed, would make it highly likely to reach the target at 5836 by May 20. We expect the ascent to continue at least until May 22, when the equity risk/reward ratio, particularly in Europe, will deteriorate. Important macroeconomic data will be released next week, including Chinese industrial production, German Zew, US retail sales, and Italian inflation. We analyze the weekly charts below: The S&P 500 has recovered about 50% of the large April decline and is now facing the resistance at 5840 points, a challenging obstacle that could generate a return of strength from sellers. If prices manage to overcome this level, we could hope for a rapid return to historical highs. Many operators will likely wait and see. The NASDAQ has a similar technical situation to the S&P 500, with resistance at 20540. The return of strength from bigtech American companies, excluding Alphabet and Apple, should help the assault on this important barrier. The DAX is also attacking a resistance, but of a different magnitude, as it is the historical maximum that has been reached and, at the time of writing, it seems that the break could be confirmed in weekly closing. A weekly closing above 23570 would open the doors to the expectation of a further strong rise of the German index, which, in just a month, has recovered the losses due to the shock of tariffs. The first support level is at 22150. The FTSEMIB is in the wake of the DAX and is now close to its annual highs. The next resistance is at 39910 points, while the first support is at 35500. Until next week, our expectation is for prices still rising. Gold has found support at 3200 dollars after a one-week retracement. The medium- and long-term trend is not currently in question, every setback is an opportunity to buy. Only a drop to 2970 could mean a significant pause in the medium-term upward trend. The EURUSD has always responded clearly to the bullish and bearish inversion patterns shown in the graph. Two weeks ago, a bearish inversion pattern was formed, identical to that of June 2023, which brought prices into contact with the area 1.1235, which was previously a resistance and is now a support. A closing settlement below this level could bring us to 1.10. We will see if the bulls can hold the support in closing.

**QNB: Federal Reserve to Continue Lowering Interest Rates in 2025**
QNB expects the Federal Reserve to continue lowering interest rates later in 2025, despite the high inflation rate and potential short-term inflationary pressures due to the imposition of tariffs. The bank's report states that the Federal Reserve has been at the forefront of discussions about the overall economy and investment, given the importance of interest rates and quantitative policies for growth, liquidity, and inflation. However, in recent months, a series of new policies adopted by the Trump administration has changed the basis of discussions and areas of focus completely. The report notes that this move was a response to concerns about excessive economic activity that could lead to high inflation rates if President Trump were to implement the proposed expansionary policies during his election campaign. According to the report, with the new US administration taking office and its priorities focused on imposing new tariffs and promoting 'government efficiency', the risk balance that threatens economic expectations has quickly shifted from excessive economic activity to recession risks. The report notes that the Federal Reserve is still in need of action in this high level of uncertainty, where monetary policy tools can play a crucial role in mitigating some of the effects of uncertainty or potential negative shocks from the political front. The report also notes that medium-term interest rates have fluctuated significantly. Investors currently expect the Federal Reserve to resume the interest rate-cutting cycle that began in September 2024, with four additional 25 basis point interest rate cuts on federal funds by the end of 2025 and additional interest rate cuts in 2026. The bank's report highlights that market expectations appear to be in line with the overall economic environment, indicating that there is sufficient space for the Federal Reserve to make further easing in monetary policy, highlighting two key factors that support interest rate cuts. The first factor is the statements of Federal Reserve officials reflecting a readiness for an additional interest rate cut later this year, as the 'dot plot' for March 2025, which outlines the expected target range for interest rates from each participant in the Federal Open Market Committee's 19 members, is roughly in line with the current market situation. This is supported by the view of most Federal Reserve officials that the economy is slowing down gradually, with a return to normal inflation, and that any potential impact on inflation from tariffs is likely to be temporary and 'ignored'. The second factor is that the weakness of the economy and the decline in market confidence, due to political shocks, make interest rate cuts a necessary step, not just a possibility. The report concludes that, despite the high inflation rate and potential short-term inflationary pressures due to tariffs, it is likely that the Federal Reserve will continue to lower interest rates later in 2025. This comes in the context of the economy's slowdown and the need to switch from a restrictive monetary policy (with an interest rate of 4.5%) to a neutral one of 4%, to avoid a potential recession.

**Kugler: Fed's interest rate policy remains restrictive, but inflation progress has slowed**
Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler stated that the Fed's interest rate policy remains restrictive and well-positioned, but the progress in returning inflation to the US central bank's 2% target has slowed since last summer. Kugler also noted that the recent increase in inflation expectations, as reflected in consumer surveys, is a concern. According to Kugler, the personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed uses to guide its 2% target, rose at an annual rate of 2.5% in February, the same as in January. Kugler said, 'In certain subcategories, there are signs that inflation has reaccelerated in recent months.' She also pointed out that, although inflation in goods was negative in 2024, as it was before the pandemic, it has become positive in recent months. 'The increase in prices of goods is not very useful,' Kugler said.

**FRB Maintains Policy Interest Rate Target Amid Concerns of Tariff-Induced Inflation**
The Federal Reserve (FRB) has decided to maintain its policy interest rate target at 4.25-4.5% for the second consecutive meeting. The decision comes as concerns about inflation rising again due to the Trump administration's tariff increase have intensified. According to Chairman Powell, 'the uncertainty about the future is unusually high' despite the US economy being 'firmly on track'. He emphasized that 'it is difficult to accurately evaluate how much of the inflation is caused by tariffs', and repeatedly used the term 'tariff inflation' to explain the risk of rising prices. The FRB has set a plan to lower interest rates twice in 2025, maintaining its outlook.

**Federal Reserve Faces Tough Decision Amid Trump's Trade Policies**
The Federal Reserve is set to hold its second meeting of 2025 today, amidst high expectations from global markets. Concerns are growing about the impact of President Donald Trump's trade policies on the US economy. Trump's policies, which include imposing new tariffs on major trading partners such as China, Canada, and Mexico, may limit the flexibility of monetary policymakers and force them to re-evaluate their strategies. The Federal Reserve and monetary easing The expert Mohamed Badra said that the Federal Reserve began a cycle of monetary easing in September 2024, where it lowered interest rates three times by a total of 100 basis points by December 2024, ending the tightening cycle that began in March 2022. In the last meeting in January 2025, the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates at 4.25% - 4.50%, in a move that observers described as coming in the context of the anticipation of what will happen to the economic situation. Badra explained to 'Telegraph Egypt' that the Federal Reserve may need more time to study the potential impacts of Trump's policies before making a new decision on interest rates. He pointed out that keeping interest rates steady in today's meeting seems to be the most likely scenario, with a possibility of resuming the downward cycle in June 2025, if inflationary pressures do not escalate further. Trump's policies deepen uncertainty According to a survey conducted by Bloomberg, most expectations are pointing towards keeping interest rates steady, due to the uncertainty left by Trump's trade policies. Trump's insistence on imposing new tariffs, along with retaliatory reactions from targeted countries, raise the risks of inflation and unemployment and slow down economic growth rates. These expectations are consistent with previous statements by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who confirmed that the cost of delaying interest rate cuts is low, meaning that the central bank is not in a hurry to take additional steps towards monetary easing. Powell emphasized that inflation has not yet reached the target level of 2%, justifying the continuation of the restrictive monetary policy for a longer period. A difficult position The Federal Reserve finds itself in a difficult position; on the one hand, the markets need more stimulus through lower interest rates to support economic growth, and on the other hand, there are concerns about the escalation of inflation due to Trump's tariffs, which requires caution. During January 2025, the annual inflation rate in the United States slowed to 2.6% compared to 2.8% in December 2024, while the unemployment rate remained stable at 4.1%. In light of these numbers, 'Capital Economics' expects the Federal Reserve to continue its cautious approach during the first half of 2025, with a possibility of resuming interest rate cuts in the second half of the year. Market expectations Scott Anderson, chief economist at 'BMO Capital Markets', said that the Federal Reserve faces a major challenge, as the underlying inflation is still high, while the full impact of the tariffs is still unclear. On the other hand, 'Deutsche Bank' predicted that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged for the second time in a row during today's meeting. 'Barclays' agreed with it in a recent research note, suggesting that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates twice in 2025, starting with a 0.25% cut in June and followed by another cut in September. On the other hand, 'Fedwatch' tool, which tracks market expectations of Federal Reserve decisions, indicates a 99% probability of keeping interest rates steady today, with a very low probability (1%) of a 0.25% cut.

**Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates at 4.5%, Emphasizes Continued Monitoring of Inflation and Economic Activity**
The Federal Reserve has decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.5%, with a continued focus on monitoring the impact on inflation and economic activity. Members of the Federal Reserve noted that inflation remains high despite indicators of strong economic growth, with unemployment rates remaining low, indicating the stability of the labor market in recent months. The participants agreed that the monetary policy stance has become less restrictive compared to previous periods, but emphasized the importance of continuing to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities as part of its strategy to tighten monetary policy gradually, taking into account the impact on financial markets. The majority of Federal Reserve members highlighted that monetary policy remains binding, requiring close monitoring of economic developments, and emphasized the need to achieve further progress in reducing inflation before considering any future adjustments to interest rates. They also stressed that the future path of monetary policy for the Federal Reserve is not predetermined, but rather subject to ongoing evaluation based on economic data, including labor market performance, inflation levels, and the sustainability of economic growth. Many participants noted that the current state of economic uncertainty requires a more cautious approach to making any new decisions about monetary policy, especially with multiple factors that could affect the direction of growth and inflation in the coming period. The members discussed several risks that could affect policy expectations, including the decline in negative risks facing the labor market and economic activity, versus the increase in positive risks that could exacerbate inflationary pressures and reduce the effectiveness of monetary tightening. Many members believed that keeping interest rates at binding levels would be necessary if the economy continues to grow strongly, along with high inflation, while there may be room to ease monetary policy if the labor market begins to slow, economic activity declines, or inflation falls to 2% at a faster pace than expected. They also discussed some aspects related to the general budget, including the restructuring of bond purchases in the secondary market, to ensure consistency between SOMA portfolio maturities and Treasury debt issuance, to reduce the risk of any disturbances that may occur in the financial market. In light of the likelihood of significant fluctuations in reserve levels in the coming months due to the challenges related to the debt ceiling, some participants suggested that the Federal Reserve may consider slowing or even halting the reduction of the general budget temporarily until this issue is resolved. Many members emphasized the importance of studying new ways to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, to ensure a more flexible response to economic changes and to promote monetary stability in the future.

**BCE Ignores FED, Cuts Interest Rates Amid 'Enormous' Uncertainty**
The European Central Bank (BCE) has decided to lower interest rates by 0.25 points, ignoring the Federal Reserve's (FED) actions. According to Luis de Guindos, the vice-president of the BCE, the 'enormous' level of uncertainty makes it impossible to predict where interest rates will end up. De Guindos stated, 'This is due to the enormous level of uncertainty.' He also emphasized that the BCE will make decisions on a case-by-case basis, depending on economic indicators. The magnitude of interest rate cuts will depend on whether inflation converges towards the 2% target set by the BCE in a sustainable manner. De Guindos expressed confidence that this will happen by the end of the year, but noted that factors such as the geopolitical situation must be taken into account. He stated, 'If inflation moves according to our projections, the path of our monetary policy is clear.' However, external factors can affect the economy and produce shocks, and the base scenario estimates that inflation will converge towards the target this year, with a slight recovery in economic growth, reaching 1.1% in 2025, after 0.7% last year. De Guindos considers a recovery in consumption to be 'key' for a rebound in economic growth in the eurozone, as the lack of confidence among consumers is one of the reasons why this has not happened yet. He also anticipates an increase in inflation in the coming months due to base effects, mainly related to energy, but the BCE is convinced that it will 'begin to decelerate more in the spring' and converge towards the 2% target in a sustainable manner. On the other hand, De Guindos explained that the main impact of potential tariffs in response to US policies 'will be on growth', while the effect on inflation is more difficult to calculate. He warned that if the world embarks on a path towards a trade war, this will have an 'extremely negative' impact on the prospects for global economic growth. 'Tariff increases are a negative supply shock, especially if they are accompanied by retaliation,' he warned, emphasizing that 'this vicious circle must be avoided.'

**Fed Maintains Interest Rates, Nomura Advises Diversified Bond Strategy**
Despite US President Trump's repeated dissatisfaction with interest rates, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has decided to maintain the federal funds rate target range at 4.25% to 4.50% as of February 2025, without any adjustments. This indicates that the Fed is taking a more cautious monetary policy stance while observing economic growth and inflation trends. Looking ahead to 2025, according to Fed officials' expectations, the pace of rate cuts may slow down, with a possible total of 75 basis points in rate cuts for the year. According to Nomura Asset Management, in the face of fluctuating interest rates, a diversified bond strategy is recommended to minimize risk and maximize returns. Nomura Asset Management's Vice President of Investment Strategy, Zhang Jiwen, stated that relying solely on long-term government bonds is no longer a safe choice. For example, despite being a year of rate cuts in 2024, the US 20-year+ government bond index still recorded a -7.98% negative return, while the US comprehensive bond index rose 1.25% during the same period. Zhang Jiwen analyzed that interest rate fluctuations have a significant impact on long-term government bonds, and that switching to a diversified bond strategy can effectively reduce losses and even achieve gains in the opposite direction. He further emphasized that in a bullish market, a single bond type is difficult to cope with all challenges, and therefore a diversified layout is needed, with adjustments to investment strategies according to market changes, and selection of high-potential targets from different bonds. Nomura Global Bond Fund Manager Lin Shimeng also pointed out that since October 2023, the US 10-year government bond yield has continued to fluctuate, mainly due to inflation and economic data exceeding expectations, leading to market expectations of the Fed's future policy being divided. Trump's policies, including attracting foreign capital and reducing taxes, have helped the US economy, but immigration and trade policies may bring inflationary pressures, making the Fed's policy more flexible. Lin Shimeng recommends focusing on high-quality credit bonds and using a diversified bond allocation strategy to diversify risks.
