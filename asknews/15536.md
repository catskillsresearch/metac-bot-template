**AI shortcuts climate threats to secure Australia's drinking water**
Researchers from the University of Technology Sydney have developed an AI-based system that uses ensemble modelling to predict changes in water quality before they occur, including in advance of severe weather events. This approach is more efficient than traditional methods, which rely on collecting water samples from the source for lab analysis, a process that can take up to 24 hours to produce results. According to the researchers, this AI system can help water authorities provide safe drinking water during significant rain events.

**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**Artificial Intelligence Surpasses Human Predictions in Weather Forecasting**
Microsoft has developed a new artificial intelligence model called 'Aurora' that can provide accurate weather forecasts, sometimes even surpassing human predictions made by specialized agencies. The model uses deep learning techniques and analyzes vast amounts of climate data. According to a recent study published in the scientific journal 'Nature', Aurora's performance includes predicting weather phenomena such as air quality, ocean waves, and tropical cyclone tracks with unprecedented accuracy and at a lower computational cost. The study found that Aurora outperformed traditional models used by major international institutions in providing 10-day weather forecasts. This development comes in the context of a rapidly accelerating competition among technology companies to apply AI in climate forecasting. Huawei launched its 'Bango-Weather' model in 2023, while Google announced last year that its AI-based model surpassed traditional methods in this field. This progress is expected to improve the global ability to predict severe weather events, which are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change, thereby supporting adaptation efforts and reducing human and economic losses.

**Invasive Species ChatGPT On Track to Take Over by 2030**
ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM), is on track to take over by 2030, according to predictions. Initially, it began by replacing lower-level jobs, but now even high-paying dream jobs are under threat due to companies adopting AI-first hiring practices. This shift is driven by the ability of AI to perform tasks more cheaply. The author notes that the rapid advancement of AI has been unexpected, with agents becoming increasingly human-like in their responses and behavior. As the author states, 'It studied the responses we chose. It mimicked our behaviour by analyzing our...'

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Microsoft's AI Weather Model Surpasses Traditional Forecasting Methods**
A weather forecasting AI model developed by Microsoft has surpassed traditional forecasting methods in performance. The model, called 'Aurora', has learned from over 100 million hours of past weather patterns and has shown superior performance in predicting the trajectory of tropical cyclones, surpassing the results of major forecasting centers around the world, including the Japan Meteorological Agency. The model has also demonstrated high accuracy in predicting wave heights, air pollution, and 10-day weather forecasts. According to the researchers, the model's ability to learn from vast amounts of data and adapt to specific tasks allows it to outperform traditional methods. The development of the model began in 2023 and has shown promising results in its first research phase, with the potential to be applied to various fields such as flood prediction, air pollution mitigation, and renewable energy production. As one of the researchers, Paris Perdikaris from the University of Pennsylvania, said, 'In the future, we may be able to use this model for various applications such as flood prediction, air pollution control, and renewable energy production.'

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**AI Advances Weather Forecasting with Unprecedented Accuracy**
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing weather forecasting, enabling more accurate and efficient predictions. Google's GenCast model, trained on historical data, has shown unprecedented accuracy in predicting weather and extreme events over a 15-day period. If GenCast had been operational in 2019, it would have outperformed the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in 97% of cases for over 1,300 climate disasters. Microsoft's Aurora model, developed by a laboratory in Amsterdam, has become the first AI model to consistently outperform seven state weather centers in predicting the trajectory of cyclones over a five-day period. According to Paris Perdikaris, the lead author of Aurora, the next challenge will be to develop systems that can work directly with observations, such as satellites, to generate high-resolution predictions anywhere in the world. 'We will always need human expertise to interpret the data,' says Laure Raynaud, a researcher at Météo-France, which is developing the IA version of its Arpège and AROME models. 'When it comes to protecting people and property, I don't think we can do without human expertise.'

**AI Breakthrough: Predicting the Weather for a Month with High Accuracy**
Predicting the weather for an entire month with high accuracy is no longer a distant dream for meteorologists. Thanks to AI, this possibility is becoming a reality. A recent study led by Trent Vonich, a PhD student at the University of Washington, has shown that with the help of artificial intelligence, it is possible to overcome the 14-day barrier of conventional meteorological models. The Graphcast model, developed by the DeepMind team, has made significant progress in this area. By comparing simulated data with reanalysis data (historical weather archives), the researchers were able to improve the accuracy of their predictions by 86% at 10 days and showed good performance even for longer periods. As Vonich said, 'This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the field of meteorology.'

**Can AI Models Predict the Weather 30 Days in Advance?**
Researchers Trent Vonich and Gregory Hakim from the University of Washington have made a breakthrough in meteorological predictions using Google's GraphCast AI model, which is trained on 40 years of 'reanalysis' data. They claim to have improved predictions by 86% at 10 days and surprisingly, the model showed the ability to predict the weather up to 33 days. 'We didn't find a limit to the extent of the predictions,' says Trent Vonich in Science. 'We just ran out of memory.' However, their study has several limitations, including that they only tested their theory with past weather reconstructions and did not provide real predictions beyond two weeks. Additionally, their study does not settle the debate on the magnitude of the butterfly effect in meteorology. A 2023 study published in Geophysical Research Letters showed that AI models ignore small-scale atmospheric processes that are supposed to create chaos and doubt their ability to push the limits of predictions. Other researchers admit that small errors can proliferate, but argue that their effects may not be as critical as thought.

**Aurora: Microsoft's AI Model Revolutionizes Weather Forecasting**
Microsoft has developed a new artificial intelligence model called Aurora, which has surpassed traditional methods in predicting weather and hurricanes. According to the study published in Nature, Aurora was able to accurately predict the paths of all hurricanes in 2023, outperforming the National Hurricane Center. The model was trained on past data only and was able to predict the path of the Doksuri typhoon four days in advance, which was more accurate than official predictions at the time. Aurora's predictions are also significantly cheaper than traditional models, requiring hundreds of times less computational power. In 10-day global weather forecasting, Aurora outperformed the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) by 92%. 'We're seeing a new era in meteorology,' said Paris Perdikaris, a professor of machine engineering at Pennsylvania University. 'In the future, our goal is to have real-time high-resolution predictions using satellite and weather station data.'

**Artificial Intelligence Makes Significant Progress in Predicting Weather and Storms**
Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress in predicting weather and storms. Google's 'GenCast' model, trained on historical data, has shown the ability to predict extreme weather and climate events with 97% accuracy 15 days in advance. If 'GenCast' was operational in 2019, it would have exceeded the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) in more than 1300 weather-related disasters. Google and Microsoft have developed AI tools that can produce better forecasts than traditional computers in a few minutes. Microsoft's 'Aurora' model, created by a team in Amsterdam, has predicted the path of hurricanes for 5 days with better accuracy than 7 government forecasting centers, according to a study published in the scientific journal 'Nature'. The rapid progress of AI has led to the development of two new AI models, 'Arbige' and 'Arom', but they still have limitations, including requiring hours of computational processing and consuming large amounts of energy. In the next 5-10 years, the goal is to build systems that can work directly with weather observation systems, such as satellites, to provide high-accuracy forecasts wherever needed. Many countries currently lack reliable warning systems. The 'physical' models, which have been developed over decades, rely on large amounts of observational data or weather archives, and apply physical laws to make predictions. AI models, on the other hand, collect and process data in a 'statistical' way, without re-calculating everything, according to researcher Lor Raïno. With the help of AI, it may be possible to make predictions more frequently, especially for destructive storms that are difficult to predict. The French Meteorological Agency is working to provide AI-supported forecasts on a scale of a few hundred meters. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts is developing an AI model that is 1000 times less computationally intensive than the traditional model, according to Florance Rabie, the director general of the center, which provides forecasts for 35 European countries. The AI model currently produces forecasts on a scale of about 30 square kilometers, which is less detailed than the 'Aurora' model, but its first operational version is being used by local weather experts since February to prepare warnings for the population. These forecasts will not disappear quickly, according to Lor Raïno, who says that 'we will always need human experts to evaluate the data'. Florance Rabie adds that 'when it comes to protecting people and property, I don't think we can do without human expertise'.

Google's 'GenCast' model, trained on historical data, has shown the ability to predict weather and extreme climate events 15 days in advance with unprecedented accuracy. If 'GenCast' were operational in 2019, it would have exceeded the global reference forecast, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), in 97% of cases, surpassing 1300 climate-related disasters. Microsoft's 'Aurora' model, developed by a research lab in Amsterdam, has become the first AI model to predict the path of hurricanes 5 days in advance with better accuracy than 7 government forecasting centers, according to a study published in the scientific journal 'Nature'. 'Aurora' was able to predict the path of Typhoon Doksuri 4 days in advance, while official forecasts at the time indicated it was heading towards Taiwan.

Many countries currently lack reliable warning systems. According to Lor Raïno, a researcher at the French meteorological agency Météo-France, 'we didn't think it would happen this fast.' The agency is developing two AI-based forecasting models, 'Arbieg' and 'Arome'. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts is also working on a new AI model, which is 'a thousand times less computationally intensive' than the traditional model, according to Florance Rappé, the director-general of the center, which provides forecasts for 35 European countries. The AI model currently produces forecasts on a scale of around 30 square kilometers, which is less detailed than 'Aurora's' (around 10 square kilometers), but its first operational version is being used by local weather experts since February to prepare alerts for the population. These forecasts will not disappear quickly, according to Lor Raïno, who says: 'we will always need human meteorologists to evaluate the data.'

**Aurora, Microsoft's AI System for Environmental Predictions, Takes a Significant Step Forward**
Aurora, Microsoft's AI system for environmental predictions, has taken a significant step forward. According to a new study, Aurora has surpassed traditional systems in several areas. For example, the AI system was 100% effective in tracing the trajectory of cyclones five days in advance and 92% effective in doing so ten days in advance. Paris Perdikaris explains how the system works: 'The training of Aurora involves two phases. First, a large amount of data is fed into the system, including one million hours of geophysical data such as wind speed, humidity, atmospheric composition, temperature, and so on. These data come from meteorological analyses, historical reconstructions of past events, predictions, and climate simulations, allowing Aurora to 'learn' to predict the evolution of terrestrial system variables in advance. In the second phase, the model can be adapted to perform specific tasks, such as using atmospheric composition to predict air quality or pressure models associated with storm phenomena to track tropical storms.' The AI system is able to obtain faster predictions because it learns patterns directly from the large amount of data it is trained on, without needing to rely on explicit mathematical equations like traditional models. The researchers explain that the system's greater accuracy is due to several factors, including its neural network architecture, which is particularly well-suited to capturing complex physical processes that occur simultaneously and on different scales. Additionally, the system was designed to leverage knowledge acquired in one field (such as atmospheric dynamics used in meteorological predictions) to improve predictive performance in other domains (such as air quality prediction). 'This interdisciplinary learning is fundamental,' emphasizes Perdikaris.

**Microsoft's 'Aurora' AI Model Revolutionizes Weather Forecasting**
Microsoft has developed an advanced artificial intelligence model called 'Aurora' that is revolutionizing weather forecasting. According to a study published in the scientific journal 'Nature', 'Aurora' has been able to produce accurate weather forecasts for up to 10 days, surpassing traditional methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and cost, especially in monitoring air quality, weather patterns, and the paths of tropical cyclones affected by climate change. Paris Berdicheas, the lead researcher on the project and a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said, 'For the first time, an artificial intelligence system can outperform all operational centers in predicting hurricanes.' According to the study, 'Aurora' has demonstrated remarkable accuracy, successfully predicting all hurricanes that occurred in 2023, outperforming official forecasts. One of the most notable cases where 'Aurora' excelled was in predicting the path of Typhoon Doksuri in the Pacific, where 'Aurora' accurately predicted the typhoon's landfall in the Philippines four days before it occurred, while official forecasts at the time indicated it would head towards northern Taiwan. The study notes that traditional weather forecasting models are built on complex physical equations that rely on laws of conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, requiring massive computational power. However, 'Aurora' has overcome these requirements, with the study indicating that its computational costs are hundreds of times lower than traditional models, opening up new possibilities for using artificial intelligence in weather forecasting at a low cost and high efficiency. Berdicheas said in a video presentation published by 'Nature': 'We are on the cusp of a transformative era in atmospheric science... in the next five to ten years, we aim to develop artificial intelligence systems that interact directly with satellite and weather station data, providing high-accuracy forecasts anywhere and anytime.' According to its developers, 'Aurora' is the first artificial intelligence model to consistently outperform seven international centers in predicting the paths of destructive hurricanes, up to five days before they occur, marking a major step towards replacing or integrating artificial intelligence into official forecasting systems around the world.

**Google and Microsoft's AI Weather Models Boosted by Machine Learning**
Google and Microsoft have developed AI models that can make more accurate weather predictions than traditional models, without increasing energy costs. Google's GenCast model, trained on historical data, can predict the weather and extreme events for 15 days with unprecedented accuracy. If GenCast had been operational in 2019, it would have exceeded the predictions of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in 97% of cases for over 1,300 climate disasters. Microsoft's Aurora model, developed by a laboratory in Amsterdam, has become the first AI model to systematically predict the trajectory of cyclones five days in advance, surpassing seven state weather centers. According to Paris Perdikaris, the lead author of Aurora, 'in the next five to ten years, the holy grail will be to build systems that can work directly with observations, satellites or others, to generate high-resolution predictions anywhere we want.' Météo-France is also developing an AI version of its Arpège and AROME models, which could lead to more frequent weather predictions, including for devastating thunderstorms.
