**Will Gold Prices Reach $7,000 per Ounce in the Next Few Years?**
Gold prices have risen sharply over the past two years, driven by increased demand from central banks and investors seeking safe-haven assets, amidst global geopolitical and trade tensions. Analysts predict that gold prices may continue to rise in the coming years. 'Cam Hui' of MarketWatch expects gold prices to reach $7,000 per ounce within three to five years, citing factors such as US President Donald Trump's policies, which have eroded confidence in the US dollar and led investors to sell US assets and seek safe-haven assets. Moody's downgrade of the US credit rating has also contributed to the uncertainty, with risks including a growing federal deficit and rising US debt. 'Hui' believes that these factors, combined with geopolitical tensions, market volatility, and central bank demand, will drive gold prices higher. Other analysts, including John Paulson and Ed Yardeni, predict that gold prices will reach $5,000 per ounce by 2028 and $4,000 per ounce this year, respectively. JPMorgan analysts expect gold prices to reach $6,000 per ounce by 2029, driven by a shift of 0.5% of foreign investors' US assets to gold, which would result in an 18% annual return.

**Gold Expected to Reach $4,000 per Ounce by 2026: Experts**
Experts predict that gold prices will reach $4,000 per ounce by 2026. Despite recent fluctuations, international financial institutions expect gold to continue its upward trend in the long term. Bank of America has announced that it expects gold to reach $4,000 per ounce by the end of 2025 or early 2026, surpassing its previous target of $3,000. Francisco Branch, Director of Global Commodities at Bank of America, said, 'Gold is currently in a correction process. This consolidation may take a few months. However, by 2026, a $4,000 level is possible.' Despite short-term market fluctuations, gold remains a popular investment option for investors. Analysts believe that even if some investors are drawn to riskier assets due to events such as the repeal of some trade tariffs during the Trump era, gold continues to be a safe-haven asset. Last week, precious metals declined due to limited dollar appreciation and increased risk appetite. However, Bank of America analysts point out that for gold to reach $4,000, investment demand must increase by at least 18% annually, a level that has been achieved in previous years. The upward expectation for gold prices is not limited to Bank of America. Citigroup has raised its forecast to $3,100-$3,500, while Standard Chartered expects gold to decline in the short term but rebound in the second half of the year, reaching $3,500. Goldman Sachs analysts recommend gold as a hedge against inflation, citing the failure of traditional stock and bond portfolios to provide adequate protection in recent times. They note that in an environment of increasing US debt, interest rate pressure, and geopolitical uncertainty, investors are seeking more resilient alternatives, and gold and oil are emerging as leading options for both inflation protection and positive real returns.

**Will the Rise in Gold Prices be Sustainable? Expert Predicts New Levels**
The price of gold has risen in recent weeks, with the price of one ounce of gold increasing by 0.6% to $3,310. In Turkey, the price of gram gold is trading at 4,175 TL, while the price of quarter gold is 6,875 TL. The rise in gold prices is attributed to the developments in US trade policies and the geopolitical risks between Russia and Ukraine. The US has increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% from 25%, which has positively affected gold prices. Additionally, President Trump's accusation of China violating the trade truce has increased uncertainty in global trade and led investors to seek safe-haven assets like gold. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has also increased risk perception in the markets. International banks, including Bank of America, Citi, Standard Chartered, and Goldman Sachs, predict that gold prices will continue to rise in the long term, with Bank of America forecasting that the price of one ounce of gold could reach $4,000 by the end of 2025 or early 2026. However, analysts expect a consolidation period in the short term. Filiz Eryılmaz, an economist, notes that for a sustained increase, the price of one ounce of gold needs to break above $3,370. She advises investors to consider safe-haven assets like gold for long-term investments.

**Trump wants to maintain nuclear predominance**
US President Donald Trump announced his goal to quadruple the country's nuclear energy capacity by 2050. This decision is consistent with his aim to maintain the US's leading position in key areas and to give a strategy to the private sector. Trump ordered the Department of Energy to accelerate the construction of ten large reactors by 2030 and to contribute to the modernization of existing reactors. The executive order includes four decrees, which insist that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a 'culture excessively averse to risk' that establishes that nuclear facilities produce the lowest number of emissions, even below natural ones. According to Michael Katsios, Director of Scientific and Technological Policy of the Presidency, the executive orders will launch a 'nuclear renaissance in the United States' and will allow 'great innovators and entrepreneurs in the United States to overcome obstacles' in nuclear technology. The four executive orders are related to two areas of government: energy and defense. They allow the construction of nuclear reactors on federal land, reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and increase uranium mining and enrichment in the United States. Trump also signed an order to reinstall 'science with gold standards' in a moment when the government has cut billions of dollars in federal subsidies for scientific research and has reduced the staff of federal agencies focused on science. 'Today we sign important decrees that will make us the true force of this industry, which is enormous,' Trump said in the presentation of the executive orders. The Nuclear Energy Office has a budget cut of $400 million, but this is compensated by the increase of other items. According to the Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, the 'excess of regulation' will be reduced and the investment of risk capital in the industry will be encouraged, allowing 'to win the war of artificial intelligence with China.'

**In Gold We Trust Report 2025 -**
The In Gold We Trust report 2025, a renowned 450-page report, has been released. The report, honored by the Wall Street Journal as the 'gold standard of all gold studies,' has been downloaded and shared over 2 million times. The report covers various topics, including the status quo of gold, the Big Long, and the dynamics of the New Gold Playbook. The authors predict a gold price of USD 4,800 by 2030, with a possible inflationary scenario of up to USD 8,900. Central banks' demand for gold remains high, with a record 1,086 tons of gold reserves added in 2024. The report also discusses the potential of silver, mining stocks, and commodities, with a comparison of performance to date in the current decade with that of the 1970s and 2000s. The authors believe that gold will continue to shine in the second half of the decade, driven by factors such as the gold price being in a secular bull market, central banks' constant buying, and the explicit political desire to weaken the US dollar. The report also addresses the question of whether gold is already (too) expensive, with some monetary comparisons indicating that gold still has potential.

**DOE Issues Emergency Order to Maintain Midwest Grid Reliability Ahead of Summer Demand**
The US Department of Energy (DOE) has issued an emergency order to maintain grid reliability in the Midwest ahead of summer demand. The order, authorized under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, will keep the 1,560-megawatt J.H. Campbell coal-fired plant operational until May 31, despite its scheduled retirement. This decision follows recent assessments by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) that identified the MISO region as being at risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high summer demand. The DOE's Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) issued the directive as part of a broader federal initiative focused on national energy reliability and resilience. Additionally, new executive orders aim to promote the deployment of advanced nuclear technologies and implement 'Gold Standard Science' across federal agencies, emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, and peer review in scientific research.

**Gold Prices $10,000 by 2030? - Live Trading News**
Analysts predict that gold prices could reach $10,000 per ounce by 2030, driven by historical trends, the declining value of the U.S. dollar, and rising geopolitical tensions. According to InvestingHaven, gold could exceed $3,275 in 2025 and reach $4,000 by 2026. Incrementum's Stoeferle projects gold could hit $4,800 by 2030, citing central bank buying and the erosion of purchasing power. Knightsbridge Gold's current trajectory and market sentiment also support a significant revaluation of gold. As CEO A says, 'The establishment often downplays gold's potential, focusing on short-term price corrections or the allure of cryptocurrencies.' However, this narrative overlooks the fundamental drivers of gold's value, including the structural shift driven by decades of monetary mismanagement and the fragility of fiat systems. Gold prices are poised for a significant upward move, potentially surpassing $10,000 per ounce by 2030.

**Gold volatility increases as Trump tariffs tank markets**
The recent announcement of US President Donald Trump's new tariffs has led to increased volatility in the gold market, with the price reaching a record high of $3200 overnight. The tariffs, which aim to shield American industries from recession, have sparked fears of a global trade war and a stagflationary environment. The US Congressional Budget Office has warned that the federal deficit has reached a point of no return, and the country's public debt is projected to hit 156% of GDP by 2055. As a result, investors are flocking to gold as a safe-haven asset, with the price averaging nearly $2900 in Q1 2025, an 8% increase from the previous quarter. Analysts expect producers to report record quarterly margins, earnings per share, and cashflow in Q1 2025. The gold price is now rising faster than inflation rates, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Additionally, the silver price is well-supported at the $29 to $30 region, and the global silver market is expected to remain in a structural deficit in 2025. The precious metals mining space is experiencing a breakout, with many quality juniors trading at low-risk entry points.

**Islam Memiş Issues Critical Warning: Investors Should Protect Their Physical Gold**
Gold market expert İslam Memiş has made a critical statement about gold. Memiş stated that gold mines may be depleted by 2050, and that investors who own physical gold should protect their assets. Memiş pointed out that gold investments are increasing worldwide, and that scientists predict that global gold reserves may be depleted by 2050. Memiş warned that in the future, accessing physical gold may become difficult, saying, 'We are the last generation to be able to touch and own physical gold.' He also mentioned that in the process of transitioning to a cashless world economy, owning limited assets like gold may be prohibited. Memiş advised investors that gold will continue to appreciate in value in the long term, but warned that borrowing in foreign currencies or gold may be risky. He suggested that those without foreign currency or gold income should avoid borrowing in these currencies, but that borrowing in Turkish lira does not appear to be a risk.

**The Last Generation to Own Physical Gold: Islam Memiş' Warning**
Islam Memiş, a well-known Turkish financial analyst, predicts that gold mines will be depleted by 2050, leading to a significant increase in gold demand. He advises everyone to hold onto their gold, as it will become a rare commodity in the future. Memiş believes that physical gold will become increasingly valuable in the coming years and that gold owners should closely monitor the market. He also warns that people without a foreign income should avoid borrowing in foreign currencies, as it may become a problem in the future. Memiş quotes, 'We are the last generation that will be able to touch and own physical gold.' He predicts that people will only be able to see gold in museums in the future. Memiş also suggests that the new world order will discourage people from holding onto limited assets like gold, and that gold sales may be banned in the event of a major crisis or economic transformation. He advises investors to hold onto their physical gold, saying, 'Your grandchildren will look at your wedding photos and think, 'These people were crazy, they had such big gold pieces!''

**Gold Prices Soar to $3000: Experts Point to Geopolitical Tensions and Economic Uncertainty**
Gold prices are skyrocketing, with the price of an ounce reaching nearly $3000, due to several factors, including geopolitical tensions. According to informed sources, 'the intense political turmoil in the world, following the recent war on Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the aftermath of President Donald Trump's victory and his desire to end the conflict there and the tension between Kiev and Washington, have all contributed to the erosion of investors' confidence and encouraged them to seek refuge in gold, which is considered a safe haven in times of crisis.' This was confirmed by economist Michel Fayed, who noted that 'the lack of economic certainty has led to inflation and recession, and has driven investors towards gold.' 'We cannot forget the impact of central bank policies, particularly with regard to interest rates, on the price of gold,' Fayed said, adding that 'low interest rates make gold more attractive because it does not provide a specific return.' He also pointed out that 'the trend towards eliminating the dollar in some countries, such as the BRICS group, which is seeking to diversify its foreign exchange reserves, also supports the demand for gold,' and that 'the upward trend may continue in the short to medium term due to the ongoing state of uncertainty.' Furthermore, Fayed stated that 'the development of gold prices will depend on the development of the global economic and geopolitical situation.' Despite the positive real interest rates in the United States since 2023, the expectation of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in 2024 and 2025 has increased interest in gold. Fayed noted that 'when interest rates fall, assets that carry a return like bonds become less attractive, and gold gains more value.' Additionally, he pointed out that 'inflation, despite its decline to 2.9% in the United States in January 2025, remains a source of concern, and encourages investors to protect themselves through gold.'

**US Trade Policy and Central Bank Gold Purchases Drive Up Gold Prices**
The US's trade policy has increased the sense of risk aversion, and global central banks are buying gold, driving up gold prices. Despite countries continuing to increase their gold reserves, some scholars believe that the world will not return to the 'gold standard'. According to the World Gold Council, central banks have been buying gold for 15 consecutive years, with a net purchase of 1,045 tons in 2024, the third consecutive year exceeding 1,000 tons. The report states that the annual average of central bank gold purchases from 2010 to 2021 was 473 tons, while the annual average from 2022 to 2024 was more than twice the previous 12 years. 'Central bank demand itself is not unexpected, but the strong and sustained demand has even exceeded our original high expectations,' the Goldman Sachs report said. 'The high level of geopolitical and economic uncertainty in 2025 makes it seem that central banks will again use gold as a stable strategic asset, as they have in the past.' The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the involvement of North Korea, and the ongoing tensions in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea have all contributed to the market's shift towards gold. Economist David Huang said that the 'war premium' concept in economics, where the market automatically prices in gold as an asset during times of war and geopolitical turmoil, is driving the gold price up. The People's Bank of China has been purchasing gold in large quantities, with some reports suggesting that they have been secretly buying up to 55 tons in October, far exceeding their official reported purchase of 5 tons. The Washington-based think tank's economist, Lee Heng-ching, said that the reason for China's large-scale secret gold purchases is that they are worried about being subject to US financial sanctions, particularly if they were to attack Taiwan. They are buying gold to hedge against this risk and to store it in their own reserves, rather than leaving it in the vaults of the New York Federal Reserve. Both Huang and Lee believe that the world will not return to the gold standard, as the current economic system is too complex and the gold supply is not sufficient to meet the demand. They also believe that the 'Bretton Woods system' that was established after World War II, which pegged the US dollar to gold and other currencies to the dollar, is unlikely to be re-established. However, they do believe that gold will continue to play an important role in central bank reserves and will be used as a 'last resort' to combat risk.

**Could a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Reshape Global Finance?**
The U.S. government is considering acquiring up to 1 million BTC, which could make it a crypto superpower. However, this move raises questions about the decentralized spirit of Bitcoin and how the world would react. Acquiring such a large amount of Bitcoin would be challenging due to price swings and regulatory hurdles. If the U.S. were to hold 5% of all Bitcoin, it could impact the global market, potentially pushing prices to $125,000 by 2025 or even $2.9 million by 2050. This could also spark a 'digital gold rush' among other countries. However, a U.S. Bitcoin reserve could also shake up the global financial system, making the dollar look outdated or eroding trust in traditional currencies. The global reaction would be mixed, with some countries embracing Bitcoin and others pushing for regulations or developing their own digital currencies.

**How to Invest in Gold in 2025**
There are several ways to invest in gold, and estimates suggest that we can continue mining it until the 2050s. At that point, prices would likely surge. To invest in gold, you can buy physical gold, invest in gold mining companies, or invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track gold's surrounding markets. Some of the best options for beginners in 2025 include Barrick Gold Corporation, Sprott Gold Miners ETF, iShares Gold Trust Micro, and Kinross Gold. These investments offer a range of benefits, including diversification, risk management, and potential for long-term growth. However, it's essential to define your objectives and appetite for risk before investing in gold. Additionally, it's crucial to understand that gold is seen as a safe and stable investment at its core, but it's not without risk. It's recommended to spend solid time checking your strategy before making any moves.
