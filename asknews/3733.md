**Top analyst issues a blunt warning on Warren Buffett's net worth**
Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas warns that if Bitcoin maintains its historical yearly growth, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, will surpass Warren Buffett's net worth. According to Balchunas, if Bitcoin rises 50% this year, it would be in line with its long-term average, and Nakamoto would be worth more than Buffett. As of June 2, Buffett's net worth stands at $1,575 billion, and Nakamoto would need approximately $37 billion more to surpass him. Balchunas notes that Nakamoto's estimated stash of 1.096 million BTC is still appreciating, and he believes that the crypto community can learn a great deal from Nakamoto's legacy, comparing him to Jack Bogle, the Vanguard founder who revolutionized investing but didn't pursue maximal personal wealth. Bogle once said, 'There is nothing for Bitcoin, except the hope that you would sell out to somebody for more than you were paid for'. 'It's fascinating to ponder that the founder of something so successful never cashed in,' Balchunas wrote.

**Wells Fargo sees rise of companies holding Bitcoin on balance sheets**
Wells Fargo believes that Bitcoin is entering an 'institutional phase,' marked by the emergence of companies, known as 'Bitcoin Treasury Corps,' that are using capital markets to amass large Bitcoin holdings. According to the firm, these companies, including Strategy, Twenty One, Strive, and Nakamoto, may raise as much as $25 billion. Wells Fargo sees the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs as a key factor in institutional exposure, with ETFs attracting $136 billion in assets under management in just 16 months. The firm believes that the emergence of more Bitcoin Treasury Corps could become an even bigger source of assets under management, and that Strategy's efforts to tap the $300 trillion global bond market 'might be the most underappreciated bitcoin story of 2025.' As long as public markets continue to assign a premium to their Bitcoin holdings, Wells Fargo expects more Bitcoin Treasury Corps to emerge.

**Bitcoin's Global Impact: A Revolution in Finance**
Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, is revolutionizing global finance. In May 2025, its market value reached $2.2 trillion, following a historic high of $112,000 per unit, according to posts on X. Backed by blockchain, Bitcoin offers secure and decentralized transactions, attracting investors and governments. Bitcoin has transformed the financial system with its blockchain technology, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs. In 2024, Chainalysis reported a 30% increase in crypto transactions in Latin America, while Sub-Saharan Africa showed notable growth in DeFi usage. Globally, it moved over $1.9 trillion in transactions in 2024, according to Fortune Business Insights. In the US, more than 150 institutions have exposure to Bitcoin, with $132.98 trillion in ETFs and $30 trillion in public company holdings, according to Crypto Times. This surge is due to favorable legislation and the approval of ETFs. Nigeria stands out in Africa, with nearly 50% of its population using cryptocurrencies to combat inflation, according to Chainalysis' 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index. El Salvador, a pioneer in Latin America, adopted Bitcoin as a legal currency in 2021, using the Lightning Network for remittances that represent 24% of its GDP. Bhutan uses hydroelectric energy to mine Bitcoin sustainably, accumulating significant reserves through Druk Holding and Investments. Countries like Argentina and the UAE are also advancing, driven by economic instability and clear regulations, respectively. Despite its success, Bitcoin faces challenges. Research by the United Nations University (2023) found that mining consumed 173.42 TWh of electricity between 2020 and 2021, equivalent to the consumption of countries like Pakistan. However, 60% of mining already uses renewable energy, according to Cambridge. Optimistic projections, such as those from Galaxy Digital, estimate that Bitcoin could reach $185,000 in 2025. Its global impact, with trillions in motion, solidifies it as a key player in future finance, although its success will depend on regulations and sustainability.

**10/12 People who may shed light on who is really Satoshi Nakamoto - Tekedia**
Tekedia has compiled a list of 10 individuals who may be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. The list includes David Chaum, a cryptographer who proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his dissertation; Gavin Andresen, who built up a relationship with Nakamoto and became the dominant contributor of code over 'Bitcoin Talk'; Stuart Haber, Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer, who were cited in the white paper published by Nakamoto; Joseph Poon, who led on The Lightning Network and was Lead Founding Creator on the Handshake Blockchain; Wei Dai, who released 'b-money' in 1998 and was one of the first two people contacted by Nakamoto as he was developing Bitcoin; Ross Ulbright, who developed a 'darknet market' known as 'Silk Road' under the pseudonym 'Dread Pirate Roberts'; Dorian Nakamoto, who was incorrectly identified as Satoshi by Newsweek; Nick Szabo, who released 'Bitgold' in 1998 and has been accused of being Satoshi Nakamoto; Adam Back, who invented Hashcash and was one of the first two people contacted by Nakamoto as he was developing Bitcoin; Peter Todd, who was named as the real-world identity of Satoshi Nakamoto by Cullen Hoback, HBO, but has denied it; and Hal Finney and Craig Wright, who were individually engaging with Nakamoto on Bitcoin Talk but have been discounted as possibilities due to their involvement with Nakamoto. The article concludes that none of the individuals on the list have been definitively proven to be Satoshi Nakamoto, and that the true identity of the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin remains a mystery.

**The Rise of Cryptocurrency in a Hyper-Tech world**
Cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency protected by cryptography, using a distributed ledger called blockchain to record transactions. The first and most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, thousands of cryptocurrencies with unique features and applications have emerged. Cryptocurrencies function through a peer-to-peer system, where transactions are recorded and verified on a blockchain, and users store their private and public keys in a digital wallet to securely send and receive coins. Transactions are validated by miners, depending on the coin.

**Bitcoin for Beginners: A Guide to Investing in the Most Popular Cryptocurrency**
Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world, introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a digital currency that uses a decentralized database called a blockchain to record transactions. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by a central authority. Users can make transactions directly with each other without relying on banks or financial institutions. Buying Bitcoin can be profitable, especially for those interested in new technologies and innovative financial structures. The blockchain technology behind Bitcoin has the potential to change many areas of the financial world. For example, transactions using blockchain are faster than traditional payment methods. To buy Bitcoin, investors need to choose a trading platform or cryptocurrency exchange that allows the purchase and sale of the cryptocurrency. Popular platforms include Coinbase, Scalable, finanzen.net zero, and Trade Republic. However, it is essential to note that Bitcoin is a high-risk investment due to its extreme volatility. The price can fluctuate rapidly, leading to significant gains or losses. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties, potential government interventions, and hacking risks are associated with Bitcoin investments. It is crucial to understand the tax implications of buying and selling Bitcoin, as it can be subject to capital gains tax in many countries. In Germany, for example, Bitcoin gains are taxable, while losses can be deducted. It is recommended to consult a tax advisor to ensure compliance with tax laws. Before investing in Bitcoin, it is essential to read financial analyses and follow the market to develop a basic understanding of the market. It is also recommended to be patient and think long-term, rather than being influenced by short-term price fluctuations. The most important tip is to only invest money that you can afford to lose.

**Satoshi's Vision: Is It Complete in 2025? Kind of, but the Finish Is the Beginning**
In 2025, Bitcoin has become a store of value and hedge against inflation, but not the everyday currency Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned. Its scalability woes have pushed it away from peer-to-peer cash. Enter Kaspa, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockDAG, which is stepping up as the payment rails for a hybrid TradFi/DeFi world, breathing fresh life into Satoshi's original intent. Kaspa's block rate has been pushed to 10 blocks per second (BPS), delivering ~3,000 TPS with confirmations in ~1 second and finality in ~10 seconds. Its PoW security and decentralised ethos align with DeFi's user-sovereignty principles, supporting dApps, lending, and trading. Stablecoin integration is a game-changer, enabling practical transactions, think paying for groceries or settling invoices. Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups further elevate Kaspa's potential, supporting everything from decentralised exchanges to enterprise tokenisation. Satoshi's 2008 whitepaper couldn't predict stablecoins, ZK rollups, or the hybrid TradFi/DeFi landscape of 2025. Kaspa builds on his principles -- PoW, decentralisation, deflationary money -- but adapts them for modern demands. 'Kaspa doesn't aim to dethrone Bitcoin but to complement it, forming a symbiotic ecosystem: Bitcoin as the reserve asset, Kaspa as the payment rails,' said an anonymous source. 'Satoshi's dream isn't just complete, it's being reborn, bigger and bolder, in a world he could only imagine.'

**Bitcoin: The Price of the Cryptocurrency on April 21**
Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 as a response to the financial crisis. It promotes a libertarian ideal and aims to challenge traditional financial institutions. Despite its growth and adoption, organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund remain skeptical about the benefits of cryptocurrencies. The election of Donald Trump in 2024 led to a positive movement for major cryptocurrencies, including a new historical high for Bitcoin, surpassing $107,000 per unit. The development of new AI models, such as DeepSeek, has also impacted the cryptocurrency market. As of 09:00 UTC on April 21, 2025, Bitcoin is trading at $87,630.55 USD, with a 3.48% change in the last 24 hours and a 0.26% change in the last hour. Experts attribute the increase in Bitcoin's value to factors such as institutional adoption, investor interest, and continuous innovation in blockchain technology. However, investing in cryptocurrencies comes with high risks, including the possibility of a sudden drop in value.

**Bitcoin Price Today: Sunday, April 20, 2025**
The Bitcoin price today, Sunday (20), is US$ 84,786.05, representing a 0.49% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 0.19% decrease in the last hour, according to market data. Despite the fluctuations, the digital asset remains the number one in capitalization among cryptocurrencies. Created in 2008 by a developer under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin emerged as a response to the global financial crisis of that year, with a libertarian ideal that proposed challenging traditional financial systems. The currency uses cryptography to ensure a decentralized management, which prevents regulation by banking institutions - a characteristic that, at the same time, increases its volatility. According to Bloomberg analysis, the advance of the currency is linked to the search for alternatives in the face of global economic instability, the increase in institutional adoption, and the evolution of blockchain technology. The value of Bitcoin, like that of other cryptocurrencies, is defined by supply and demand. Its use requires a digital wallet, which stores the cryptographic keys that guarantee the ownership of the assets. Although promising, investment in cryptocurrencies is considered high-risk and may lead to capital loss, requiring caution from users.

**Cryptocurrencies Show Resilience Amid US Market Turmoil**
While the US stock market has seen a 5-trillion-dollar loss in just two days, with the S&P 500 index falling to its lowest level in 11 months and the Nasdaq 100 entering bear market territory, cryptocurrencies have shown resilience. Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen approximately 6% since the announcement of the tariffs, compared to the 11% drop of the Nasdaq. The cryptocurrency market as a whole, according to the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, fell approximately 4.9% during the same period. Geoffrey Kendrick of Standard Chartered believes that the prices of cryptocurrencies will remain resilient, saying, 'During the last 36 hours, I think we can also add 'US isolation coverage' to the list of uses of Bitcoin.' Kendrick notes that Bitcoin's performance has been better than many traditional stocks, including Microsoft, during the recent market downturn. The cryptocurrency community is also celebrating the supposed birthday of Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, which is based on the creator's profile on the P2P Foundation. However, some speculate that the date is not real but rather symbolic, coinciding with the anniversary of Executive Order 6102, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 5, 1933, which required Americans to surrender their gold to the Federal Reserve.

**BTC to PKR: Conversion rate; March 12, 2025**
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) was recorded at 23,053,675.94 in Pakistani Rupees (PKR) on March 12, 2025, compared to PKR 23,259,659.11 at closing on March 11, 2025. The surge in Bitcoin prices was driven by a substantial increase in trading volumes and a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency market following Donald Trump's election victory in November. However, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued a formal notification warning against engaging in cryptocurrency transactions, citing concerns over risks associated with digital currencies, including their potential for use in illicit activities and volatility. Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency that functions as a medium of exchange and a payment method independent of any individual, organization, or authority. It was launched in 2009 as a bit of encrypted software written by someone using the Japanese-sounding name Satoshi Nakamoto. 'This positive outcome was primarily driven by a substantial increase in trading volumes for Bitcoin (BTC) and a variety of other digital currencies, a trend that closely followed the U.S. elections,' said an article on Coinbase's financial performance. 'However, amidst this booming landscape in many parts of the world, it is crucial to be aware of the regulatory challenges cryptocurrencies face in various jurisdictions.'
