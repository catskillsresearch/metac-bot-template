**Our flip-flopping leaders are in retreat on defence: TOM TUGENDHAT**
Tom Tugendhat criticizes the UK's Defence Secretary, John Healey, for being too vague on defence spending commitments. Healey's 'aspirations' for increasing defence spending to 3% of GDP are not backed by concrete plans or financial commitments. In contrast, Ukraine's military has shown remarkable success in destroying Russian strategic bombers and disrupting their supply lines using drones and other technology. Tugendhat argues that the UK needs to adopt a similar approach, prioritizing practicality and firm financial commitments over 'aspirations'. He also criticizes the recent £3.4 billion deal to give the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, which will be taken from the defence budget, and the Labour government's reluctance to make hard choices on defence spending. Tugendhat concludes that the UK needs to be honest about its defence capabilities and make tough decisions to ensure its military is effective.

**Starmer Strengthens UK's Anti-Russia Stance: 'We Must Be Ready for War'**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has outlined a new military and defense strategy, focusing on the 'threat' posed by Russia. He stated, 'If we want to deter a conflict, the best way is to prepare for a conflict.' The strategy includes plans for 12 new nuclear-powered submarines, massive investments in munitions, and a command center for coordinating cyberattacks against Russia and China. The opposition Tory party and conservative media are skeptical, noting that Starmer remains vague on resources and has made a 'half-step back' on the timeline for increasing military spending from 2.5% to 3% of GDP, now aiming for 2034 instead of 2027. Starmer emphasized the need for national unity in the face of an increasingly unstable and dangerous world. The three main objectives of the new strategy are to make the country 'ready for war,' strengthen NATO, and accelerate military innovation to make the UK a 'leader among allies.' Specific plans include building six new munitions factories, creating a hybrid coordination center for the Royal Navy, and investing £15 billion in modernizing the nuclear arsenal.

**UK to build up to 12 new attack submarines**
The UK will build 'up to' 12 new attack submarines to replace the Astute class from the late 2030s onwards, according to the prime minister's announcement. The new submarines will be conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered, and will keep 'Britain and Nato safe for decades', as stated by Sir Keir. The government will also spend £15bn on its nuclear warhead program and commit to increasing UK defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027. The review will make 62 recommendations, which the government is expected to accept in full. The Labour party has committed to increasing defence spending to 3% of national income by 2034, but the Conservatives say this should be met by the end of the decade. The review will also include other announcements, such as £1.5bn to build six new factories for 'always on' munitions production capacity, building up to 7,000 long-range weapons, and setting up a 'cyber and electromagnetic command' to boost the military's defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**PM Starmer:  warns UK must prepare for war to prevent it**
Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a significant shift in the United Kingdom's military strategy, prioritizing 'war-fighting readiness' and deterrence amid global instability and rising threats from Russia. Starmer unveiled plans to boost defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034 and 'innovate and accelerate at a war-time pace,' citing Russia's aggression and global tensions as reasons to invest heavily in military capabilities. 'We cannot ignore the threat Russia poses,' he said. 'To deter war, we must be prepared for it.' The strategy includes plans for new submarines, expanded munitions manufacturing, and reaffirmed NATO-first commitments. Opposition voices have emerged, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch challenging the adequacy of Starmer's budget timeline and the Liberal Democrats arguing the UK must move faster and spend more immediately.

**Labour accused of making an embarrassing retreat on defence spending**
Labour's Defence Secretary, John Healey, has been accused of making an embarrassing retreat on defence spending after downgrading a commitment to spend 3% of GDP on national security by 2034 to a mere 'ambition'. Just 72 hours after saying Britain 'will spend' such an amount 'in the next Parliament', Healey told the BBC that it was only an 'ambition'. Critics warn that the 10-year plan is likely to prove unaffordable without a hike to 3%. The Ministry of Defence has announced plans to build up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines to boost the Royal Navy's commitment to the Aukus Pacific defence partnership, but the first of these submarines is not expected to enter service before the late 2030s. Labour has been accused of weakening UK security by the Conservatives, who say that the promises on submarines are a 'fantasy fleet' without real money to back them up.

**Suspend EU fishing deal until France stops Channel migrant crossings, Starmer told**
The UK is calling for the EU fishing deal to be suspended until France stops Channel migrant crossings. The UK has intercepted 14,811 migrants so far this year, a 42% increase from last year. France has intercepted just 38% of migrants, down from 45% last year. UK officials, including Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Defence Secretary John Healey, are urging France to take action. 'The French are completely failing to stop these illegal immigrants,' said Tom Tugendhat, adding that the UK should 'get serious' about the issue. Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, said the French are 'taking Britain for fools' and that the UK should draft in the marines to pick up migrants and return them to France. 'We paid them to stop the boats, they only make a half-hearted effort to do so,' Farage said.

**Boris Johnson may return as Badenoch becomes unpopular**
Conservative Party officials are planning to replace Kemi Badenoch with Boris Johnson as the party leader, according to the UK's Sun. The move comes after the party's loss of 674 council seats in the May 1 local elections and a significant dip in poll ratings. A Tory official was quoted as saying, 'We keep sharpening our knives and putting them back down again. Things are pretty grim.' Johnson, the former UK prime minister, is seen as the party's best chance of beating Nigel Farage's Reform UK in the elections. However, under party rules, Badenoch's position cannot be challenged until 12 months after she became Conservative leader, which could be in November. Officials are considering other options, including mass calls for resignation by members of the shadow cabinet, with Robert Jenrick and Laura Trott being considered as potential replacements.

**Can Kemi Badenoch's new policy idea save her from local election disaster?**
Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative Party, is facing a difficult set of local elections, with Nigel Farage threatening to 'eat the Tory party for breakfast'. Despite this, Badenoch is focusing on a 'culture wars' issue, proposing to end the recording of non-crime hate incidents by police forces in England and Wales. Critics say this is an attempt to distract from the party's unpopularity and that the move would prevent the police from monitoring serious antisemitism and other racist incidents. The elections are expected to be 'very difficult' for the Tories, with opinion polls suggesting they will fall far short of their previous performance. Badenoch's failure to capitalise on the government's unpopularity is worrying her followers, and there will be renewed speculation about her leadership after the results. Robert Jenrick, who was defeated by Badenoch for the leadership last year, has been making his availability to replace her clear, and others who were disappointed last time round, such as James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat, might also like another run.

**Government urged to take action against Hong Kong 'bounty hunters´...**
The UK Government has been urged to take action against 'bounty hunters' targeting Hong Kong pro-democracy activists living in the UK. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said letters were being distributed to neighbours of Hong Kong refugees encouraging them to turn their neighbours in to the Chinese embassy. The letters offered a reward of approximately £100,000 for information leading to the arrest of three individuals, including 17-year-old Chloe Cheung. Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said the Government will use 'any and all measures' to mitigate the risk to individuals and that the activity described is 'completely unacceptable'. Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine asked how the Government will 'bring these bounty hunters' to justice and utilise sanctions to 'crack down on Hong Kong and Beijing'. Conservative former minister Tom Tugendhat shared his experience of being targeted by communications and warned that the pernicious threat from the Chinese government is undermining the confidence in the British state and the credibility of its ability to protect its citizens.

**UK Protests Against China's 'Vast Embassy' Plan**
A large-scale protest has been started in the UK against China's 'Vast Embassy' plan. Several British ministers are opposing China's Vast Embassy plan. But what is China's Vast Embassy plan that has caused a stir in the UK...we will tell you. However, let us first know that the shadow home secretary and opposition Conservative Party MP Robert Jenrick, shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat, and former Tory leader Ian Duncan Smith joined hundreds of protesters who gathered at the proposed site of China's so-called 'Vast Embassy' in East London. Jenrick said, 'We do not want this historic building - behind the Tower of London - to become a big embassy of the Chinese Communist Party.' He added, 'This is the wrong location. This is the wrong process, and it is not good for the national security of our country.' The protesters are concerned that if the proposed embassy is allowed to become one of the largest diplomatic missions in Europe, it could be used as a 'spy center'.

**Tom Tugendhat: Allowing Chinese 'Mega-Embassy' in London Would Be a 'Grave Error'**
Former Tory Cabinet Minister Tom Tugendhat has stated that allowing a 'mega-embassy' for China in London would be a 'grave error'. The proposed 700,000 square foot Mega Hub, which would be the largest foreign embassy in the UK, concerns 'state power' and 'ignores human rights completely', according to Tugendhat. Speaking at the protest outside the Royal Mint Court site, Tugendhat said: 'This would not just be a turning point, it would be a grave error. It would be a very clear statement that our government had chosen the wrong side and not the side that was for the defense and protection of the British people and our economic future.' Tugendhat added: 'The reality is that some people made decisions in 2010, 2013, you can understand at the time. You can see the hope and optimism with which they approached it. To have the same optimism in 2025? That's not optimism, that's just voluntary ignorance.' The protest, which was attended by over 5,000 people, was held against the proposed complex, which would overshadow the American embassy in nine orms and be three times the size of the MI6 building. The plans for the historic site to be converted into an embassy were rejected unanimously by local councillors in December, but the application has since been called in for further consideration after support from ministers Yvette Cooper and David Lammy. Tugendhat warned: 'We know that when the Communist Party of China builds walls, what happens inside is never in the interest of Britain.' He added: 'We know that when the Communist Party of China closes doors, the only thing it traps is freedom. We know because many of you have lived it – many of you who are brave Hong Kongers, brave Tibetans, and brave Uyghurs, who have explained your testimony a thousand times, have been extremely clear – that when the Communist Party of China brings its presence, fear approaches.'

The protest against the proposed embassy was attended by over 5,000 people, including Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith and former immigration minister Robert Jenrick.

**London Protesters Rally Against Proposed Chinese Embassy**
A thousand people gathered in London on Saturday to protest against the proposed new Chinese embassy in the city center. The protesters, including members of the Hong Kong, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Chinese diaspora communities, as well as human rights activists, are concerned that the site is 'inappropriate' because it does not provide enough space for safe demonstrations. 'We don't need a mega-ambassador here,' said Iona Boswell, a 40-year-old social worker. 'It will be used to facilitate the harassment of dissidents.' Another protester, a member of the group 'Hongkongais de Leeds,' said, 'After the construction of the super-ambassador, they will have more people to do the dirty work.' Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative MP, also attended the protest, saying, 'It's about the future of our freedom, not just the site of the Chinese embassy in London.' The protesters are concerned that the new embassy will lead to an increase in economic espionage and the silencing of opponents of the Chinese Communist Party in the UK.

**AFGHANISTAN, WASHINGTONISTAN, LONDONISTAN: BEYOND BIDEN & BORIS - African Voice Newspaper**
BAME leaders in the UK parliament have called for immediate action to address the crisis in Afghanistan. They suggest increasing the number of British soldiers in Kabul, doubling the number of refugees accepted into the UK, and providing supervision and mentorship to Afghan leaders. Lord Simon Woolley, a respected adviser to British governments, emphasized the need for a 'global Britain' that prioritizes global leadership and responsibility. Rt. Hon. Rory Stewart, a former military veteran and British Senior Minister, expressed anger and disappointment at the UK's handling of the crisis, saying that it was 'unforgivable' and that the country had lost the capacity to think independently of the US. Rt. Hon. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, called for forceful leadership and emphasized the importance of understanding the fundamentals of leadership in times of crisis. The article also highlights the plight of women and girls in Afghanistan, who continue to face gender-based discrimination and violence under Taliban control. BAME leaders have called for practical solutions, including increasing the number of British soldiers in Kabul and doubling the number of refugees accepted into the UK.
