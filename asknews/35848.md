**Update on Proposed Tax Law Changes in the House and Senate**
As the 2025 legislative session begins, tax reform has become a central focus for both the House and Senate. House Republicans have proposed a comprehensive tax package to extend and expand the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), while Senate Republicans have adopted a more conservative fiscal approach. The House proposal includes significant reductions in Medicaid spending to finance the tax cuts, which could result in 8.6 million people losing health coverage over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The reaction to these proposals has been sharply divided, with proponents praising the bills as necessary to sustain economic growth and critics warning that they disproportionately benefit high-income earners while threatening essential social programs. 'The proposed Medicaid cuts have sparked intense opposition from healthcare organizations and state governments, who argue that millions of vulnerable individuals could lose coverage,' said a source. 'The debate underscores the broader conflict between tax reduction strategies and the preservation of public services.'

**Small Business Reps Divided on Trump Tax Cuts**
Small business representatives are divided on whether to extend the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The American Hotel & Lodging Association, International Franchise Association, and National Restaurant Association urged Congress to preserve the 'business, individual, and family tax provisions' enacted during President Donald Trump's first term. They argued that 'millions of small and family-owned businesses across the nation' would see tax hikes if the provisions sunset without congressional intervention. However, the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee conducted a hearing where minority leaders railed against Trump's tax policies, saying they benefit large companies and wealthy individuals, not small businesses. Michael Negron, a policy fellow at Groundwork Collaborative, testified that the Section 199A pass-through deduction benefits larger companies more than small businesses, with 74% of the benefits flowing to the wealthiest 5% of businesses. Walt Rowan, president of a Pennsylvania-based glass company, testified that the TCJA 'continues to disadvantage businesses like mine,' as he did not benefit from the small business tax deduction.

**Trump Considers Raising 'Super Rich Tax' Amid Republican Party Divisions**
US President Trump is considering adjusting the 'super rich tax' by raising the top marginal tax rate for individuals with annual income over $2.5 million from 37% to 39.6%. According to sources, Trump privately urged House Speaker Johnson to raise the tax rate and close loopholes for Wall Street investors during a phone call on May 7. The Republican Party is secretly drafting a new tax bill, which is expected to be released in the coming days. However, Trump vetoed the proposal last month, citing concerns that it would lead to a 'very destructive' outcome, causing many millionaires to leave the country and resulting in financial losses. Trump stated in an interview that this would create a lot of chaos and many billionaires would leave the country. The top marginal tax rate was previously reduced to 37% during Trump's first term, as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in 2017. However, this temporary tax relief is set to expire in 2025. Trump has again emphasized the importance of tax cuts in his current term, proposing to extend and expand the TCJA. However, there are divisions within the Republican Party on whether to raise the 'super rich tax'. For example, former White House advisor Bannon has long advocated for increasing the personal income tax rate to make the Republican tax bill more feasible. Analysts believe that raising the 'super rich tax' would help the Republicans avoid significant cuts to Medicaid and other taxes, and also help them avoid Democratic criticism of cutting social security to support tax cuts for the rich. However, Johnson, Lummis, and other Republican leaders, as well as business groups, are opposed to the idea. US Chamber of Commerce Chief Policy Officer Bradley expressed surprise that the idea has not been more strongly rejected. The chairman of the pro-free enterprise non-profit organization Growth Club, McIntosh, also considers this move to be 'political suicide', as bad policies and politics will lead to the Republicans losing the House of Representatives and the Democrats re-initiating impeachment proceedings.

**REPS LISA MCCLAIN, JULIE FEDORCHAK And PATRICE ONWUKA: Women Know The Value Of Tax Cuts To Our Economy |**
As National Small Business Week comes to a close, women entrepreneurs like Reps. Lisa McClain, Julie Fedorchak, and Patrice Onwuka are highlighting the importance of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in driving economic growth and prosperity. The TCJA, passed in 2017, slashed tax rates for families and job creators, leading to the lowest unemployment in 50 years and a record high median household income of $68,703 by 2019. If the tax cuts expire, small businesses, including 26 million women-owned businesses, could face a top tax rate of 43.4 percent, stalling their progress. McClain, Fedorchak, and Onwuka urge Congress to make the tax cuts permanent to provide economic certainty and motivate businesses to hire, expand, and invest. 'We cannot allow our nation's economic engine to stall,' they say. 'With the right policies in place, there's no limit to how far women-led businesses can go.'

**Opinion: Lawmakers must protect tax cuts that strengthen rural small businesses**
Small business owners like Mike Limberhand, policy chair for the Rural and Agriculture Council of America, are calling on lawmakers to protect tax cuts that strengthen rural small businesses. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provided a 100% bonus depreciation tax credit for equipment and machinery, 100% research & development tax credit, 20% small business deduction, and reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. These provisions are set to expire or need to be restored, and lawmakers must work quickly to extend them. Limberhand says, 'Now is not the time for lawmakers to push us off a fiscal cliff by massively raising taxes.' Extending these tax cuts will help provide certainty and confidence for small-business owners in rural communities. 'Rural small businesses have survived years of inflation, economic turbulence, supply chain disruptions, and tightening margins,' Limberhand notes. 'Retaining a competitive tax code is critical for rural and Main Street small businesses like mine.'

**GOP charges ahead despite deep divisions on Medicaid, SALT**
House Republicans are pushing forward with a massive budget reconciliation package that includes deep Medicaid cuts and an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. However, the proposal has sparked fierce divisions within the GOP conference, with moderates and conservatives at odds over the size of the Medicaid cuts and the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. 'Still a hell no,' said Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) about the SALT cap proposal, while Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) warned that he would not support any bill that does not adequately lift the cap. The Energy and Commerce Committee's proposal would reduce Medicaid spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, but conservative spending hawks are calling for deeper cuts. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has pronounced the cuts 'morally wrong and politically suicidal.' Democrats are united in opposing the bill, calling it a 'reverse-Robin Hood scam' that slashes federal health programs to accommodate tax cuts for the wealthy. The bill is expected to face a tough markup process, with Democrats planning to focus on the points of contention during the Energy and Commerce Committee's markup.

**House Ways and Means Releases Partial Tax Bill Text**
The House Ways and Means Committee has released partial text for the tax portion of a reconciliation bill, which aims to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and make other tax reforms. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the provisions would add over $4.9 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. The committee is expected to release additional text before a markup on May 13. The draft still lacks provisions on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Inflation Reduction Act energy credits, and more. Checkpoint invites comments from the tax community on how these proposals may affect tax practice and the federal budget.

**Extend Trump's tax cuts, pay for it by repealing Biden's climate handouts**
President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is set to expire at the end of the year, and Democrats are pushing for a $4.5 trillion tax increase. Republicans, who were elected with a mandate to end the 'lunacy of Bidenomics' and make America competitive again, must extend and expand the Trump tax cuts while preventing any tax hikes. Trump recently warned Republicans that a tax increase would ruin their chances of success in 2026. If the tax cuts expire, an automatic $4.5 trillion tax hike will land on working families, with the average taxpayer facing a 22 percent tax hike. Republicans must use the budget framework to extend and expand the Trump tax cuts through a final Reconciliation bill. This is the test of whether they intend to do anything with the mandate they were given. By extending the tax cuts, Republicans can prevent higher taxes on 40 million families and 26 million small businesses, and promote a stronger economy and more opportunity.

**Analyzing Republicans' Budget Proposal For 2025 TCJA Extension**
The Republicans' budget proposal for 2025 aims to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is set to expire on January 1, 2026. The proposal includes a reconciliation bill that would raise the Federal budget deficit by up to $4.5 trillion over 10 years, with the House of Representatives targeting $4.5 trillion in net tax cuts and the Senate targeting $1.5 trillion. The Senate's approach uses a 'current policy baseline', treating the current TCJA rules as permanent, which would make it easier to extend the rules without a sunset provision. However, this tactic has been criticized as a 'gimmick' that masks the true cost of the legislation. The House and Senate versions of the budget resolution highlight significant differences between the two chambers, including the depth of spending cuts and the permanence of TCJA. The reconciliation bill is expected to be a complex and contentious process, with Republicans facing challenges in getting a bill passed into law without adding significantly more spending cuts.

**Budget Votes And Tax Cut Hopes: Congress's Path To Reconciliation**
Congress has made progress on drafting the tax-focused reconciliation bill, but obstacles still remain. The House passed the Senate-amended budget on April 10, unlocking the reconciliation process and paving the way for one bill that addresses much of President Trump's agenda, including the extension of the expiring provisions of the TCJA. The reconciliation bill is expected to be large, covering a variety of policy areas, with tax being a top priority. The main aim of the tax portions of the reconciliation bill will be to extend the expiring provisions from the TCJA, including individual income tax rates, expanded child tax credit, the SALT cap, estate tax changes, and more. The budget resolution provides different instructions to the House and Senate committees, with the Senate instructions mandating a floor of $4 billion in spending cuts across the federal government, while the House section requires $1.5 trillion in cuts. The reconciliation bill is expected to be scored using a current-policy baseline, which scores extending policy already in place as costing zero, but Democrats have called this method 'magic math' and are skeptical of it. The bill is expected to be passed by Memorial Day, but there are several hurdles that could come up, including the potential expansion of existing credits like the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, and the potential rollback of the clean energy credits from the Inflation Reduction Act.

**Budget Reconciliation: Using the Current Law vs. Current Policy Baseline**
The House and Senate had to decide whether to use the current law baseline or current policy baseline when calculating the cost of changes to the tax code. The current law baseline assumes the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) will expire within the next 10 years, while the current policy baseline assumes it will continue. The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated that permanently extending TCJA will cost over $4 trillion in the first 10 years using the current law baseline. The Senate's Byrd Rule prohibits any impact on the national debt outside of the 10 year budget window. Using the current policy baseline would allow permanent tax changes without violating the Byrd Rule, as it assumes the TCJA will continue and does not account for the costs to extend it. The budget resolution passed by both chambers used the current policy baseline, which has never been used before. Leaders in both chambers will need to overcome objections from deficit hawks about the economic assumptions when using the current policy baseline.

**GOP Gimmick To Extend Tax Cuts Could Expand Obamacare Too**
Senate Republicans are attempting to use a budget maneuver to pass a permanent extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions, but it could also make it easier to pass a permanent extension of enhanced Obamacare subsidies. The 'current tax policy' baseline gambit would make it look like the TCJA extension costs nothing, but it could also apply to the enhanced subsidies, which expire at the end of the year. This could pave the way for a handful of Republicans and all Democrats to vote to attach a permanent extension of enhanced subsidies onto the reconciliation bill. As one bipartisan group of budget experts wrote, this maneuver would allow Congress to 'make budget provisions it favors appear free while making provisions it doesn't favor appear expensive.'

**Opinion | The price of GOP gibberish about Trump's tax cuts? About $4 trillion.**
Senate Republicans are using 'dynamic scoring' and 'current-policy baseline' to justify a permanent extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, despite a consensus among economists that it would result in a $4 trillion revenue loss over a decade. Dynamic scoring involves predicting the macroeconomic effects of legislation, while current-policy baseline argues that extending existing tax cuts is not a new tax cut because they already exist as current policy. However, experts warn that this approach is problematic and can be used to 'prove' that the tax cuts will 'pay for themselves' with tax revenue from faster economic growth. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, calls this 'make-believe scoring' and notes that the House of Representatives' budget resolution assumes that extension of the TCJA will stimulate more than 3½ times the revenue anticipated by the most optimistic model. Budgeting experts have also used analogies to illustrate the flaws in current-policy baseline thinking, such as comparing it to expecting a child to find a job after graduation or buying a new sports car because it's just a continuation of 'current policy.'

**This Week From the Hill (March 30 - April 5, 2025)**
The House and Senate are working to reconcile their budget resolutions, with the primary difference being that the House wants to extend the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ('TCJA'), while the Senate plans to address tax issues in future legislation. Some have suggested moving to a current policy baseline for scoring legislation, which would reduce the cost of extending TCJA. The Senate parliamentarian is expected to rule on this change this week. House Speaker Mike Johnson hopes to have the final budget reconciliation package to President Trump's desk by Memorial Day. President Trump wants the debt ceiling increase included in the budget reconciliation bill, but adding this could complicate matters for Speaker Johnson and may require further spending cuts.

**GOP Shouldn't Use Budget Gimmicks To Extend Trump Tax Cuts**
The debate is ongoing in Congress about how to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions that expire at year's end. The question is whether to use a 'current policy baseline' or a 'current law baseline' in the budget reconciliation bill. The 'current law baseline' assumes the TCJA provisions expire, making the cost of an extension $4 trillion, while the 'current policy baseline' assumes the TCJA gets extended, making the cost $0. However, a recent Congressional Budget Office report shows that extending the tax provisions would significantly increase federal debt over the long term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed support for the accounting maneuver, but it would have long-run implications, few of them positive. Democrats would likely use this accounting gimmick to expand the welfare state if they retake the majority. The Senate parliamentarian could decide not to bless Republicans' proposed accounting maneuver, and abolishing the legislative filibuster would have long-run consequences that conservatives would come to regret.

**Nearly 500 Business Groups Urge Congress to Permanently Extend Pro-Growth Tax Reforms**
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, along with 492 state and local chambers of commerce and national trade associations, has urged Congress to adopt a current-policy baseline in its budget resolution to extend the temporary provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and deliver permanent tax relief to American families and employers. According to the cosigners, adopting a current-policy baseline would avoid a $4 trillion dollar tax increase and provide businesses with the certainty and stability needed to make long-term investments. Neil Bradley, Executive Vice President, and Chief Policy Officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, 'Thoughtful tax policy drives economic growth while improving fiscal responsibility. Lawmakers have the procedural tool at their disposal to do both—now is the time to use it.'

**Can Congress Extend Trump's Tax Cuts Without Ballooning the Deficit?**
The House of Representatives and the Senate are at odds over how to extend President Donald Trump's tax cuts without increasing the deficit. House Republicans plan to add $4.5 trillion to the deficit to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions for 10 years, but Senate Republicans want to make the tax cuts permanent, arguing that this would not increase the deficit. The Senate parliamentarian would need to approve using a 'current policy' baseline, which measures the impact of the tax cuts relative to existing law, rather than the 'current law' baseline used by the Congressional Budget Office. Opponents argue that this would be an accounting gimmick and hide the true impact on the deficit. However, supporters argue that it would focus Congress on reducing spending and not just cutting taxes. There is no precedent for passing policy in reconciliation under a current policy baseline, and it is unclear whether the Senate parliamentarian would approve it.

**Can Congress Extend Trump’s Tax Cuts Without Ballooning the Deficit?**
The House and Senate are at odds over how to extend President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), with the House looking to extend the provisions for 10 years and the Senate wanting to make them permanent. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to push through the legislation, but there is a wrinkle: per budget reconciliation rules, legislation cannot increase the deficit beyond the 10-year window of the budget resolution. House Republicans estimate that extending the tax cuts would add $4.5 trillion to the deficit, but Senate Republicans argue that using a 'current policy' baseline, which measures the impact of a proposed law relative to legislation already on the books, would show that the cost of making the tax cuts permanent is zero dollars. Opponents argue that this baseline is a 'pure accounting gimmick' and that the effect on the deficit is still real. The outcome is uncertain, with some Republicans on board with the current policy baseline and others opposed.

**Major Federal Tax Changes Could Be Coming Soon**
Major federal tax changes are expected to occur in 2026, as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions are set to expire. If Congress takes no action, the top personal income tax rate will increase from 37% to 39.6%, and the standard deductions will revert to $6,350 for single filers and $12,700 for joint filers. Other expiring provisions include the maximum child tax credit dropping from $2,000 to $1,000, the $10,000 SALT deduction limit being eliminated, and the cap on home mortgage interest deductions increasing from $750,000 to $1,000,000. Neil Becourtney, CPA, notes that these changes could have significant impacts on taxpayers, and that Congress may extend or make the TCJA provisions permanent. According to the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, extending all expiring provisions would cost an estimated $5 trillion between FY2025 and FY2034.
