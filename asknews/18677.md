**Brazil's BRICS Presidency: A New Era of Cooperation and Governance**
Brazil will assume the presidency of the BRICS in 2025, hosting the summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7. The country has been a founding member of the bloc, along with Russia, India, and China, and has played a crucial role in its construction and consolidation. The BRICS has expanded to include 9 partner countries, and its membership is expected to grow with the addition of Indonesia. The Brazilian presidency has outlined six priority areas: facilitating trade and investment, reforming multilateral institutions, addressing climate change, governing artificial intelligence, strengthening institutional capacity, and promoting South-South cooperation in health. However, the bloc faces challenges, including the ongoing pandemic, economic instability, and the need for more inclusive and sustainable governance. The Brazilian presidency aims to position the BRICS as a leader in climate change, proposing a Declaration-Quadro on Climate Financing and concrete actions on cooperation, carbon accounting, and trade and ecological transition. The expansion of the BRICS has also raised concerns about the dilution of Brazil's influence and the need for institutional strengthening. The Brazilian presidency has proposed a disciplined and guided expansion, ensuring that new members are properly socialized to the bloc's practices and procedures. The country has also strengthened the 'people-to-people' pillar, promoting the participation of social movements, academia, and other actors in the construction of proposals for the BRICS.

**Are Countries' New Climate Plans Ambitious Enough? What We Know So Far**
The World Resources Institute analyzed the initial submissions of countries' new climate commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), for 2025. The results show that while some countries, such as the U.S., U.K., and Brazil, have made ambitious commitments, many others, including major emitters like the EU and China, have yet to submit their NDCs. The analysis found that the new NDCs submitted so far have made a noticeable but modest dent in the 2035 'emissions gap', with a projected reduction of 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 compared to 2030. However, this is far from what's needed to keep global warming within safe limits, and many countries, including developed and wealthy economies, have not strengthened their 2030 targets. The analysis also found that some countries, such as the U.K. and Brazil, have set ambitious targets, while others, such as Canada, have made only marginal increases to their targets. The report concludes that much greater ambition and action are needed to narrow the emissions gap and keep global temperature goals within reach.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Starmer's grown-up approach may lift some negativity**
Five years after the UK's exit from the EU, emotions have cooled, and a more sober examination of the relationship has led to a reevaluation. The new deal signed in May realigns the UK-EU relationship, moving away from a hard Brexit to a softer and closer one. The agreement includes a reduction in checks on food exports, allowing the UK to sell raw burgers and sausages into the EU for the first time since Brexit, and a reduction in bureaucracy for businesses. The Starmer government claims this will benefit the UK economy by as much as £9 billion a year by 2040. The deal also permits young people to travel and work more freely between the UK and EU, and British holidaymakers to use e-gates at more European airports. However, critics point out that the agreement does nothing to stem the small boats crisis, and the fisheries part was the most controversial component. The Brexit divide will not disappear, but this agreement augurs a more mature relationship that is focused less on separation and more on cooperation and maximizing the UK-EU partnership.

**UK Prepares for War Amid Rising Tensions in Europe**
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's predecessor, Keir Starmer, announced that the UK is increasing its defense investments to prepare its armed forces for combat amid rising tensions in Europe. Starmer stated, 'We are moving to a [regime] of readiness for combat as the primary goal of our armed forces.' He emphasized that the country's security will be based on partnership with NATO allies, and the UK will never fight alone: 'Our defense policy will always be primarily focused on NATO.' Starmer highlighted that the alliance is 'a fundamental source of strategic power' for the UK, and the country aims to implement innovations in its armed forces 'at the speed of war.' He plans to make British forces 'ten times more lethal by 2035.'

**France to Ban Smoking in All Public Outdoor Spaces from 2025**
France has announced a ban on smoking in all public outdoor spaces starting from 2025, as part of a broader national plan to combat tobacco. According to Health Minister Frédéric Valletoux, the measure aims to create a 'smoke-free generation' by 2032. 'It's unacceptable that in 2024, 75,000 people still die every year in France due to smoking,' Valletoux said. 'We want to create environments where smoking is no longer the norm.' The ban will be implemented gradually, following the example of over 7,000 areas that have already become 'smoke-free' through local ordinances. The government will establish the ban nationwide, uniforming the rules across the country. The new regulations will be accompanied by awareness campaigns, fines for those who break the rules, and incentives for those who quit smoking. The price of cigarette packs will also increase, reaching 13 euros by 2026. The plan has received support from health and environmental organizations, which highlight the harm caused by smoking not only to human health but also to the environment. Some representatives of the tobacco industry and tobacconists have expressed concerns about the economic impact, while some smokers have questioned the measure, considering it too restrictive. France is taking a leading role in Europe in the fight against tobacco, following the example of countries like New Zealand and Canada. The French government hopes that this move will inspire other European countries to take similar initiatives to protect public health and the environment. This ban represents a deep cultural shift: from a symbol of freedom and transgression, the cigarette becomes an habit to overcome for the common good.

**Sergey Sobyanin on the 'Cloud Cities' Forum: A Platform for Technological Innovation**
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin spoke about what awaits participants of the 'Cloud Cities' forum. In 2023, the Moscow government organized a forum on the future of BRICS cities, titled 'Cloud Cities'. This became an effective platform for exchanging best practices, expertise, and technologies. The first forum had over 5,000 participants, while the previous year saw 13,000. Representatives from India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt, and Tanzania got familiar with the work of key technological and infrastructure objects in Moscow, including the Metro Situation Center, 'Digital Twin of the Capital' and the Skolkovo Technopark. Several agreements were signed, including the implementation of technologies from Russian companies 'Informtechnika', IBI software, and Digital practices in Egypt. The Skolkovo Fund agreed to cooperate with The Corporate Group, a leading company in the UAE in the field of high-tech programs, as well as with the game console company Game Art Pioneers. In 2025, the 'Cloud Cities' forum will focus on robotic technologies and artificial intelligence, which are already playing an important role in the work of many city services and will become increasingly significant. The forum will bring together representatives of authorities, business leaders, scientists, and experts from over 35 foreign countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Africa. After the business program, participants will be able to get to know Moscow better, its rich history, and culture. Cooperation between BRICS countries and other states creates favorable conditions for the implementation of technological innovations. Joint efforts will help create more sustainable, intelligent, and comfortable cities for future generations, said Sergey Sobyanin. 'The cooperation of countries of the BRICS and other states creates favorable conditions for the implementation of technological innovations. Joint efforts will help create more sustainable, intelligent, and comfortable cities for future generations,' Sobyanin said. 'Cloud Cities' forum will be held on September 17-18 at the Moscow Concert Hall 'Zaryadye'.

**The BRICS Go Their Own Way**
The BRICS+ Leaders Summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025, with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as the host. The summit will bring together the heads of state of the BRICS members, including Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, as well as several partner countries. The BRICS have been expanding their trade and economic cooperation, and are working to create a parallel version of the original Bretton Woods institutions. They have established the BRICS New Development Bank, the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement, and the BRICS payment system (BRICS Pay) to displace Western institutions. The BRICS will not be announcing a new currency, returning to a gold standard, or abandoning the US dollar at the summit. Instead, they will focus on admitting new members, adding new countries to the partner list, and building out new systems for payments, settlement, and custody. The BRICS already have a common currency in the form of gold, which they hold as a reserve asset. The summit will be momentous, but it will not be a 'global reset' or the 'end of the dollar.' It will be an important step towards creating a new global monetary system.

**EU's Green Deal at Risk: Simplifications to Common Agricultural Policy and Energy Sector**
The European Union's Green Deal is at risk due to new trade policies and political balances. The European Commission has proposed simplifications to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which environmental associations claim will weaken measures to protect pastures, bogs, and wetlands. According to the associations, 'The European Commission has once again neglected nature and climate protection in the most significant European budget, the Common Agricultural Policy. Such short-sighted decisions not only hinder the resilience of agricultural businesses but also question the legitimacy of the Common Agricultural Policy, moving further away from environmental and climate goals set by the Union.' Germany and Poland are pushing for greater flexibility, but this contradicts their own efforts to avoid climate crisis prevention measures in their businesses while seeking public support for insurance against extreme weather events. The EU should not abandon its ban on internal combustion engines by 2035, but the fines for producers who do not meet emission limits for new cars sold from 2025 will be calculated over a three-year period instead of annually. The energy sector is also at risk, as the EU's road map for phasing out fossil fuels and uranium from Russia has been criticized for not accelerating the use of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and electrification. Instead, it proposes diversifying energy sources, which could lead to increased dependence on the US.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**BRICS countries adopt joint roadmap for entrepreneurship growth through 2030**
BRICS member states have agreed on a joint plan to develop small and medium-sized enterprises in the countries of the association for 2025-2030. Brazilian Minister of Entrepreneurship, Marcio Franca, stated that the initiative is gaining a special and institutional form, and will enable the exchange of experience in the global economy. The members also passed a declaration supporting the free trade regime in the global economy, warning that trade restriction policies may lead to a contraction of global trade and uncertainty in economic activities. A comprehensive Strategy for BRICS economic partnership through 2030 is expected to be endorsed by leaders of member states at a meeting in Rio de Janeiro on July 6 and 7.

Members of the BRICS group have agreed on a joint plan to develop entrepreneurship in member countries from 2025 to 2030, according to Brazilian Minister of Entrepreneurship, Microenterprises and Small Business, Marcius Franca. 'The initiative, launched under Russia's presidency last year and now led by Brazil, has taken on a concrete and institutional form,' he said. The plan aims to promote entrepreneurship and small business development in BRICS countries. The group also adopted a joint declaration supporting free trade in the global economy, warning that restrictive trade measures, including non-discriminatory tariff increases, could lead to further decline in global trade, disruption of supply chains, and uncertainty in international economic and trade activities.

**UK Opposition Accuses Starmer of 'Selling Out' to EU and 'Destroying' Fishing Industry**
Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservative Party, has stated that the agreement with the EU is a step back for the UK and makes it a 'rule follower' at the mercy of the EU. She has criticized the points agreed with Brussels on fishing, which will allow reciprocal access to waters until 2038, an extension of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Badenoch has also said that the new agreement with the EU returns the country to the 'starting point' nine years after the Brexit referendum and that this means following EU rules again, such as accepting the carbon price set by Brussels or allowing the European Court of Justice to arbitrate again in some areas. 'We left the European Union. That was settled, we drew a line on that. This agreement is taking us back to the past and that's why we call it surrender,' she added. The Reform UK party has also accused Starmer of having succumbed to Brussels for an agreement that 'opens the door to millions of European immigrants and sells the fishing industry.' 'He will never be forgiven,' they added on X. Before the exact terms of the agreement were revealed, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said that the concessions would spell the end of the fishing industry. One of the most contentious points of this package of measures is the agreement on youth mobility, which includes a future pact that would return the UK to the Erasmus+ program and a program that would facilitate the exchange of young people to travel, study or work, under age and time limitations, although both parties emphasized that it would not mean a return to free movement. Badenoch has indicated that she supports the principle of a limited youth mobility program to some European countries, but not to the EU as a whole, which diverges from the terms of the Labour Party. 'There is a big difference between a young person from France who comes for a year's sabbatical and one from 30 years old with several children who comes from a poorer EU country like Bulgaria or Romania,' she said.

**UK Reaches Agreement with EU on Trade, Defense, and Security**
After nearly nine years of voting to leave the union, Britain, with its significant defense capabilities, will participate in joint procurement projects. The two parties have also agreed to facilitate the entry of British food and tourists into the European Union and signed a new fishing agreement. The tariffs imposed by Trump, along with warnings that Europe needs to make more effort to protect itself, have forced governments around the world to rethink their trade, defense, and security relationships, bringing the UK and European leaders closer together. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who voted to remain in the EU in the Brexit referendum, is betting that presenting tangible benefits to the British people, such as faster electronic gates at EU airports, will outweigh the cries of 'betrayal' from Nigel Farage, a member of the Brexit campaign. The government says the agreement with its largest trading partners will reduce bureaucracy for food producers and farmers, making food cheaper, improving energy security, and adding around £9 billion to the economy by 2040. This is the third deal the UK has made this month, following agreements with India and the US, and while it is unlikely to lead to a significant economic boost immediately, it may increase business confidence and attract the investments that are desperately needed. Sunak said in a statement, 'It's time to look forward... to move on from old, stale discussions and political battles to find practical, logical solutions that benefit the British people.'

**Venstre Abandons Ambition to Phase Out Gas Heating by 2035**
Venstre, a Danish political party, has announced that they will not force homeowners to switch from gas heating before 2035, according to party leader Troels Lund Poulsen. This decision is 'deeply irresponsible', according to De Radikale's energy spokesperson Samira Nawa. 'I think a government party like Venstre should hold on to the agreements they make, especially in this time of climate crisis and security crisis,' she said. Poulsen argued that implementing the planned phase-out of gas heating by 2035 would leave thousands of Danish families with a large and unnecessary bill. 'It doesn't make sense economically or environmentally, when the gas is both Danish and green,' he said. Venstre still supports the idea of more people switching to district heating or heat pumps. In 2022, a broad majority in the Danish parliament agreed on a political ambition to phase out gas heating in Danish homes by 2035. Both Venstre and De Radikale are part of the agreement, which was made to make Denmark and Europe independent of Russian gas. 'It's a common EU goal to free ourselves from Russian gas, and Venstre is running away from that when they make this announcement,' Nawa said. She urges both Venstre and the government to think carefully about their decision.

**Milei Names US, China, and Russia as Leaders of New World Order**
Argentine President Javier Milei believes that Europe has not grown significantly in years and will face a tough struggle. He also stated that the US will lead the Americas and Europe, Russia will lead Eurasia, and China will lead the rest of Asia. Milei considers Argentina to be the main ally of the US, saying 'We are in the right place and at the right time, and that's why they cooperate with us.' This view is a change from his previous stance, where he criticized China and supported Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Milei's current views are also in contrast to Argentina's decision to leave BRICS and focus on developing relations with liberal democracies such as the US, Israel, the EU, and Canada. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has also warned that a new world order is forming and that Europe needs to prepare for it by 2030. She stated, 'We are ready to take control of the inevitable changes. Because we cannot let history dictate us.'

**196 Countries Agree on Funding Plan to Protect Nature**
The 196 countries participating in the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) have reached an agreement on a funding plan to protect nature until 2030. The agreement establishes a 'permanent arrangement' for funding efforts to preserve biodiversity and a 'mobilization strategy' to raise billions of dollars to protect nature. The plan aims to collect billions of dollars to achieve the goal of stopping deforestation, overexploitation of resources, and pollution by 2030, which threatens food security, the climate, and the survival of a million endangered species. The agreement calls for the world to increase its spending on nature protection to $200 billion annually by 2030, with $30 billion of that coming in the form of aid from wealthy countries to poor ones. However, the method of collecting and sharing funds became a point of contention between major powers and the rest of the world, leading to a breakdown in negotiations in Colombia. After two days of negotiations, a new proposal was presented by the Colombian presidency, aiming to narrow the gap between the North and South. On Thursday, Brazil presented a new proposal on behalf of the BRICS group, which is closer to a final proposal, during the closing session on Thursday night. The main point of contention is the demand from poor countries for the creation of a new fund dedicated to biodiversity, under the authority of the Conference of the Parties, as stipulated in the 1992 agreement. However, developed countries, led by the European Union, Japan, and Canada, in the absence of the United States, which has not signed the agreement, strongly opposed this proposal. They also criticized the fragmentation of development aid, which has already decreased due to financial crises and the withdrawal of American support since Donald Trump's return to power. The Colombian presidency released a settlement proposal on Friday morning, which includes a roadmap for reforming the different systems that generate financial flows aimed at protecting nature by 2030, leading to the agreement. However, some attendees pointed out that countries are still far from the right path to achieve the goals of the global biodiversity framework 'COP15-Montreal' adopted in 2022 to stop and reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030.

**French National Assembly Votes Against 2035 Ban on New Thermal Vehicles**
The French National Assembly voted against the government's plan to ban the sale of new thermal vehicles by 2035, instead opting to keep the deadline at 2040. The move was opposed by 34 deputies, mostly from the National Rally, while 30 deputies from the Renaissance, ecologists, and France Insoumise parties voted in favor. The European Union's principle of primacy of EU law requires France to adopt the 2035 deadline. However, Matthias Renault, a National Rally deputy, argued that 'the cost of buying an electric car is quite unaffordable for low-income households' and that 'the European automotive sector is not yet ready for this transition.' Danielle Brulebois, a Macronist deputy, suggested that 'nothing is pressing' to transpose the 2035 deadline into French law, citing ongoing discussions in Brussels and a 'review clause' in 2026. Marc Ferracci, the Minister of Industry and Energy, defended the 2035 target, which has mobilized the entire automotive industry and is not something that should be questioned. The European Commission has indicated that it is considering 'flexibilities' to alleviate the sanctions for car manufacturers, and a plan of action will be announced on March 5. The Commission seems willing to ease the fines for non-compliance with CO2 reduction targets in 2025, following pressure from the automotive lobby and several EU member states, including France and Italy.

**EU Fails to Meet Deadline for Climate Goals for 2035**
The European Union (EU) has failed to meet the deadline to present its climate goals for 2035, which expired on February 10. The EU Commission has not yet presented any plan, and it is possible that it will not do so before the COP30. The majority of countries have not yet presented their climate goals for 2035, despite the deadline set in the Paris Agreement of 2015. Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said, 'No problem, it's normal that it takes a little more time to have these plans with the highest quality.' However, the EU Commission still needs to have the plans on their table by September. The EU has not yet presented its National Determined Contributions (NDC) for 2035, which will be influenced by its climate goal for 2040. The Commission plans to present the legislation in the second quarter of 2025, but experts doubt that it will be possible to present the NDC before the COP30. 'The legislative process for the 2040 goal will take at least a year,' explains Michael Sicaud-Clyet, from the WWF, making it impossible to finalize the law and propose an indicative target for 2035 before the COP30.

**Trump in Trouble: BRICS Countries Shock the US Deep State with Strategic Move**
Pepe Escobar explains how the new BRICS dynamics are changing the global power balance and why Trump is now in serious trouble. The BRICS countries, Russia, Iran, and China, have made a strategic move that has shocked the US Deep State. They have formed a geo-economic and energy partnership, not just a geopolitical or military alliance. The International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is a key component of this partnership. Russia is investing heavily in the development of this corridor, while Iran needs investments for shipping on the Caspian Sea, building highways from north to south Iran, and infrastructure for ports in the south to connect to Mumbai, India. India is interested in this partnership as it is a key strategy for the country. The new BRICS dynamics are creating new trade routes, including the Seidenstraße 2.0, which will connect Europe to Asia. China's plans for the Seidenstraße go up to 2049, with a 5-year plan for each stage. The US, on the other hand, is not planning for the future, but rather focusing on short-term gains. Trump's 'America First' policy is a result of the US's inability to compete with Asia. The US is trying to sabotage the BRICS alliances, and 2024 is the year of the BRICS countries. The US has a list of 'swing states' that it is trying to destabilize, including Brazil, India, South Africa, Turkey, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia. Vietnam is also playing a significant role in the multipolar world, with a strong economy and strategy that is cooperating with Russia and China.
