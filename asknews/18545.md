**Russia's Ailing Aviation: Expert Weighs in on SBU Operation**
According to aviation expert Konstantin Kryvolap, the operation by the SBU was 'fantastic and phenomenal' and will have a significant impact on the Russian population's mindset. Currently, there are four Tu-160 aircraft at a Russian factory, which have been undergoing modernization for over three years. Kryvolap described the process as 'not modernization, not even revival, but rather a kind of mortuary.' The Tu-160 aircraft, which were stationed in Russia, numbered 13 and were used in operations against Ukraine only four times. The aircraft is equipped with a revolver mechanism that allows it to launch 12 X-101 missiles. However, the Russians have attached pylons to the Tu-95 aircraft to launch 8 missiles, but only four aircraft were used due to the failure of their wings. Kryvolap noted that this was not a successful attempt to use stolen materials from the production of the Boeing-52 for the USSR. The Boeing company is modernizing its aircraft, extending their lifespan to 2050, while the Russian Tu-95 aircraft, which was last produced in 1994, is in a different situation. As of May 31, the Russians had 24-28 such aircraft, with over 18 not based in the European part of Russia. The majority of the aircraft were stationed at the 'Ukrainka' airbase, but have since been relocated to the 'Belaya' airbase, where they were destroyed. Kryvolap stated that there were approximately 25 Tu-22m3 aircraft in the enemy's arsenal. It is worth noting that as a result of the 'Spider Web' operation, 34% of strategic carriers of cruise missiles were destroyed. The SBU targeted four military airbases in Russia: 'Belaya', 'Dyagilevo', 'Olenya', and 'Ivanovo'.

**Navy awards $536M contract to industry for first dismantlement of nuclear-powered ship**
The US Navy has awarded a $536 million contract to NorthStar Maritime Dismantlement Service to dismantle, recycle and dispose of the former aircraft carrier Enterprise (CVN-65). The four-year undertaking will set precedents for future nuclear-powered ship disposals. According to the contract announcement, the ship will be dismantled in its entirety, and all resulting materials will be properly recycled or disposed of. NorthStar, whose parent company is based in New York, has partnered with Modern American Recycling and Radiological Services to complete the work in Mobile, Alabama. Scott State, CEO of NorthStar, said the company will dismantle the ship 'safely, efficiently, cost-effectively and in an environmentally responsible manner.' The Navy expects to save an estimated $1 billion in cost by leveraging private-sector expertise in commercial nuclear power plant decommissioning.

**World's First Nuclear Aircraft Carrier Set For Dismantling Under $536M Plan**
The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded NorthStar Maritime Dismantlement Services a $536.7 million contract to dismantle the decommissioned nuclear aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN 65). The work will be carried out in Mobile, Alabama, and is expected to finish by November 2029. The contract includes the removal of hazardous materials, including low-level radioactive waste, and the recycling or proper disposal of all recovered materials. The decision to dismantle the USS Enterprise follows years of debate and a Navy report in 2022 exploring different options for the ship's fate. The dismantling project is expected to bring economic benefits to Mobile, Alabama, and the Navy and contractors have assured strict safety and environmental protections. The USS Enterprise was the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the world and played a significant role in many critical U.S. Navy operations throughout her service life.

**Putin shamed - Zelensky says operation to destroy 40 warplanes was 'Next to FSB'**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed that a drone strike, which destroyed over 40 Russian aircraft, including nuclear-capable warplanes, was orchestrated from within Russia. The operation, which caused $7 billion in damage, was launched using 117 drones and hit 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers. Zelensky described the operation as a major success, saying it was 'next to FSB' in terms of its complexity and effectiveness, and compared it to the US's 'Pearl Harbor' experience during WW2. The operation, which was in the works for over 18 months, is being seen as a significant blow to Russia's air capabilities.

**Ukraine's SBU Destroys Russian Nuclear Carriers with Drones**
The head of the SBU, Yuriy Butusov, revealed new details about the operation 'Pavutina', which used small drones to destroy Russian nuclear carriers. According to Butusov, the operation was a success, with 116 drones launched and 41 Russian strategic aircraft destroyed. The operation had significant consequences, including the destruction of billions of dollars' worth of military equipment, the elimination of Russia's ability to launch strategic attacks on Ukrainian cities, and the weakening of Russia's air defense capabilities. Butusov noted that the operation was logistically complex and required over a year and a half of preparation. The SBU used FPV-drones and mobile wooden houses with hidden drones to launch the attack. Butusov stated that all SBU agents involved in the operation returned safely to Ukraine. 'This is the first time in world history,' Butusov said, 'that drones have been used to destroy Russian nuclear carriers.' He also noted that the operation was a significant blow to Russia's military capabilities and that the country will have to spend significant resources to repair the damage. 'The enemy will have to spend billions of dollars to repair the damage,' Butusov said. 'This is a significant blow to the enemy's military capabilities.'

**Ukrainian Security Service Destroys 34% of Russia's Strategic Aircraft Carriers**
The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) reported that a special operation, codenamed 'Paution', resulted in the destruction of 34% of Russia's strategic aircraft carriers of cruise missiles, valued at approximately $7 billion. '34% of strategic carriers of cruise missiles on main airbases of the RF have been destroyed,' the SBU stated. The SBU has promised to reveal more details about the operation later. The operation, which took place on June 1, 2025, involved the use of drones to target Russian aircraft, including A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22M3. According to sources, over 40 aircraft were destroyed, causing an estimated $2 billion in damage to the Russian air force. The operation was led by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with SBU head Vasyl Malyuk and the SBU team executing the plan. The operation was logistically complex, requiring over a year and a half of preparation. The SBU first transported FPV drones to Russia, then mobile wooden houses with drones hidden under the roofs, which were then transported on trucks. At the right moment, the roofs were remotely opened, and the drones flew to destroy the Russian bombers. 'This is how beautifully the airbase Belaya looks now. The enemy's strategic aviation,' Malyuk said in a video, showing the destroyed aircraft.

**Ukraine Launches Significant Attack on Russia's Military Airfields**
Ukraine has launched a significant attack on Russia's main military airfields, according to expert Bogdan Dolince. 'The damage is a serious blow to the Russians,' he said. The real situation regarding the damage or destruction of aircraft will become clear in a few days after the appearance of satellite images. However, the attack is a significant blow to Russia. Dolince explained that the Russians have around 100 strategic aircraft, half of which are Tu-95MS, which are outdated and used to preserve resources for more modern Tu-22 and Tu-160. 'If we talk about the damage to such a number, then in fact, we are talking about the damage or destruction of half of all operational strategic aircraft of Russia,' he said. Dolince also noted that Russia is currently unable to produce new aircraft, which means that Russia will lose the ability to use these aircraft for many years. 'If we talk about strategic aviation, then indeed strategic aviation is a component of Russia's nuclear triad. So, we are talking about aircraft-carriers of nuclear weapons that can be used to launch from cruise missiles. Therefore, Russia is very afraid of losses, damage to these aircraft. If, of course, we are talking about damage, for example, to Tu-95, then this is a less significant loss for Russia, because these aircraft are morally outdated, and in the event of, for example, a conflict with NATO, they can be quickly destroyed,' he said. However, he noted that the loss or damage of more modern supersonic aircraft, such as Tu-160, and other types of bombers, is more serious. 'This is Tu-22, which are relatively modern. And in principle, today this is the basis of Russian nuclear security. And damage or loss of these aircraft can be very painful for the enemy,' he said. He added that such aircraft are in short supply in Russia and that Russia has only been able to assemble one test sample in 10 years. 'In general, Russia planned to produce up to 10 units of new Russian strategic aircraft by 2024. But this did not happen. And this speaks to the fact that today, in the event of a loss of aircraft, Russia will be unable to restore or rebuild its strategic aircraft, probably for the next 10, and possibly even 20 years,' Dolince explained.

**Ukraine Destroys Russian Aviation: Expert Estimates Recovery Time**
The SBU conducted a special operation to destroy Russian aviation, which the aggressor country used to attack Ukraine. Explosions were heard at airfields in the rear of Russia. It is reported that more than 40 aircraft were destroyed. Anatoly Khrapchinsky, an aviation expert and deputy director of a company producing electronic warfare systems, noted in an interview with 24 Kanal that the main Russian airpark is being destroyed, which was involved in attacks on Ukrainian territory. According to Khrapchinsky, Russia concentrated its strategic aviation on main airfields, which can fly and perform combat tasks. He noted that the SBU carried out a high-quality operation and disabled most of the modernized aircraft that functioned and could carry new missiles. 'These aircraft were involved in the main mass attacks on Ukrainian territory. Now the enemy will understand that even in the deep rear, he has no opportunity to protect his aircraft,' Khrapchinsky said. The expert explained that the number of aircraft in Russia is quite large, but the country can only use 60 Tu-22M3 aircraft, while in reality, there are only 25. The number of Tu-95 aircraft that constantly carried out attacks is 15-20. Now, most of the working aircraft that were able to take off have been damaged. Recently, there was information that Russia planned to modernize these aircraft, but now they will not even be able to repair them, Khrapchinsky said. The expert emphasized that the main aircraft-carriers of nuclear missiles of the class X-55 or X-102, which made flights in the Baltic Sea, in the border zones with the US and NATO countries, threatening with their presence, are now significantly lost. During the full-scale invasion, Russia faced a problem with repairing aircraft, so some aircraft were repaired for a year, Khrapchinsky said. 'To restore one aircraft, it may take a year. It is important to understand which aircraft were destroyed, because among them were conserved or non-functional. But what we see, as it explodes and burns - it is a sign that the aircraft were fueled, conserved ones would not have exploded,' Khrapchinsky concluded. It is worth noting that the SBU prepared for the 'Spider' special operation to destroy Russian strategic aviation for more than a year and a half. How it happened - read in the material.

**Russia's Strategic Platforms Destroyed: A Blow to Its Nuclear Shield**
The Russian Federation has lost strategic platforms, which is a blow to its nuclear shield, according to the channel. The Tu-95 and Tu-160 are the main carriers of cruise missiles, and the destruction of even a few of them reduces the ability to deliver a retaliatory nuclear strike. The A-50, which is referred to as the 'eyes' of the Russian army, has also been destroyed, which significantly reduces Russia's ability to manage airspace, coordinate air defense, and deliver strikes, as stated in the message. The loss of these important aircraft, which are no longer being produced, demonstrates Russia's inability to reproduce strategic resources in modern conditions of sanctions and isolation, writes 'Труха Україна'. The weakening of Russia's long-range aviation has strengthened NATO on the eastern flank, providing an opportunity for political pressure and rearmament of partners, as noted in the message. 'Russia's nuclear triad is being destroyed right now - this is a total slap and humiliation [of illegitimate Russian President Vladimir] Putin for the whole world,' writes the channel.

**France's New Aircraft Carrier: A Crucial Factor in Detering Russia**
France plans to build a new aircraft carrier, the Porte-avions de nouvelle génération (PA-Ng), by 2038. The construction of the first components is expected to start in 2025, but the actual building of the ship will likely begin in 2031. According to Ruben F. Johnson, a consultant for the Pentagon and expert on international military issues, the construction of the aircraft carrier is a complex and expensive process, and it is unclear whether it is worth the cost, especially given the growing threat from Russia. Johnson notes that the presence of the French aircraft carrier is crucial for NATO and other partners in the region, and that it would be a key factor in deterring Russia from launching a nuclear attack on the West. The new aircraft carrier is also needed to provide a platform for the French military to launch fighter jets, including the Rafale M and future generations of fighter jets. A US naval contractor and shipbuilder notes that France is holding onto its aircraft carrier potential because it understands that once it is lost, it can never be regained. 'No country that has given up its aircraft carriers has ever gotten them back. It takes too many resources to do that after you've returned your aircraft carrier forces to zero. The Brazilians said they're going to try, and I wish them all the best, but the chances are not in their favor,' the contractor said.

**A Royal Navy aircraft carrier is inside a hostile missile footprint. Can it survive?**
The Royal Navy's Prince of Wales aircraft carrier is heading into a warzone, where it will be within the footprint of hostile missiles. Critics claim that aircraft carriers are unsurvivable in such situations, but the US has achieved a temporary ceasefire with the Houthis, who are now targeting Israel instead of shipping. The British have experience navigating the Bab-el-Mandeb and Strait of Hormuz, where they have successfully destroyed drones and missiles. To keep the carrier and supply ship safe, the group will use layered defense, including intelligence gathering, cyber collection, and electronic warfare. This will involve geolocating potential threats, such as drones, and using submarines and aircraft to detect and neutralize them. As one expert notes, 'there is nothing in this current transit that will come as a surprise, and the group will have trained for all of it.'

**US Concerns Over China's Growing Military Power: A Threat to US Aircraft Carriers?**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent statement has caused concern among experts. According to Hegseth, China has the capability to destroy all 11 US aircraft carriers within 20 minutes using hypersonic anti-ship missiles. Although the statement is hyperbolic, analysts see it as a reflection of growing concern about the vulnerability of the US fleet to China's increasing military power. China has been actively developing the concept of asymmetric deterrence, focusing on long-range anti-ship ballistic missiles, such as the 'Dongfeng-21D' and 'Dongfeng-26'. These complexes, equipped with hypersonic warheads, are designed to penetrate layered air defenses and strike aircraft carrier groups at a significant distance. China has also been investing in reconnaissance capabilities, including the deployment of new KJ-700 long-range radar aircraft, which can perform not only airborne early warning but also optical-electronic reconnaissance and electronic warfare. This integration allows China to track US naval movements in real-time and quickly target US ships. Hegseth's statement is seen as a reflection of the real strategic shifts, as only a limited number of US aircraft carriers can be simultaneously deployed in a single region, reducing their operational flexibility and increasing the risk of a massive attack, especially in areas like the South China Sea. Analysts note that China is building a sustainable system of military deterrence based on relatively cheap but effective missile systems, which allows it to exert pressure on regional US interests using conventional weapons, achieving a strategic effect comparable to nuclear deterrence.

**The USS Enterprise Prepares for Its Final Voyage**
The USS Enterprise, the US Navy's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, is preparing for its final voyage to a shipyard where it will be dismantled and recycled. The ship, which served for over 50 years, will be broken down into its eight nuclear reactors, which will be sent to authorized waste disposal sites. The process is expected to cost between $554 million and $1.55 billion and take up to a decade to complete. The Navy expects to save significantly by not maintaining the ship, which would have cost $10 million annually. The USS Enterprise's fate is a portent for the US Navy's nuclear-powered carriers, which are costly and take years to build and break up.

**US Escalation of Campaign Against Houthis Expected as Aircraft Carrier Departs**
There are several reasons for the Houthis to be concerned about what will happen in the coming weeks, as the US-led air campaign is expected to escalate, with some estimates suggesting that this campaign will expand and cause more damage to the Houthis. The US is currently deploying two aircraft carriers, the USS Truman in the Red Sea and the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea, and the US Navy's aircraft are participating in the bombing of Houthi infrastructure. A US official told Al Arabiya and Al Hadath that the USS Truman was at the end of its deployment when the Pentagon asked it to extend its mission and return to the Red Sea, and that the USS Carl Vinson came to the region in preparation for the departure of the USS Truman. There are expectations in the Pentagon that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will ask the USS Truman and its accompanying naval and air forces to return to their base for rest and maintenance soon, and it will be necessary for General Kenneth McKenzie to make the most of the remaining time, and this will be through escalating the attacks before the USS Truman departs. The Houthi threat is an additional reason for the Americans to escalate the attacks, as the Houthi group has proven, day after day, that it is determined to carry out attacks that threaten regional security, and last week saw the launch of a ballistic missile towards Israel. This attack raises a lot of concern among Americans, not because of its danger, but because the US military and intelligence agencies have said, for more than two years, that they do not have accurate and complete information about the Houthi capabilities, and they have pointed out that they do not know exactly how many missiles and launchers the Houthis have, and some of them have been developed by Iranian electronics smuggled into Yemen, and some have been produced locally by the Houthis, and the US intelligence does not know exactly how many they have produced, what they have lost, and what remains. Destruction of Houthi capabilities Some estimates by special sources to Al Arabiya and Al Hadath indicate that 80% of Houthi capabilities have been destroyed. Officially, the Central Command said in a statement on Sunday that it had carried out its operations since March 15 'using detailed and comprehensive intelligence information', and the statement added that 'these strikes have resulted in the killing of hundreds of Houthi fighters and many of their leaders, including senior officials of the Houthi missiles and drones... and that the strikes have destroyed many command and control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons production facilities, and storage sites for advanced weapons.' The Central Command says that its operations have led to a reduction in the frequency and effectiveness of Houthi attacks, and that the number of ballistic missile launches has decreased by 69%, and the number of drone attacks has decreased. Eliminating the threat The Central Command can say that it has made progress in its campaign, but there are many doubts about the course of the military campaign. The most worrying thing is that the declared goal of the Americans is to eliminate the Houthi threat, and officials in Washington say that this goal has not been achieved yet, and may not be achievable at all. In the current distribution of power, where the Houthis control vast areas of Yemen, the Houthis will need minimal capabilities to carry out attacks like launching a missile or a drone. The second reason for concern among officials is that the US-led air campaign against the Houthis has begun, but the parties to the Yemeni conflict and the alternatives needed to control Houthi areas 'are not fully prepared to fill the gap', according to the view of officials in Washington. Escalation ahead In all cases, the Houthis will be in a difficult situation in a short time, as the Americans will escalate their campaign, and they have not yet used the 'B-2' stealth bombers stationed at Diego Garcia base, and they may decide to use them to strike more fortified warehouses. The Americans also know that Iran is following the provision of intelligence support to the Houthis from ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, but President Donald Trump has not yet decided to strike these ships while negotiating with the Iranians on the nuclear program.

**China can sink all US aircraft carriers in 20 minutes, says Pentagon**
The US Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, has admitted that the US loses to China in all simulated war games conducted by the Pentagon. Hegseth pointed to China's hypersonic missiles, which, according to US military reports, can destroy all US aircraft carriers in just 20 minutes. This is not a new concern, as the US has already expressed surprise at China's advancements in hypersonic arms and other military technologies. The US General Milley previously stated that the first detected Chinese hypersonic glider test firing hypersonic missiles was a new 'Sputnik moment' for the US, referring to the Soviet test that exposed the lack of US space technology. China has been superior since 2021, with its DF-ZF system, which can reach Mach 10 (12,348 km/h) and carry nuclear payloads, having been deployed on submarines and land-based launchers. The system's design allows for an unpredictable trajectory at hypersonic speeds, evading US Aegis and THAAD defense systems. 'We don't have the capability to detect it or intercept it with current technology,' acknowledges a US Navy official anonymously in The Washington Post. China has also incorporated a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS), which allows for launching a nuclear payload from low Earth orbit, avoiding early warning radars. 'It's a qualitative leap: combining hypersonic with FOBS gives China a credible first-strike nuclear capability,' says a Congressional Research Service report cited by the Pentagon. While China is deploying these arms, the US is accumulating delays. The US Air Force canceled its hypersonic missile program in 2022 due to technical failures, and the AGM-183A ARRW's operational deployment is delayed until 2025. The Pentagon's 2023 budget allocated $4.7 billion to hypersonics, a 40% increase from 2022, but the Senate's Armed Services Committee warned in an internal memo that 'China invests three times more in military R&D since 2018.' It was only a matter of time before China surpassed the US, something that Hegseth now criticizes, saying that Pentagon bureaucracy slows everything down and US companies don't help. Taiwan is now in total danger. The Chinese advantage is clear, acquired over the past two decades, according to Pentagon experts. The DF-ZF, with a range of 2,500 kilometers, are deployed on submarines and land-based launchers. From the South China Sea, they could reach Guam, a key US base in the Pacific, or any naval group with aircraft carriers in the Taiwan Strait without leaving territorial waters. If put on target, they would be history, as pointed out by the US Secretary of Defense. Beijing has created a naval exclusion zone where the US cannot operate without unacceptable risk, the Pentagon says. The general John Hyten, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also denounced in 2021 that 'bureaucracy strangles innovation' in the US. Meanwhile, Admiral Philip Davidson, former commander of the Indo-Pacific, warned that year that China could try to invade Taiwan 'before 2027' using its DF-21 and DF-26 ballistic missiles, capable of hitting 1,500 and 4,000 kilometers, respectively. But invade or not, the result is the same for the US military: they are losing the oceans, if not already. Without a superior navy, the US risks its global influence. That's why Hegseth insists on a change in doctrine. A RAND Corporation report, leaked in 2023, proposes abandoning dependence on aircraft carriers, 'high-value targets' that have no place in a world dominated by enemy arms that cannot be intercepted. The US, it says, must prioritize attack submarines and bases on remote Pacific islands. Meanwhile, the Pentagon admits that China is ahead: only in 2022, China conducted 135 hypersonic arms tests, compared to 9 by the US. Now its missiles are deployed along its entire coast, ready to 'kill' any naval group that enters its area of action.

**US Defense Minister Warns of China's Hypersonic Threat to US Aircraft Carrier Fleet**
US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth warned that China could destroy the entire US aircraft carrier fleet within 20 minutes using its hypersonic technology. Hegseth stated, 'China could destroy the entire US aircraft carrier fleet within just 20 minutes.' According to Hegseth, the US strategy has been to demonstrate power worldwide through aircraft carriers, but China could potentially knock out 10 carriers with 15 hypersonic missiles within the first 20 minutes of a conflict. Hegseth also criticized the US bureaucracy and slow pace of acquiring new weapons as the reason for China's growing advantage in conflicts, saying that the US always loses to China in Pentagon war games. 'Interesting Engineering' reported on Hegseth's assessment.

**US aircraft carriers adrift as China surges at sea**
The US aircraft carrier fleet is facing significant challenges, including production delays, rising threats, and shrinking numbers. The USS John F Kennedy (CVN-79) and USS Enterprise (CVN-80) are behind schedule, with the latter's construction attributed to late-sequenced critical material. The US Navy is working to mitigate these risks and reach a combat-ready state as soon as possible. Meanwhile, China is surging ahead at sea, with its first nuclear-powered carrier, the Type 004, nearing completion. China's military planners believe that carriers can provide unique advantages in war, despite debates over their relevance. The US's continued building of aircraft carriers ensures their place as a centerpiece of force projection, but their growing vulnerability is a concern. According to the US Navy's FY2025 30-year shipbuilding plan, the fleet will reach 12 carriers in three years, but will drop to nine by 2047 in some scenarios.

**Iran 'will cease to exist by September' if it doesn't agree to Trump's nuclear deal, warns US**
Iran may cease to exist by September if it does not agree to the nuclear deal proposed by Donald Trump, according to the Daily Express. The US is increasing its military presence in the Middle East, including the deployment of bombers and an additional aircraft carrier group. This move, according to the Daily Express, signals that Washington is ready to take decisive action in the event of Iran's refusal to negotiate. 'President Trump has already warned Iran that 'there will be bombings' if the deal is not reached, and has ordered the deployment of additional strategic air squadrons and a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East,' the media outlet reports. Israel, which is expected to lead any attack on the Islamic regime, is also ready for a military scenario, despite official restraint. 'Yes, there is a willingness to give President Trump time to try to reach a favorable agreement, which we also prefer to war. But the military option is undoubtedly real – it's on the table, and the time for a decision is approaching,' said one of the leading right-wing members of the Israeli parliament. A high-ranking source in the Israeli Defense Forces emphasized: 'Israel can no longer live with active terrorist threats.' The Israeli strikes on October 26 last year in response to 'unprecedented' Iranian attacks – destroyed most of the Islamic regime's air defense in Syria, Iraq, and Iran, and also destroyed Iran's ability to produce drones and combine warheads with missiles. 'These were the main obstacles during the consideration of a large-scale air operation against Iran,' said a representative of the IDF. Journalists write that Israel has a sense of 'renewed confidence' linked to Trump's return to the White House, whose administration has made it clear that, unlike during the Biden administration, there are no 'red lines' in restraining Iran's ambitions. 'After completing planned exercises in the Indo-Pacific region, the aircraft carrier strike group led by the Carl Vinson will arrive in the CENTCOM zone to continue supporting regional stability, restraining aggression, and protecting regional trade routes,' the statement reads. In addition, the aircraft carrier strike group led by the Nimitz 'has begun deployment in the western part of the Pacific Ocean to maintain our advantage in combat operations in the Indo-Pacific region.' Also, US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth has ordered the deployment of additional air squadrons in the region. 'The US remains committed to regional security in the CENTCOM zone and is ready to respond to the actions of any state or non-state actor seeking to escalate or exacerbate conflict in the region,' said Parrell. 'Minister Hegseth continues to clearly indicate that if Iran or its trusted individuals threaten American personnel and interests in the region, the United States will take decisive action to protect our people,' he added. As reported by OBOZ.UA, Iran is not planning to negotiate with governments that scare it. Tegheran has sharply increased its reserves of high-enriched uranium to 60%. Iran has brought its army to a state of combat readiness. Only verified information in our Telegram channel OBOZ.UA and Viber. Do not believe in fakes!

**US Continues Airstrikes on Yemen, Threatens to 'Completely Destroy' Houthis**
The US continued its airstrikes on Yemen for the sixth consecutive day, targeting areas in the provinces of Hodeidah and Saada. The US launched 5 airstrikes on a textile factory in Zabid, Hodeidah province, while continuing to target Saada province. The spokesperson for the Houthis, Yahya Saree, announced that the group had targeted the Ben Gurion Airport in Israel with a ballistic missile, saying, 'We have escalated our operations to target enemy warships in the Red Sea, including the USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier and its accompanying warships.' This comes as the Houthis announced the killing of 16 of their members in a battle they called 'The Promised Victory and Holy War,' referring to their operations in November 2023 in response to the Israeli genocide in Gaza. US President Donald Trump threatened to 'completely destroy' the Houthis, who have announced a fourth attack on a US aircraft carrier in response to US airstrikes. Trump wrote on his social media platform, 'Great damage has been inflicted on the Houthi savages, and I'm watching how the situation will deteriorate. This is not a fair fight, and it will never be. We will completely destroy them.' He also stated that the Houthis will lose in any case, but that Iran's decision to stop supplying them with weapons will hasten their defeat. Trump called on Iran to 'stop immediately' sending weapons to the Houthis and to let them fight on their own.

**US Destroys Houthi Leaders, Launches Attack on Aircraft Carrier**
The US has announced that it has destroyed several leaders of the Houthis, in response, an attack was launched on the American aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman. According to NBC News, Nasr al-Din Amer said, 'We will respond to the recent escalation with further escalation. Our response will not be delayed,' and promised to continue operations until Israel 'lifts the blockade of Gaza.' The Houthis, who have taken control of part of Yemen, including its capital Sanaa, have intensified attacks in the region in response to the war in the Gaza Strip. A senior official, as quoted by ABC News, said, 'This was not a pinprick... This was a crushing response that was actually targeted at several Houthi leaders and destroyed them.' The official emphasized the active support provided by Iran to the Houthis, saying, 'President Trump considered this unacceptable. We inherited a terrible situation, and this is one of the efforts needed to correct this injustice and restore global trade.' A source from ABC News reported that the airstrikes are expected to continue. They have carried out dozens of attacks on several warships, dozens of attacks, over 175 on global trade, and sunk several ships. We will hold not only the Houthis, but also Iran, their patrons, accountable, said Fox News' Pete Hegseth. The campaign will only end when freedom of navigation is restored. 'I want to be very clear: this campaign is about freedom of navigation and restoring deterrence. At the moment when the Houthis say, 'We will stop shooting at your ships, your drones,' - this campaign will end. But until then, it will be relentless,' said the minister. 'We will bring you to account as a sponsor of this proxy... We will not hesitate. This is not the Biden administration. The message is clear. We will pursue the Houthis until they stop shooting at our ships, and the Iranians would do well not to intervene,' said the Defense Minister.
