**British govt suffers setback in AI copyright battle**
The British government's plans to make it easier for AI companies to access data have been dealt a blow as the House of Lords backed more protection for content creators. The Labour government's Data (Use and Access) Bill aimed to introduce a copyright exception for commercial generative AI training, but an amendment passed by 272 votes to 125 requires authors to give permission for their work to be used and to be able to see what has been taken, by whom and when. Beeban Kidron, a member of the House of Lords, said 'creators do not deny the creative and economic value of AI, but we do deny the assertion that we should have to build AI for free, with our work, and then rent it back from those who stole it.' The bill will now be sent back to the House of Commons for further debate.

**U.S. Copyright Office Report Backs Licensing for AI Training and Rejects Compulsory Models**
The U.S. Copyright Office has released a report supporting the idea of licensing copyrights for AI training, while rejecting compulsory licensing and opt-out approaches. The report notes that licensing could be a 'practical solution' for commercial AI models, but not for non-commercial uses such as analysis or research. The Office also recognizes that most stakeholders do not support statutory changes or government intervention in this area. The report suggests that a compulsory license would have significant disadvantages, including setting fixed royalty rates and terms that can become difficult to undo. The Office leaves it up to copyright owners and AI companies to figure out the right way to license and compensate for training data, but explores options such as compensation structures based on a percentage of revenue or profits, and Extended Collective Licensing (ECL). The report marks the Office's third report on generative AI and its impact on copyrights since it launched an initiative in 2023.

**From melody to machine: who owns the future of creativity?**
The backlash from established artists against generative AI is short-sighted and protectionist, according to an article. The artists, including Elton John and Chris Martin, are pressuring the British government to restrict AI's use of copyrighted works. However, the article argues that AI's analysis and pattern recognition of copyrighted works is not copying or distribution, but rather synthesis. Demanding permission or payment for every use of a copyrighted work is technically unworkable and incompatible with progress, the article claims. 'AI doesn't copy -- it synthesizes,' the article states.

**US Plans to Cancel AI Chip Export Restrictions, AI Industry Chain May See Recovery**
The US Commerce Department has announced plans to cancel and modify the Biden administration's restrictions on the export of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips. According to Reuters, US President Trump plans to cancel and modify the restrictions on the export of AI chips, which were introduced in January this year. The 'Artificial Intelligence Dissemination Framework' divides countries into three levels: the first level, which includes over 10 countries and regions, can purchase AI chips without restrictions; the second level, which includes around 120 countries and regions, has an annual purchasing limit; and the third level, which is 'highly concerned' countries and regions, is completely banned from exporting high-end AI chips. The US Commerce Department spokesperson stated, 'The Biden administration's rules on AI are too complex and bureaucratic, and will hinder American innovation. We will replace it with a simpler rule to unleash American innovation and ensure American dominance in AI.' If the Trump administration cancels the export restrictions on AI chips, the domestic AI chip import pressure may be alleviated in the short term, and the AI industry chain may also see a recovery in valuation. However, it is still necessary to pay attention to the new rules that may be introduced by the Trump administration in the future, and the importance of self-control in the current trade friction background does not decrease.

**Nvidia to Release Modified H20 AI Unit in China Amid US Export Restrictions**
Nvidia, a leading US company in artificial intelligence, plans to release a modified version of its H20 AI unit on the Chinese market, after the US imposed export restrictions on the original model. The company aims to maintain its presence on one of its most important markets, despite the US administration's efforts to limit China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. According to Reuters, Nvidia has presented new technical guidelines for the development of modified chip projects, which will result in a significantly reduced version of the H20 unit, including reduced memory capacity. Clients may potentially modify the configuration of modules to adjust the performance levels of the chip. The Chinese market is crucial for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of the company's total revenue in the previous fiscal year, which ended on January 26. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, visited Beijing last month, just days after US officials announced new export license requirements for the H20 unit. As previously reported, the US has restricted the export of advanced Nvidia chips to China since 2022, citing concerns about their potential military applications. 'We want to find a way to continue to serve our customers in China,' said Jensen Huang, according to Reuters. 'We believe that our technology can be used for peaceful purposes, and we want to make sure that we can continue to provide it to our customers in China.'

**NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang Criticizes US Government's AI Chip Export Restrictions**
Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, expressed dissatisfaction with the US government's policy of restricting the export of NVIDIA chips to China. At the 'Milcon Conference 2025' in Los Angeles, Huang said, 'There is a logic that technology access is limited for economic or national security reasons, but this is a missed point that the other country's government is not limited in utilizing their computing power.' He emphasized, 'If we completely withdraw from a specific market, someone else will take our place.' Huang mentioned that Huawei, a formidable technology company, will likely fill the gap. He stressed, 'Therefore, we need to make the American Standard a global standard and build AI on top of American technology.' Huang also predicted that the Chinese AI chip market will reach $50 billion in a few years, and that the US will miss out on a massive business opportunity. He said, 'If we can bring this revenue back to the US, we can pay taxes in dollars, create jobs, and advance our technology much further.'

**AI race heats up: What U.S. export controls mean for Asia**
The US has introduced new export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights, which will apply worldwide from May 15, 2025. The controls aim to prevent the misuse of AI technologies by adversaries and maintain the US' technological advantage. The rules apply to countries and intermediaries that could serve as conduits for circumvention, and target AI model weights, which are the essential output of AI training. The US government has formed the view that controlling access to chips alone is no longer sufficient, as restricted countries could still benefit from pre-trained models developed using US-originated infrastructure. The rules also prohibit entities with VEU status from providing IaaS products to train advanced AI models outside of Tier 1 countries without BIS authorisation. Companies will need to adapt to the new regulations, which will impact their cloud and AI operations, partnerships, financiers, and customer base. Data centre operators and AI businesses in Asia can proactively adapt by securing access to alternative compute resources, implementing compliance measures, and ensuring contractual and regulatory readiness.

**US Introduces Global Regulation of Artificial Intelligence: A New Era of Control**
The US has introduced the first global regulation of artificial intelligence, aiming to control the export of advanced GPU chips for AI. The new rules divide the world into two categories: countries with unlimited access to advanced microchips and AI algorithms, and countries that require licenses. The latter can purchase up to 1700 chips per year, and any additional purchases require permission from the US Department of Commerce. The 18 countries with unlimited access include Australia, Belgium, the UK, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan, as well as the US. Companies with a 'Universal Verified End User' status, such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, are exempt from these restrictions. However, these companies must ensure that the technologies do not reach countries where the sale of American chips is prohibited, including China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. The restrictions are based on Total Processing Performance (TPP), a measure of overall processing power. Countries not among the 18 privileged nations can purchase chips with a TPP of up to 790 million until 2027, equivalent to the power of 50,000 Nvidia H100 chips, sufficient for advanced research. The restrictions are designed to encourage companies to obtain verified end-user status, providing the US with transparency in technology transfer and significantly helping to prevent the spread of chips to China.

**US Strengthens Control Over Global AI Chip Market**
The US is introducing stricter export controls on AI chips and technologies, aiming to maintain its advantage in advanced developments for domestic use and allies, while limiting access to these technologies for China. According to Reuters, the new rules require global licensing requirements for certain types of chips with limited exceptions. Countries are divided into three categories. The first group, consisting of 18 countries including Japan, the UK, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will face minimal restrictions. The second group, comprising around 120 countries such as Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, will face moderate restrictions. The third category, including China, Russia, and Iran, which are under arms embargo, will be completely denied access to these technologies. US cloud service providers, such as AWS and Microsoft, will be allowed to deploy up to 50% of their AI computing capacity outside the US, with no more than 25% directed to countries in the second category, and a maximum of 7% for any single country outside the first group. Additionally, advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), critical for AI training and data center operations, will be subject to restrictions. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are the main manufacturers of these chips. However, leading cloud service providers, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, will be able to create data centers under global licenses, exempting their projects from national quotas on AI chip supply.

**US Restrictions on AI Technology: Taiwan Gains Unrestricted Access**
The US has announced new restrictions on the export of AI technology, aiming to keep advanced computing power in the US and its allies. The new regulations limit the number of AI chips that can be exported to most countries and continue to ban exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. However, the US has granted its closest allies, including Taiwan, unrestricted access to AI technology. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that this move 'should create trust in the administration and control of our government and the compliance of companies with the law.' Taiwan has invited US officials and industry experts to the island to help companies understand 'relevant regulatory laws and trends' in the face of ongoing US restrictions on AI technology since 2022. Taiwan's government, which is always on guard against pressure from Beijing, has already implemented strict rules for chip exports to China and has repeatedly stated that it will enforce the US restrictions. TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker and a key supplier of chips for Nvidia's favorite KI, is based in Taiwan.

**US Introduces New Global Rules for AI Technology Exports**
The US government has announced new global rules for the export of chips and AI technologies, effectively dividing the world into three levels. The new rules restrict the export of AI chips to most countries, but provide unlimited access to American AI technologies for the US's closest allies. The restrictions apply to a wide range of technologies, including models of AI, and take into account the weight of these models. The rules also establish a procedure for foreign governments to sign agreements in exchange for easing restrictions. The world will be divided into three levels: 18 countries, including Japan, the UK, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will be exempt from the rules; around 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, will face certain restrictions; and countries subject to an arms embargo, such as Russia, China, and Iran, will be completely barred from receiving these technologies. Additionally, US-based suppliers, such as AWS and Microsoft, will be allowed to deploy only 50% of their total AI computing capacity outside the US, no more than 25% outside level 1 countries, and no more than 7% in a non-level 1 country, as said by the US government. 'The new rules are a significant step towards controlling the global flow of AI technologies,' said a US government official, 'and will help to prevent the misuse of these technologies by hostile nations.'

**US Tightens Rules on Export of AI Chips**
The outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden has introduced new restrictions on the export of American chips for training neural networks and AI developments. The export rules, which will take effect in 120 days, set limits on the total volume of sales of computational power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to most countries in the world. The restrictions aim to control global access to AI and expand restrictions on modern GPUs, which are necessary for creating high-performance computing clusters used in AI work. The first group of 18 countries, including the US, will be affected, but only indirectly. Companies and organizations in these countries will be allowed to place no more than 50% of their AI computing power outside the US and no more than 25% outside the first group of countries. The second group of around 120 countries, including Singapore, Israel, and the UAE, will face stricter restrictions, with a limit of 790 million total processing performance (TPP) by 2027, equivalent to about 50,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. The third group, which includes Russia, China, and Iran, will be banned from buying advanced chips necessary for creating powerful computing clusters. According to analyst Alexei Boyko, the new restrictions will affect Russian companies working in high-performance computing and AI, making it harder for them to buy necessary foreign microchips. However, Boyko notes that the ban on imports has existed before and is unlikely to be fully enforced. NVIDIA's leadership has criticized the decision, saying it will harm the global computing industry and push the world towards alternative technologies. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, has previously stated that the restrictions will only lead to NVIDIA losing the Chinese market to new players from China. The future administration of President Donald Trump is expected to maintain similar views on the competitive threat from China, including in AI technologies.

The embargo on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea will remain in place. According to Gina Raimondo, US Secretary of Commerce, 'The US currently leads in AI development and AI chip design. It's crucial that this remains the case.' The regulation, presented during the last days of the Joe Biden administration, aims to strengthen US dominance in AI by establishing strict controls on the circulation of chips and global development of the technology. The measure follows a four-year effort by the Biden administration to limit China's access to advanced chips, which could improve its military capabilities, and reinforces US leadership in AI by closing existing regulatory gaps. Although the implementation of the rule by the future administration of Donald Trump remains uncertain, both governments share concerns about the AI threat. The regulation will take effect 120 days after publication, allowing time for China to adjust competitively. The restrictions also include limits on advanced GPUs, essential for training AI models. Cloud service providers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon may request global authorizations to build data centers in countries affected by export quotas, accelerating access to AI under strict US control.

**US announces new restrictions on AI chip exports**
The United States has announced new export rules on advanced computing chips used for artificial intelligence, aiming to restrict access to countries like China. The restrictions, which include rules on weights for closed AI models, build on curbs announced in 2023. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, 'The US leads the world in AI now -- both AI development and AI chip design -- and it's critical that we keep it that way.' The new rules require authorizations for exports, re-exports, and in-country transfers, with exceptions for friendly countries. AI data centers will need to comply with enhanced security parameters to import chips. The rules will go into effect in 120 days, giving the incoming administration time to make changes.
