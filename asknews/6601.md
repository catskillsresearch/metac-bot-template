**BYD 'assombra' Europa, desbanca Tesla e cresce quase 1.000% em um ano**
BYD's astonishing sales growth in Europe is not a coincidence. The Asian manufacturer, which recorded its fifth consecutive month of sales growth outside of China in April 2025 with 79,000 vehicles sold, has a well-defined strategy to conquer the continent. This includes the launch of new models, such as the Sealion 7, Dolphin Surf, and luxurious Denza, as well as the arrival of the BYD Shenzhen, a massive ship with a capacity to transport 9,200 cars, to major European centers. According to S&P Global Mobility, BYD is expected to sell around 186,000 electric vehicles in Europe by the end of 2025, representing a growth of over 100% compared to the previous year, when 83,000 units were registered between January and December. In Brazil, BYD is on the verge of inaugurating its own factory in Camaçari, Bahia, and has already become the 9th largest car manufacturer in the country, with 30,157 units sold between January and April 2025. 'BYD is growing rapidly in Europe, and this is not just a short-term trend,' said a spokesperson for the company. 'Our strategy is to offer a wide range of electric vehicles that meet the needs of European consumers, and we are confident that we will continue to see strong growth in the coming years.'

**Tesla's Börsencomeback Fades as Sales Decline**
Tesla is currently struggling with declining sales, with new registrations in Germany dropping by almost 46% in April 2025. Since the beginning of the year, the decline is over 60%. This is despite the growing demand for electric cars, with almost one in five new vehicles being an electric car. Volkswagen dominates the market, with 9,725 pure electric vehicles sold, while Tesla only managed 885 new registrations, ranking 16th. This indicates that Tesla is losing market share, while Volkswagen is expanding its lead with a wide range of models and strong presence. As one can see, 'Tesla is on shaky ground', with its market position weakening. 'The company's struggles are a stark contrast to the growing popularity of electric cars', said an analyst. 'Volkswagen's success is a result of its broad model portfolio and strong brand presence', added another expert.

**UST's Wang Xingxing Reveals Humanoid Robot Industry's Hot Trend and Future Prospects**
The sixth Shanghai Innovation and Entrepreneurship Youth 50 Forum was held on May 10, 2025, where Wang Xingxing, CEO of UST, revealed that the humanoid robot industry has experienced an unprecedented hot trend, with many companies accelerating the landing of downstream scenarios. Many humanoid robot manufacturers have gone out of stock, including UST, which is currently facing a shortage of personnel in various positions. Wang Xingxing believes that in the next 2-5 years, the problem of end-to-end artificial intelligence will become the core of technical research and development. Therefore, the strongest humanoid robot company must be a company with artificial intelligence capabilities. Currently, hardware issues are also hindering the development of the industry, and how to produce low-cost, long-lasting hardware is a key factor in large-scale production. UST has become a leader in product sales, with a sales volume of 23,700 units in 2024 and a market share of nearly 70%. The company has also delivered over 1,500 humanoid robots. With the continuous progress of technology, humanoid robots are expected to become the next generation of large-scale deployment of intelligent terminals, bringing about a wide range of market opportunities. The 2025 World Robot Competition - the first Humanoid Robot Sports Festival will be held on August 15-17, 2025, with a comprehensive competition including football, track and field, and pharmaceutical sorting. The festival will also include a theme conference and a carnival. The festival is organized by the China Electronics Society, the Wuhan Investment Holding Group, and the China Humanoid Robot Association. The event will showcase the comprehensive capabilities of humanoid robots. Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, has been a focus in the industry. In June 2024, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would perform a major hardware upgrade on Optimus in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, and would enter the limited production stage in 2025. On March 21, 2025, Musk announced that Tesla had completed the manufacturing of Optimus on the production line in Fremont, California. Tesla plans to produce 5,000 units of Optimus in 2025 and 50,000 units in 2026. To accelerate the mass production of Optimus, Tesla has published multiple job postings on its website, mostly for engineers, including machine learning engineers, deep learning operation engineers, and reinforcement learning engineers. This indicates that Tesla is still investing heavily in artificial intelligence to improve the overall capabilities of Optimus. On April 19, 2025, the Beijing Humanoid Robot Half Marathon was held, which attracted widespread attention and discussion. It was found that multiple companies' humanoid robots had shown impressive performance. Figure is another focus humanoid robot manufacturer. On February 21, 2025, Figure released the Helix end-to-end humanoid model, which first applied the 'visual-language-action (VLA)' to humanoid robots, enhancing the robot's learning ability and limb control ability. The Helix is composed of two AI modules, playing the roles of 'brain' and 'little brain'. The 'brain' module is a 70 billion-parameter multimodal model that can process multimodal information at a frequency of 7-9 Hz. The 'little brain' module is an 8 million-parameter AI that converts the 'brain' module's instructions into actions at a frequency of 200 Hz. As the humanoid robot industry develops, AI chips (realizing robot brain and small brain intelligence), reducers, dexterous hands, PEEK materials, motors, lithium batteries, and silk rods (transmission devices) will also have development opportunities. According to iFinD financial data terminal, the concept stocks of humanoid robots include: Huaan Technology, Bluesky Technology, iFlytek, Three Flowers Intelligent Control, Shanghai Electric, Guangqi Technology, Billion Energy, Rui Xing Micro, Peng Ding Holdings, Sheng Hong Technology, Guangqi Group, Li Yi Intelligent Manufacturing, and Zhonglian Heavy Industry.

**Tesla's China Crisis: Will It Sink or Save the Stock in 2025?**
Tesla is facing a critical period in China, with 26,000 unsold vehicles in Shanghai, regulatory pressure mounting, and potential disruptions in supply chains. This could impact Tesla's stock and investors in 2025. The company is set to temporarily pause production of the Model Y and Cybertruck at its Austin factory, which could lead to further delays in delivery timelines for Cybertruck reservation holders. China's regulatory crackdown on Tesla's data collection practices is also a major threat, which could lead to restrictions on vehicle sales and production. To mitigate these risks, Tesla might consider adjusting its pricing strategy in China, but this could also squeeze profit margins. Additionally, Elon Musk's new role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration is drawing criticism, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Investors should keep a close watch on any legal developments surrounding DOGE and its impact on Tesla.

**Tesla Idles Model Y and Cybertruck Lines Amid Falling Deliveries and Inventory Pile-Up**
Tesla has instructed assembly line workers at its Austin Gigafactory to take an extended break during Memorial Day week, affecting the Model Y and Cybertruck production lines. This move comes as the company faces a slump in deliveries and rising inventory, with a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025 and 26,000 more vehicles produced than delivered. Tesla has also seen waning interest in the Model Y, with fewer than 50,000 Cybertruck units delivered since its launch and over 10,000 units remaining unsold. CEO Elon Musk expressed concern over macroeconomic instability and policy unpredictability, saying 'If the ship of America goes down, Tesla will go with it.' The company has not issued a formal statement about the production halt, and it remains to be seen whether Tesla's strategy adjustments will be enough to revive consumer interest and stabilize output.

**Humanoid Robot Industry Trends: 2025 Expected to be a Year of Mass Production**
The humanoid robot industry is expected to accelerate in 2025, with Tesla's production plan aiming to produce 10,000 Optimus robots per month by 2025, 10,000 per month by 2026, and 100,000 per month by 2027. As the industry enters the mass production era, we believe that with the accumulation of data, iteration of large models, and decrease in hardware costs, humanoid robots will be expected to enter the industrial and home scenarios on a large scale. On the hardware level, we recommend paying attention to the following dimensions: 1) the adoption of rotational and linear actuators in parallel by main manufacturers such as Tesla, which is expected to increase the penetration rate of domestic manufacturers; 2) the use of planetary gearboxes as the core components of linear actuators, which are expected to bring about incremental application scenarios; 3) the use of flexible hands as the best choice for end-effectors, which requires high precision, load capacity, and flexibility, and is expected to bring about changes in freedom and transmission methods. According to Tesla's Optimus-Gen3, the freedom is expected to increase to 22, approaching the 24 freedoms of the human hand. The transmission method is expected to adopt a three-stage transmission scheme consisting of planetary gearboxes, miniature gearboxes, and tendon-based transmission. We recommend paying attention to module manufacturers such as Zhiwei Electrical, Jiechang Drive, and core component suppliers such as Ningzhi Electrical (hollow cup motors) and Zhejiang Rongtai (miniature gearboxes). 3) The shortage of production capacity and the urgent need for cost reduction also make harmonic reducers and six-axis force sensors worth paying attention to. We recommend paying attention to Green Harmonic, Zhongdadi, Henggong Precision, Donghua Testing, and Kelie Sensors.

**Tesla's Cybertruck Hits Historic Low of Over 10,000 Unsold Vehicles**
Tesla's Cybertruck has reached a historic low of over 10,000 unsold vehicles, with a total value of around $760 million. This is despite Elon Musk's claims of 'unprecedented demand' for the vehicle, with over a million reservations made. However, analysts predict that production of the Cybertruck may be halted in the coming months due to poor sales. In 2023, Musk said that the Cybertruck had 'unbelievable demand' and that 'over a million people had reserved the vehicle.' However, the actual sales figures for 2023 were only 38,965 units, with many of these vehicles being from the previous year's production. The current sales projections for the Cybertruck are around 20,000 units per year, a far cry from the initial projections of 500,000 units per year. The situation is being compared to the Edsel, a failed Ford brand from the 1950s, which was also plagued by poor sales. Tesla's financial struggles are also being attributed to Elon Musk's involvement in politics, including his support for Donald Trump's campaign and his efforts to change the US administration, which have led to a backlash against the company. The company's sales have also been affected by the growing market for electric vehicles in the EU, with sales in Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, and France all experiencing significant declines.

**Tesla Reports Economic Model Production to Start in 2025, Cybercab Mass Production in 2026**
Tesla has released its 2025 first quarter financial report, revealing several key business developments. The company reaffirmed its plans for new vehicle models, including an economic model, which is expected to start production in the first half of 2025. According to the report, the new model will combine next-generation platform technology with existing platform advantages and share production lines with existing models. This strategy, although resulting in a lower cost reduction than expected, is expected to improve capital efficiency and allow for flexible expansion of production capacity in a market with increasing uncertainty. Tesla predicts that its production capacity, which has the potential to produce nearly 3 million vehicles per year at its existing factories, will increase by over 60% compared to 2024 before investing in new production lines. In the autonomous driving field, Tesla revealed that its Cybercab product, designed for Robotaxi, will continue to use the 'unboxed' manufacturing strategy and is expected to enter mass production in 2026. This innovative process aims to simplify production processes, reduce operating costs, and improve scalability. Analysts believe that Tesla is trying to solidify its cost advantage in the electric vehicle market through technology reuse and production process optimization, while accelerating the commercialization of autonomous driving technology. As new vehicle models and Robotaxis are gradually rolled out, Tesla's production expansion and technology innovation strategy may enter a new stage.

**Tesla to Start Production of New, More Affordable Models in Summer 2025**
Tesla plans to start production of new, more affordable models in the summer of 2025. The company has seen a decline in sales, with 1.79 million vehicles sold in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 1.81 million in the same period the previous year. To reverse this trend, Tesla aims to accelerate the creation and commercialization of more affordable models, with a goal of producing over 3 million vehicles per year. The new models will take inspiration from the Model 3 and Model Y, and will be based on Tesla's new platform. They will likely be variants of the Model 3 and Model Y, but at a lower price point. Tesla has recently increased its prices, which suggests that the new models will be stripped-down versions of the popular 3/Y duo. The company must respond to the growing competition in the electric vehicle market with more affordable options. As production of the new models is set to begin in the summer of 2025, we can expect to learn more about them soon.
