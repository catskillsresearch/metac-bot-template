**Starmer Attacks Farage: 'He Will Shatter the UK's Economy'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticized his political rival Nigel Farage on Thursday, saying that the far-right politician's reckless spending would 'shatter the UK's economy'. Starmer delivered a speech at a glass factory in northwest England, targeting Farage, who is a close ally of former US President Donald Trump and whose party, the Brexit Party, won only 5 seats out of 650 in the House of Commons. Farage said, 'Today is Independence Day for Britain - a day to celebrate the historic vote to leave the EU'. Starmer accused the Conservative Party of 'stumbling' and warned that voters may be faced with a choice between the Labour Party and the Reform UK Party in the next general election, scheduled for 2029. He also dubbed Farage's economic plans as 'Theresa May 2', referencing the former Conservative Prime Minister who shook the financial markets and led to a sharp increase in borrowing costs.

**World News | UK PM Starmer Takes Aim at Nigel Farage as Trump Ally Becomes Growing Rival | LatestLY**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken aim at Nigel Farage, a hard-right politician and ally of President Donald Trump, saying Farage's economic plans would 'trash the UK economy through reckless spending.' Starmer branded Farage's plans 'Liz Truss 2.0,' referencing the former Conservative prime minister who implemented tax cuts without funding, causing financial market turmoil. Farage's Reform UK party has surged in opinion polls, winning several local elections and targeting working-class voters who once backed Labour. Starmer's popularity has plunged as his government struggles to kick-start a sluggish economy, and he has pushed back on Farage's image as a man-of-the-people, stressing his own working-class credentials. 'It's Liz Truss all over again,' Starmer said. 'The same bet in the same casino... Using your family finances, your mortgages, the bills, as the gambling chip on his mad experiment.'

**UK PM Starmer warns Farage's 'fantasy' fiscal plans would crash the economy**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that Nigel Farage's fiscal plans would crash the economy if Reform UK ever won power. Starmer described Farage's tax and spending plans as a 'fantasy', similar to those of former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss, who resigned in 2022 after her 'mini budget' of unfunded tax cuts sent markets into a tailspin. Starmer said, 'Now in government, we are once again fighting the same fantasy - this time from Farage. The same bet in the same casino: that you can spend tens of billions of pounds in tax cuts, without a proper way of paying for it.' Farage has pitched a right-wing agenda of lowering immigration and cutting taxes, while also courting workers who may have become disaffected with Labour over Starmer's efforts to cut public spending.

**Do you think Nigel Farage could be Prime Minister? Take our poll and have your say - The Mirror**
Keir Starmer has launched a scathing attack on Nigel Farage, calling him 'Liz Truss 2.0' and accusing him of planning a 'mad experiment' that will hammer family finances. The Prime Minister compared Reform UK's uncosted pledges to Liz Truss's tax-slashing mini-Budget, which sent mortgage rates rocketing. Farage hit back, accusing Starmer of 'Project Fear 2.0', but economists have said Reform's plans would blow a hole in the public finances. A YouGov poll revealed that Farage is voters' last choice to be Prime Minister, with 44% of the public backing Starmer compared to 29% choosing Farage. Farage said the UK does not have a 'presidential election' and he needs a 'team of people that look competent and capable of going into government'. Starmer said Farage's economic plans are 'precisely the sort of irresponsible splurge that sent your mortgage costs, your bills and the cost of living through the roof. It's Liz Truss all over again.'

Celebrities have signed an open letter to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, urging him to 'end the UK's complicity' in the Gaza conflict.

The letter highlights the dire situation in Gaza, where 71,000 children under four are 'acutely malnourished' and are 'crying until they can't cry anymore'. The letter states, 'You can't call it 'intolerable', yet do nothing,' directly addressing Starmer. The letter concludes, 'The world is watching and history will not forget. The children of Gaza cannot wait another minute. Prime minister, what will you choose? Complicity in war crimes, or the courage to act?'

**Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer visits Glass Futures in St Helens**
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer visited the Glass Futures facility in St Helens, where he met with workers and learned about their skills and the facility's history. The £54m research and technology center, which was opened in 2023, aims to decarbonize the global glass industry by developing carbon-neutral glass. Starmer praised the workers, saying, 'I think it's fantastic and I can see how proud you are of what you do, each of you contributing with your different skills to what is happening here.' He also noted the facility's history, saying, 'If I've understood what you've told me glass has been made on this very site for the best part of 250 years.' The visit was seen as an opportunity for Starmer to connect with the workforce and understand their skills firsthand, rather than just reading about it in a briefing.

**British, Japanese PMs voice opposition to trade war as both facing U.S. tariffs**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed opposition to a trade war, stating that it does not benefit anyone. This comes as the United States maintains a 10 percent tariff on most countries and a 25 percent tariff on steel, aluminium, and car parts. Starmer acknowledged that it is unlikely the US will remove the 10 percent tariff on British imports, but is trying to persuade the US president to lift the 25 percent tariff on British cars. British economists warn that uncertainty, weaker exports, and rising costs may weigh on growth and employment in key sectors. Japan has announced plans to send Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa to the US for tariff negotiations as early as next week.

**Deft handling of Trump and Zelensky helps Starmer overcome rocky start**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has managed to turn his image around after a rocky start by effectively handling President Donald Trump and coaching Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Starmer's approval ratings have improved significantly, with 27% of the public satisfied with his performance in December rising to a third of voters approving of his performance after his first White House meeting with Trump. 'This is clearly an opportunity for Starmer to reset his premiership after the fastest collapse of support that we've seen,' said Mujtaba Rahman, a managing director at the Eurasia Group. Starmer has also been credited with brokering a tense rapprochement between Trump and Zelensky and has pressed Trump to commit to security guarantees to deter further Russian aggression in Ukraine. He is now turning back to his economic agenda, a tough-medicine program to cut welfare spending, boost defense and jolt Britain's anemic growth rate.

**Ishiba cabinet approval in Japan hits record low, Asahi reports**
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's approval rating has dropped to a record low of 26% after he handed out gift vouchers worth 100,000 yen (US$673) each to 15 first-term lower house lawmakers of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). According to a poll conducted by the Asahi newspaper, the approval rating slid 14 percentage points from the previous survey. Ishiba said he used 'pocket money' to hand out gift certificates as a 'show of appreciation' for their hard work getting elected, but apologized for causing 'distrust and anger among many people.' The lawmakers returned the gift vouchers to Ishiba's office. The slide in opinion polls could be a blow to Ishiba's leadership ahead of an upper house election slated for July, amidst Japan's economic challenges.

**Keir Starmer's dire personal rating boosted by Ukraine leadership**
Sir Keir Starmer has seen a rare poll boost as voters approve of his handling of the Ukraine crisis. According to YouGov, the Prime Minister is now more popular than Reform's Nigel Farage for the first time since September. Meanwhile, Reform UK voters are turning against Donald Trump, with a 25-point increase in negative views of the president since mid-February. By contrast, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has increased in popularity, with 71% of Britons now having a favourable view of the Ukrainian leader. Nigel Farage's numbers have worsened, with a quarter of Britons (26%) now having a positive view of him, down from 30% in mid-February. Farage's latest net favourability score of -39 is 11 points lower than Starmer's. A Reform UK spokesman said, 'We are a grassroots political party funded by the mass membership and not reliant on any single large donor.' However, the party has struggled to attract donations since winning five seats in the election last July, with £281,000 made in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to £350,000 personally topped up by Farage from outside work in the same period.

**UK's Starmer juggles trouble at home as he walks geopolitical tightrope with Trump**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a challenging geopolitical situation ahead of his meeting with President Donald Trump, as he tries to balance support for Ukraine with maintaining relations with the US. However, Starmer's approval ratings at home are also in decline due to controversies such as axing a winter fuel repayment program and policy reversals on political donations. According to Colin Brazier, Starmer's approval ratings have 'fallen faster than almost any previous incumbent' due to new taxes and a sense of 'undeveloping' Britain. Despite this, Alan Mendoza, Executive Director of the Henry Jackson Society, believes that the meeting could be an opportunity for Starmer to gain points at home while soothing diplomatic ties. Mendoza pointed to the successful meeting between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron as an indicator of how Starmer's discussions could go. The meeting is expected to address topics such as U.S.-U.K. defense alliances, support for Ukraine, and shared economic and trade-based partnerships.

**Starmer Becomes Second Least Popular British Government Leader in 46 Years**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has become the second least popular British government leader in 46 years, according to a YouGov poll. The poll results show that Starmer has the lowest approval rating compared to all his predecessors, except Liz Truss. He lags behind Tony Blair (45% approval rating), who served from 1997 to 2007, by 35 percentage points. Starmer also trails behind Margaret Thatcher (25% approval rating), John Major (16% approval rating), and David Cameron (24% approval rating), who all had lower approval ratings than him. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said no one, as the article does not contain any quotes from Starmer or other officials.
