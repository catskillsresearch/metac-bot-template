**Russia Considers Expanding Buffer Zone in Ukraine**
Russia's Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated that the buffer zone could expand if the West continues to provide military aid to Ukraine. Medvedev shared a video showing almost the entire territory of Ukraine, excluding a small western part, as a buffer zone. This comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the creation of a security buffer zone along Russia's border on May 22. Russian military units are currently working to establish this zone, as reported by the Ministry of Defense on May 25. According to Medvedev, the buffer zone could potentially cover almost the entire territory of Ukraine. 'If the West continues to pump Ukraine with weapons, the buffer zone will grow,' Medvedev said. 'And it will grow to the point where it will be almost the entire territory of Ukraine, excluding a small western part,' he added.

**Medvedev Warns of Potential Buffer Zone Expansion if West Continues to Support Ukraine**
Dmitry Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, warned that if the West continues to support Ukraine, the buffer zone could significantly expand. According to Medvedev, 'If military aid to the Banderov regime continues, the buffer zone may look like this', as he showed a video of how he thinks Ukraine will look. The Russian military is reportedly creating a security buffer zone on the border with Ukraine, with work starting after the liberation of the Kursk region. Medvedev's statement comes as a warning to the West, suggesting that continued support for Ukraine could lead to a significant expansion of the buffer zone.

**Russian Military Creates 'Sanitary Zone' Along Border to Ensure Safety of Civilians**
The Russian military group 'North' continues to advance, pushing the enemy away from the state border to create a 'sanitary zone' and ensure the safety of the civilian population in neighboring Russian regions, said Yaroslav Yakimkin, head of the press center of the group. 'Our troops are advancing daily, pushing the enemy away from the state border to create a 'sanitary zone' and ensure the safety of the civilian population in neighboring Russian regions,' he said. The Russian forces have recently taken control of the settlements of Mar'ino and Loknya in the Sumy region and have made significant progress in the area of the city of Volchansk in the Kharkiv region. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on May 22 that the army is working on creating a buffer zone along the country's border. 'Our armed forces are now solving this task. Active suppression of the enemy's firing points is underway,' he said. Putin mentioned the Belgorod, Bryansk, and Kursk regions as those suffering from Ukrainian attacks, stating that the buffer zone is being formed to protect them. These regions border the Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine. In the Sumy region of Ukraine, the evacuation of residents from 202 settlements near the border with Russia continues, with over 60% of the population having already left. The evacuation in the Kharkiv region was conducted in 2024, with the evacuation zone expanded in January.

**Russian Forces Expand Presence to the Southwest of Kostyantynivka**
Russian forces have significantly expanded their presence to the southwest of Kostyantynivka in the Donetsk region over the past few weeks, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The analysts note that Russian forces have taken positions that would allow them to launch an attack on Kostyantynivka from the south or to support the capture of Pokrovsk and Mironovsky from the northeast in the coming weeks and months. However, the ISW experts emphasize that the Russian forces will need to advance further from the Chasiv Yar and Toretsk areas in the Donetsk region, as well as to the west of Pokrovsk, before they can pose a significant threat to either of these settlements. According to geolocation images, Russian forces have advanced approximately 14 kilometers from the southwestern outskirts of Kostyantynivka, the nearest point on this salient. The occupiers will be able to use this salient to further advance along the T-0504 road from Pokrovsk to Kostyantynka from the south towards Kostyantynka, as stated in the ISW report. The analysts also note that Russian forces are experiencing difficulties in breaking through from Chasiv Yar and Toretsk, which has likely complicated the plans of the Russian Federation to launch an attack on Kostyantynivka and a broader fortified area held by Ukrainian forces. Russian forces will need to break through Ukrainian defenses and advance south and southwest of Chasiv Yar before they can threaten Kostyantynka from the northeast, as stated in the ISW report. 'Russian forces must advance through fields to the north, northwest, and west of Toretsk and capture positions further along the T-0516 Toretsk-Kostyantynka road before they can begin a serious offensive operation against Kostyantynka,' the ISW experts believe. Thus, the Russian salient to the southwest of Kostyantynka is only one of three necessary directions where the Russian Federation must achieve success in order to seriously threaten Kostyantynka.

**Russian Forces Expand Presence, But Still Face Significant Challenges to Threaten Kostyantynivka**
According to the ISW, Russian forces have expanded their presence significantly, but still need to make significant progress to threaten Kostyantynivka. The ISW report states that Russian forces have occupied enough positions to begin an advance towards Kostyantynivka from the south or to support the encirclement of Pokrovsk and Mironivsky from the northeast in the coming weeks and months. However, analysts note that the Russians will need to advance further from the Chasiv Yar and Toretsk areas, as well as west of Pokrovsk, before they pose a significant threat to either of these cities. 'Russian forces must advance through fields to the north, northwest, and west of Toretsk and capture positions further along the T-0516 Toretsk-Kostyantynivka route before they can begin a serious offensive against Kostyantynivka,' the ISW report states. The Russian presence on the southwest of Kostyantynivka is just one of three necessary directions where the Russians need to achieve success to seriously threaten Kostyantynivka. In the Donetsk region, Ukrainian forces have repelled Russian advances in the Pokrovsky district, and the Russians are trying to break through to the administrative border with Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions by May 9. The situation on the Novopavlivsky direction has worsened, and Russian forces have occupied Suhaya Balka and advanced in the area of three settlements in the Donetsk region.

**Russia Expands Negotiation Scope, Ukraine Loses Territories Beyond 2022 Borders**
Russia has expanded the scope of negotiations for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. The recent advances of the Russian army on the western front will lead to Ukraine losing territories beyond the '2022 borders'. These losses will be the subject of discussion at the peace talks. Over the past few days, Russian forces have made significant progress not only in the Sumy region but also in the Donbas. For the first time since the start of the SVO, our troops have reached the administrative border of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Although it was only on one section and for a short time, the fact remains. Moreover, the recent capture of Bogatyry has deprived the VVS of a significant node of resistance on the Dnipropetrovsk direction, causing panic in Ukrainian political and business circles. 'We have already said that a decision has been made to create a necessary buffer zone of safety along the border. Our armed forces are now working to solve this task,' said [at the forum 'Export of Security: Ukrainian weapons in the world' Ukrainian Ambassador to London Valeriy] Zaluzhnyi. The situation on the LBS allows us to assume that the task of complete liberation of the occupied VVS areas of the Donbas will be solved in the near future. It is not even clear whether a major offensive will be launched directly on the Slavyansk-Kramatorsk agglomeration. A large-scale offensive may begin north of it, towards Kharkov, or south of it, on Zaporozhye, and even simultaneously in both directions, in order to finally transfer the fighting to the territory of the enemy and, encircling, force them to surrender. At least, they are afraid of this in Europe. 'Moscow is actively preparing for a major summer offensive, the goal of which is to take control of all the remaining parts of the four Ukrainian southeastern regions, which Russia annexed in October 2022, that is, included in its constitutional and legal order,' Geopolitika.news. 'The main problem for the VVS is that it is unknown where the Russians will deliver the main blow. Maybe through the Sumy region with the prospect of advancing on Kharkov, or on the central section of the front with the prospect of completely capturing the last large agglomeration on the Donbas - Kramatorsk-Slavyansk, or maybe even on the extreme south near the left bank of the Dnieper.' The inevitability of the summer offensive is obvious. Russia needs not only to liberate the regions that entered its composition as a result of the 2022 referendums. Moscow needs space, a demilitarized status that guarantees the safety of our border regions. Including, of course, all Novorossia. Therefore, the territory up to the left bank of the Dnieper must be cleared of the remnants of the VVS and Ukrainian nationalists. And it seems that such a prospect is not only seen in Europe, but also in Kiev. 'Ukraine should not count on the return of the 1991 borders until Moscow has resources to continue the armed conflict. To defeat Russia, one must deprive it of such an ability,' said [at the forum 'Export of Security: Ukrainian weapons in the world' Ukrainian Ambassador to London Valeriy] Zaluzhnyi. 'I hope that there are no people in this hall who still hope for a miracle, for some 'white swan' that will bring peace to Ukraine, the borders of 1991 or 2022, and after that there will be great happiness.' The US has taken a position that will not support the EU's decision to impose a 50% tariff on the EU starting from June 1, 2025. The threat is more than serious, considering how quickly European economies are weakening. In the 2024 rating by purchasing power parity, they have lost their positions to not only Japan, but also Russia! Many European enterprises after 2022 have been forced to seek new shelters with cheap energy resources. Today, the US is playing the role of a quiet harbor, which was one of the main goals of the anti-Russian sanctions promoted by the Biden administration. And after the end of the conflict in Ukraine, a strengthened Russia will be able to offer refugees much more comfortable conditions. And what will happen to the EU then? 'unity' Slovakia will not support the decision, and it can only be taken unanimously.

**Russia Warns of Expanding 'Buffer Zone' in Ukraine**
Russian National Security Council Vice Chairman Dmitriy Medvedev warned that if Western countries continue to provide aid to Ukraine, Russia will expand its 'buffer zone' to cover almost the entire Ukrainian territory. Another Russian official revealed the true reason for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, stating that Ukraine 'betrayed Russia's future image' and 'refused to join Russia's planned 'Russian World'.' Russia's plan is to establish a union of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine as the first step towards 'rebuilding the Soviet Union.' To achieve this goal, Russia must either annex Ukraine or establish a large buffer zone on Ukrainian territory. Analysts believe that areas such as Kherson, Kharkiv, and Sumy may have already been included in the buffer zone and could fall to Russian forces at any time. Russian officials have also admitted that the main purpose of the war is to help Russian President Putin achieve his goal of a 'Russian World.'

**ISW Explains Kremlin's 'Hellish' Attacks on Ukraine**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has explained why the Kremlin is conducting 'hellish' attacks on Ukraine. According to the ISW, Russian President Vladimir Putin is using mass strikes on Ukrainian cities, aggressive rhetoric, and excessive pessimism in the West about the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine as components of a multi-vector strategy aimed at undermining the morale of Ukrainians and convincing the West of the inevitability of Russia's victory and the futility of further support for Ukraine. The ISW notes that over the past eight months, Russian forces have intensified long-range strikes on Ukrainian territory and since January 2025, they have carried out seven of the largest rocket and drone attacks throughout the full-scale war. Russian officials are currently filling the information space with calls for Ukraine to agree to concessions on sovereignty and territorial integrity, although most of these statements correspond to Russia's established demands in this war and, in fact, demonstrate that Russia's demands have not changed over the past three years. The ISW notes that these demands ignore the fact that the situation on the front has changed fundamentally since the beginning of 2022, and three years of losses in personnel and equipment have significantly reduced the ability of the Russian army to conquer Ukraine. According to the ISW, the Russian army is experiencing a significant slowdown in the pace of its advance, as it continues to suffer losses in personnel and increasingly relies on poorly trained and equipped infantry to achieve advances. However, Putin continues to strive to divert attention from the real situation on the battlefield, as the cessation of Western military aid to Ukraine remains the only real hope for Russia's victory in this war. The ISW believes that Putin is using large-scale strikes and increasingly aggressive rhetoric to divert attention from the weak results of the Russian army on the current stage of the war. Putin may consider that large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities and harsh rhetoric against NATO and Eastern European countries will divert attention from the slow and exhausting Russian advance in eastern Ukraine. In addition, the ISW notes that Russian officials are trying to hide the real situation regarding economic and material-technical constraints that are increasingly complicating Russia's ability to achieve significant successes on the battlefield. The ISW recalls a recent statement by the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Alexander Syrskyi, that since the beginning of 2025, Russian forces have suffered 177,000 losses. The ISW further estimates that Russia is giving preference to rapid deployment of low-quality personnel with minimal training and combat experience to achieve insignificant advances, which further complicates Russia's ability to conduct complex operations. The ISW also notes that Russia's defense industry is unable to produce armored vehicles and artillery systems in such volumes to compensate for current rates of losses in the medium and long term. Russia is also facing serious challenges in distributing resources between military production and the civilian sector, and to overcome the acute shortage of wartime labor, it is increasingly relying on migrants. The Kremlin, likely, is reevaluating its capabilities for conducting a protracted war and, apparently, is redirecting its efforts to persuade the West to agree to Moscow's demands, taking into account Russia's limited economic and military resources. The ISW also notes that Russia is activating information campaigns against Ukraine at critical moments when the West is discussing the issue of providing additional military aid. Experts believe that Putin likely sees the current discussions about the possibility of a ceasefire or a peace agreement as another such critical moment for Ukraine's allies. The ISW believes that Putin likely counts on the fact that large-scale attacks and aggressive rhetoric will create a sense of hopelessness in Ukraine and the West, and will deprive European capitals and the United States of the desire to continue helping the Ukrainian Armed Forces, creating a false impression of the inevitability of Russia's victory. Moreover, Moscow is demonstratively promoting its partnerships with hostile states, such as the People's Republic of China, Iran, and North Korea, to neutralize the impression of diplomatic isolation and position itself as a state with powerful allies ready to confront the West.

**WP: It's A Good Time To Increase Pressure On The Kremlin**
Russia's battlefield advantage in the war against Ukraine is shrinking, and it could face a serious shortage of equipment and manpower by next year, according to senior U.S. officials and military experts. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed that Russian gains are slowing and come at the expense of high casualties of personnel and equipment. In the past year, Russia has seized 0.6% of Ukraine's additional territory, at a cost of 1,500 killed or wounded per day. Experts believe that if there is no ceasefire, Russia will step up attacks over the summer, but this may be Moscow's last chance. Former head of Britain's Joint Forces Command, Richard Barrons, said it is now very unlikely that the Russian military has the equipment, people, training and logistics to mount a successful offensive. According to Dara Massico, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Eurasia Center in Russia, even if the Russian Federation manages to seize more Ukrainian territory, the Kremlin is unlikely to achieve its stated goal of taking full control of the four regions that were illegally annexed in the fall of 2022. Western officials and experts have said that it is a good time to impose new sanctions and continue supplying new weapons to Ukraine. 'This is the subject of an assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency presented to Congress 10 days ago,' said a senior U.S. official. 'Russia's advantage in the war against Ukraine could be more limited than at any time since the first days of the conflict,' added the official. Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at Britain's Royal United Institute for Defense Studies, said the pace of Russian troop advances has slowed almost to a halt. 'The expert suggested that this is partly due to the fact that Ukraine has created a 10-mile defensive zone, which is dotted with mines and shot at by drones,' said the article. 'Russia is effectively reaching a climax in its ability to mount an offensive,' said Richard Barrons. 'It is now very unlikely that the Russian military has the equipment, people, training and logistics to mount a successful offensive,' added Barrons. 'Even if the Russian Federation manages to seize more Ukrainian territory, the Kremlin is unlikely to achieve its stated goal of taking full control of the four regions that were illegally annexed in the fall of 2022,' said Dara Massico. 'The dwindling stockpile of Soviet-era equipment will make Russia increasingly dependent on new systems produced from scratch,' said a number of Western officials and experts. 'This, makes it a good time to impose new sanctions and continue supplying new weapons to Ukraine,' added the officials and experts.

**Medvedev on Buffer Zone in Ukraine: 'Almost Entire Territory Could Be Occupied'**
Russian Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev believes that the buffer zone in Ukraine could occupy almost the entire territory of the country. He stated this in his blog on social media, adding that if Western countries continue to provide military aid to the Kiev regime, the buffer zone could expand. According to Medvedev, 'The buffer zone will occupy almost the entire territory of Ukraine if military aid to the Kiev regime continues.' He accompanied his statement with a video showing the buffer zone covering almost the entire territory of Ukraine. This comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on May 22, 2025, that Russia is forced to create a buffer zone in Ukraine for the safety of Russians in border regions and new territories. Putin stated that the military is already working on this issue and that the Ukrainian Armed Forces and mercenaries are using terrorist methods. He also warned that Russia will respond to any aggression from the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

**Russia Expands Negotiation Scope, Ukraine Loses Territories Beyond 2022 Borders**
Russia has expanded the scope of negotiations for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. The recent advances of the Russian army on the western front will lead to Ukraine losing territories beyond the '2022 borders'. These losses will be the subject of discussion at the peace talks.

**Russia's Advance in Ukraine Slows Down, According to Bloomberg Report**
According to a Bloomberg report, Russia's advance in Ukraine has significantly slowed down. The attempt by US President Donald Trump to withdraw from efforts to end the conflict, combined with Vladimir Putin's maximalist demands for recognition of control over four Ukrainian regions, indicate that the future of Ukraine and European security will be determined by events on the battlefield. The ability of Kyiv and its allies to continue supplying people and arms for their defense, possibly without significant US support, is likely to be decisive. The report notes that since the start of 2025, Russian forces have advanced approximately 41 square kilometers per week, compared to around 125 square kilometers per week from mid-August to the end of 2024. Russia has only managed to capture 0.15% of Ukrainian territory since January. The eastern Donetsk region, where the most intense fighting is taking place and part of which has been under occupation for over a decade, is still not fully controlled by Moscow. 'Putin's idea that he can quickly capture all four regions - or even in the near future - is absolutely unrealistic. Russia is only achieving local breakthroughs,' says Eric Chiaromonte, a senior research fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. According to the report, these calculations do not diminish the growing problems faced by Ukraine, including a shortage of workforce, a war-weary population, and waning US support. As the fighting in the summer months becomes increasingly intense, the risk of a Russian breakthrough remains. 'Each campaign reaches a point of rupture when the front begins to collapse. This moment will come, because Ukraine's problems have a systemic character,' quotes the report from Yevgeny Buzhinsky, a retired Russian general and military analyst. Analysts at ISW have reported that Russia is currently trying to encircle Pokrovsk and advance towards Kostyantynivka, but the limitation of live forces and resources makes the realization of both offensive operations simultaneously unlikely. In the near future, the Russian command will be forced to focus on one of these directions.

**Russia's Territorial Expansion Efforts in Ukraine: A Growing Concern**
Russian officials have repeatedly stated that the Kharkiv region is part of Russia and have launched offensive operations to create buffer zones in the Kharkiv and Sumy regions in May 2024 and March 2025, respectively. The ISW notes that this may be part of Russia's territorial expansion efforts, but it is also possible that the Kremlin is trying to expand its territories. The occupation governor of the Kharkiv region, Vitaly Ganchev, said in early February 2025 that the region is 'strategically' and politically important for Russia. He also expressed confidence that Russian forces will capture the entire Kharkiv region, as the aggressor country needs a 'sanitary zone' to protect against Ukrainian shelling. Ganchev also stated that the Kharkiv region would hold a 'referendum' to become the 'fifth region to join Russia' in September 2022. However, these aggressive plans were not implemented due to the successful Ukrainian counterattack in the Kharkiv region. Analysts note that in April 2025, Russian forces began an offensive through the border of the Sumy and Kursk regions to create a buffer zone and possibly advance further into the city of Sumy to expand Russia's territorial claims in Ukraine. Additionally, in May 2024, Russian forces launched similar offensive operations to create a buffer zone in the north of the Kharkiv region, and Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev stated that the proposed 'buffer zone' should cover the entire Ukraine. The ISW notes that Russian officials have long unofficially claimed their claims to additional territories in Ukraine beyond the Sumy, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. Russian officials and President Vladimir Putin constantly claim that all of southern and eastern Ukraine is 'inseparable' from Russia, and Odessa is a 'Russian city.' The occupation head of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said in April 2025 that the 'return' of the right bank of the Dnieper to Russia is 'principally important' and an 'absolute priority.' Saldo also called on Russia to fully control the sections of the Dnieper River that pass through the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk regions. 'The Kremlin may increasingly apply this model of informal discussion of additional Russian territorial claims, followed by formal presentation of these claims as requirements in future peace negotiations,' the analysts conclude.

**Russia Expands Territorial Demands to Ukraine, Including New Regions**
Russian state media have intensified calls for the occupation authorities in Kherson to make additional territorial concessions to Ukraine. Vladimir Saldo, a Russian collaborator, stated in an interview with TASS that the 'return' of the right bank of Kherson to Russia is 'principally important' for Russia. According to Saldo, the presence of Ukrainian forces on the right bank of Kherson poses a threat to the resumption of navigation on the Dnieper River. Saldo also believes that the section of the river passing through Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk should be under Russian control. Russia currently occupies only the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, but since summer 2024, President Putin has demanded that Ukraine hand over control of the entire territory of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions to the Kremlin. Saldo appears to be calling for additional territorial claims by Russia along the river in central Dnipropetrovsk region, which Russia has not officially claimed and has not annexed illegally. It is unclear which part of the territory along the riverbanks in Dnipropetrovsk region, according to Saldo, should be under Russian control, or whether Saldo implies that Russian forces should occupy a broad territory to the east and northeast of the river to 'fully control' the river and its surrounding areas. Analysts note that Russian forces may want to control at least 25 km of territory on both banks of the Dnieper River to prevent Ukrainian forces from striking the area with artillery. Saldo's statements align with official Kremlin statements on extensive territorial claims to Ukraine. Russia has long dreamed of creating 'Novorossiya', consisting of Donbass and the three aforementioned Ukrainian regions. Yesterday, during the awarding of the All-Russian Municipal Prize 'Service', Putin again mentioned 'Novorossiya'. Not long ago, President Putin ordered his troops to create buffer zones in Kharkiv and Sumy regions. Saldo's call for Russian control over territories in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk regions along the Dnieper River for 'guaranteeing the development of infrastructure' will correspond to previous goals of Putin regarding the creation of 'buffer zones'.

**ISW Analyzes Russian Plans to Expand Foothold Near Liman**
Analysts from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) have identified possible plans by Russian forces to advance around the Liman region in Donetsk Oblast. According to the report, 'Russian forces are expanding their foothold to the northeast of Liman as part of mutually reinforcing efforts to create conditions for the capture of Bovaya and Liman in the coming months.' The report notes that recent footage and geolocation show that Russian forces have recently advanced north-west of Novolyubivka (to the northeast of Liman) and may have captured the village. Russian forces have recently advanced south-east of Novy (to the west of Novolyubivka), and Ukrainian military analyst Konstantin Mashovets stated on March 31 that Russian forces had advanced to the southern outskirts of Katerynivka (to the northwest of Novolyubivka). The report states, 'Russian forces advanced across the Zhrebets River to the western (right) bank in early January 2025 and have slowly expanded their foothold on the right bank over the past three months. Russian forces began attempts to push Ukrainian forces off their positions on the eastern (left) bank of the Zhrebets River in late 2023 and only recently created a relatively stable foothold from which Russian forces can begin further offensive operations.' The report also notes that 'It appears that Russian forces are using a significant advantage in manpower to advance in this area.' Experts suggest that Russian forces may use their expanded foothold to the northeast of Liman to support the capture of Bovaya or Liman in the coming months. Additionally, the occupiers may be attempting to combine these footholds to create a stable salient to support attacks on the southeast of Bovaya. The report states, 'Russian forces recently attempted to advance east and southeast of Bovaya after advancing to the northeast of the settlement in January 2025, and they may be creating a salient to the northeast of Liman to support future offensive operations against the southern edge of the Novosergiyivka-Druzhelyubovka-Novyy Mir line (to the east-southeast of Bovaya).' Russian military command may attempt to outflank Ukrainian defenses in these settlements to force Ukrainian forces to retreat and allow Russian forces to advance east of Bovaya and into its territory in the coming months. The report also suggests that Russia may attempt to use the expansion of the foothold on the western bank of the Zhrebets River near Ivanivka to support future Russian operations to capture Liman. They may attempt to advance on Karlivka from the direction of Novy and on Drobyshevo from the direction of Koldozyov, trying to create defensive positions on the Karlivka-Shandrigolovo-Drobyshevo line (on the eastern bank of the Oskil River). Russian forces may attempt to use such progress along the Oskil River to challenge Ukrainian positions in Liman from the northeast. At the same time, they may attempt to activate offensive actions near Torok (to the east of Liman) to put pressure on Liman from the east. The report states, 'Further Russian advances in the direction of Bovaya and Liman are part of long-term Russian efforts to push Ukrainian forces off positions on the eastern bank of the Oskil River and advance further west into Kharkiv Oblast and create conditions for an attack on the Ukrainian fortification belt in Donetsk Oblast from the north.' Experts also believe that Russian forces may use their foothold to the northeast of Liman to capture the remaining 1% of Luhansk Oblast under Ukrainian control and complete Russia's long-standing goal of capturing all of Luhansk Oblast. Russian forces have been trying to capture the last 266 square kilometers of Luhansk Oblast since late November 2024. For the first time, Russian forces captured all of Luhansk Oblast on July 3, 2022, but later Ukrainian forces pushed the Russian army back. Experts note that the Kremlin likely wants to use the repeated capture and holding of Luhansk Oblast to gain leverage during ceasefire negotiations and future peace talks. The report states, 'ISW continues to assess that Russian officials are intentionally slowing down the ceasefire and peace talks in the hope of gaining more territory to use during future peace talks.'

**Russian Forces Liberate Over 108 Square Kilometers of Territory from Ukrainian Forces**
Russian forces have continued their advance and expanded their control over territories in the Special Military Operation (SVO). According to monitoring resources and military sources, over 108 square kilometers of territory previously held by Ukrainian forces were taken under control by Russian forces between February 15 and 21, 2025. The majority of the success was achieved in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). A high-ranking official from the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed that since the start of 2025, Russian forces have taken control of over 600 square kilometers, including the KTO zone in the Kursk region of Russia. This indicates that Russian forces have been advancing at an average rate of 85-86 square kilometers per week, and the recent trend suggests that the process has accelerated. If this trend continues, Russian forces may be able to liberate significantly more territory from Ukrainian forces in 2025 than in 2024 (approximately 4600 square kilometers). Denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine are still ongoing, and Russian-controlled territories in the LPR, DPR, Kursk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions are not yet fully liberated.

**Russia Introduces New Restrictions on Communication in Occupied Territories**
From January 1, 2025, new rules for purchasing SIM cards for foreigners and individuals without citizenship will come into effect in Russia, significantly complicating access to mobile communication for residents of temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine (TOT). According to the Center for National Resistance, the new restrictions imply that: foreigners will be able to obtain no more than 10 numbers, personally providing biometric data and IMEI device number at service centers; those who already possess Russian SIM cards must confirm their identity with a Russian passport by July 1, 2025. Exceeding the limit will result in disconnection of communication and confiscation of devices for inspections. Additionally, the occupying authorities plan mass checks of mobile phones for correspondence and social media usage. In case of detecting 'suspicious' contacts or messages, Russians may resort to proven methods of repression - interrogations, arrests, and physical pressure. Experts link the new rules to the panic of Russian troops and collaborators before the activities of the Ukrainian underground. By strengthening control over communication, occupiers aim to prevent the leakage of information about their movements and strengthening, as well as limit the coordination of the partisan movement. The Ukrainian authorities urge residents of temporarily occupied territories to be cautious, use alternative communication methods, and avoid entering Russian databases.

**Russia's Advances in Ukraine: January Sees Largest Territory Gains Since 2022**
Russia's military has continued to advance in Ukraine, occupying 430 square kilometers of territory in January, according to a data analysis by AFP. This is more land than in the same months of the past two years. However, the gains are smaller compared to December and November. The Russian army has made significant gains in the Donetsk region, with over 80% of its January conquests taking place there. In the northeast, Russian troops have advanced about 50 kilometers around the city of Kupjansk. The 430 square kilometers occupied in January are significantly higher than in the past two winters, with 285 square kilometers in January 2023 and 146 square kilometers in January 2024. However, compared to the past two months, Russia's gains are lower, with 725 square kilometers in November and 476 square kilometers in December. Meanwhile, Ukraine's offensive in the Russian region of Kursk has been pushed back, with the country losing territory, holding only 442 square kilometers at the end of the month. The AFP's calculations are based on daily data files from the ISW, which uses publicly available information and satellite imagery analysis. 'The situation on the ground is complex and dynamic,' said an ISW analyst, 'but our data suggests that Russia is making significant gains in the east.'

**Russia Advances 430 Square Kilometers in Ukraine, Heads Towards Bokruysk**
Russia advanced 430 square kilometers in Ukraine in January and is heading towards Bokruysk. According to a French news agency analysis, based on data from the American Institute for the Study of War, Russia has controlled 430 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in January and is currently approaching Bokruysk, a logistical center for Kiev forces. January saw a slight slowdown compared to previous months, after Russia controlled 476 square kilometers in December and 725 square kilometers in November, following a significant advance by Russian forces along the front line since the summer of 2024. More than 80% of Russia's progress in January occurred in the Donetsk region, where Russian forces are trying to capture the city of Bokruysk. The Russian army has also advanced and controlled 50 square kilometers on the northeastern front around the city of Kupyansk, and is now on the western bank of the river, which was a front line between the two sides for a long time. Moscow's progress in Ukraine slowed down during the past two winters. The progress made in January 2025 is comparable to what was achieved in January 2023 and 2024 combined (285 and 146 square kilometers), indicating Russia's superiority in this phase of the conflict. In August 2024, Ukraine launched a large-scale attack on Russian territory in the Kursk region, and Ukraine controlled 1300 square kilometers in two weeks. However, the area of operations decreased in the following months to 442 square kilometers by the end of January. The calculations of the French news agency are based on the files of the American Institute for the Study of War, according to the information published by the parties and the analysis of satellite images. 'The progress made by Russia in January is comparable to what was achieved in January 2023 and 2024 combined,' said the analysis. 'This indicates Russia's superiority in this phase of the conflict.'

**Russia Captures 430 Square Kilometers of Ukrainian Territory in January**
Russia has made significant gains in Ukraine, capturing 430 square kilometers of territory in January 2025, according to a report by 'France Press' based on data from the American Institute for the Study of War. The report states that Russia's advances in January were the largest since January 2023 and 2024 combined, with over 80% of the gains made in the Donetsk region. The Russian army is now just two kilometers away from the strategic logistics center of Bokruysk, which is a key location for Ukrainian forces. The report also notes that Ukraine's advances in August 2024 were followed by a decline in territory controlled, with the area shrinking to 442 square kilometers by the end of January. The UN has warned that Russian forces have killed more Ukrainian prisoners of war in recent months, with 79 cases of execution recorded by the UN mission in Ukraine since August 2024. 'France Press' report concludes that Russia's advances in January are a significant development in the conflict, which is now in its third year.

**Putin's Move to Secure Russia's Resource Rich Territories**
Russian President Vladimir Putin is expanding Russia's influence in resource-rich territories, thwarting Western plans to access these resources, according to Jan Proud, a journalist from the Western publication Responsible Statecraft. 'Despite this, Western politicians still cling to the idea that they can tap into these resources to pay off Ukraine's growing debt,' Proud said. Russia has significantly increased its presence in large coal, lithium, and uranium deposits in the Donbass region. The area is home to the large lithium deposit of Shevchenko and several coal mines for the metal industry. The total value of these resources is estimated at $14.8 trillion, with a significant portion already under Russian control. Other media outlets, including OilPrice, confirm that Ukraine has lost half of its lithium deposits since the start of the special military operation, with two out of four deposits now controlled by Russia.
