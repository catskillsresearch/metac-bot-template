**The Dangers of Relying on AI for Medical Diagnosis**
A recent Canadian medical study has warned against relying on artificial intelligence tools, such as 'ChatGPT', for self-diagnosis of medical conditions. The study found that these tools can produce inaccurate and sometimes dangerous results in complex medical scenarios. The researchers tested the accuracy of 'ChatGPT-4' in analyzing and diagnosing various medical conditions based on user-provided symptoms. The results were alarming, as the AI performed well in simple cases but failed miserably in diagnosing life-threatening conditions such as aortic dissection, which can delay treatment and increase the risk of death. The study's authors noted that AI tools still lack the complete clinical context that doctors need to make accurate decisions, which undermines trust in their use as a substitute for human medical examination. The study found that people who use AI for diagnosis often do so out of anxiety or to avoid visiting a doctor, but this puts their health at risk without their knowledge. The researchers recommend educating users about the risks of using these tools outside the medical advisory framework. They also emphasize the need for clear regulatory guidelines for the medical use of AI technology, while continuing to develop more accurate algorithms in the future.

**Can AI Be Your Therapist? New Research Reveals Major Risks**
A recent research study found that large language models (LLMs) and commercially available therapy bots are not yet capable of serving as autonomous therapists due to their sycophantic behavior, lack of empathy, bias, and cultural understanding. The study tested multiple models and popular therapy bots with high-acuity mental health symptoms and scenarios, and the results were concerning. The researchers concluded that therapy is a human relationship built on trust, empathy, confidentiality, and clinical expertise, and that LLMs currently perform at best as 'low-quality' therapists. However, AI can still be helpful in supportive roles when paired with human supervision, providing validation, explanations, and availability. The goal should be to integrate AI in a thoughtful, ethical, and evidence-based manner that prioritizes patient safety and increases availability of effective treatment, as stated by Dr. Marlynn Wei, 'The effectiveness of therapy is not just in the language. It is in the human presence and accountability present in ethical and experienced clinical care.'

**Traditional Education Won't Survive AI**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming education, and educators must adapt to this new reality. Research by Kwok (2025) introduces the concept of 'Existential Redundancy,' where AI surpasses humans in tasks traditionally considered hallmarks of intelligence, such as memorization, calculation, and creative generation. This raises questions about the future of education and what skills will remain distinctly human. Experts like Kwok and Pablo-Martí et al. (2024) argue that education must shift from knowledge transmission to cultivating human capacities like wisdom, ethical judgment, and authentic human connection. The integration of AI in education presents both promise and peril, and educators must ensure that machines enhance human potential while safeguarding human rights and values. As the authors note, 'The greatest risk is not that machines will become too intelligent, but that humans will become too dependent on machine intelligence, forfeiting the very capacities that make us human.'

**AI can accurately predict recovery in coma and consciousness disorders | Technology**
A recent review of 21 studies on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in diagnosing and predicting disorders of consciousness found that AI-enabled tools can accurately predict recovery in coma and consciousness disorders. The studies, which involved 14,683 patients, used AI to analyze EEG, ECG, and neuroimaging data to differentiate between consciousness states and predict outcomes. Notably, EEG-based tools identified critical electrophysiological markers that correlate with recovery potential, and deep learning models outperformed traditional ML approaches in temporal EEG analysis and structural neuroimaging interpretation. The review also found that supervised learning methods dominate current AI applications in DoC diagnosis and prognosis, including support vector machines, random forests, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, unsupervised approaches like k-means clustering were applied to explore hidden patient subgroups and derive novel indices like the Consciousness Domain Index (CDI). AI can enhance clinical decision-making and patient outcomes by enabling personalized diagnosis and rehabilitation strategies through integrating multimodal patient data, including neuroimaging, autonomic signals, and behavioral assessments.

**When AI Feels Like a Friend  --  But It's Not Therapy**
A recent clinical trial at Dartmouth found that an AI therapy bot was almost as effective as human therapists in supporting people with depression, anxiety, or eating disorders. The bot, trained on evidence-based mental health practices, showed similar improvements to 16 hours of human therapy in just 8 weeks. However, the author notes that these bots are not therapists and should not be relied upon for complex emotions, trauma, or crisis situations. They also highlight the risk of AI 'therapy' apps lacking oversight and failing to meet medical standards. The author believes AI companions can offer support, but not replace trained mental health professionals. 'We must be careful not to blur that line,' said Nick Jacobson, the lead researcher. 'AI can be a kind companion when we need one, but it's not a substitute for real humans.'

**AI Bests Physician Recommendations for Acute Complaints in Virtual, Primary-Care Visits**
A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations for acute complaints during virtual primary-care visits generally align with those from physicians and could even surpass them. The research compared initial clinical recommendations made by the K Health Clinical AI platform to final physician decision-making at a virtual primary and urgent care clinic run by Cedars Sinai. The study included 461 real primary care visits and found that AI-guided medical intake questions occurred via a structured chat. When confidence was sufficient, AI presented diagnosis and management recommendations in the form of prescriptions, laboratory tests, and referrals. The researchers found that AI recommendations were rated as superior twice as often as they were rated inferior to those of physicians and received only about half as many 'potentially harmful' ratings as the physicians. Dr. 'As recommendations emerge for the use of powerful AI programs in medicine, great caution should be the watchword,' he wrote. 'In contrast to other diagnostic and therapeutic methods, AI programs are an impervious black box.' The researchers proposed that 'thoughtful integration of AI into clinical practice, combining its strengths with those of physicians, could improve the quality of care.'
