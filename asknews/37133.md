**AM Best Comments on Decommissioning of NOAA's Billion-Dollar Climate Disaster Database**
AM Best has commented that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) removal of the billion-dollar weather disaster database could hinder insurance companies' ability to track losses due to secondary perils. The database, which was created in 1980, will be archived but no longer updated beyond 2024. Sridhar Manyem, senior director at AM Best, stated, 'Having a common and agreed-upon data source would help insurers trend these losses in their modeling and use the data for pricing, reinsurance and risk management.' The removal of the database may also impact parametric triggers within catastrophe bonds, which depend on measurements by the NOAA. Manyem added, 'If more of these data sources were to disappear, private companies may have to step in to fill the void and it could take some years to build credibility and trust among market participants.' Insured catastrophe losses in 2024 were significant, with two major hurricanes and severe convective storms contributing to the losses.

**Pharmalittle: We're reading about FDA eyeing PDUFA changes, compounded weight loss drugs, and more**
Noom, an online weight loss company, is now offering compounded versions of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy at a lower cost. The move comes as the FDA clamps down on mass production of copies of the in-demand medicine. Noom's version of compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic, will be offered as part of a personalized program for patients, which it says will comply with changing FDA regulations. The FDA is also exploring the possibility of changing the fee structure of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, with Deputy Commissioner Grace Graham stating, 'It is worth exploring whether and how restructuring and simplifying the user fee program may help rebuild trust in the FDA in its decisions.' The FDA will hold two public meetings in July to discuss reauthorization of its use fee act programs for the fiscal year 2028-2032 period.

**Summer 2025 Forecast: Will the Heat Wave End?**
RTL.de's summer forecast for 2025 suggests a possible end to the dry weather, with a 50% chance of a change in the weather pattern by May. According to Christian Häckl, RTL's weather expert, 'the probability of the dry weather coming to an end is over 50%. A significant change in the weather is possible, and this would also reduce the likelihood of heat in June.' The 42-day forecast shows a decrease in summer temperatures, with the 25-degree mark barely reached. However, the forecast for July and August remains hot and dry, with temperatures potentially reaching over 40 degrees. Häckl notes that 'in the last 25 years, there have been repeated temperatures above 35 degrees or even 40 degrees in the summer, but they were usually regional and short-lived.' The American weather model (NOAA) also predicts a warm summer, but with more rainfall, particularly in the south and Alpine regions.

**Differentiating Between Cyberattacks and Space Weather: A Growing Concern**
Three weeks after a blackout in Europe, the cause remains uncertain - suspected of being a cyberattack or the influence of space weather. On April 28, part of Europe plunged into darkness due to an unexpected power outage in Spain, Portugal, and southern France. Millions of people were affected. Trains stopped running, passengers were stranded, and cell phone and internet signals fell. The DIBELS assessment consists of short tests that measure phonics, reading fluency and other literacy skills, depending on the age group. The fall 2023 DIBELS assessment results showed 49.9% of kindergarten students, 58.0% of first-graders, and 60.4% of second-grade students met or went above benchmark status. That's up from fall 2022, when results showed 47.0% of kindergarten students, 52.5% of first-graders and, 56.0% of second-graders met or went above benchmark literacy goals for their age group. According to James Spann, senior climate scientist at the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the communication between government agencies needs to improve. When different agencies come to different conclusions, the response is delayed, which can increase damage and put more people at risk. 'It is essential to know the systems affected well. Many satellites, especially commercial ones, are not well understood by climate scientists,' Spann said. 'This makes it difficult to predict how they will react to solar storms.' To avoid bigger problems, scientists and satellite operators need to work together. Cooperation between these professionals can improve alerts, allow for faster responses, and better protect essential services for society. 'We need more observations and better prediction models,' Spann warned. 'This would help avoid surprises and give more time to act safely.'

**Commentary: The unconscionable assault on climate research must stop**
The US government's attack on climate research is having devastating consequences. The Trump administration has made significant budget and staff cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), risking the loss of data and modeling capability needed to predict and plan for worsening climate events. NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, affecting farmers, businesses, and communities. Research at South Carolina colleges and universities is also at risk, as are programs that help safeguard our businesses and communities. The administration's suspension of US Agency for International Development climate financing will be disastrous for vulnerable populations around the globe. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey, almost 80 percent of Americans believe government investment in scientific research is worthwhile. However, the Trump administration has fired all contributors to the National Climate Assessment and ordered the National Science Foundation to stop funding all new and existing research. Congressional Republicans are violating their oath of office by allowing the executive branch to recklessly gut science agencies and programs. As the author states, 'Nothing will be gained, but much will be lost if this program is eliminated.'

**Senegal to Remove Foreign Military Bases by July 2025**
Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko announced on Monday evening that his country will no longer have foreign military bases by July 2025. 'Since we've been in power for a year, we've taken acts of sovereignty, and I take as proof the presence of foreign military bases. We said we can't accept foreign military bases in Senegal. And any country that had a foreign base in Senegal, we notified them to return all their troops,' Sonko said in an interview with the Burkinabé national television (RTB) after a 48-hour working visit to Ouagadougou. The Prime Minister stated that 'this operation is underway' and 'two days ago, a military base was liberated, and the process will be completed by July, and Senegal will no longer have foreign military bases on its soil.' Sonko emphasized that 'for me, this must be an ordinary act for a country to say we are sovereign, we have a national army, we have defense and security forces, we think we can manage our own security.' He added that 'we are open to partnerships with the world, but they must be just and balanced,' and that the African continent must take its destiny in its own hands in a sovereign manner. Regarding the fight against terrorism, Sonko stated that 'Africa is actually being attacked.' 'Where do the weapons used by these people come from? (...) There are people who give them these weapons. But by doing so, they are not only attacking Burkina Faso, they are attacking all of Africa. And that's a common response we need.' He called for mobilizing all populations, starting with the youth, and for the political elite to be up to the task to identify the fundamental issues of security and development.

**Scientists Monitor 2025 as a Crucial Test of Global Warming**
Scientists are closely monitoring 2025, not only for its temperature, but also as a crucial test of our understanding of the speed of global warming. Since the beginning of 2025, some previous records have been broken, with the global temperature in the first quarter of this year being the second-highest ever recorded, continuing an exceptional heat wave that began in July 2023. In February, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that the first month of 2025 was the warmest January on record, with a global temperature of 14.06°C, 0.65°C above the average for March 1991-2020. According to NASA, the European Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the Berkeley Earth organization, January 2025 was the warmest January on record, with a global temperature of 1.59°C above the 1880-1899 average, and 0.12°C above the previous record set in January 2024. Some scientists, such as Jeff Masters, a meteorologist specializing in hurricanes, who co-founded the commercial weather service 'Weather Underground', found the new record for January unexpected, as it surpassed the previous record set last year, when the natural climate variability led to the strong El Niño event, which caused a global temperature increase. Others, such as Nick Dunstone, head of the UK Met Office's climate monitoring division, say this is not surprising, as 2024 was the warmest year on record, and there are larger fluctuations in a single month compared to the entire year. According to the Carbon Brief, a platform specializing in climate science and policy, the first three months of 2025 may not represent the entire year, as historical temperature trends suggest that global temperatures tend to rise in winter months (December, January, and February) in the Northern Hemisphere. The organization also notes that the likelihood of 2025 being the warmest year on record is 34%, which is slightly lower than the 38% expected in late March. The remaining months of 2025 are expected to see a slight decrease in temperature compared to the first three months. If this happens, 2025 is likely to be less warm than the record set in 2024. Masters expects 2025 to see high heat waves, but possibly not surpass the record set in 2024, due to the strong El Niño event at the beginning of the year, which raised global temperatures slightly, but it is unlikely to continue throughout the year.

**US Government Cuts Threaten Climate Research and Data Collection**
The US government has decided to stop collecting certain data sources to save money, which could lead to a devastating cut in climate research. Researchers and officials are sounding the alarm, fearing that reduced budgets could cause the scientific community to lose important data that helps understand atmospheric phenomena and the potential effects of climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is planning to cut funding for long-term measurements of snow temperature in the western mountains, CO2 levels in Hawaii, and hurricane forecasting instruments. According to Ralph Keeling, the current leader of the Mauna Loa Observatory project and son of Charles Keeling, who started the CO2 measurements in 1958, 'If these cuts are implemented, it would be a nightmare for climate science not only in the United States but worldwide.' The warning is being echoed in the global climate research community. The NOAA has also announced that it will no longer collect data on the economic impacts of the largest natural disasters in the US. Some of the biggest climate protection measures in the country - or even the planet - could be affected by these cuts. Additionally, many specialized areas are at risk, as shown by the project to measure snow temperature. Even seemingly niche work can have huge impacts - not only on research but also on affected people. For example, the frozen reservoir of the Sierra snowpack provides a third of California's groundwater and most of the water demand of cities in northwestern Nevada. Researchers hoped to help authorities better predict the timing of water supply fluctuations in the region.

**June Weather Forecast: Is Summer Still Far Away?**
According to the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the first signs suggest that the weather in June 2025 will be anything but calm. These are not deterministic predictions, but rather seasonal projections that integrate statistical indices, climate anomalies, and prevailing atmospheric regimes to outline probabilistic trends on a large scale. It is essential for those planning vacations or working in the tourism industry to constantly monitor updates from meteorological models, as in a season dominated by instability, even a few days can make a difference.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has announced that it will stop updating its Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database beyond 2024. This decision has been met with criticism from former National Weather Service (NWS) directors, who warn that staff cuts will lead to 'needless loss of life.' Meanwhile, climate change continues to have far-reaching effects, including making coffee more expensive and causing penguin chicks to die from excessive rain in Antarctica. Additionally, a study estimates that the world's biggest companies have caused $28 trillion in climate damage.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will no longer track the cost of climate change-fueled weather disasters, including floods, heat waves, and wildfires. The agency's National Centers for Environmental Information will stop updating its Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database beyond 2024, and its information will be archived. This move is part of changes to the agency and the Trump administration limiting federal government resources on climate change. The database has tracked hundreds of major events across the country, totaling trillions of dollars in damage, since 1980. As one writer noted, 'weather is something that's been happening since the dawn of time' and is not solely caused by human activities.

**US Database Tracking Climate Change Losses Goes Offline**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is retiring its public database that tracks the cost of losses from climate change-fueled weather disasters, including floods, heat waves, and wildfires. The database, which has been tracking losses since 1980, will no longer be updated beyond 2024 and its data will be archived. NOAA communications chief Kim Doster said the change is 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes.' Scientists say these weather events are becoming increasingly more frequent, costly, and severe with climate change. The move is part of President Trump's efforts to remove references to climate change from the federal government's lexicon and documents, and is seen as a blow to efforts to assess the impact of weather events fueled by the planet's warming. Other private databases may be available, but they would be more limited in scope and not shared as widely due to proprietary reasons.

**Climate center for Texas is back online after funding 'lapse'**
The Southern Regional Climate Center (SRCC) at Texas A&M, which monitors weather and climate data for six states, was back online after federal funding 'lapsed' on April 17, 2025. The center's website was unavailable, but by late Monday afternoon, it had been restored. According to SRCC head John Nielsen-Gammon, the four regional climate centers that had shut down have received notices to proceed from NOAA and are 'in the process of going live again.' Regional climate centers provide efficient, user-driven services that cover weather data, including precipitation and temperature departure-from-normal maps, which are used by broadcast meteorologists to provide context for local weather.

**Climate Model Sounds Alarm: Will 2025 Bring an Extreme Heatwave Like 2003?**
A renowned climate model is warning of a potentially extreme heatwave in 2025, similar to the one in 2003. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) CFS-Prognose, the summer of 2025 could be up to 2 degrees warmer than the average temperature from 1991 to 2020. This could lead to severe consequences for both humans and nature, including drought, dry soil, and empty rivers. The model suggests that the heatwave will not only break temperature records during the day, but also lead to tropical nights, making it difficult for the human body to recover. This is particularly concerning for older people and those with health issues. As the climate model warns, 'the situation is becoming increasingly dire'.

An internal memo had warned of '100% unrecoverable data loss' if the sites went down.

**Mass Layoffs at NOAA Spark Concern Over Climate Science Future**
Hundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off at a key US agency, sparking concern in the scientific community. According to a California congressman, the massive personnel cuts will impact research and environmental policies. The layoffs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are causing concern, as the agency is crucial for weather forecasting, climate analysis, and marine conservation, which are vital for responding to climate change and natural disasters. The NOAA has been criticized by conservative sectors, particularly since the launch of the 2025 Project, a plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which accuses the agency of being a 'main driver' of climate alarmism and proposes its dismantling. This attack on the NOAA has sparked a debate about the future of climate science in the US and raises serious doubts about the country's ability to face environmental challenges.

**Trump's Administration Blocks Climate Data, Raises Concerns About Noaa's Future**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) was temporarily blocked from displaying its CO2 monitoring page for 24 hours after a group of officials from the Department of Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, accessed the agency's system. The move has raised concerns that sensitive climate change data may have been removed, which could hinder public access to crucial climate measurements. This comes after President Donald Trump removed climate change references from other federal agency websites. The new head of Noaa, Neil Jacobs, has a history of promoting antiscientific behavior, including altering a hurricane map to support Trump's claims. Jacobs has also been criticized for his role in the agency's handling of the 2019 hurricane season. Meanwhile, the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (Epa), Lee Zeldin, has a history of voting against environmental regulations and has ties to the fossil fuel industry. The actions of the Trump administration seem to align with the Project 2025 manifesto, which calls for the Noaa to be 'smashed and reduced' and is seen as a threat to the agency's ability to provide accurate climate information.
