**Uir Calls for Incentives for Interport Rail Operations**
The Italian interports are in a transitional phase that should end in 2026 with the completion of the upgrade works on the railway network. The Union of Interports (Uir) has expressed concern about the current situation, where traffic is decreasing and the sector needs support. According to Uir, it is urgent to respect the timetables and complete the modernization works on the railway network to avoid losing traffic shares and not meeting the potential demand. The association has reported a significant impact on traffic due to the ongoing works, with a -16.5% decrease in 2023 and a -3.2% decrease in 2024, with 40,000 trains operated in intermodal terminals. The Italian government has started a 'mappatura dei terminal merci intermodali esistenti' (mapping of existing intermodal freight terminals) as part of the planned works. 'It is urgent to respect the timetables and complete the modernization works on the railway network,' said Uir, 'to avoid losing traffic shares and not meeting the potential demand.'

**Carriers have a West Coast bias**
Tender rejection rates for truckload shipments originating in the Southeast surpassed 10% last week, while rates for freight departing the West Coast remain well below the national average. This contrast is striking, especially given the current focus on imports and the Southern California ports. The rejection rate disparity is unlikely to be caused by demand alone, as tender volumes out of the Southeast are down 6% year over year, while West Coast volumes have declined 14% annually. The shift of long-haul freight demand from the West to rail, with intermodal capturing a large share from the truckload sector, helps explain part of the disparity. Without sufficient transcontinental freight, carriers operating out West may find themselves stuck without balanced return loads. Some carriers may be gravitating toward the West Coast due to operational advantages, such as better truck utilization and higher revenue per load, as well as compelling rates, with spot rates in many major Southern California lanes at or above $3 per mile.

**Supply Chain in Numbers  --  May 26, 2025**
Ocean carriers are planning to increase rates by over $3,000 per container on the Asia-Europe route, despite weak demand and overcapacity. However, shippers are reporting offers as low as $1,200 per container. Analysts predict that the imbalance between vessel supply and demand will cap any sustained rate increase. Meanwhile, cargo demand at Hong Kong International Airport grew 2.6% year-on-year in April, driven by increased transhipments to Europe and the Middle East. The Lego Group is investing $366 million in a new warehouse and distribution center in Virginia, which is expected to create 305 jobs. Stord, a company providing fulfillment services, raised $200 million in financing, valuing the company at $1.5 billion. Pulse Charter Connect, a startup that streamlines organ transportation, oversubscribed a $2 million seed round, bringing its total raised to $3.3 million.

**CSX CEO: China Decoupling Could Benefit East Coast Volumes**
CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs remains optimistic about the company's volume growth prospects for 2025, despite the uncertainty related to the Trump tariffs. Hinrichs believes that decoupling from China could benefit East Coast volumes, and the company is working with East Coast ports to understand changing freight flows. Total volume for the railroad declined 1 percent to 1.5 million units, with revenue decreasing 7 percent to $3.4 billion for the quarter. Intermodal volumes increased 2 percent to $716 million, driven by international activity and an uptick in port traffic. According to chief commercial officer Kevin Boone, the trucking market has not inflected, but 'does seem to be past the bottom,' which is moderately favorable for overall intermodal volumes.

**For CSX, a Difficult 1Q25**
CSX reported a difficult first quarter 2025, with operational challenges such as weather-related disruptions and major infrastructure rebuild projects impacting network performance, revenue, and income. President and CEO Joe Hinrichs stated, 'CSX faced operational challenges to start the year, which contributed to first quarter results that did not meet our expectations.' Despite this, the company still expects volume growth in 2025, driven by intermodal volumes. However, revenue will be impacted by lower coal benchmarks, diesel prices, and volume mix, particularly in the first half of the year. The company is taking targeted actions to address network constraints and is committed to safely and reliably serving customers. CSX's operating ratio increased to 69.6%, compared to 63.7% in 1Q24, and the company expects to hold headcount roughly flat through the remainder of the year. Intermodal yields declined 5% Y/Y in 1Q25 on a 2% y/y increase in volumes, and CSX acknowledged a modest pull-forward contribution in 1Q international volumes, which has intensified significantly into April.
