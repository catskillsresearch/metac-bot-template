**Explainer-How flesh-eating screwworms in cattle could raise US beef prices**
The New World Screwworm, a parasitic fly that eats cattle and other animals alive, has spread from Central America to Mexico and is now a threat to the US cattle herd. The US has halted cattle imports from Mexico, citing the insect's spread, which could further elevate record-high beef prices. The screwworms were eradicated from the US in the 1960s, but experts say more factories need to be built to breed and sterilize the flies to control the outbreak. The US Department of Agriculture has announced a $21 million investment to convert a fruit fly factory in Mexico to produce sterile screwworms, and the border is expected to re-open to cattle imports by the end of the year. Dr. Timothy Goldsmith, a veterinary medicine professor, warned that any outbreak in the US would put other livestock and household pets at risk, and that homeless people would be especially vulnerable to infestation. 'This is a pest we don't want back. This is a bad thing,' said David Anderson, livestock economist at Texas A&M University. 'I can't imagine having to deal with that. It's gross.'

**Eramet's shares slide as Gabon plans manganese ore export ban**
Eramet's shares fell 4% on Monday after Gabon announced a plan to ban unrefined manganese exports from 2029. The French mining group, which is the main shareholder in Gabon-based Comilog, said it would continue to work with the authorities 'in a spirit of constructive partnership and mutual respect'. Eramet aims to safeguard the 10,460 Gabonese jobs sustained by Comilog and its railway transport unit Setrag. The move is part of Gabon's efforts to move from exporting raw materials to local processing, following similar initiatives in Guinea, Zimbabwe, Mali, and Tanzania. Eramet's growth in recent years has been driven by its operations in Gabon and Indonesia, but its historic nickel operation in New Caledonia has been struggling with losses and social unrest.

**We Should All Fear the Screwworm**
The US has successfully eradicated the parasitic New World screwworm, a fly whose larvae 'eat animals alive,' from North America since the 1950s. However, this success is now in jeopardy as the screwworm has begun to inch back into the continent. The USDA's effective process involved raising screwworms in factories, sterilizing them with radiation, and dropping millions of them weekly in at-risk areas. Despite a 100-mile wide barrier in the Darién Gap between Panama and Colombia, where tens of millions of irradiated screwworms continue to descend weekly, the barrier was breached in 2022.

**Guinea Signs Pact for Stability and Social Progress**
On May 29, 2025, Guinea marked a significant turning point in its history with the signing of the Pact of Stability for Growth and Social Progress. This agreement, facilitated by the Ministry of Labor and Public Function and supported by the National Council for Social Dialogue (CNDS), aims to strengthen social dialogue and promote economic development. The pact is a concrete realization of Article 11 of the National Charter of Social Dialogue, which established a formal framework for consultation between social partners. According to Minister of Labor Faya François Bourouno, the pact represents a structured and durable response to recurring social tensions, strikes, and professional conflicts that hinder economic progress. Ahmed Kanté, president of the Federation of Guinean Employers in the Mining Sector (FEPAMGUI), hailed the agreement as a major step towards stability, emphasizing the importance of respecting salary provisions to ensure a peaceful social climate. The pact is supported by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and benefits from essential technical assistance, ensuring compliance with international social governance standards. This agreement sets the stage for a new era of professional relations in Guinea, guided by dialogue, transparency, and a shared commitment to preventing conflicts and building a more just and stable society.

**Génération Patriote Benelux Officially Launched in Brussels**
On May 24, 2025, the 'Patriote Sans Frontières' event marked the official launch of the Génération Patriote Benelux antenna, in the presence of numerous personalities and members of the Guinean diaspora. The event focused on mobilization for the support of General Mamadi Doumbouya's candidacy, citizen engagement, and cultural animation. The Génération Patriote Benelux bureau successfully gathered hundreds of Guineans living in Belgium and Europe for a high-energy citizen day. Notable interventions punctuated the event. The spokesperson for Génération Patriote Benelux first thanked the movement's leaders before justifying the choice to support General Mamadi Doumbouya: 'What the President has achieved in just a few years is unprecedented. The infrastructure projects, the reforms, and especially the Simandou 2040 program have placed our country on the path to harmonious development, and we don't want it to stop in its tracks. We've regained the pride of being Guinean, that's why we want him to present his candidacy for the next elections.' The General Coordinator of Génération Patriote, Ibrahima Cissé, emphasized that 'Génération Patriote are generations of Guineans who refuse forgetfulness, resignation, and divisions. They are patriots, in their soul, in their actions, and in their example.' The Chargé d'Affaires of the Guinean Embassy in the Benelux, Mory Camara, thanked and congratulated the founders of the movement for their activities in Guinea and abroad. He also welcomed the focus on citizen mobilization around the census, which is 'an indispensable step for the development process initiated by the President of the Republic, General Mamadi Doumbouya.' The event also featured a session on the importance of the electoral census in Guinea, as well as a call for a massive and historic mobilization for the Great March of Brussels on May 31, 2025. The march aims to demonstrate the diaspora's support for the President's candidacy and to affirm a common vision: a standing, united, and forward-looking Guinea.

**Guinean Civil Society Demands Implementation of UPR Recommendations**
The Guinean civil society has welcomed the progress made in human rights, but is calling for concrete actions to implement the 257 recommendations from the 4th cycle of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Guinea, held in Geneva on April 29. Ousmane Diané, spokesperson for the Federation of Guinean Associations for the Promotion of People with Disabilities, emphasized the need for a strong political commitment to translate these commitments into action. He called for the development of a national implementation plan with sufficient resources, measurable indicators, and an inclusive monitoring mechanism involving civil society, technical partners, and citizens. The recommendations made by 87 UN member states cover a wide range of rights, including civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. Special attention is paid to the rights of women, children, people with disabilities, justice, education, freedom of expression, and the management of natural resources. The civil society has welcomed the active participation of the Guinean delegation in Geneva, particularly the Ministry of Justice, and the open dialogue with UN mechanisms, seeing it as an encouraging sign. However, they emphasized that accepting the recommendations is only the first step; their effective implementation remains a priority. The statement also highlights critical points such as the fight against enforced disappearances, the end of impunity, the improvement of prison conditions, or the ratification of the Paris Protocol relating to National Human Rights Institutions (INDH). The civil society also emphasizes the importance of inclusivity in development projects, particularly the Simandou mining project, which is expected to become a model of good governance, transparency, and respect for the rights of local communities. Finally, the Guinean civil society has urged public institutions to work closely with civil society to ensure the integration of recommendations into public policies, in respect of local realities. They have reaffirmed their willingness to accompany the state in this ambitious process so that by 2030, the commitments made in Geneva are translated into real progress for citizens.

**Kanikokoe Movement Aims to Strengthen Unity and Development in Guinean Forest Region**
The Kanikokoe movement, led by its national coordinator, Mr. Noël Lamah, has launched a series of awareness-raising activities in Coyah, in the presence of numerous institutional and community representatives. This initiative aims to strengthen the unity of communities from the Guinean Forest region while promoting major themes for their socio-economic and political development. 'Kanikokoe', a deeply significant term in local culture, embodies a call to proximity, solidarity, and concrete action. The movement has quickly structured a national coordination that brings together representatives of various communities across the country. The goal is to ensure equitable inclusion at all levels (prefectures, sub-prefectures, communes) so that the Guinean Forest is no longer perceived as an archipelago of isolated communities, but as a cohesive entity, focused on development. Four priority themes have been identified and are the subject of the awareness-raising campaign: biometric census, pacts of non-aggression in the forest region, fundamentals of the new Constitution, and the Simandou 2040 project. Mr. Lamah emphasizes that the forest region is often weakened by isolation and lack of information, even though a large part of its population now lives in the Grand-Conakry. He calls for the inclusion of internal diasporas in all awareness-raising actions. 'We are the great electors of the forest,' he affirms, stressing the importance of also sensitizing those who live outside the region. Mr. Lanciné Kaba, representative of the prefect of Coyah, welcomed this initiative, which he described as 'promising'. He recalled the importance of awareness, which is one of the current priorities of the government. In his view, the Kanikokoe movement perfectly meets national expectations, particularly in terms of promoting the Simandou 2040 project and social cohesion efforts. This launch in Coyah is just the first step in a broader process. The initiators of the movement aim to extend the awareness-raising campaigns to all communes of the Grand-Conakry, then to the entire national territory.

**Carter Center Applauds Historic World Health Assembly Resolution to Accelerate Guinea Worm Eradication**
The World Health Assembly has passed a historic resolution to accelerate the eradication of Guinea worm disease, with only 15 human cases remaining. World Health Organization Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'The passage of the Guinea worm resolution is a fitting homage to the hard work and commitment of the late President Jimmy Carter.' The Carter Center, led by CEO Paige Alexander, has been working with WHO and governments around the world to eradicate the disease. Jason Carter, board chair of The Carter Center, said, 'Eradicating Guinea worm disease was a deeply personal mission for my grandparents. They witnessed firsthand the immense pain Guinea worm causes. They knew this work could change millions of lives—and it has.' The resolution puts a global spotlight on critical actions to accelerate and finalize eradication efforts with the support of the global community.

**Mauritania Eradicates Trachoma as a Public Health Problem**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that Mauritania has successfully eradicated trachoma as a public health problem, making it the seventh country in the African region to achieve this milestone. The WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, congratulated the government and people of Mauritania on this achievement, saying, 'This is another example of the remarkable progress we have made in combating neglected tropical diseases, and it gives hope to many other countries that are still struggling with trachoma that they too can eliminate this disease.' Mauritania has a long history of fighting trachoma, dating back to the 1960s, but it was not until the early 2000s that it conducted a national survey to map the disease. The country has since implemented the SAFE strategy, which includes surgery to treat late-stage disease, mass antibiotic treatment using azithromycin, public awareness campaigns to promote face washing and personal hygiene, and improved access to water and sanitation services. The WHO has praised Mauritania's leadership and commitment to eliminating trachoma, saying, 'This is a historic victory for public health in Mauritania.' Trachoma is the second neglected tropical disease to be eliminated in Mauritania, following the elimination of Guinea worm disease in 2009. Globally, Mauritania joins 21 other countries that have been certified by the WHO as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. These countries are Benin, Cambodia, China, Ghana, India, Iraq, Iran, Laos, Malawi, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Gambia, Togo, Vanuatu, and Vietnam. These countries are part of a larger group of 20 countries that have eliminated one or more of the neglected tropical diseases.

**Guinea's President Inaugurates Strategic 'General Mamadi Doumbouya' Toll Bridge**
The President of Guinea, General Mamadi Doumbouya, inaugurated the 'General Mamadi Doumbouya' toll bridge in Tanènè, a strategic infrastructure that replaces four old metal bridges dating back to the colonial era. The new bridge, measuring 126 meters long, is accompanied by 7.5 kilometers of access roads and features a modern toll and weighing system with eight lanes. This project is part of the Simandou 2040 program, which aims to develop infrastructure, transportation, and technology in Guinea. The bridge is a major step towards the country's modernization and will contribute to the regulation of road transport while generating revenue for infrastructure maintenance. The President also named the bridge after himself in recognition of his achievements. He visited the toll and weighing stations and demonstrated the system by crossing the bridge with his vehicle. The inauguration of this bridge is a testament to Guinea's transformation and progress under the leadership of General Mamadi Doumbouya.

**Guinea worm resurfaces in Vietnam after WHO certification, affects only men**
The guinea worm, once declared eliminated in Vietnam, has resurfaced in isolated cases, particularly among adult men, linked to raw food habits and posing serious health risks. According to Associate Professor Dr. Do Trung Dung, the parasite has reappeared in 24 cases over the past five years, all in adult males across five provinces. Patients typically reported eating undercooked animal meat or drinking untreated water. The guinea worm larvae incubate for 10 to 12 months before the mature worm begins its painful journey outward through the skin. Dr. Dung warned that forcibly extracting the worm or attempting surgical removal can be extremely dangerous, as it can release toxins and larvae into the body, leading to inflammation, secondary infections, or even sepsis. He urged the public to practice safe food and hygiene habits, including eating well-cooked food, drinking boiled water, maintaining clean water sources, and ensuring hygiene in kitchens and food preparation areas. 'Each guinea worm may carry 3 to 4 million larvae. If the worm is broken during extraction, it can release toxins and larvae into the body, leading to inflammation, secondary infections, or even sepsis,' Dr. Dung explained. 'Other severe complications include joint immobility and abscesses caused by dead worms.'

**Guinea Worm Disease in South Sudan: Eradication is within reach - South Sudan**
South Sudan is facing a surge in human cases of Guinea Worm Disease (GWD), with six reported cases, three domestic animal infections, and 13 animal un-emerged worms in 2024 alone. This is a significant increase from 2023, when there were only 2 reported cases in the country and 14 across the entire African continent. Despite the challenges, South Sudan is making a concerted push to eradicate the disease, which has a patchy history in the country. Since independence in 2011, the country has seen progress and setbacks, with the highest number of cases reported in 2014. However, domestic animal cases have been identified in 2015, 2022, and 2023, and there is evidence of a wider spread of the disease, with 13 un-emerged cases found in wild animals in 2024. 'It is a pivotal time for South Sudan to strengthen its efforts and contribute significantly to Africa's -- and the world's-goal of eradicating Guinea Worm Disease,' according to the article.

**‘True leadership is not about power’: South Sudan honors good deeds of Jimmy Carter**
The South Sudan government and partners have commemorated the life of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter for his charitable contributions to peace and health sector transformation in the country. Carter's foundation, The Carter Center, has helped reduce Guinea worm disease by 99.9% and is close to eradicating it entirely. Vice President Rebecca Nyandeng said, 'President Carter showed us that true leadership is not about power, but about service. His legacy is written not only in history books but in the lives he touched and the suffering he alleviated.' The Carter Center has also played a crucial role in global conflict resolution, including mediating the 1995 'Guinea Worm Ceasefire'. The South Sudanese government has recommitted to eliminating Guinea worm, trachoma, river blindness, and lymphatic filariasis by 2030.

**Carter Center Reports 14 Human Guinea Worm Cases in 2024**
The Carter Center reports 14 provisional human cases of Guinea worm disease worldwide in 2024, aligning with some of the lowest annual totals ever reported. According to Dr. Kashef Ijaz, Carter Center vice president of health programs, 'A single worm can cause multiple new cases the following year, and we're actively preventing outbreaks in some of the most challenging and complex environments.' The campaign has reduced the disease by more than 99.99% and averted over 100 million cases since 1986. Adam Weiss, director of the Carter Center's Guinea Worm Eradication Program, said, 'The low provisional numbers show that communities' unwavering commitment to reaching zero and interventions to reduce human suffering are working.' The Carter Center leads the global campaign, working closely with national ministries of health and global institutions to eradicate the disease. Guinea worm is poised to become the second human disease in history to be eradicated, following smallpox.
