**Four Psychics Predict World War III in 2025**
Four prominent psychics, including the Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, the French seer Nostradamus, the Brazilian psychic Athos Salomi, and the British hypnotherapist Nicholas Ougola, predict that the world will witness the outbreak of World War III before the end of 2025. Nostradamus, known as the 'Prophet of Doom,' believes that the UK will be drawn into the conflict, writing, 'When the people of Europe see England establish its throne behind it, wars will break out on both sides... England will be printed with fierce wars, and enemies will appear from within and outside.' Baba Vanga, who is known as 'Nostradamus of the Balkans,' predicts a catastrophic event in 2025, which she believes will be the beginning of the 'fall of humanity.' Athos Salomi, who is known as 'the living Nostradamus,' believes that the war will be more terrifying than previous ones, with technology and electronic warfare becoming the tools of 21st-century fighters. Nicholas Ougola, a hypnotherapist from London, predicts that the war will break out in the middle of this year due to 'the lack of mercy in the world,' citing his spiritual visions of 'terrible acts of evil and human violence towards each other in the name of religion and nationalism.'

**Chilling prediction that four of the world's most famous psychics say will happen in 2025 | Daily Mail Online**
Four famous psychics, including Nostradamus and Baba Vanga, have predicted a devastating war in Europe in 2025. Nostradamus warned in his book Les Prophéties that the UK will be drawn into a war, saying 'When those from the lands of Europe, see England set up her throne behind. Her flanks, there will be cruel wars.' Athos Salomé, dubbed the 'Living Nostradamus', also predicted a coming war, saying 'the worst is yet to come' and that World War III is imminent. Nicolas Aujula, a hypnotherapist, agreed, saying 2025 will be 'a year where there is a lack of compassion in the world' and that we are teetering on the edge of WWIII. Meanwhile, Russia's propagandists have declared that British blood 'must be spilled' after a Volkswagen filled with explosives was detonated near the home of a Russian military officer, and have threatened revenge on the alleged suppliers of the explosives and British intelligence. Dmitry Medvedev, a Russian politician, has also warned that Sweden and Finland, two of NATO's latest members, are now potential targets of nuclear revenge.

**Psychics all warned about one chilling 2025 prophecy**
Four famous psychics, including Baba Vanga, Nostradamus, Athos Salomé, and Nicolas Aujula, have all warned about a chilling event that they say will be taking place in 2025. According to their prophecies, Europe will be rocked by a devastating war, and the UK will be drawn into it. Baba Vanga, who accurately predicted 9/11 and the death of Princess Diana, has forecast that the war will be the start of 'humanity's downfall' that will 'devastate' the population. Nostradamus warned in his book Les Prophéties that the UK will be involved in 'cruel wars' and a 'great pestilence from the past returns, no enemy more deadly under the skies.' Athos Salomé, dubbed the 'Living Nostradamus,' predicted that World War III is imminent and that we are teetering on the edge of it. Nicolas Aujula, a hypnotherapist based in London, agrees that 2025 will be 'a year where there is a lack of compassion in the world' and that we will see 'horrific acts of human evil and violence towards each other.' The prospect of war reaching the UK feels more plausible now than ever before as Vladimir Putin's propagandists have declared that British blood 'must be spilled' in a haunting World War III threat.

**Four Psychics Predict Apocalyptic End of 2025: 'The Worst is Yet to Come'**
Four well-known psychics, including Baba Vanga, Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicholas Ojula, have made a chilling prediction that a Third World War will start in 2025. According to the New York Post, all four psychics are convinced that the war will begin this year. Baba Vanga predicted that a war will break out in Europe this year, which she called the start of 'humanity's downfall' and a major blow to the planet's population. Nostradamus also repeated this warning, stating that the UK will be drawn into the conflict. 'The kingdom will be marked by such brutal wars that enemies will rise both from outside and from within,' he said. Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian psychic, is also convinced that the Third World War is on the horizon and 'the worst is yet to come.' He believes that this conflict will be more terrifying than previous ones, as it will involve technology and cyber warfare. 'This is not just a war between people, it's a war of machines - and what will happen next?' he said with concern. His words echo those of technology experts who warn of the need to regulate artificial intelligence as strictly as nuclear weapons if humanity wants to survive. Nicholas Ojula, a 38-year-old hypnotherapist from London, also believes that the war could start as early as mid-year due to 'a lack of empathy in the world.' Referring to his visions, he claims: 'We will witness horrific acts of human cruelty and violence against each other - in the name of religion and nationalism.'

**World-renowned psychics predict apocalyptic end to 2025: 'The worst...**
Four psychics, including Blind Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, 16th-century French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Athos Salomé, and London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, have predicted that World War 3 will break out before the end of 2025. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Nostradamas of the Balkans,' has foresaw a war breaking out in Europe this year, which she sees as the start of 'humanity's downfall.' Nostradamus believes that the UK will be drawn into the conflict, writing in his book 'Les Prophéties' that 'when those from the lands of Europe, see England set up her throne behind, her flanks, there will be cruel wars.' Athos Salomé warns that this conflict will be 'perhaps scarier than in years past, as tech and cyber warfare will become the modus operandi for 21st-century combatants.' Nicolas Aujula believes that war could break out by the middle of this year due to a 'lack of compassion in the world.' Their ominous warnings come at a particularly volatile time, with ongoing conflicts in Pakistan and India, and the Russo-Ukraine War showing no signs of ending.

**Russia issues WWIII threat to Donald Trump as tensions with Vladimir Putin explode - Manchester Evening News**
Russia's ex-President Dmitry Medvedev has issued a warning to Donald Trump, stating that a World War III could occur if Russia's demands are not met. Medvedev's comment, made on social media, was in response to Trump's claim that Vladimir Putin is 'playing with fire'. Medvedev wrote, 'I only know of one REALLY BAD thing - WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!'. This is not the first time Medvedev has made inflammatory remarks, and his comments are likely to be seen as a veiled reference to Russia's nuclear arsenal. Trump has consistently maintained that the conflict in Ukraine would have been averted had he remained in office, and has suggested that he could resolve the conflict if he made a comeback to the White House.

**"World War 3": Ex-Russian President Warns Trump After Putin's Criticism**
Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has warned Donald Trump of World War III after Trump said Vladimir Putin was 'playing with fire' by continuing the war with Ukraine. Medvedev said, 'Regarding Trump's words about Putin 'playing with fire' and 'really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one REALLY BAD thing - WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!' Trump had earlier said he would 'absolutely' consider new sanctions on Moscow amid missile and drone bombardment in Ukraine that left many dead. The threat of World War III comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war have intensified in recent weeks, but Putin has been accused of stalling peace talks.

The biggest threat to European peace is seen as Russia, with 82% of Western Europeans considering it a major or moderate threat. Islamic terrorism and tensions between Europe and the US are also major concerns, with Germany and France seeing these issues as significant threats.

A recent YouGov poll conducted in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.S. found that between 41% and 55% of respondents in each country believe another world war is likely to occur within the next five to 10 years. The majority (68-76%) think that a third world war would involve nuclear weapons and result in a higher casualty count than previous global conflicts. According to the National WWII Museum, the Second World War took the lives of 45 million civilians and 15 million in battle. The poll also found that 25-44% believe that if another world war were to occur in the next 5-10 years, it would result in the deaths of most of the world's population. The Ipsos findings also show that 72% believe there is a likelihood that nuclear, biological, or chemical warfare could happen somewhere in the world. 'Only a minority of western Europeans believe their national militaries could effectively defend their countries in the event of a third world war,' the survey says. 'By contrast, 71% of Americans have confidence that the armed forces could defend their country,' YouGov found. As for the source of the threat, most European countries cite Russia as the culprit, with 72-82% of Western Europeans telling YouGov they see the superpower as a major or moderate threat to peace in Europe.

**Survey Finds Majority Believe Third World War Likely Within 5-10 Years**
A recent survey conducted by the 'YouGov' institute and published by the British newspaper 'The Guardian' found that a majority of citizens in the United States and Western Europe believe that a third world war is likely to occur within the next 5-10 years. The survey highlighted the growing tensions with Russia as the most likely cause of a global conflict. According to the survey, between 41% and 55% of participants in 5 European countries (UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) believe that a new global war is 'very likely' or 'somewhat likely', a view shared by 45% of Americans. The majority of participants, ranging from 68% to 76%, expect any future global conflict to involve the use of nuclear weapons. Between 57% and 73% believe that the next war could lead to human losses exceeding those between 1939 and 1945, and between 25% and 44% believe that it could lead to the extinction of most of the world's population. The survey also found that most participants believe their countries will participate in any future global war, with 66% in Italy and 89% in the UK. However, their trust in their military forces is much lower, with only 16% of Italians and 44% of French believing their forces are capable of defending them. In contrast, 71% of Americans expressed great confidence in the US military. Russia was ranked as the biggest threat to global peace, with between 72% and 82% of Europeans and 69% of Americans agreeing. 'Terrorist extremism' came in second, but did not receive the same level of consensus. The survey noted that what is interesting is that many Europeans also expressed concern about the United States, with 58% of Spaniards, 55% of Germans, and 53% of French believing that tensions with Washington pose a significant or moderate threat to peace in Europe. The survey also found that most participants believe that the legacy of World War II is still present and should be taught to new generations. Many also expressed fear of repeating the Nazi atrocities, with some questioning their countries' ability to effectively deal with the consequences of that period.

**50 Years of Socio-Political Predictions for the World**
The author predicts that the world will enter a chaotic phase over the next 25 years, with the emergence of artificial intelligence-powered robotic soldiers and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The author believes that AGI will be developed first by the U.S., China, or another country, and will eventually reach near-godlike power. The author argues that a free AGI would be preferable to one controlled by corporations or authoritarian regimes, but suggests that a collaborative AGI that works with humanity in a mutual partnership would be the best-case scenario. The author notes that the next 50 years will test the limits of human ingenuity, morality, and survival.

**350 experts predict what the world will look like in 2035**
A survey of 357 experts on international affairs predicts that World War III is inevitable and will likely start within the next 10 years. Four in 10 global strategists (40.5%) believe a world war involving major nations like the United States, China, or Russia will break out by 2035. The majority of respondents said it would likely involve nuclear weapons and battles in outer space. Climate change was ranked as the second greatest threat to the world in 2035, with three in 10 experts citing it as the single biggest threat to global prosperity between 2025 and 2035. Experts also warned of new global alliances over the next 10 years that may threaten the US and NATO, with nearly half the poll (47.4%) believing China will lead a new alliance that officially connects them to Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Despite concerns about job losses due to automation, 58% of experts felt that artificial intelligence would have a positive impact on global affairs over the next ten years.

**World War To Space Battles: Experts Predict What World Could Look Like In 10 Years**
A new survey conducted by the Atlantic Council has revealed that World War III is likely to start within the next 10 years, with 40.5% of experts predicting a global conflict involving major nations like the US, China, and Russia. The survey, which involved 357 political strategists and foresight practitioners, also found that climate change is the second greatest threat to the world in 2035, with 29.9% of respondents ranking it as the single biggest threat to global prosperity. However, the majority of experts believe that there will be more global cooperation to stop the crisis by 2035. Interestingly, the rise of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) was widely viewed positively, with 58% of respondents feeling that AI will have a positive impact on global affairs over the next ten years. According to the experts, a war would not end well for the Ukrainians and would lead to a decline in America's economic and diplomatic dominance. 'The grimmer forecasts were in keeping with a dark global outlook overall, with 62 percent of respondents expecting the world a decade from now to be worse off than it is today, and only 38 percent predicting that it will be better off,' the team at the Atlantic Council said.

**UK 'will be at war in next five years' as official claims we 'need conscription right away' - Daily Star**
Liberal Democrat MP Mike Martin, a former British Army officer, believes there is a 'good chance' the UK will be involved in a war 'before the next election' and thinks conscription is necessary 'right away'. Martin, who has a PhD in war studies, stated that 'we're not at a stage yet where you can replace people with drones' and that 'drones are fine, as far as they go, but you still need people to occupy villages, hold ground, and all the rest of it'. This warning comes as experts predict the likelihood of 'World War 3' and Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has warned that the risk is 'extraordinary' and that 'World War III has already begun'. Dimon pointed to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as cooperation between US enemies Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, as reasons for his grim outlook. He also stated that the world's collection of nuclear weapons is 'the biggest risk mankind faces', ahead of climate change.

**How Europe has been preparing for WIII - and why Britain isn't ready**
European countries are preparing for a potential World War III by investing heavily in their defense systems. Poland is spending €2.5bn on its border defense system, including a 'sky shield' system to protect its eastern border from Russia. The Baltic states are also investing in their defense lines, with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania planning a major project in 2025. In contrast, the UK is scrapping £500m worth of military equipment and will conduct a strategic defense review in 2025. The UK's defense secretary, John Healey, acknowledged that the cuts are happening amid 'war in Europe, growing Russian aggression, and conflict in the Middle East', but the review will not report until late February 2025. Many experts agree that the timeline for a potential conflict is within three to five years, and the UK is not prepared to respond effectively. The article argues that the UK's defense spending is lagging behind its European neighbors, and that the country is 'defenseless against many forms of modern attack'. The chief of the defense staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, admitted as much during a conference in Berlin last year, and the article concludes that the UK needs to follow the example of the Nordic and Baltic countries in bolstering both defense and civil readiness for war.
