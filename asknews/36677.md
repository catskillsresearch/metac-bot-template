**Wall Street Closes in Positive Territory Amid Tariff Uncertainty and Nvidia's Good Results**
The New York Stock Exchange closed in positive territory today, navigating the legal consequences of the tariffs proposed by the Trump government and benefiting from the good results of Nvidia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.28%, the Nasdaq gained 0.39%, and the S&P 500 rose 0.40%. Steve Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers, said, 'It's strange to say that on a day when the news was so rich, there weren't many news that interfered with the market.' However, he believes that this is because many of the news had already been discounted by investors. The tariffs proposed by Donald Trump were temporarily maintained by a court of appeal, pending a decision. The market did not react much to this news, suggesting that it was not surprised by the decision. The investors were also focused on the results of Nvidia, which reported a profit of $18.775 billion, up 26% from the same period last year, but with a cost of $4.5 billion related to the license required by the government to export to China. The US International Trade Commission (ITC) estimated that Trump had exceeded his powers by imposing increased tariffs, which is a prerogative of Congress. The Trump government has appealed this decision, which it considers 'clearly wrong.' Analysts at Briefing.com estimated that 'in the end, the decision of the court of appeal, like that of the international trade commission, only reinforces the idea that an additional uncertainty about tariffs has been injected into the market.' The market also welcomed a new estimate of the US GDP, which showed that the economy contracted in the first quarter, but less than initially estimated. In annualized terms, the GDP contracted 0.2%, less than the 0.3% initially forecast. However, the number of jobless claims exceeded expectations, rising by 14,000 from the previous week. Steve Sosnick said, 'In the end, there was a lot of economic information this week, most of which was correct, but nothing that particularly moved Wall Street.' The only good surprise was the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which was above expectations.

**New York Stock Exchange Rises After Court Decision on Trump's Tariffs**
The New York stock exchange rose after a court decision to temporarily suspend the implementation of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. The Dow Jones index closed at 42,215.73, up 0.28% from the previous day. The S&P 500 index rose 0.4% to 5,912.17, while the Nasdaq index gained 0.39% to 19,175.87. As the legal process for Trump's tariffs continues, a positive trend was observed in the stock market. The US International Trade Court had ruled that Trump's tariffs exceeded his authority and ordered the implementation of the tariffs to be halted. The Trump administration appealed the decision, arguing that it damaged the government's diplomacy and interfered with the President's authority. The appeals court temporarily suspended the implementation of the tariffs, allowing them to continue during the appeals process. Meanwhile, Nvidia's strong financial results, released after the market closed, supported the stock market. The company's revenue and profit increased 69% and 26% respectively in the quarter, exceeding expectations. Nvidia's shares rose 3% or more. In terms of macroeconomic data, the US Commerce Department released its second estimate of first-quarter GDP, which showed a 0.2% contraction in the period. This was down from the 0.3% contraction expected in the previous estimate. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits also rose to 240,000, exceeding market expectations. Additionally, Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell met to discuss economic growth, employment, and inflation. In a statement, Powell said that the Fed's policy would be based on economic data and its implications for the outlook. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump believed Powell's decision not to lower interest rates was a mistake, which had put the US at a disadvantage economically compared to China and other countries. Other Fed officials also made statements, including Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who said that if tariffs were avoided through an agreement or other means, interest rates could fall.

**New York Stock Exchange Closes with Decline Ahead of Nvidia Earnings**
The New York stock exchange closed the day with a decline, ahead of Nvidia's earnings announcement. The Dow Jones index lost around 250 points and fell by 0.58% to 42,098.70. The S&P 500 index fell by 0.56% to 5,888.55, and the Nasdaq index fell by 0.51% to 19,100.94. Investors were waiting for Nvidia's financial results, and the stock market was in a negative trend. Analysts noted that the planned tariffs on the European Union, which were delayed after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, had created optimism in the markets. However, analysts also pointed out that the uncertainty surrounding tariffs would continue until there was more clarity on customs duties and the passage of the tax bill in the US Senate. The US Federal Reserve also released its minutes from its last meeting, which showed that officials were concerned about the increasing uncertainty in the economic outlook. The minutes stated, 'Officials agreed that a cautious approach would be appropriate until the net effects of a series of changes in government policies become clearer.' The minutes also noted that officials were concerned about the risk of inflation and unemployment rising. The 30-year US Treasury bond yield rose to over 5% during the day, before falling back to 4.98%. The 10-year Treasury bond yield also rose by 5 basis points to 4.49%. In macroeconomic data, the average interest rate for 30-year mortgages in the US rose to 6.98% last week, the highest level since January. In corporate news, GameStop shares fell by around 11% after announcing that it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoins worth over half a billion dollars.

**New York Stock Market Closes Down Ahead of Nvidia's Earnings Announcement**
The New York stock market closed down on the day before Nvidia's earnings announcement. The Dow Jones index lost 250 points, while investors were concerned about tariff uncertainties and economic turmoil. US Treasury bond yields rose, and mortgage interest rates reached their highest level. Analysts noted that the positive mood created by the postponement of tariffs after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen would not last, as tariff uncertainties would continue until there was more clarity on tariffs and the US Senate's tax proposal was passed. The Federal Reserve also released its minutes from its last meeting, which showed that officials were concerned about the increasing uncertainty in the economic outlook and the potential for inflation and unemployment to rise. The 30-year US Treasury bond yield rose above 5% during the day, before falling to 4.98%. The 10-year Treasury bond yield also rose 5 basis points to 4.49%. In macroeconomic data, the average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage in the US reached its highest level since January, at 6.98%. GameStop shares fell by around 11% after announcing that it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoins worth over half a billion dollars.

**New York Stock Market Rises Ahead of FOMC Meeting Minutes and NVIDIA Earnings**
The New York stock market indices, including the Dow Jones 30, S&P 500, and Nasdaq, are experiencing a slight increase ahead of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) May meeting minutes and NVIDIA's quarterly earnings release. The Dow Jones 30 has risen 59.10 points (0.14%) to 42,402.75, the S&P 500 has increased 6.20 points (0.10%) to 5,927.74, and the Nasdaq has risen 11.73 points (0.06%) to 19,210.90. Investors are focusing on NVIDIA's first-quarter earnings release, which will be announced after the market closes today. The US government's export restrictions on semiconductors to China are expected to have a significant impact on NVIDIA's revenue. Despite the strong demand for AI semiconductors, the market is cautious about how the export restrictions will affect the company's guidance. The Fed will release its May FOMC meeting minutes at 2 pm today, which is expected to provide insight into the central bank's monetary policy direction. The market is closely watching the minutes for clues on future interest rate decisions, particularly in light of the recent expansion of economic uncertainty. Yesterday, the New York stock market experienced a sharp increase, driven by the news that Donald Trump, the former US president, has delayed the EU's 50% tariff until July 9. This move is expected to alleviate trade tensions, at least temporarily. Rich Saferstein, CIO of Treasury Partners, said, 'Investors should focus on the long-term environment rather than getting bogged down in tariff uncertainty.' He added that regulatory easing, reshoring, tax benefits, immediate write-offs, and M&A activity are all positive factors that can create a favorable investment environment. However, he noted that short-term uncertainty is unavoidable, and there is a possibility of economic slowdown over the next two quarters.

**Is The US Stock Market Open On Good Friday?**
The US stock market will be closed on Good Friday, April 18, and will reopen on Monday, April 21. The Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) will remain closed on this day, while the U.S. bond market will close early at 2 p.m. ET on Thursday, April 17. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) has guided this decision. According to the Nasdaq website, the closure stems from historical tradition rather than religious obligation, dating back to the late 19th century. Interestingly, historical data suggests that this Good Friday break tends to have a positive impact on the markets. While trading is paused on major exchanges, other parts of daily life carry on, including the U.S. Postal Service and most banks.

**US Government Cancels Semana Santa Holidays, No Break**
The US government has canceled the Semana Santa holidays, and there will be no break. Although Good Friday is not a federal holiday, some banks and government offices may close or have reduced hours in states where it is an official holiday. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq will not operate on Good Friday, as it is a holiday in the stock market. However, supermarkets, restaurants, and government offices will be open, although some stores and businesses may close or change their hours on Easter Sunday. Many Christians in the US will celebrate Good Friday with fasting and religious services, and churches will hold special events to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Although Semana Santa is not a national holiday, Spring Break is a period expected by students and families, but its date is not yet fixed as it varies by educational institution.

**New York Stock Exchange Closes with Decline Due to Trump's Tariff Policies**
The New York stock exchange closed the day with a decline due to the uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The Dow Jones index lost over 400 points and fell by 1.14% to 41,432.87. The S&P 500 index fell by 0.76% to 5,571.95, and the Nasdaq index fell by 0.18% to 17,436.10. Analysts pointed out that the uncertainty caused by Trump's policies, particularly the tariffs, has increased concerns about the economic direction. Trump's announcement of new tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum products, which will be increased to 50% from 25%, has added to the uncertainty. However, Trump also signaled that he may reconsider the tariffs. Analysts also pointed out that the decline in consumer confidence and the decrease in government employment and financing have put pressure on the economy. The JOLTS data, which showed an increase in open job numbers to 7.74 million in January, was seen as a positive sign for the labor market. The passage of a new budget in the US Congress and the Ukrainian government's willingness to accept the US's 30-day ceasefire proposal were also seen as positive developments. However, the disappointing earnings reports from Delta Air Lines and Kohl's, a retail company, have added to the concerns about the slowing economy.

**Wall Street Closes in Clear Decline Due to Concerns about US Economy**
The New York Stock Exchange closed in a clear decline today, with investors concerned about the cooling of the US economy and the devaluations of mega-capitalizations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index lost 1.69%, the Nasdaq technology index fell 2.20%, and the broad S&P 500 index fell 1.71%. Tom Cahill, from Ventura Wealth Management, commented, 'A set of elements weighed on the market, with some statistics coming out below what was expected.' The final estimate of the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index, which declined significantly in February, 'mainly due to fear of an imminent price increase,' due to the rise in tariffs, was particularly poorly received. The index evaluating this confidence fell to 64.7 from 71.7 in January, a 10% monthly drop and almost 16% year-over-year. Additionally, the preliminary estimate (67.8) released on February 7 had already depressed investors. Furthermore, the numbers on the sale of used homes in January came out lower than expected. Cahill noted, 'At the beginning of 2025, we thought the economic growth could slow down and we're starting to see some disappointment in the economic data.' On the other hand, market operators are worrying about the impact of the layoffs of thousands of employees in the framework of the campaign led by Elon Musk's department, known as the Efficiency Government.

**Why is the US stock market closed today?**
The US stock market will be closed on February 17, 2025, in observance of President's Day. The Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchanges will be closed, but there are pre-market and after hours trading sessions available. Some online brokers allow trading during these hours, but it's essential to check with your broker to see if you're eligible. Extended Markets carry risks, with higher volatility and less liquidity. The US bond market will be closed, but the federal bank, currency, commodities, and global financial markets are expected to remain open. Japan's 10-year government bond yield rose to its highest level in nearly 15 years, driven by robust economic growth data. Japan's GDP grew by 0.7% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter, exceeding expectations. The favorable data points to a hawkish view for the Bank of Japan's monetary policy, with additional rate hikes expected later this year. Gold prices surged above $2,900 per ounce on Monday, indicating a likely technical rebound after its biggest one-day decline in two months. Traders are concerned about market disruptions caused by US President Donald Trump's tariff threats and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook.
