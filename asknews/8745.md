**Could Poverty Trigger the Next Pandemic? | Newswise**
New research from the University of Georgia and Oklahoma State University suggests that socioeconomic factors, such as poverty, international travel, and poor access to healthcare, may be driving forces behind the emergence and spread of animal-borne disease outbreaks. The study analyzed data from over 300 global disease outbreaks and found that environmental factors, like changing weather patterns and close contact with livestock or wildlife, can spark viral disease outbreaks, but socioeconomic factors often help these diseases spread widely. According to lead author Payton Phillips, 'It's our behavior, our medical systems, our travel, our economic conditions that play a role in disease outbreaks.' The researchers recommend addressing socioeconomic issues, such as poor sanitation and water quality, to prevent outbreaks. They also note that many infectious diseases originate in animal populations and can spread to humans through interactions with animals or contaminated food and water. 'Many viruses are naturally found in certain animals,' Phillips said, 'but it's our behavior that allows them to spread.'

**Minister Cataldo Questions 48-Hour Teacher Strike, Warns Against Trivializing the Strike**
Education Minister Nicolás Cataldo has addressed the 48-hour teacher strike called by the union for June 4 and 5. According to the union, the strike is due to the 'insufficiency of responses and concrete measures' from the Ministry of Education. Cataldo stated that the main issue is that there is a 'pre-established agenda' with a defined roadmap. 'If we are already sitting down to talk, it's because we don't require any pressure to have a space for conversation with us and to address topics that we largely share,' he said. Cataldo also emphasized that 'not everything can be resolved with a strike.' He noted that the loss of class time for children is evident, especially after the pandemic, and that this is something that needs to be avoided. The minister also expressed that there is a working group led by Subsecretary of Education Alejandra Arratia, and that the 48-hour strike was known before the last meeting last week. Cataldo stated that when there is a need for mobilization, it is legitimate, but he believes that the instrument of the strike should not be trivialized. He also commented on the shooting at a school in San Pedro de la Paz and the debate about installing metal detectors at school entrances. Cataldo emphasized that there is a difference between the situation in Chile and the mass shootings that occur in the United States. 'We have a red line that we have reached,' he said. He noted that the situation in the US is different, where people enter to randomly shoot and kill as many people as possible. In contrast, the incident in Chile was a 'fight,' not an attack. Cataldo reflected that when such situations occur, it means that society is failing. 'The education system has a role in this (...) there is a broader reflection that society as a whole needs to make, and that corresponds to all of us who influence the construction of those common senses. Starting from politics, but also addressing it from another point of view.'

**Solo Leveling Author Reveals Plans For A New Sung Jinwoo Romance Story**
Chugong, the creator of Solo Leveling, has expressed interest in writing a 'what if' romance story between Jinwoo and Joohee. In the original story, Joohee was too weak to handle Jinwoo's path, leading to her not ending up with him in canon. Chugong stated, 'Joohee's mental health was very weak and therefore couldn't handle the path Jinwoo would be going forward.' However, he has confirmed that Jinwoo did have feelings for Joohee before they went their separate ways. Chugong wants to explore an alternative ending where Jinwoo ends up with Joohee instead of Cha Hae-In, which would be a dramatic change for the series and potentially impact the sequel, Ragnarok.

**God of War's Next Game Can't Close One Pandora's Box Ragnarok Opened**
The Valhalla DLC for God of War: Ragnarok was a creative pivot that introduced roguelike progression and introspective storytelling to the series. This type of experience should be included from the start in future God of War games, not as a post-launch bonus. The next game could be set in Egypt, Greece, or a new location, but it should build on the roguelike formula introduced in Valhalla. This would raise the baseline expectations and make the roguelike system feel like an essential design feature. The article suggests that the next God of War game should focus on emotional reckoning and legacy, using the roguelike format to explore themes of failure and growth. Santa Monica Studio should embrace Valhalla as a core feature going forward, rather than leaving it behind as a one-time success.

**The Surprising Netflix Series that Represents a Part of Human History**
The Netflix series 'Vikings' has become a global phenomenon, combining real historical facts, Scandinavian legends, battles, and betrayals. The show follows the story of Ragnar Lothbrok, a Norse farmer who becomes a mythical figure after exploring new maritime routes to the west. As the series progresses, Ragnar consolidates his leadership, faces internal and external challenges, and leaves a mark on his community through alliances, conquests, and strategies that defy tradition. The show also explores the cultural clash with Christian lands, moral dilemmas of war, and the attempt to evolve a civilization accustomed to violence. With impressive battles, deep dialogue, and impeccable aesthetics, the production successfully portrays a key period in Nordic history, blending legend with real historical records. 'Vikings' has received excellent reviews and has inspired a spin-off series, 'Vikingos: Valhalla', which continues the legacy of its protagonists with a more moderate reception.

**536 AD: The Year the World Froze**
The year 536 AD is considered by historians and climatologists to be the most catastrophic year in human history. It was not due to a war or a pandemic, but a natural event: a global volcanic winter, followed by years of cold, famine, and disease. The event began with a massive volcanic eruption, the identity of which is still unknown. Researchers have suggested the Ilopango crater in El Salvador, but a 2018 study pointed to Iceland as the possible source. The eruption threw the Earth's atmosphere into chaos, causing a prolonged period of cold and darkness. Written accounts from the time are chilling. Cassiodoro, a Roman politician, wrote in 538 AD: 'The Sun seems to have lost its usual light and appears blue-gray. We no longer see the shadow of our bodies at noon.' Procopius, a Byzantine historian, described a 'solar eclipse' accompanied by widespread fear. The phenomenon was not just psychological: the Sun's light was actually obscured by a veil of volcanic ash and sulfuric acid that enveloped the atmosphere. Tree ring growth in Denmark and ice core samples show clear signs of a dramatic cooling. The global temperature, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, plummeted. Summers disappeared, it snowed in summer in China, and severe droughts hit South America. Agricultural production came to a standstill. Irish chronicles speak of a 'failure of bread' in 536, a sign of widespread famine. The disasters did not end there. A few years after the eruption, in 541 AD, the Eastern Roman Empire was hit by the plague of Justinian, a pandemic of bubonic plague that decimated the population of Constantinople and the Mediterranean. According to some scholars, it was this combination of climate collapse and health crisis that marked the beginning of the irreversible decline of the Byzantine Empire. The consequences of the catastrophe were global. In Central Asia, the cooling reduced grazing areas, forcing nomadic tribes to migrate eastward, sparking new conflicts in northern China. Some of these groups surprisingly allied with the Eastern Roman Empire, contributing to the defeat of the Sasanian Empire, their Persian rivals. However, not everywhere was the 536 AD a completely negative year. In the Arabian Peninsula, the climate became more humid and favorable to agriculture. With the great empires in crisis, a new geopolitical space opened up. This context, among other factors, allowed the rapid rise of the Arab Empire in the 7th century, one of the most influential civilizations in history. Many scientists consider 536 AD as the beginning of the Late Antique Little Ice Age, a cold phase that lasted about a century. Its origins seem directly connected to the volcanic eruptions of the mid-6th century, which profoundly altered the planet's climate dynamics. Almost 1,500 years later, the 536 AD reminds us how nature can suddenly change the course of human civilization. In a world today threatened by extreme weather events and increasingly complex global crises, this dark chapter of the past takes on a new meaning: human vulnerability to planetary forces is not a modern problem, but a constant of our existence.'

**A Terrifying Scenario: How the World Could End Before 2045**
According to scientific estimates and security studies, several scenarios are possible for the end of human civilization, including deadly pandemics, major climate disasters, economic system collapse, and a more frightening threat: a global nuclear war. If environmental, political, and economic crises continue to escalate over the next two decades, the world may find itself on the brink of collapse. Climate change, resource depletion, armed conflicts, and pandemics could combine to create a fertile ground for a catastrophic event. In this scenario, major powers would lose their ability to control, and the global system would begin to shake and eventually collapse completely, according to the Daily Mail. A nuclear war could spark a chain reaction of automatic responses that cannot be controlled. Imagine a massive cloud of smoke blocking the sun and engulfing the planet in a dark, lasting environmental disaster. A nuclear winter: an era of artificial ice. If a nuclear war were to occur, scientific estimates suggest that global temperatures could drop catastrophically, plunging the world into a nuclear winter, where agriculture would collapse, supply chains would stop, and food security, which relies on billions of people, would disappear. In such a situation, famine and extreme cold would be common enemies for those who remain alive. On the other hand, with the breakdown of global trade chains and production, the international economy could collapse completely, with banks closing, currencies becoming worthless, and communities turning to bartering or controlling resources through force. The global financial system we rely on today could become a distant memory, replaced by a constant struggle for survival. Pandemics and health collapse. In a post-catastrophe world, diseases are expected to spread rapidly, and with the destruction of medical infrastructure and air and water pollution, new diseases will emerge that are difficult to treat. Human survival would depend more on avoiding infection than adapting to economic or political situations. However, even with the bleakness of this scenario, there is still a chance to avoid the catastrophe, where countries can work on signing new agreements to limit nuclear weapons, intensify efforts to combat climate change, and rebuild international trust.

**Ragnarök: Danish Researchers Find Evidence of Real Climate Catastrophe**
Danish researchers have found evidence of a real climate catastrophe that occurred over 1,500 years ago. This event may have inspired the Scandinavian myth of Ragnarök, which tells the story of the gods' demise and a series of natural disasters. As Daily Mail reports, the discovery supports the legend of Ragnarök, which has been passed down for centuries. 'The discovery of the climate catastrophe that occurred over 1,500 years ago provides a scientific basis for the legend of Ragnarök,' said a researcher, although the name of the researcher is not specified in the article.

**Iran on the Brink: A Potential War with the US and Israel**
The situation on the Middle East is nearing a critical point, with ongoing conflicts in Syria, Turkey, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. The 'Iranian question' is a concern for the US administration, with some sources suggesting that Washington and Tel Aviv are planning a massive strike against Tehran. If this happens, the region will be plunged into chaos, according to some analysts. A senior official in the White House has stated that the US plans to complete a military operation in Iran by the fall, if Tehran does not begin dismantling its nuclear program. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has warned that 'war with Iran is almost inevitable' if a nuclear deal is not reached soon. Israel, which has been given a free hand by Trump, is adding fuel to the fire. Iran's military has reportedly warned potential opponents that it will retaliate with a pre-emptive strike against a joint US-British base in the Chagos Islands if necessary. This would be an attempt to keep Trump from launching a military attack on Iran. The US is seriously considering nuclear talks with Iran, according to Axios. For Russia, which has Iran as its main strategic partner in the region, a war between its ally and the West would be a 'catastrophic' event. Russia has warned that such a conflict would lead to 'irreversible catastrophe', according to The Sun. Political analyst Dmitry Rodionov believes that the situation is on the brink of disaster, with Iran's well-developed system of bunkers making it difficult for the US to inflict significant damage. Rodionov warns that Iran could retaliate with a serious attack, potentially reaching as far as the US base in San Diego. He also believes that a war would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy, including a sharp increase in oil prices and a global financial crisis. This would be a 'true Ragnarök', a scenario in which the world is plunged into chaos and destruction. Rodionov is skeptical about Trump's willingness to risk such a conflict, but believes that it is a real possibility. 'This will be a test not only for the US, but for the whole world, which will face serious shocks in politics and economics. It's hard to imagine that Trump or his team, which advocates for war, are so confident. It's unclear if they are willing to take the risk. In the current circumstances, this war will drain the US of all its strength,' Rodionov said. 'It's possible that Trump will become the one who organizes Ragnarök.'

**World on Brink of New Pandemic, Warn Scientists**
Scientists warn that the world is closer than ever to a new pandemic, citing factors such as the destruction of natural habitats and complacency towards preventive measures like vaccination. 'Nobody questions that, sooner or later, we will be confronted with another pandemic virus. By definition, each day that passes brings us one day closer to a new pandemic, although it is impossible to predict exactly when it will occur,' says parasitologist Miguel Prudêncio. According to the World Health Organization, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed over 7 million people and infected over 700 million. Geneticist Luísa Pereira points to several reasons contributing to the high risk of pandemics, including increased globalization and destruction of natural environments, which facilitate the 'jump' of pathogens from other organisms to humans. Biochemist Miguel Castanho notes that ecological imbalances can favor new pandemics, as viruses are part of environmental balances and are strongly correlated with what happens to fungal populations. 'The destruction of large natural habitats, such as the Amazon, can have extremely high costs, not only in the form of extreme climate events, but also in pandemics,' warns Castanho. Immunologist Helena Soares agrees that the world is closer than ever to a new pandemic due to a combination of environmental factors, such as habitat destruction and urbanization, and the global exchange of people and goods, which increases exposure to new and established infectious agents. Soares also highlights complacency as a factor, citing the recent emergence of infections by the 'mpox' virus and 'concerning' outbreaks of bird flu and the re-emergence of dengue, measles, and diphtheria. 'Not only in relation to vaccination, but also to other preventive measures, such as staying at home and wearing a mask when a person becomes ill with an infectious disease,' she adds.

**Scientists Warn of Increased Risk of New Pandemic**
Scientists warn that the world is getting closer to a new pandemic like COVID-19. 'Nobody questions that, sooner or later, we will be confronted with another pandemic-causing virus.

According to geneticist Luísa Pereira, several factors contribute to the high risk of pandemics, including globalization and the destruction of natural environments, which facilitate the 'jump' of pathogens from other organisms to humans. Climate change, which increases the distribution of mosquitoes, flies, ticks, and fleas that carry pathogenic microorganisms, is also a concern. Biochemist Miguel Castanho notes that ecological imbalances can favor new pandemics, as viruses are part of environmental balances and are strongly correlated with what happens to fungal populations. 'The destruction of large natural habitats, such as the Amazon, can have extremely high costs, not only in the form of extreme climate events, but also in pandemics,' warns Castanho. Immunologist Helena Soares agrees that the world is getting closer to a new pandemic due to a combination of environmental factors, such as the destruction of ecosystems and urbanization, and the global exchange of people and goods, which increases exposure to new and established infectious agents. Soares also highlights the complacency factor, citing the recent emergence of infections by the 'mpox' virus and 'concerning' outbreaks of bird flu and the re-emergence of dengue, measles, and diphtheria. 'We have short memories,' Pereira warns, 'and the high vaccination rate in the mid-20th century protected us greatly against most infectious diseases, leaving us to forget about seeing people sick and dying from these diseases. Parents stop vaccinating their children, diseases reappear, and they won't stay confined to one country.'

**The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Sociopolitical Perspective**
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised numerous questions, from a sociopolitical perspective. The director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated in 2020 that it is likely that there will be new pandemics in the near future. The pandemic has revealed the close links between human health, animal health, and the planet. The crisis has shown that efforts to improve healthcare systems will be insufficient if they are not accompanied by a critique of the relationship between humans and animals, as well as the existential threat posed by climate change. The pandemic has had a significant impact on the world, with four million deaths and a global economic contraction of around 5%. The article discusses the possibility of a new normality after the pandemic, and the need for a critical examination of the relationship between humans and animals, as well as the impact of climate change. The article also mentions the role of capitalism and the need for a transformation of the current system. The author argues that the pandemic has highlighted the structural injustices in the system, including the expansion of hunger and poverty. The article concludes by stating that the pandemic has created a window of opportunity for reflection, reimagining, and restarting the world.
