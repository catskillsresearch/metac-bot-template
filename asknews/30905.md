**Central Bank Decides to Lower Interest Rate by 100 Basis Points**
The Central Bank has decided to lower the interest rate by 100 basis points to 24.50%. This decision is a reflection of the latest economic developments and expectations since the previous Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Globally, growth expectations have declined since the April meeting, mainly due to the ongoing developments in global trade policies and the possibility of further disruptions in supply chains. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have adopted a more cautious approach in managing their monetary policies amidst ongoing uncertainty about economic growth and inflation. In terms of global commodity prices, oil prices are still driven by supply and demand factors, while agricultural commodity prices have seen a less pronounced decline due to climate-related risks. Despite the decline in inflationary pressures, the upward risks surrounding inflation continue, including the exacerbation of geo-political tensions and the ongoing disruptions in global trade policies. Locally, preliminary indicators for the first quarter of 2025 suggest a continued recovery in economic activity, with expected real GDP growth of 5.0% compared to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Estimates of the output gap indicate that real GDP is still below its potential, despite the ongoing growth in economic activity, suggesting that demand-driven inflationary pressures will remain limited. This is consistent with the expected downward trend in inflation in the short term, supported by the current monetary policy stance. However, it is expected that economic activity will reach its potential by the end of the fiscal year 2025/2026. In terms of the labor market, the unemployment rate has seen a slight decline to 6.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The annual inflation rate has seen a sharp decline in the first quarter of 2025, mainly due to the decline in inflationary pressures, the effectiveness of the monetary policy tightening, and the positive impact of the base period, as well as the gradual disappearance of the impact of previous shocks. By April 2025, both the annual general and basic inflation rates had stabilized at 13.9% and 10.4%, respectively, mainly due to the moderation of monthly inflation developments as a result of the decline in food prices, which contributed to reducing the impact of the increase in non-food inflation due to administratively determined price movements. Given that the pressures resulting from these movements are of a temporary nature, the implicit inflation continued to take a downward trend since the beginning of the year, gradually converging towards its consistent level with the Central Bank's target for the fourth quarter of 2026. The slowdown in general and basic inflation, as well as the decline in implicit inflation, indicate an improvement in inflation expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the annual general inflation rate will continue to decline during the remaining period of 2025 and 2026, although the measures to control public finances implemented in 2025, as well as the relative stability of non-food inflation, will slow down the pace of this decline. It is worth noting that the intensity of the upward risks surrounding inflation has declined compared to the April meeting, mainly due to the decline in trade tensions, the current exchange rate developments, and the return of the risk indicator to its normal level, allowing for the continuation of the monetary easing cycle that began at the previous meeting. However, the upward risks remain, represented by the effects of global trade policies, regional conflicts, and the exceeding of public finance control expectations. Based on the current monetary policy stance, the Monetary Policy Committee believes that lowering the Central Bank's interest rate by 100 basis points will achieve a balance between mitigating the prevailing risks and the available room for further monetary easing, while supporting the downward trend in inflation during the expected horizon of expectations. The Committee will continue to evaluate its decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, emphasizing that these decisions are based on the expectations and risks surrounding them, as well as any new data that may emerge. The Committee will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments, and will not hesitate to use all available tools to bring inflation to the target rate of 7% (±2 percentage points) in the average of the fourth quarter of 2026.

**German Economy Expected to Stagnate This Year, Council of Experts Warns**
The German Council of Economic Experts has reduced its forecast for the German economy, expecting it to stagnate this year during a 'pronounced phase of weakness'. The council, which advises the German government on economic policy, had previously predicted a 0.4% growth rate for this year in November. Germany has been the only member of the G7 advanced economies to not grow in the past two years, hindered by fiscal restrictions and industrial recession. According to Veronika Grimm, a member of the council, 'The unfavorable effects of the general economic weakness continue to affect the labor market.' The number of unemployed in Germany is approaching the three million mark for the first time in 10 years. The German economy, which is heavily export-oriented, is expected to be significantly influenced by two factors in the near future: US trade policy and the fiscal package. As Monika Schnitzer, president of the council, warned, 'The German economy will be significantly influenced by two factors in the near future: US trade policy and the fiscal package.' The new German government must ensure that the massive new public spending is distributed carefully to boost long-term growth; otherwise, it could be wasted, warned influential economic experts. The council also noted that the additional public spending, dubbed 'fiscal bazooka' by the media, could generate up to five percentage points of additional GDP growth by 2029, or have no significant effect.

**OECD unemployment rate remains stable at 4.9% in March 2025 - TEXtalks | let's talk textiles...**
The OECD unemployment rate remained stable at 4.9% in March 2025, marking the 36th consecutive month at or below 5%. The data shows a largely unchanged labor market across most OECD member nations, with 23 countries experiencing stable unemployment rates, 5 countries seeing an increase, and 4 countries seeing a decline. Notable performers include Turkey, which recorded a historic low unemployment rate of 7.9%, and the European Union and euro area, which maintained strong labor market performance with unemployment rates at record lows of 5.8% and 6.2% respectively. Economists view the continued stability as a sign of steady labor market conditions, supported by economic growth and post-pandemic recovery efforts. However, analysts caution that future shifts in global demand, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical tensions could impact employment rates in the coming months.

**Central Bank of Egypt Decides to Lower Interest Rate by 1% on a Slower Pace**
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to lower the interest rate by 1% on a slower pace than the previous meeting. According to the Central Bank's report, the interest rate on overnight deposits and lending, as well as the main operation rate of the bank, decreased by 100 basis points to 24%, 25%, and 24.50%, respectively. This decision reflects the latest developments and economic expectations since the previous Central Bank meeting. The Central Bank explained that global growth expectations have decreased since the April meeting, mainly due to the ongoing developments in global trade policies and the possibility of further disruptions in supply chains. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have adopted a more cautious approach in managing their monetary policies, given the ongoing uncertainty about economic growth and inflation prospects. In terms of global commodity prices, oil prices are still driven by supply and demand factors, as well as expectations of a decline in global demand. Regarding global prices of basic agricultural commodities, the decline was less pronounced due to climate-related risks. Despite the decline in inflationary pressures, the upward risks surrounding inflation remain, including the exacerbation of geo-political tensions and the continuation of trade policy disruptions, according to the Central Bank's statement. On the domestic front, the Central Bank stated that preliminary indicators for the first quarter of 2025 indicate a continued recovery in economic activity, with expected real GDP growth of around 5% compared to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The estimates of the output gap suggest that real GDP is still below its potential, despite the ongoing growth in economic activity, indicating that inflationary pressures from demand will remain limited. This is consistent with the expected downward trend in inflation in the short term, which is supported by the current monetary conditions. However, it is expected that economic activity will reach its potential by the end of the fiscal year 2025/2026. In terms of the labor market, the unemployment rate has decreased slightly to 6.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The annual inflation rate has decreased sharply in the first quarter of 2025, mainly due to the decline in the intensity of inflationary pressures, the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening, and the positive impact of the base period, as well as the gradual disappearance of the impact of previous shocks. By April 2025, both the annual general and basic inflation rates stabilized at 13.9% and 10.4%, respectively, mainly due to the moderation of monthly inflation developments, resulting from the decline in food prices, which contributed to reducing the impact of the increase in non-food inflation due to administratively determined price movements. Given that these pressures are of a temporary nature, the implicit inflation has continued to take a downward trend since the beginning of the year, gradually converging towards its consistent level with the Central Bank's target for the fourth quarter of 2026. The slowdown in general and basic inflation, as well as the decline in implicit inflation, indicate an improvement in inflation expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the annual general inflation rate will continue to decline during the remainder of 2025 and 2026, although the implementation of fiscal policy adjustments in 2025, as well as the relative stability of non-food inflation, will slow down the pace of this decline. It is worth noting that the intensity of upward risks surrounding inflation has decreased compared to the April meeting, mainly due to the decline in trade tensions, the current exchange rate developments, and the return of the risk indicator to its normal level, allowing for the continuation of the monetary easing cycle that began in the previous meeting. However, the upward risks remain, including the effects of protectionist trade policies globally, regional conflicts, and exceeding the expectations of fiscal policy adjustments. Based on the current monetary conditions, the Monetary Policy Committee believes that lowering the bank's basic interest rates by 100 basis points will achieve a balance between mitigating the prevailing risks and the available room for moving forward in the monetary easing cycle, while supporting the downward trend in inflation during the expected time horizon. The committee will continue to evaluate its decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, emphasizing that these decisions are based on expectations and risks surrounding them, as well as any new data that may emerge. The committee will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments, and will not hesitate to use all available tools to bring inflation to the target rate of 7% (±2 percentage points) in the average of the fourth quarter of 2026.

**Central Bank of Egypt Decides to Lower Interest Rates by 1% on Deposits and Loans**
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to lower interest rates by 1% on deposits and loans for one night, and the main bank rate by 100 basis points to 24.00%, 25.00%, and 24.50%, respectively. This decision is a reflection of the latest economic developments and expectations since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The committee noted that global growth expectations have declined since the previous meeting, mainly due to the ongoing trade policy developments and the possibility of further disruptions in global supply chains. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have adopted a more cautious approach in managing their monetary policies, amidst ongoing uncertainty about the economic growth and inflation outlook. The committee also noted that the global prices of essential commodities remain driven by supply and demand factors, with oil prices being influenced by supply and expectations of a decline in global demand. The prices of essential agricultural commodities have shown a less pronounced decline due to climate-related risks. Despite the decline in inflationary pressures, the upside risks to inflation remain, including the exacerbation of geo-political tensions and the continuation of trade policy disruptions. On the domestic front, preliminary indicators for the first quarter of 2025 suggest a continued recovery in economic activity, with expected real GDP growth of around 5.0% compared to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

In terms of the labor market, the unemployment rate has shown a slight decline to 6.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The annual inflation rate has shown a sharp decline in the first quarter of 2025, mainly due to the decline in inflationary pressures, the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening, and the positive impact of the interest rate cut, as well as the gradual decline in the impact of previous shocks. By April 2025, the annual inflation rate and the core inflation rate had stabilized at 13.9% and 10.4%, respectively, mainly due to the moderation in monthly inflation developments, driven by the decline in food prices, which contributed to reducing the impact of the increase in non-food inflation due to administered price adjustments. Given that these pressures are of a temporary nature, the implicit inflation has continued to follow a downward trend since the beginning of the year, gradually converging towards its consistent level with the bank's target for the fourth quarter of 2026. The slowdown in the general and core inflation rates, as well as the decline in implicit inflation, indicate an improvement in inflation expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the annual inflation rate will continue to decline during the remainder of 2025 and 2026, although the fiscal adjustments implemented in 2025, as well as the relative stability in non-food inflation, will slow down the pace of this decline. It is worth noting that the upside risks surrounding inflation expectations have declined compared to the April meeting, mainly due to the decline in trade tensions, the current exchange rate developments, and the return of the risk indicator to its normal level, allowing for the continuation of the monetary easing cycle that began at the previous meeting.

**Merkez'in Year-End Inflation Forecast: 24% - Latest Developments**
According to the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB), the year-end inflation forecast for Merkez is 24%. TCMB President Fatih Karahan stated, 'We are continuing to gradually receive the results of our tight monetary policy. In response to the recent market volatility, we took proactive steps as the TCMB. We will maintain our commitment to our monetary policy and ensure that the disinflation process continues. Global trade and economic policies remain uncertain. Tariff measures have increased global inflation expectations. The tight monetary policy has resulted in a more balanced composition of demand. Industrial and service production have increased in the first quarter. The labor market is less tight than implied by the headline unemployment rate. Domestic demand has continued to grow, exceeding expectations. However, the impact of the disinflation process on demand conditions has weakened. We expect the current account deficit to GDP ratio to be slightly higher in 2025 compared to 2024, but still below the long-term average. The disinflation process, which began in June 2024, has continued uninterrupted. The latest three-month data suggests a stable trend. Key indicators also point to the continuation of the disinflation process. The decline in service inflation is becoming more pronounced. The underlying commodity price index has strengthened in April. The current data suggests that the exchange rate effect is less significant than in the past. We expect the decline in commodity prices to support disinflation.'

**German Economy Faces Recession and US Tariffs**
The German Council of Economic Experts has lowered its growth forecast for the country's economy, citing a 'clear phase of weakness' that could lead to a recession this year. The council, an academic body that advises the German government on economic policies, had previously forecast a 0.4% growth rate in November, but has now revised its estimate due to ongoing economic slowdown. Germany is the only country in the G7 that has not seen any economic growth over the past two years, due to the decline in the industrial sector and increasing financial constraints. Veronica Grimm, a member of the council, said, 'We are still observing significant negative effects on the labor market due to the prolonged economic weakness', adding that the number of unemployed people is approaching 3 million for the first time in a decade. The council expects the US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump to have a severe impact on the German economy, which relies heavily on exports. Monica Schnitzler, the council's president, said, 'The German economy will be clearly affected in the coming period due to two main factors: US tariffs and the local fiscal package'. The council also expects the new fiscal package to have a positive impact on the economy, with a growth rate of 1% expected in 2026. However, Schnitzler warned that the effects of the package will not be immediate, and real growth is expected to occur in 2026, as the implementation of projects takes time. 'We need a clear budget that defines who will spend the money, when, and how', Schnitzler said. The council also expects the private consumption to grow strongly by 2026, with improved real incomes, but warned that the savings rate will remain high, which may weaken the stimulus effect of consumption.

Labour Union Labour Sector Representative, Chow Siu-muk, said that in recent years, many foreign labor and talent plans have been implemented, and the local employment situation has become more difficult than before. He expressed concern that the unemployment rate may continue to rise and suggested that the government should review the foreign labor and talent policies if the unemployment rate reaches 4%, and implement measures to help workers find employment and companies operate.

**OECD unemployment rate remains stable at 4.9% in March 2025 - TEXtalks | let's talk textiles...**
The OECD unemployment rate remained stable at 4.9% in March 2025, marking the 36th consecutive month at or below 5%. The data shows a largely unchanged labor market across most OECD member nations, with 23 countries experiencing stable unemployment rates, 5 countries seeing an increase, and 4 countries seeing a decline. Notable performers include Turkey, which recorded a historic low unemployment rate of 7.9%, and the European Union and euro area, which maintained strong labor market performance with unemployment rates at record lows of 5.8% and 6.2% respectively. Economists view the continued stability as a sign of steady labor market conditions, supported by economic growth and post-pandemic recovery efforts. However, analysts caution that future shifts in global demand, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical tensions could impact employment rates in the coming months.

According to the US Labor Department's February employment statistics (preliminary value, seasonally adjusted), the number of non-agricultural sector employees increased by 151,000 compared to the previous month, falling short of market expectations of 160,000. The unemployment rate also worsened to 4.1% from the previous month's 4.0%. The number of employees in the leisure and hospitality sector decreased by 16,000, and retail also decreased by 6,300, reversing the significant increase in the previous month. The pace of job growth in January was revised downward from 143,000 to 125,000. This is the first time the unemployment rate has worsened since November 2024.

**Labor Market Trends in 2024 and Prospects for 2025**
The latest labor market data for the third quarter of 2024 show an increase in the activity rate, which rose to 50.6%. The employment rate remains relatively stable, while the unemployment rate increased to 5.8%, but remains below the 2022 level. The economic contraction was less severe than expected, with a 1.8% interannual decline. In 2024, the general price level increased by 117.8% nationally, while the salary index grew by 145.5% for workers in both the public and private sectors. However, salaries are still below pre-2024 levels, with a 21.1% loss of purchasing power compared to 2017. The correction of service prices has been significantly higher than the average inflation rate, with housing and utilities costs increasing by 248.2% in 2024. The growth of salaries above inflation does not necessarily imply a recovery of purchasing power when the largest increases are concentrated in essential goods and services, limiting the ability to consume other types of goods and services. The commercial sector retreated 7.5% nationally in the same period, while in Rosario, the real factoring of commerce fell 13.9% interannually in the accumulated until November. For 2025, the labor market is expected to continue expanding, but the increase in costs of basic services will continue to pressure the purchasing power of workers. The creation of employment in 2025 will depend not only on the expansion of the labor force, but also on the generation of quality employment. A major challenge will be the internal and external conditions of companies, which may face difficulties related to productivity, the adoption of new technologies, and access to financing.

**Chile's National Unemployment Rate Drops to 8.0% in November 2024 - January 2025**
According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the national unemployment rate in Chile decreased to 8.0% in the quarter of November 2024 to January 2025.

As the INE stated, 'In 12 months, the indicator registered a decrease of 0.4 percentage points (pp.), due to the increase in the labor force (0.8%), lower than the presented by employed people (1.3%)'. The decrease was also lower than the previous quarter's rate of 8.1%.

**US Unemployment Rate Falls to 4.0% in January, Job Creation Slows**
The US unemployment rate fell to 4.0% in January, with the creation of 143,000 new jobs, according to the Department of Labor. The revision of the data for November and December allowed the unemployment rate to drop to 4%, its lowest since May of last year. The strong labor market supports the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates, at least for now. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that the wildfires in Los Angeles and severe winter weather in other parts of the country had 'no perceptible effect' on employment in January. The creation of jobs in January was almost half the number of December's estimated 307,000 people. The publication of the January data comes with the annual revision of the two statistics used to measure the US labor market, which had been moving in incompatible directions. The survey of businesses, which markets and investors rely on, showed much higher job creation figures than the survey of households, which is used to calculate the labor force and unemployment rate. Now, the first is revised downward and the second is revised upward, bringing their positions closer together. The revision of the business survey shows a less dynamic labor market in 2024 than initially calculated, with a total reduction of 610,000 jobs, of which 240,000 correspond to last year. This translates to a monthly job creation of 166,000 in 2024, instead of the 186,000 initially estimated. However, this negative difference is concentrated in the first part of 2024, while the job creation data for November is revised upward by 49,000 to 261,000, and December by 51,000 to 307,000. With such a strong labor market, despite the cooling of January, investors assume that the Federal Reserve will maintain interest rates at their current level of 4.25%-4.50% at its meeting on March 19. In fact, given the uncertainty about the inflationary effect of Trump's tariffs, it is possible that high interest rates will last longer than expected.

**Unemployment Rate Expected to Continue Decreasing in 2024**
The National Administrative Department of Statistics, Dane, has released the labor market results for the end of last year. Expectations are that the unemployment rate will continue to decrease, following the 8.4% rate in November. Bancolombia's research team noted that despite the challenges, the country recovered its growth last year due to private consumption and foreign investment. They described the labor market as 'resilient', citing the support of labor income for households as a key driver of consumption. According to Dane, 2.1 million people were unemployed in November, 195,000 fewer than in October, representing 5.2% of the total national population. The employed population increased to 23.6 million, 420,000 more than before. 'The labor market is maintaining the support of labor income for households as another motor of consumption,' said the team.

**Colorado’s job market is booming — so why is unemployment still climbing?**
Colorado's unemployment rate has been increasing, reaching 4.3% in November 2024, higher than 32 other states. However, this is not necessarily a cause for concern, according to Brian Lewandowski, executive director of the Business Research Division at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder. Lewandowski attributes the increase to a growing labor force, with Colorado adding 49,000 nonfarm jobs in 2024 and having the fourth-highest labor participation rate in the country. The state's younger population and high cost of living may also be contributing factors. Despite the labor shortages reported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Lewandowski believes that the trends suggest a recovering economy, with more people re-entering the workforce and new adults and residents looking for employment. He notes that the unemployment rate may be increasing due to the timing of people entering the labor market and not having a job right away. Lewandowski's team projects that Colorado's unemployment rate will continue to climb in 2025, but still sees the economy as poised for continued growth.
