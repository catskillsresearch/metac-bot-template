**Harvard tops the world rankings, but the US is struggling**
For the 14th consecutive year, Harvard is the best university in the world according to the Cwur ranking. It is followed by two other private American universities, MIT and Stanford. Cambridge and Oxford in the UK, respectively in 4th and 5th place, are the public institutions with the highest score in the world. Despite winning eight of the top ten positions, the US is struggling to maintain its dominance globally. In the Global 2000 ranking, only 40 American universities have improved their position compared to 2024, with 15 maintaining their position and 264 falling in the ranking. The best public American university is Berkeley, ranked 12th in the world, one place behind Caltech. The US is the second country with the most representatives in the Global 2000 ranking with 319 institutions, ten fewer than last year. Canada has 38 institutions in the ranking, led by the University of Toronto at 23rd place. Nadim Mahassen, president of World University Rankings, comments: 'Although the US still boasts the best universities in the world, the decline of the vast majority of its higher education institutions should concern US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and the entire Trump administration. At a time when Chinese universities are reaping the fruits of years of generous financial support from their government, American institutions are struggling with federal funding cuts and controversies over academic freedom and free speech. With the US surpassed by China as the country with the most representatives in the ranking, its reputation in the global higher education sector is seriously threatened.' Mahassen warns: 'The strong decline of American universities is parallel to that of universities in Japan, France, and Germany, while British and Russian universities have had slightly better results. With the extraordinary rise of Chinese institutions, Western universities cannot afford to stand by and sleep on their laurels.'

**China dominates US in global university rankings**
China has surpassed the United States in the latest Global 2000 university rankings by the Center for World University Rankings, marking a historic shift in higher education dominance. Chinese institutions now account for 17 percent of the list, up from 324 last year to 346 this year, while the number of ranked US universities dropped from 329 to 319. According to Nadim Mahassen, president of the Center for World University Rankings, China's success is attributed to enhanced research performance and sustained government investment in higher education. Mahassen said, 'At a time when Chinese universities are reaping the rewards of years of generous financial support from their government, American institutions are grappling with slashed federal funding and disputes over academic freedom and free speech.' The sharp decline of US universities parallels that of institutions in Japan, France, and Germany, while UK and Russian universities have fared only slightly better. Mahassen emphasized that the extraordinary rise of Chinese institutions means that universities in the Western world cannot afford to stand still and rest on their laurels.

**China Citizen Scientific Literacy Survey: 44.07% of Citizens Have Basic Scientific Literacy**
According to the 2024 China citizen scientific literacy survey, the proportion of citizens with scientific literacy has increased to 15.37%, and the proportion of citizens with basic scientific literacy has reached 44.07%, with a population of 4.4 billion. This has further solidified the labor force foundation for building a large-scale high-quality innovative army. China Science and Technology Association (CSTA) officials explained that the survey is divided into four levels: 'high-level scientific literacy', 'scientific literacy', 'basic scientific literacy', and 'low scientific literacy'. The survey results show that 2.30% of citizens have high-level scientific literacy, 15.37% have scientific literacy, and 44.07% have basic scientific literacy. The CSTA official analyzed the characteristics of the 4.4 billion people with basic scientific literacy: they are large in scale, with an average score of 68, and have a strong ability to apply scientific knowledge. The official believes that this group can adapt to the development of the times, provide a large-scale human resource foundation for economic and social development, and lay a solid foundation for the continuous improvement of citizen scientific literacy. There is no concept of 'not having scientific literacy' in the survey, and the results are not intended to imply that there is a group of people who do not have scientific literacy. The official emphasized that the survey results should be used to provide targeted suggestions for education, public scientific literacy, and scientific innovation, rather than being used to create a sense of crisis or anxiety.

**China's Gaokao Exam: A Secretive and Highly Secure Test of Knowledge and Endurance**
Every June, millions of Chinese students face the gaokao, the national university entrance exam that can determine the course of their lives. In 2025, over 13.35 million young people will take this test, according to the Chinese Ministry of Education, making it one of the largest numbers on record. The results not only open or close doors to China's most prestigious universities, but also directly affect professional success in China and social mobility for each applicant. As a Chinese official said, 'The security of the gaokao is a matter of educational justice.' The exam tests knowledge and also measures the ability to withstand pressure. The test lasts between two and four days, depending on the province, with days that exceed nine hours. Students must take exams in Chinese language, mathematics, and foreign language, and also choose subjects such as physics, chemistry, history, or politics. It's not enough to pass; the system prioritizes those who achieve better results than the rest. Intensive preparation begins in childhood. Many adolescents study between 10 and 12 hours a day. Achieving a high score can mean accessing one of the country's top 50 universities, with salaries that exceed those of graduates from lower-ranked centers by up to 30%. As a Weibo user said, 'For many, the gaokao is the only path to success.' The exams are printed under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and the National Administration of State Secrets Protection, usually in highly secure prisons. The selected teachers who design them remain isolated for weeks, without access to the internet or mobile phones. They can only communicate with family members through fixed phones under state control. During the exam days, surveillance cameras, GPS systems, and drones are used to prevent cheating, which is punishable by up to seven years in prison in China. In cities like Beijing, construction is suspended and exclusive public transportation is provided for students. The protection of the exams, according to official media, reaches security levels above those of a bank.

**Transcript: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," June 1, 2025**
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared on 'Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan' on June 1, 2025, to discuss various topics, including the US-China trade relationship, tariffs, and the national debt. Bessent stated that the US is not intentionally escalating the standoff with China, but rather de-risking its economy by reducing reliance on Chinese products. He also mentioned that the inflation numbers are the best in four years, contradicting earlier predictions of big inflation. Bessent emphasized that the US will never default on its debt and that the country is on the warning track but will not hit the wall. He also discussed the tax bill working its way through Congress, which includes an increase or suspension of the debt limit that needs to be delivered by mid-July. Bessent stated that the US is bringing the deficit down slowly and aims to leave the country in great shape in 2028. He also mentioned that the CBO scoring of the tax bill estimates it will add four to five trillion dollars over the next 10 years, but noted that this does not include substantial tariff income and a prescription drug plan that could push down costs for prescription drugs.

**China's Tight Grip on the Internet: A Threat to Global Freedom**
China has the most control over the internet, according to the 2021 'Freedom on the Net' report by Freedom House, which reviewed 70 countries. China scored only 10 out of 100, indicating a severe situation of internet freedom. Other highly restricted countries include Iran, Myanmar, and Cuba. Vietnam, which ranks fifth on the list, is following China's footsteps. China's 'Great Firewall' system controls internet traffic within and outside the country, allowing the government to filter content. Iran and North Korea also use similar systems. This model is becoming popular in Southeast Asia, with Cambodia and Thailand considering adopting similar strict internet policies. Tight internet regulations are common in the Middle East and North Africa, with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain ranking high on the list. Russia ranked 11th in the report, with measures including blocking online content, blocking platforms, spreading false information, cyber attacks, and taking action against users. The report clearly shows how some governments are using the internet as a means of control and surveillance, affecting citizens' freedom of expression.

**USWNT player ratings vs China: Emma Hayes' side never threatened as Lindsey Heaps, Sam Coffey, Cat Macario score in dominant display | Goal.com US**
The USWNT dominated China in a 3-0 win, with Catarina Macario, Sam Coffey, and Lindsey Heaps scoring the goals. The USWNT's attack was efficient and ruthless, with Macario, Alyssa Thompson, and Michelle Cooper running circles around China's defense. According to Cooper, 'We were just talking in our huddle about how we want to be ruthless... 3-0 is a good win, we put in a good performance, but we can always be better.' The win was a statement for the USWNT, especially after losing two of their last three matches. Even without key players, the USWNT's attack remains high-octane.

**Why Universities are Increasing Passing Scores, Explained by the Ministry of Education**
The Ministry of Education explained why universities are increasing the passing scores. According to Sayaat Nurbek, the Minister of Education, the passing score of 75 points for pedagogical specialties has been in place for several years and will not be revised upwards. 'We won't raise it now because the shortage of teachers is still quite large,' he explained. However, he noted that universities are free to set their own passing scores, taking into account their capabilities and infrastructure. '135 points - this is a separate case for universities that are experiencing a significant infrastructure deficit and artificially inflate the passing score to filter out a large number of people. Within the framework of academic freedom, each university has the right to set its own passing scores in accordance with its possibilities and infrastructure,' Nurbek said.

**Asia-Pacific Region Sees Decline in Press Freedom, State-Controlled Media Domination**
According to Reporters sans frontières (RSF), the freedom of the press and access to reliable information in the Asia-Pacific region are under threat due to the dominance of a powerful and authoritarian state-controlled model of information, particularly through economic ownership of media. In the 2025 World Press Freedom Index, 20 out of 32 countries and territories in the region saw their economic score decrease. Many independent media outlets in Myanmar have been dismantled and forced into exile or clandestinity. Hong Kong and Cambodia have seen media closures and journalist departures, often forced into exile under precarious conditions. Radio Free Asia's shortwave programs in Mandarin, Tibetan, and Laotian have been suspended. Concentration and collusion with the power of politics dominate the majority of media groups, with Thailand, Mongolia, and Pakistan being among the most skilled at controlling the media. RSF notes that some countries, such as North Korea, China, and Vietnam, have completely suppressed any form of independent media. As one commenter noted, 'Personne ne parle de la France, aucune liberté de l’information dans les grands médias' ('Nobody talks about France, no freedom of information in the major media'). Another commenter questioned whether France truly benefits from a free press, where information is often censored, manipulated, and pro-governmental, serving the interests of the ruling power.

**China's Press Freedom Restrictions Reach New Heights**
China's restrictions on press freedom have reached an unprecedented level, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF). The organization's annual ranking has seen China's ranking improve from 179 to 172 in 2024, but it has since dropped to 178. RSF's White Orlan explained, 'China's restrictions on press freedom have become more severe in recent years. Those who still insist on independent reporting are almost impossible to find. Many have been forced to work underground. As soon as the authorities discover someone doing independent reporting or publishing articles under their real name, they become a target for persecution.' Foreign journalists also face various restrictions, including strict visa approval policies and frequent smear campaigns. Hong Kong's press freedom ranking has dropped from 135 to 140, with a record-low score of 39. RSF has classified Hong Kong as 'very serious' for the first time. Taiwan's press freedom ranking has improved to 24, but RSF believes there is still room for improvement. Taiwan's media landscape still faces many problems, including a lack of transparency and a shortage of funding for public broadcasting.

**Tibet scores zero in ‘Freedom in the World 2025’ index - Phayul**
Tibet has scored zero in the 'Freedom in the World 2025' index for the second consecutive year, according to a report by Freedom House. The report states that Tibet is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) government, which suppresses Tibetan religious beliefs and cultural identity. The report highlights forced assimilation tactics, including mass surveillance, arbitrary detentions, and the relocation of Tibetan communities. The ongoing suppression of political and religious freedoms in Tibet has drawn widespread international criticism, with human rights organizations condemning the CCP's policies in the region. 'Tibet is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) government based in Beijing, with local decision-making power concentrated in the hands of Chinese party officials,' the report states. 'Authorities are particularly harsh in suppressing Tibetan religious beliefs and cultural identity, imposing policies that weaken the presence of ethnic Tibetans.'

**Hongkongers' score for city's autonomy, freedom dips for first time since 2020**
A new poll has found that Hongkongers' perception of the city's autonomy and freedom has declined for the first time since 2020, according to the One Country Two Systems Index published by the Path for Democracy think tank. The poll of 1,005 residents found that nearly half of respondents are dissatisfied with the city's legislature. The public's rating of the city's degree of autonomy, human rights, and freedoms declined in the second half of last year, with an average score of 5.38, down from 5.45 in the first half of 2024. This marks the first drop since 2020, when the public's rating had been gradually increasing since the first half of that year, when it hit a low of 3.39. 'It's a worrying trend,' said a spokesperson for the think tank, 'and we need to take a closer look at what's causing this decline.'

**Hong Kong Ranked 'Partially Free' in Latest Global Freedom Report**

**Taiwan Ranked 23rd Most Free Country in the World, China Scores 9 Points**
Taiwan has been ranked as the 23rd most free country in the world, according to the latest 'Global Freedom Report' by the US non-profit organization 'Freedom House'.

'Freedom House' did not provide an analysis of China's scoring standards and current situation.

**Global Freedom Report: China Ranks 9th, Taiwan 2nd in Asia**
The latest global freedom report by Freedom House shows that China scored 9 points, ranking as an 'unfree' country, while Tibet scored 0 points, ranking as an 'unfree' region. Hong Kong scored 40 points, ranking as a 'partly free' region. Taiwan, on the other hand, scored 94 points, ranking second in Asia, just behind Japan's 96 points. The report evaluates the freedom of 195 countries and 13 regions, with a total score of 100 points. China's score of 9 points is due to its suppression of political dissent, independent NGOs, and human rights defenders, which has almost eliminated its civil society. Hong Kong's score of 40 points is due to Beijing's increased control over the region, with many dissidents being charged under the National Security Law. The report notes that Hong Kong's judiciary has been compromised, with judges facing immense pressure to cooperate with the government's suppression of dissent. 'The Chinese government has been suppressing political dissent, independent NGOs, and human rights defenders for years,' said the report. 'This has almost eliminated China's civil society.' 'Hong Kong's judiciary has been compromised, with judges facing immense pressure to cooperate with the government's suppression of dissent,' the report added. 'This has harmed Hong Kong's rule of law.' 'Taiwan's high score of 94 points is a testament to its commitment to democracy and human rights,' said the report. 'It is a shining example of a free and democratic society in Asia.'
