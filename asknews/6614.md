**Is Bitcoin About to Soar -- or Crash? | The Motley Fool**
Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of $112,000, leading some investors to believe it will continue to soar in 2025. However, others argue that it is overvalued and due for a significant price decline. The bullish case is based on mainstream adoption, with companies and governments investing in Bitcoin. On the other hand, bears argue that people are simply hoarding Bitcoin, expecting to sell it at a higher price. According to prediction markets, there is a 78% chance of Bitcoin hitting $125,000 in 2025, a 43% chance of hitting $150,000, and a 16% chance of hitting $200,000. The most likely scenario is a Bitcoin price between $125,000 and $150,000 by the end of the year. As one expert notes, 'it's possible to come up with a likely Bitcoin scenario for 2025. It will consolidate at the $110,000 level before climbing to $125,000 and setting a new all-time high.'

**Bitcoin's Market Cap Is Now Higher Than These 3 Tech Giants. Can It Still Soar Higher? | The Motley Fool**
Bitcoin has reached a record market cap of over $2.1 trillion, surpassing that of several tech giants, including Microsoft. Despite this, some analysts believe it still has room to grow, with forecasts suggesting it could reach $1.5 million by 2030. However, others, including Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor, are more optimistic, predicting it could top $13 million by 2045. The author of the article believes that Bitcoin has become overvalued and a significant correction could be overdue, citing its lack of competitive advantage over other cryptocurrencies. They suggest allocating only a modest amount of a portfolio to Bitcoin due to its highly speculative nature.

**Algorand Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will ALGO Price Hit $1? - BitRss - Crypto World News**
Algorand's price has surged over 30% this week, and predictions suggest it could reach $0.90 by the end of 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate potential highs of $5.65 by 2030. The network's strong push for scalability, security, and decentralization is paying off, with growing developer interest and improved adoption. However, the question remains: Can ALGO Price hit $1 this cycle? According to CoinPedia's Algorand Price Prediction, the forecast for the Algorand network is optimistic for the coming years. With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Looking ahead to 2026, the ALGO price may record a maximum price of $1.35. With a potential low of $0.65, the average price could settle at around $1.0. By 2030, the value of a single Algorand token could reach a high of $5.65, a low of $2.50, and an average of $4.05.

**Bitcoin to Reach $1 Million by 2030: Prominent Analysts Predict Strong Price Increase**
Several prominent financial commentators and investment analysts are predicting a long-term price increase for Bitcoin that could take the asset's price above $1 million before the end of the decade, driven by growing inflation and expanding global debt. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her company's 'Bull Case' scenario, requiring a 58% annual compound growth rate over the next five years, primarily driven by increasing institutional adoption. Robert Kiyosaki, a popular financial educator and author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', predicts a more modest price of $1 million for Bitcoin by 2035. Kiyosaki believes that until 2035, a Bitcoin will be worth more than $1 million, gold will be at $30,000, and silver will be at $3,000 per coin, citing record-high federal and credit card debt in the United States in 2025 as the main factor for the search for protection assets like precious metals and Bitcoin. Other analysts, including Raoul Pal, point to the devaluation of fiat currencies as a key reason for Bitcoin's appeal as a protection asset. Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, also predicts that Bitcoin will reach $1 million, highlighting its potential to 'transform the global economy in incredible ways'. Markus Thielen, CEO and head of research at 10x Research, notes that Bitcoin's price historically moves in increments of $16,000, indicating that the next significant resistance for Bitcoin is near $122,000. André Dragosch, European research head at Bitwise, predicts that Bitcoin could extend its rally to a top above $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing a model proposed by Canadian Bitcoin investor Greg Foss that evaluates Bitcoin based on a basket of G20 sovereign bonds.

**Ripple Price Prediction 2021, 2025, 2030**
Experts predict that Ripple's price could rise from its current level of $0.46 to $2 in 2021. Some experts predict that by 2023, the value of Ripple could reach $3. Others predict that if XRP adoption reaches expected levels, we could see the price of Ripple go up to $5 in 2024, with XRP potentially oscillating between $4-$8. The majority of predictions state that the value of Ripple will be around $6 for most of 2025. Long-term price predictions for XRP state that the digital currency could reach $17 by 2030. Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, says that they want to make XRP a valuable payment tool, and its value will increase as a result. Ripple is different from Bitcoin in that it is controlled by a company that works with banks, and XRP cannot be extracted. It can process 1,500 transactions per second, compared to Bitcoin's 7 transactions per second. Transactions are also cheaper with XRP, with average fees for Bitcoin transactions increasing to $27, and each transaction taking an average of 70 minutes to be cancelled.

**Investment Preferences Shift: Experts Predict Rise of AI, Tokenized Properties, and Gold**
Investors' preferences are shifting due to technological advancements, demographic changes, and economic fluctuations. Experts predict that artificial intelligence, tokenized properties, and gold will be the top investment choices in the coming years. Currently, approximately 48.7% of global investments are in real estate, with a total value of $380 trillion. Bonds and stocks follow, with $133 trillion and $124 trillion, respectively. Gold and cryptocurrencies trail behind, with a total market value of $22.4 trillion and $3.6 trillion, respectively. Despite being the least popular investment option, cryptocurrencies have provided the highest returns to investors in recent years. For example, Bitcoin has increased by approximately 3100% since 2018. In contrast, gold has grown by 167%, stocks by 66%, bonds by 29.4%, and global real estate by 22.5% over the same period. Experts believe that investment preferences will shift towards digital and thematic areas in the future, driven by economic, technological, demographic, and climate factors. Tokenized properties, which are becoming increasingly popular, may reduce the high entry costs associated with real estate. Younger investors are turning to digital assets with smaller capital, while aging populations may lead to decreased demand for housing in some countries. Traditional safe-haven assets like bonds are losing their appeal due to rising government debt and declining credit ratings. Stock markets, on the other hand, continue to offer long-term investment opportunities in sectors like artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, cloud technology, and biotechnology. Gold remains a popular investment option during times of uncertainty, but experts warn that factors like space mining may increase gold supply and drive down prices in the future. Cryptocurrencies are growing as an alternative to traditional finance, with an estimated 560 million people, or 7% of the global population, using them by 2024. According to ARK Invest, the value of this market could reach $12 trillion by 2030 and $50 trillion by 2050.

**Bitcoin Maintains Value Above $109,000, Reaching New Historical Highs**
Bitcoin has maintained its value above $109,000, reaching new historical highs last week, just before Bitcoin Pizza Day. According to Lemon, the cryptocurrency has traded at $109,002 at 8:45 am today, with 0% growth in the last 24 hours. In contrast, most popular cryptocurrencies have experienced slight declines, except for Ethereum, which has risen by 3.1%. Willy Woo, a bitcoin analyst since 2016, has warned that the upward trend is starting to decline and may be followed by a period of consolidation. 'We're preparing for another solid streak in the long term,' he said. Despite its volatility, the growing institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors present a promising scenario for bitcoin. US Treasurer Rosie Ríos has stated that both bitcoin and blockchain 'are here to stay.' 'The world is watching us. We're setting the pace for what will happen not only in our history, but also in the future, and for all of us, this is the American dream. It's about the values that founded our country,' she said at the Bitcoin Conference 2025. The current US President, Donald Trump, has become a key figure in the industry, promising to create a bitcoin reserve and launching two cryptocurrencies, US$TRUMP and US$MELANIA. Marcelo Cavazzoli, founder and CEO of Lemon, noted that the last historical maximum has seen the highest volume of purchases and sales in the last three months and the most users interacting with Bitcoin in the last year. 'The interest is no longer just from retail. Today we see funds, companies, governments, and even proposals to incorporate bitcoin into state reserves. Institutional adoption is at a different speed: ETFs are opening the door, and every dollar that enters is transformed into a real BTC purchase,' he said. From Bitso, another major cryptocurrency platform in the region, they also celebrated this new record. 'The Bitcoin Pizza Day marks a key milestone in the history of cryptocurrencies: it recalls the first commercial transaction with bitcoin. Today, with a market capitalization of around $1.9 trillion, cryptocurrencies continue to challenge traditional models,' explained Julián Colombo, general manager of Bitso Argentina. Guilherme Nazar, regional vice president of Binance for Latin America, stated: 'The new historical maximum of bitcoin speaks of its resilience in the face of uncertainty and its growing relevance, a sign of confidence from both individuals and institutions. That this milestone was achieved on Bitcoin Pizza Day is a symbolic reminder that the value of cryptocurrencies is not a speculative theater, but something tangible, global, and deeply human.' The boom in Argentina is also reflected locally. According to the Panorama Cripto in América Latina report, Argentina leads the region in the value received in cryptocurrencies, with $91.1 billion between July 2023 and June 2024. Bitcoin represents 49% of cryptocurrency portfolios in the country, dominating over other digital currencies.

**'Orange is the new gold': Bitcoin Predictions Soar to New Heights**
The Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas has become the epicenter of an unprecedented wave of optimism in the crypto world. Major figures in the sector have made vertiginous predictions for the cryptocurrency, with scenarios of $200,000 and even $1 million becoming increasingly consensual. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said, 'The bitcoin is no longer an alternative, it's the new standard. Orange is the new gold.' He believes that the bitcoin, associated with the color orange in its logo, will surpass gold as a global reserve value, as younger generations prefer digital assets to precious metals. Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad,' also predicts a bitcoin price of $1 million by 2035, citing the potential 'implosion of the dollar' due to the US's massive public debt. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), former CEO of Binance, believes that the bitcoin could reach between $500,000 and $1 million in the current or next cycle, driven by the combined effects of spot ETFs, institutional demand, and inflationary monetary policies. Matt Hougan, director of investments at Bitwise, predicts a bitcoin price of $200,000 by the end of 2025, citing the inevitable rise of the cryptocurrency due to its fixed supply and massive buying pressure generated by recently approved bitcoin ETFs in the US.

**Bitcoin's New All-Time-High Brings Free Beer for All**
A banker's generous donation of $150,000 in Bitcoin has led to a free beer party for all passengers on a train. The event has sparked excitement among Bitcoin enthusiasts, with market wizard Peter Brandt predicting that the cryptocurrency could reach $125,000 to $150,000 by the end of August. This would be a significant milestone for Bitcoin, which has already seen a remarkable 27,467% return for investors who bought in at $350 in 2015. Meanwhile, the company D-Wave has seen a significant increase in value since a recommendation in February 2024, and is now being considered as a potential quantum computing favorite. Additionally, a new robot stock has been added to the Depot 2030 portfolio, which is expected to benefit from future quantum breakthroughs.

**World gobsmacked as Bitcoin goes ballistic**
Bitcoin has reached a record high of $110,524, driven by optimism over cryptocurrency legislation in the United States. Experts believe the surge is a 'major milestone' and predict that Bitcoin will reach $160,000 by Q4 2025 and $1 million by 2030. Caroline Bowler, CEO at BTC Markets, said the rise reflects a mature interest in digital assets worldwide, driven by institutional-grade infrastructure and stronger regulatory clarity. Edward Carroll, Head of Global Markets and Corporate Finance at MHC Digital Group, claimed that Bitcoin is decoupling from its correlation to risk assets and behaving more like an independent asset allocation. However, experts have long warned that Bitcoin and other cryptos are highly speculative and that investors could lose a significant amount of money if they're not careful.

**Bitcoin Price Predictions: Experts Expect Significant Growth by 2030**
Bitcoin has reached a record high of $107,000, exceeding the value of one kilogram of pure gold. According to Investing, this is the highest price since January of this year. The growth is driven by a favorable macroeconomic environment, institutional investments, and expectations of a softening of US monetary policy. One of the most well-known cryptocurrency traders has predicted that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 by 2030. This forecast is consistent with his views on key themes that he believes will be central to the next market cycle. Another expert, Jeff Kendrick, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025, $300,000 in 2026, $400,000 in 2027, and $500,000 in 2028. Meanwhile, the CEO of Pixelmatic and JAN3, Samson Mow, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1 million, and believes that this is potentially possible 'already this year'. A survey conducted by HashKey found that 50% of respondents believe that Bitcoin's price could exceed $300,000 this year.

He added, 'These will be the easiest money to make, and those who are waiting in fear may be the biggest losers.' Kiyosaki also warned that in 2025, credit card debt will reach its highest levels ever, the US debt will reach its highest levels ever, unemployment will rise, the US pension system will lose money, and retirement benefits will be stolen, potentially leading to a greater recession in the US.

**Will We See a $1 Million Bitcoin by 2030?**
Bitcoin has established itself as the leading cryptocurrency, drawing interest from institutional investors, retail traders, and governments worldwide. As of February 2025, Bitcoin trades at around $97,615. Many investors and analysts speculate whether Bitcoin could reach the $1 million mark by 2030, citing factors such as institutional adoption, macroeconomic trends, regulatory shifts, and technological advancements. Some experts, such as those who believe in this milestone, while others remain skeptical due to potential risks and challenges.

**Catherine Wood Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $1.5 Million by 2030**
Catherine Wood, founder of Ark Invest, predicts that the value of Bitcoin will reach $1.5 million by 2030, stating that 'not even China' can stop it. This prediction is based on the exponential growth of Bitcoin, which has increased in value by 100 times over the past decade. Wood notes that China's influence on Bitcoin is already low, as they have removed most of their assets. This prediction was made in the summer of 2024, when the price of Bitcoin was around $50,000 to $60,000, far from its current price of $93,000. Wood's prediction is part of a broader trend of increasing influence of Bitcoin in the world, with it becoming a widely accepted form of payment. However, it is also a high-risk investment, with no regulation or protection for investors.

**Can Bitcoin Hit $1 Million in the Next Decade?**
Bitcoin has been on a tear, gaining almost 55% in the past six months and setting new all-time highs. Some crypto bulls, such as ARK Invest, predict that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030, while MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor thinks it could reach $13 million by 2045. However, for Bitcoin to continue to soar, people must use it, and its potential growth areas include more countries adopting it as legal tender and taking a chunk out of the global remittance industry. Bitcoin's potential as a form of digital gold and increased institutional adoption are also reasons for optimism. However, reaching $1 million in the next decade would require a tenfold growth, which is a lot, especially considering its volatility and environmental record. As ARK Invest's bull case sees it, 'Bitcoin could take 25% of the global digital remittance market, which was valued at almost $23 billion in 2023.'

**Will Bitcoin Reach $1 Million? BTC Miner CEO Shares Ambitious 2030 Prediction**
Daniel Roberts, CEO of IREN, a publicly-listed Wall Street Bitcoin miner, predicts that Bitcoin's price could reach $1 million by 2030 due to its superior characteristics as a digital store of value and increasing institutional adoption. Roberts argues that Bitcoin is 'better at being gold' than gold itself, citing its scarcity, ease of transfer, and divisibility. However, analysts see a low chance of Bitcoin hitting $1M this year unless a U.S. Bitcoin reserve is established. Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, assigns less than a 10% probability to this occurring in 2025, suggesting that a seven-figure valuation for Bitcoin in the near term is unlikely. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest also projects that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2030, citing factors such as corporate treasury adoption, institutional investment, and potential interest from nation-states looking to diversify their reserves.
