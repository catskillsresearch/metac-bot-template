**Vatican Library to Digitize and Preserve Ancient Manuscripts**
The Vatican has launched a new project to restore and digitize the Vatican Library's archives, with the goal of modernizing over 80,000 ancient manuscripts. The project, in partnership with the Colnaghi Foundation, will use cutting-edge technology to preserve and share this cultural heritage. The manuscripts, including valuable pieces such as Botticelli's illustrations for the Divine Comedy and a nearly complete copy of Cicero's Republic, will be digitized and made available to the public through a powerful scanner developed by Colnaghi Factum. 'The organic material conserved is in a very deteriorated phase and would disappear if we don't act to restore it in the best possible way,' said Candida Lodovica de Angelis Corvi, representative of the Colnaghi Foundation. The project aims to preserve the documents and make them accessible to the world, and will have a significant impact on the access to historical and theological knowledge globally. The Vatican Library, founded in the 15th century, is considered one of the most important libraries in the world, and this new chapter in its history is a pioneering step in preservation, digitization, and democratization of knowledge.

**Meta to Replace Human Moderators with AI on Instagram and Facebook**
Meta plans to replace human moderators with AI to review content on Instagram and Facebook, according to internal documents obtained by NPR. The goal is to have 90% of the review process automated, allowing for faster updates and releases of new products. However, some employees are concerned that the automated system may not consider situations where products could cause harm to minors, such as rules and content publication restrictions. 'In the sense that this process means, functionally, more releases in less time, with less rigor in analysis and less opposition, that means you're creating greater risks,' said a former Meta executive, who wished to remain anonymous, to NPR. 'It's less likely that the negative externalities of changes to products will be avoided before they start causing problems in the world.' The automated system would require employees to fill out a form with the main characteristics of the product, and an AI would instantly analyze the risks and decide whether to release or not. This move comes after Meta faced scrutiny in 2021 for allegedly knowing that Instagram's algorithms were harming the mental health of teenage girls. The company had already announced the end of fact-checking teams in the US this year.

**The Voynich Manuscript: A 621-Year-Old Enigma**
The Voynich Manuscript, named after the Polish book dealer Wilfrid Voynich who purchased it in 1912, has remained undecipherable for over 621 years. The medieval manuscript is a mystery, with its unique alphabet and lack of illustrations providing no clear clues to its meaning. Researchers have proposed various theories, including that it may be a coded language, a natural language that has since become extinct, or even a steganographic message. Some have suggested that the manuscript may be a forgery, with its statistical properties and lack of grammatical structure suggesting that it was created in a later era. Despite numerous attempts to decipher the text, the Voynich Manuscript remains one of the most enigmatic and intriguing mysteries in the world of cryptography. As noted by Atanasius Kircher, a 17th-century scholar who attempted to decipher the manuscript, 'it is a book that has been written in a language that is not known to us, and the alphabet is not like any other that we have seen.'

**How AI will change the VC job**
According to Akshat Goenka, partner at Moonfire, AI will revolutionize the venture capital (VC) job, making it possible for entire deals to be fully automated. Goenka says, 'I think that you are going to see AI-first or AI-only funds.' AI will democratize dealflow and automate decision-making, making it possible for VCs to process and collect thousands of data points from various sources. Jonathan Userovici, general partner at Headline, agrees, saying, 'All the data parts — the pattern matching, the benchmarks of the metrics — will be more and more [automated].' However, many VCs remain skeptical about the idea of AI-only funds, with 94% of respondents believing that the augmented human-in-the-loop model will dominate VC moving forward. To stay competitive, VCs will need to focus on interpersonal and emotional skills, such as building relationships with founders, which AI cannot replicate.

**Asiatic Society employs AI to decipher ancient Indian manuscripts**
The Asiatic Society in Kolkata is using AI transcription and machine learning to decipher ancient manuscripts in its archives. The Vidhvanika project, launched in December, aims to digitize over 52,000 rare manuscripts and develop language models for ancient scripts. According to Anant Sinha, administrator of the Asiatic Society, 'Work needs to be done on the majority of the manuscripts.' The project has an accuracy of about 40 percent, but Sinha estimates it will reach 90-95 percent accuracy. He believes Vidhvanika may help save other languages from being forgotten, saying, 'We must make an effort to understand what is in those manuscripts and what our ancestors have left for us.' The project is supported by the Center for Development of Advanced Computing and aims to make the manuscripts accessible to scholars worldwide.

**Lost Legend of King Arthur: Scientists Decipher Ancient Manuscript**
Scientists have deciphered an ancient manuscript from the cycle of legends about King Arthur and his teacher Merlin. The manuscript was discovered by chance in 2019 in the Cambridge University library. It was inserted into a 1580 register intended for the accounting of the Huntingfield estate in Suffolk, and therefore, it went unnoticed by librarians for a long time. The fragment is signed as 'Suite Vulgate du Merlin', one of the novels about Merlin from an anonymous series of Arthurian legends. Researchers believe that there are less than 40 copies of this work left in the world, and each one is unique, as they were written by different authors with their own style. According to experts, 'an extremely important Arthurian text' was written by a medieval scribe between 1275 and 1315. It tells an engaging continuation of the adventures of the wizard Merlin and the young King Arthur. A team of researchers used advanced technologies to restore damaged parts of the text that were impossible to read and identified the type of ink used. 'It was a great day' for the researchers, as they were able to uncover a piece of history that was hidden for centuries.

**The Voynich Manuscript: Unlocking the Secrets of the World's Most Mysterious Book**
The Voynich Manuscript is considered the most mysterious book in the world and, to this day, its content remains indecipherable. The manuscript's pages, filled with texts written in an unknown language or code and accompanied by intriguing illustrations, have fascinated scholars and curious people for centuries. Despite numerous attempts to decipher its meaning, no one has been able to do so with certainty. The manuscript was acquired by Wilfrid Voynich in 1912, but its origins date back much further. It is believed to have been written between 1400 and 1500, based on the characteristics of the parchment and ink, as well as scientific analyses of its structure. The first historical mention is from 1665, when the physician Johannes Marcus Marci mentioned receiving it from the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher, famous for his studies on mysteries and codes. The manuscript's code is complex and appears to follow no logical pattern that can be applied to other languages or writing systems known today. While cryptography has been one of the most popular approaches to deciphering the book, other theories suggest that the manuscript may be a form of invented writing, a kind of 'artificial language' that never had a real meaning. This would lead to the hypothesis that the book could be a work of entertainment or a project of a creative and eccentric mind from the medieval period, intended to create a sense of mystery without a practical or scientific purpose.

**Undeciphered Books and Manuscripts: A Window to the Past**
The world of books and manuscripts is a fascinating universe, not only for the vast amount of knowledge contained in them, but also for the mysteries that they raise. There are several of these documents that remain enigmatic, as they have not been deciphered. The following are some of the most notable examples. The Voynich Manuscript is the most famous undeciphered book in the world. This mysterious text dates back to the 15th century (between 1404 and 1438) and consists of 240 pages. It is filled with illustrations and contains a text written in an unknown language or code. The illustrations are intriguing, including drawings of plants that do not match any known species, astronomical diagrams that appear to represent constellations, and figures of women in what appear to be rituals or strange baths. The text was written in an unknown alphabet, but follows patterns that indicate the existence of a real language behind its lines. However, no one has been able to translate it. Other notable examples include the Códice Rohonczi, the Disco de Festo, Linear A, the Códice de Borgia, and the Manuscrito de la Isla de Pascua. These texts are a reminder of the limits of human knowledge. Despite technological and scientific advances, there are still things that we cannot explain. 'These documents are more than simple historical curiosities, as they also represent the fascination with the unknown. Perhaps one day we will be able to decipher these enigmas. Until then, they will remain a testament to the fact that the world is full of wonders waiting to be discovered.'

**Ancient Manuscripts from Herculaneum Deciphered Using Particle Accelerators and AI**
The Bodleian Libraries, which support the University of Oxford, announced today that researchers have successfully deciphered an ancient manuscript from Herculaneum, which was buried under volcanic ash from the 2000-year-old eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The Herculaneum manuscripts were discovered in the 18th century and are part of an ancient library that was buried due to the devastating volcanic eruption. Using a combination of particle accelerators and artificial intelligence, researchers were able to read the texts stored within the manuscripts without having to physically open them, a remarkable breakthrough in the study of ancient history. According to the results, the team was able to identify several words, including 'fear', 'disgust', and 'life', which suggests that the text may be related to ancient philosophy or literature. Parsons says, 'These words suggest that this text is likely to be from one of the Stoic philosophers from the Epicurean school. It is possible, like many of the other Herculaneum manuscripts, that it is the work of Philedemus the Epicurean.' Philedemus the Epicurean was a philosopher and poet who lived in the 1st century BC and was born in the ancient city of Gadir, the ruins of which are now located in the town of Am Qais in Irbid Governorate near the Jordan-Palestine-Syria border. The work is ongoing to improve the scanning and analysis techniques using artificial intelligence, with the aim of deciphering more manuscripts without having to physically open them.

**Ancient Parchment Unveils Secrets of 2,000-Year-Old Philosophical Text**
A team of researchers has successfully revealed part of the content of an ancient parchment that was carbonized during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Using a combination of X-ray images and artificial intelligence algorithms, the experts were able to 'unroll' the document virtually without damaging it, obtaining the first readable words in nearly two millennia. The manuscript, found in Herculaneum along with hundreds of papyri in the so-called Villa of the Papyri, had remained intact but illegible due to its extreme fragility. Researchers from the University of Oxford and the Vesuvius Challenge team have worked for years on this challenge, using cutting-edge technology to rescue the knowledge contained in these texts. 'We have been able to access the content of the papyrus without compromising its physical integrity,' said the researchers. 'This is a significant breakthrough in recovering historical texts using modern technology.' So far, the team has been able to decipher approximately 5% of the text, and the initial fragments suggest that it is a philosophical work. Experts in ancient history believe it may be related to the Epicurean current, a philosophy that promoted the search for pleasure through moderation and the appreciation of everyday experiences. The discovery represents a significant advance in the recovery of historical texts using modern technology. Although the complete content of the manuscript has not yet been revealed, the researchers are confident that with more time and analysis, they will be able to read the entire document.

**Smart Engines' AI Deciphers Erased Fragments of Pushkin's Manuscripts**
Russian company Smart Engines has used their developed AI system 'Da Vinci' to decipher erased fragments of Alexander Pushkin's manuscripts. The neural network architecture 'Da Vinci' is widely used for document recognition, particularly Russian passports, regardless of the angle and conditions of the shot. The AI system learned to recognize the characteristic movements of Pushkin's pen in the unerased words and then restored the lost places using the created model of his hand movements. This way, several previously unidentified words from Pushkin's manuscripts were identified. These findings have significantly contributed to the understanding of the poet's creative process. According to Vladimir Arlazarov, the general director of Smart Engines, 'This experiment has confirmed the enormous potential of neural networks in various scientific fields. We see that artificial intelligence can become a reliable tool for researchers... The proposed method of removing erasures using AI can be applied not only to Pushkin's manuscripts, but also to archival records of other famous authors and historical documents, opening up new possibilities for studying the creative process of writing famous literary works.' However, it remains unclear why Pushkin might have erased certain words, possibly not wanting them to be read, including by artificial intelligence?

**Russian Researchers Crack Decoded Words in Pushkin's Manuscripts with AI**
Russian linguists and neural network specialists have developed a program to decipher the erased words in Alexander Pushkin's manuscripts. According to Nikita Perets, a leading researcher at the Institute of Russian Language RAS, and Dmitry Nikolaev, head of the 'Visual Systems' department at the IUP RAS, the idea came from their previous joint project, the National Corpus of the Russian Language. They decided to apply visual intelligence technologies to Pushkin's manuscripts, which often had corrections, even in the final versions. Nikolaev noted that deciphering the erased words can sometimes change the entire meaning of the work, previously considered true. 'This is a discovery on the verge of a sensation,' he said. The program processes the manuscript and shows how the words looked before being erased. A neural network provides a hypothesis, which is then verified by an experienced textologist familiar with the poet's handwriting and style.
