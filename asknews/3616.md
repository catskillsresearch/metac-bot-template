**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Food: 10 Trends to Watch by 2050**
By 2050, the way we produce, buy, and prepare food will undergo significant transformations. According to predictions, ten main trends will emerge. 1. 'Community meals' will continue to play a central role in our lives, with a focus on shared experiences and emotional connections. 2. The weekly grocery shopping trip will become a thing of the past, replaced by AI-powered meal planning and box delivery services. 3. Clothing will become a source of food production, with wearable technology that can grow food on the go. 4. Urban agriculture will become increasingly integrated into city landscapes, with shared gardens, vertical farming, and community-supported agriculture. 5. Food will be designed to absorb CO2, rather than emit it, with the help of oceanic agriculture and sustainable aquaculture. 6. AI will help reduce food waste by optimizing meal planning and transforming scraps into new dishes using 3D printing. 7. Climate change will lead to the adoption of new crops, such as mangoes and papayas in the Mediterranean, and quinoa and soy in Northern Europe. 8. Ancient crops, such as sorrel and dandelion, will make a comeback, providing a source of biodiversity and resilience. 9. 'Niche' crops, such as teff and fonio, will become more mainstream, providing a source of nutrition and sustainability. 10. Food will become a form of preventive medicine, with AI-powered meal planning and personalized nutrition tailored to individual needs and genetic predispositions. According to Dr. Joseph Poore, 'it's likely that our diet in 2050 will be significantly different from what we have today, although not necessarily in the ways we expect.' Dr. Morgaine Gaye adds, 'the next decade will see significant transformations in our daily habits and food models.'

**Nepal's New Traffic Law: A Challenge to Existing Regulations?**
The provincial government of Nepal has introduced a new traffic law, which some argue is in line with the country's constitution. According to the government, the law is based on the constitution's Article 304(1), which states that laws passed by the federal parliament after the first session will be invalid after one year. The new law is seen as an attempt to attract attention away from the existing federal traffic and transportation law, 2049 BS, and its regulations, 2054 BS. The government claims that the constitution gives them the authority to regulate traffic, citing Article 304(1) as the basis for their decision. However, some argue that this is a way to bypass the existing laws and regulations.

**Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat: Constitutional Amendments in the Next Parliament are 'Very Likely'**
Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat, the head of the Reform and Development Party, emphasized the importance of the upcoming parliamentary elections, citing that the next parliament, which will start its term in 2026, will be crucial as it will coincide with the 2030 presidential elections. El-Sadat stated, 'We are facing a parliament that will start its work in 2026, and presidential elections will be held in 2030, so anyone running for president will need the support of at least 20 MPs, highlighting the importance of forming the next parliament.' He also mentioned that the possibility of making constitutional amendments during the next parliament is 'very likely', as reported by Lamees Al-Hadidi in her program 'Kalam Akher' on ON channel. El-Sadat emphasized that having a real and active representation of parties, whether from the civil movement or others, within the parliament is a matter of great importance. He added that the elections are not just a closed or proportional electoral system, but a reflection of the political climate that needs to be prepared to encourage people to participate. El-Sadat called for the release of detained youth and party cadres without final convictions, saying, 'We need to encourage people to participate, but this will not happen unless there is a real climate that encourages voting, and one of its pillars is the release of detained youth and party cadres.' He also demanded a meeting with the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Mahmoud Fawzy, with opposition parties that have expressed objections to the electoral law amendments and electoral district divisions, to open a political discussion on how to prepare the political atmosphere for holding fair elections. El-Sadat stressed that it is also necessary for the National Election Authority to issue clear reassuring messages about judicial supervision of the elections, saying, 'We need to understand clearly: will there be complete judicial supervision? The announcement guaranteed judicial supervision by bodies such as the State Council and the Administrative Prosecution, but these bodies are subordinate to the Minister of Justice and do not represent complete judicial supervision in the full sense.'

**Russia to Impose Up to One Year in Prison for Failing to Report Diversion**
The Russian State Duma has passed a law that will impose a penalty of up to one year in prison for failing to report a planned diversion. The amendments to the Criminal Code were adopted in the second and third readings by the deputies of the State Duma. According to Vasiliy Piskarev, co-author of the amendments and chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, the law will help to protect energy and transportation infrastructure during the special operation on Ukraine. 'It is very important to provide timely information to law enforcement agencies about planned explosions, arson, or other actions that undermine the economic security and defense capabilities of our country,' Piskarev emphasized. The law will add a new provision to Article 205.6 of the Criminal Code, making it a crime to fail to report a person or group planning, committing, or having committed a diversion-related crime. The penalty for failing to report a crime will be a fine, forced labor for up to one year, or imprisonment for the same period. The list of crimes for which failing to report is punishable will include Article 281 of the Criminal Code, which deals with diversion.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Stop Bill 7, CSOs, lawyers demand: “If it passes, your vote won’t matter in 2026” - Zambia: News Diggers!**
Linda Kasonde, a lawyer, is urging citizens to oppose Bill 7 of 2025, stating that if it passes, 'your vote won't matter in 2026' as the government can secure its two-thirds majority in Parliament. Transparency International Zambia Executive Director Maurice Nyambe says it is 'mind-shattering' that the government is proceeding with constitutional amendments despite a lack of consensus. Former LAZ president George Chisanga claims that if Bill 7 passes, Zambia will 'never be considered a democracy.' A consortium of civil society organizations has also demanded the immediate halting of the constitutional amendment process.

**US Republicans Move to Amend Constitution to Allow Donald Trump's Third Term**
US Republican Andy Ogles has proposed a constitutional amendment to allow President Donald Trump to serve a third term. The amendment would modify the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms, to allow for three terms. Ogles claims to have 'a lot of support' from his Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives, but acknowledged that the amendment would face a 'difficult path' to passage. The proposed change would enable Trump to serve a third term, which Ogles justified by citing Trump's 'decisive leadership' in contrast to the 'chaos, suffering, and economic decline' experienced by the US in the past four years. However, Democratic lawmakers have criticized the proposal, with Representative Steve Cohen saying, 'Two terms are enough chaos for any nation to endure.'

**Understanding Changes and Impacts of the End of Re-election**
A proposed amendment to the Constitution that would end re-election and unify future elections every five years was approved in the Senate's Constitution and Justice Committee on Wednesday (21), but faces resistance in both houses of Congress, making its final approval uncertain. Despite the end of re-election for president, governors, and mayors having support among congressmen, some of them criticize the confusing transition rules and the unification of all elections in a single year, which would force citizens to choose nine candidates at once, in a campaign that would mix municipal, state, and federal issues. The measure proposes a gradual and complex transition until 2039, when all mandates would have a duration of five years. The path to this standardization includes a series of mandates with variable durations (four, five, six, eight, and nine years), depending on the positions and election years. The text approved in the committee still needs to be voted on in two rounds in the plenary and then analyzed in the Chamber. To be approved in the Senate plenary, it needs the support of at least 49 of the 81 senators, in two rounds of voting. If it passes, the PEC needs to be processed in the Chamber by the CCJ, special committee, and then plenary. It needs the vote of at least 308 of the 513 deputies. The proposal emerged from the senators' drawer after the Chamber approved the increase of 18 seats in the House, rejecting an equation that only rearranged the current seats according to the new data from the 2022 Census. The text is under analysis in the Senate. Currently, mayors have a four-year term with the possibility of re-election, and councilors can re-elect themselves indefinitely. Under the proposed amendment, mayors elected in 2028 would not be able to re-elect themselves, while councilors would continue to be able to re-elect themselves indefinitely. Mayors and councilors elected in 2028 would have a six-year term, while those elected in 2034 would have a five-year term. The proposed amendment also maintains the possibility of re-election for governors and senators, but with variable durations depending on the election year. For example, governors elected in 2026 would continue to have an eight-year term, while those elected in 2030 would have a nine-year term, and those elected in 2034 and 2039 would have a five-year term.

**Brazilian Senate Approves Constitutional Amendment to End Re-Election of Executive Branch Officials**
The Brazilian Senate's Constitution and Justice Commission (CCJ) has approved the text of a constitutional amendment that would end the re-election of executive branch officials, including the President, governors, and mayors. The amendment would also increase the term of office for all elected positions, with senators serving 10-year terms, and other officials serving 5-year terms. The amendment also proposes to unify the elections for municipal and general elections, starting in 2034. The CCJ's approval is a significant step towards the amendment's passage, but it still needs to be voted on by the full Senate. The amendment's proponents argue that it would promote a renewal of politics and reduce the influence of electioneering on the performance of elected officials. The amendment's text establishes different transition rules for the end of re-election for executive branch officials, with mayors and governors able to run for re-election one last time in 2028 and 2030, respectively, and the President able to run for re-election one last time in 2030. After that, new elected officials would not be able to run for re-election. The amendment also proposes to increase the term of office for all elected positions, with senators serving 10-year terms, and other officials serving 5-year terms. The amendment's text establishes different transition rules for the increase in term of office, with some officials serving longer terms before the change takes effect. The amendment's proponents argue that it would reduce the costs of elections and promote a more stable and effective government. 'The mobilization of the necessary apparatus for each election is a costly operation that consumes scarce public resources, in a country where pressing needs of the population have not yet been adequately addressed,' said Senator Marcelo Castro, the amendment's rapporteur. 'The unification will also provide a reduction in public resources employed in campaign financing,' he added.

**South Korea's Quest for Megacities: A Solution to Population Decline and Local Extinction**
South Korea's population is expected to decrease to 46 million by 2052, with a 25% reduction in the population of non-metropolitan cities. To address this issue, the government is considering merging local governments to create 'megacities' that can compete with Seoul. This would involve integrating local governments such as Busan-Ulsan-Gyeongnam, Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Gwangju-Jeonnam, and Daejeon-Chungnam. The goal is to create a new administrative system that can provide more autonomy and resources to local governments. This would require a constitutional amendment to strengthen local autonomy and fiscal independence. Currently, local governments have a low level of fiscal independence, with an average of 43.18% in 2025. Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Sejong are the only cities with a fiscal independence rate above 50%. To address this issue, the government is considering increasing the fiscal independence of local governments through measures such as increasing taxes or fees. Additionally, the government is planning to merge small administrative units to improve administrative efficiency and reduce duplication of efforts. This would involve integrating local governments and creating a more competitive and efficient administrative system. According to Hong Jun-hyun, a professor at Chungnam National University, 'We need to think and prepare for sustainable development, considering the future generation, as the population decrease and local extinction are becoming a reality.'

Rumors of Donald Trump running for president in 2028 have been circulating, with Trump supporter Steve Bannon suggesting 'a couple of alternatives' for Trump to seek another term. However, the Constitution's 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, limits a U.S. president to two terms. Sports journalist Stephen A. Smith pointed out that Trump supporters are seeking to 'circumvent' the Constitution. Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance has emerged as a popular pick to succeed Trump, with Tucker Carlson saying Vance would further Trump's 'legacy.' Trump has declined to endorse Vance, saying there are 'a lot of very capable people.' On the Democratic side, Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) is shaping up to be a possible presidential nominee in 2028, receiving praise from actor and director George Clooney, who called him a 'proper leader.'

**Germany's Arrogant Climate Policy: Why Enshrining Neutrality by 2045 in the Constitution is a Mistake**
The Greens are pushing for the German parliament to enshrine climate neutrality by 2045 in the constitution, but this is seen as an arrogant move that goes against the EU's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The article argues that Germany's climate policy is not in line with its EU partners and that the country's attempts to be a climate leader have been unsuccessful. The author suggests that Germany should instead focus on being part of the EU's majority position and not take a national path. The article also criticizes the Greens for their refusal to adapt to reality and for their 'instinctless' behavior in trying to impose their goals on others. The author concludes that the German parliament should use the upcoming constitutional amendment to correct past mistakes and make Germany more coalition-friendly in the EU.

**Germany's Climate Neutrality Goal by 2045: A High-Risk Amendment**
The German government plans to amend the constitution to include the goal of climate neutrality by 2045. This move has sparked debate among experts, with some arguing that it will have significant consequences, while others claim it will have little impact. The amendment would create a special fund of up to 500 billion euros for additional investments in infrastructure and climate protection. Critics argue that this goal is unrealistic and will lead to a deindustrialization of Germany, while proponents claim that it will drive innovation and create new markets. The cost of achieving climate neutrality by 2045 is estimated to be over 4 trillion euros, which is almost as much as the value of all goods and services produced in Germany in a year. The faster Germany aims to become climate neutral, the more expensive it will be. The Deutsche Akademie der Technikwissenschaften estimates that the additional cost of achieving climate neutrality by 2045 instead of 2050 would be 1 billion euros. The amendment has been met with skepticism by experts, who argue that it will have significant consequences for the economy and industry.

**Trump's Potential Third Term: A Constitutional Amendment in the Works?**
Supporters of US President Donald Trump are actively discussing the possibility of changing the US Constitution to allow him to run for a third term in 2028. Currently, the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, adopted in 1951, limits a president to two terms. However, this may change soon. Republican congressman Andy Ogles has proposed a resolution to amend the 22nd Amendment, saying 'it's crucial to give President Trump the resources he needs to fix the catastrophic course set by President Biden's administration.' Some Democrats have opposed the initiative, with Representative Stephen Cohen saying 'two terms are enough to plunge any country into chaos.' However, with Democrats in the minority in the US Congress, the decision ultimately rests with Republicans, who are determined to 'extend' Trump's term. To repeal the 22nd Amendment, a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives (290 members) and the Senate (67 members) is required, followed by ratification by at least 38 states. The article also mentions that Trump's potential third term has drawn comparisons to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was granted the right to serve as president until 2036 through a constitutional amendment. The article also speculates that a similar process could be used in the US, with suggestions that singer Katy Perry could be involved in the effort to 'legitimize' Trump's third term. Perry is set to join a female-only space mission in 2025, which could be seen as a parallel to Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space, who proposed a similar constitutional amendment in Russia.

**Morena to Propose Amendment to Prohibit Nepotism in 2027 Election**
Alfonso Ramírez Cuéllar, vicecoordinador of Morena in the Chamber of Deputies, plans to propose to his party to support the original initiative of President Claudia Sheinbaum to prohibit nepotism in the 2027 election, instead of 2030 as previously approved by the Senate. He stated, 'I hope we have the votes to modify it, because that's very important, that we have the votes to modify it, and I'm going to propose that we support Dr. Claudia, with what she said today, that it be the 27th.' Ricardo Monreal, coordinator of the Guinda bench, expressed support for the prohibition of nepotism in the 2027 election, saying, 'We'll see what the Commission decides, the United Commissions, but I'm in favor of the reform as it was. If it were 2027, I don't have any problem with it being that way, but the Commissions will dictate.' However, he stated that his bench will approve the reform with the modification next week, unless the United Commissions of Constitutional Matters and Electoral Reform modify it.
