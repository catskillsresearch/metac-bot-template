**Chile Aims to Accelerate Decarbonization by 2035, but Industry Actors Raise Concerns**
Chile's President Gabriel Boric announced a new project to accelerate the country's decarbonization process, aiming to reach a carbon-free energy matrix by 2035, five years ahead of the original target of 2040. The initiative seeks to facilitate investments in clean energy projects and close coal-fired power plants. However, industry actors have expressed doubts and called for more details. Camilo Charme, director of Generadoras de Chile, stated that the closure of coal-fired power plants 'cannot be done solely by political will or slogans.' Juan Francisco Galli, director of Pivotes, described the announcement as 'generic and unambitious.' Javier Naranjo, former Minister of Environment, emphasized the need for technical studies to support the project's viability. 'We must analyze with great consciousness and responsibility the technical, material, and operational conditions required,' Charme said. 'This is not a mere slogan, but a serious commitment to the country's energy transition.'

**Haryana asks NCRTC to ensure RRTS alignment has provision for future metro rail**
The Haryana government has directed the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) to plan the alignment and signalling system of the Sarai Kale Khan-Gurugram-Behrore Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor to accommodate future metro rail operations. The state government also asked NCRTC to build the RRTS depot on the SNB corridor at the terminal station instead of midway at Dharuhera. According to the revised detailed project report, construction for the 102km corridor is expected to begin in August 2026, with completion targeted for November 2031. The project cost is pegged at ₹35,000 crore, to be jointly borne by the government of India and the state governments of Haryana and Rajasthan. NCRTC spokesperson Puneet Vats said that metro trains are already being run in the Meerut RRTS system in densely populated areas, and the same can be done in the SNB and Karnal projects depending on feasibility, 'This is for the first time that metro trains are being run in an RRTS corridor as there is no requirement for a separate track. Metro stations are at short distances and in densely populated corridors it is feasible to operationalise metro trains on same RRTS track,' he said.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Taiwan's 'Super Giant Egg' Project: A Challenge to Lu Shi-yuan's Determination**
Taipei Mayor Lu Shi-yuan has announced that the 'super giant egg' project in Taichung will be completed by 2030, with a target of breaking ground within a year. The project has been carefully planned, with the site chosen and the budget secured through a BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) model, with the city government not investing any funds. The project's timeline spans across the 2028 presidential election, leaving room for speculation. If the project is completed successfully, the next president will be the guest of honor at the opening ceremony. According to the KMT's script, if Lu Shi-yuan gives birth to the project and the next president cuts the ribbon, it will be a 'perfect giant egg.' However, DPP lawmakers have already begun to 'attack the egg,' criticizing and questioning the project's feasibility. DPP Legislator Tsai Chi-chang, who is also the chairman of the Chinese Professional Baseball League, is optimistic about the project's success, but also warns against it becoming a 'mosquito house.' The Taipei Dome's delayed completion serves as a cautionary tale, with the project taking 11 years to finish, longer than initially planned. Lu Shi-yuan said, 'I have the determination to make the Taichung giant egg a reality. Politicians should help with the construction, not opposing it in the front and then trying to benefit from it in the back.' As the blue and green camps are still entangled in party struggles and recall efforts, the 'swallow' has already begun to incubate the super giant egg, and the fate of the egg remains to be seen, affecting not only the city's landscape but also Lu Shi-yuan and the project itself.

**Couple Must Sell Home for New Land Connection**
The couple Turid and Arvid Jespersen, who have lived in their house on Nøtterøy since 1969, must sell their home to make way for a new land connection between Tønsberg and Nøtterøy. The house will be demolished, and a new tunnel and bridge will be built. The couple has received a price for their house, but they do not want to disclose it. The new land connection, part of the Bypakke Tønsberg-regionen project, has been a contentious issue in Vestfold for over 40 years. The project includes a new 6-kilometer road, a 1.9-kilometer tunnel, and a new bridge. The estimated cost of the project is around 7.2 billion kroner, which will be financed by around 5.1 billion kroner in tolls over 15 years. The project is expected to start in 2029 and be completed by 2032. The couple is sad to leave their home, but they understand the need for the new connection. 'It's hard to let go of the house, but we have to make way for the new road,' said Turid Jespersen. 'We've lived here for 56 years, and it's been a great life, but now it's time to move on.'

**The low-frequency cosmic microwave background - Nature Astronomy**
David Zegeye and colleagues propose using the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) to measure spectral distortions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which contain imprints of primordial density structure. They demonstrate that the SKA and the upcoming CMB space mission LiteBIRD will provide highly complementary measurements, with their most realistic setup forecast to improve current constraints of local primordial non-Gaussianity by a factor of ~30. According to the authors, 'The SKA's future effectiveness as a probe of primordial non-Gaussianity is demonstrated, and its potential to provide highly precise measurements of the CMB's spectral distortion is shown.'

**First space image using world-leading telescope 'beyond what we hoped'**
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, being built in Western Australia, has captured its first image using 1,000 antennas, showing 85 of the brightest galaxies in the region. According to SKA-Low lead commissioning scientist George Heald, the current image quality is 'beyond what we hoped for.' The telescope is expected to be fully operational by the end of the decade and will be used to test Einstein's theory of general relativity, explore the first billion years after the universe's dark ages, and search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Dr Heald said, 'We can look back through time and see how the universe has shaped around us. What we can do is find the impact of those first stars and galaxies on the universe and beyond that we can look at the evolution of galaxies throughout time, over the course of the history of the universe.' The telescope will span more than 74 kilometres when finished in about 2030 and will be the world's largest low-frequency radio telescope.

**Less than 1% of the world's biggest radio telescope is complete - but its first image reveals a sky dotted with ancient galaxies**
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory's SKA-Low telescope, currently under construction in Western Australia, has captured its first image of the sky using 1,024 of its planned 131,072 radio antennas. The image shows a patch of the sky approximately 25 square degrees in area, dotted with ancient galaxies billions of light-years from Earth. These galaxies are so bright because each contains a supermassive black hole, emitting energy in X-rays and radio waves that can be detected by SKA-Low. The telescope's first image is a significant milestone, confirming that the complex systems for transmitting and processing data from the antennas are working properly. As the telescope grows, it will be able to detect faint signals from the first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang, and provide new insights into cosmic magnetism, interstellar gas, and dark matter and dark energy. By the end of 2026, the array is planned to expand to 68 working stations, making it the most sensitive low-frequency radio telescope on Earth.

**Thirty years of the Square Kilometre Array: here’s what the world’s largest radio telescope project has achieved so far – Physics World**
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory, a joint project between South Africa and Australia, has achieved 'first light' and produced its first-ever images. The SKA will be the largest and most sensitive radio telescope in the world, with 197 dishes and 131,072 antennas. The telescope will survey the cosmos, focusing on low-frequencies (SKA-Low) and middle-range frequencies (SKA-Mid). The SKA will shed light on some of the most intractable problems in astronomy, such as how galaxies form, the nature of dark matter, and whether life exists on other planets. The SKA has several precursors, including MeerKAT, HERA, MWA, and ASKAP, which have been trialling new technologies and shaping the instrument's trajectory. These precursors have made significant discoveries, including the detection of primordial hydrogen signals, radio transients, and fast radio bursts. However, the increasing number of satellites in space is a problem for the precursors and the SKA, as they are 'photobombing' astronomy observatories and affecting observations across the electromagnetic spectrum.
