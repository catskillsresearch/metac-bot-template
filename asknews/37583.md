In June 2025, rent contracts signed in June 2023 will experience their second and final annual increase of 80.65%, 15 percentage points less than the 95.24% increase in May, according to the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA). Additionally, contracts signed between October 17 and December 29, 2023, will be adjusted semi-annually based on the Casa Propia coefficient, which is expected to be around 48.44% in June. For example, a two-bedroom apartment in Buenos Aires rented for $334,888 in December 2023 would increase to $1,298,908 by June 2025. Meanwhile, contracts signed after December 29, 2023, with quarterly or bi-quarterly adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index (IPC), will see an increase of 9.58% in June 2025, calculated with the last IPC index published by INDEC in April 2025.

**High-Priced Rentals on the Rise in Seoul Metropolitan Area**
The Seoul metropolitan area is experiencing a rapid increase in high-priced rentals, with the proportion of rent transactions exceeding 60% of the total housing transactions. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's 'April Housing Statistics', the proportion of rent transactions in the country reached 60.4% this year. In particular, the Seoul metropolitan area showed a high proportion of rent transactions, with 63.6% in Seoul and 59.3% in the metropolitan area. The proportion of apartment rent transactions also increased from 43.4% last year to 44.5% this year. High-priced rent transactions of over 500 million KRW are also on the rise, with 366 transactions in Seoul from January to May this year. For example, a 84㎡ apartment in the '래미안 원베일리' complex in Seocho-gu, Seoul, was rented for 600 million KRW per month with a deposit of 8 billion KRW in May. Additionally, a 84㎡ apartment in the '서울숲트리마제' complex in Jongno-gu, Seoul, was rented for 1.1 billion KRW per month with a deposit of 1 billion KRW in May. Industry insiders predict that if interest rates are lowered rapidly after the election, the trend of renting out apartments for high prices will continue to worsen. As a result, people may increasingly turn to renting out apartments as a form of investment, rather than saving in bank deposits.

**Rent Increases in May 2025: What You Need to Know**
Rent increases are expected in May 2025, according to the adjustment index used in contracts. The increases will vary depending on the type of contract. For those who signed contracts in May 2023 under the old law, the second and final annual adjustment will be 95.24% interannual, which is lower than the 116.85% applied in April. This is the first time in three years that the adjustment by this index is below 100%. For example, a rent of $400,000 will increase to $780,952, and a rent of $600,000 will increase to $1,171,440. The adjustment index is published daily, so the exact increase depends on the date of the contract within the month. Additionally, contracts signed between October and December 2023 will have a semi-annual adjustment of 56.7%, and contracts signed after the derogation of the old law will have a quarterly or semi-annual adjustment tied to the Consumer Price Index (IPC). For example, a rent of $500,000 will increase to $557,525, and a rent of $800,000 will increase to $892,040.

**Rent Increases in May: Experts Predict Significant Hikes**
According to experts from the Colegio Profesional Inmobiliario (CPI) and the Foro Profesional Inmobiliario (FPI), the upcoming rent increases in May will be as follows: 95% for those with annual updates, 21.7% for those with semi-annual updates, 12.1% for those with quarterly updates, and 8.3% for those with monthly updates. Despite the significant increase, 'the prices of rental housing are decreasing in real terms', as stated by the CPI. This is due to the fact that the rent increases are below the inflation rate, with an average decrease of 36.3% from January 2024 to February 2025. 'In some contracts, we can already see decreases in nominal values of locative values. We observe counter-offers from tenants, which are increasingly accepted by landlords', as stated in the March 2025 report.

**Buying a Home in Chicago May Cost More in Certain Months, According to Zillow**
According to Zillow, homebuyers in Chicago may face higher prices if they purchase a property in certain months. In a competitive market with low inventory, sellers can gain up to $10,000 more than the listed price, as reported by Zillow. In the last two weeks of May, sellers received an average of $5,600 more than the initial listed price, which is a 1.6% increase. Zillow notes that sellers generally earn a higher profit if they list their property between March 15 and July 31, but many factors affect the opportunity premium. Despite this, home prices in Chicago continue to rise. In the four weeks ending March 30, the typical monthly payment for a US homebuyer reached a historic high for the second consecutive week, reaching $2,802. In Chicago, property sales decreased by 3.1% in February 2025 compared to the previous month, but the median home price increased by 9.1% to $360,000, up from $330,000 in February 2024.

The strongest year-over-year asking rent growth was seen in Kansas City, Chicago, and Pittsburgh. Sun Belt markets are facing challenges due to oversupply, leading to significant rent declines.

**Chicago Multifamily Rents Climb Amid 'Broken' Supply Pipeline**
Chicago's multifamily rents have increased in the fourth quarter, with Class-A downtown apartment buildings seeing a 2.6% rise in net monthly rent to $3.60 per SF. The construction pipeline is severely lacking, with only 1,200 Class-A units under construction set to deliver in the next three years. Experts predict that the trend of rising rents will continue due to consistent demand and minimal supply. Aaron Galvin, founder of Luxury Living, stated, 'The goal is that the capital markets start to see Chicago as a viable investment again and we start to have investment back into Chicago and are able to deliver brand-new luxury apartments in the way that we have, starting probably in 2027.' However, the high cost of capital is restricting developers' ability to start new projects, with Integra Senior Managing Director Ron DeVries saying, 'There's a pause in the market with the cost of capital and the ability to attract equity. So if you own buildings right now, it's all great news, right? You're trying to build a building, that's not great news. Our pipeline is broken.'
