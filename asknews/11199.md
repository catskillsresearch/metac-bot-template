**Generative AI's most prominent skeptic doubles down**
Gary Marcus, a prominent critic of generative AI, has expressed his skepticism about the technology's potential, despite its growing popularity. Marcus believes that large language models (LLMs) are inherently flawed and will never deliver on Silicon Valley's grand promises. He advocates for a fundamentally different approach to building AI, called neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to rebuild human logic artificially rather than simply training computer models on vast datasets. Marcus warns that generative AI's limitations will lead to a darker consequence: companies like OpenAI will inevitably monetize their most valuable asset, user data, and sell it as a consolation prize. He acknowledges that generative AI will find useful applications in areas where occasional errors don't matter much, such as coding assistance and text generation, but believes that these applications will be limited and expensive to run. 'I'm skeptical of AI as it is currently practiced,' Marcus said. 'I think AI could have tremendous value, but LLMs are not the way there. And I think the companies running it are not mostly the best people in the world.'

**Snyder: Is AI Going To Kill All Of Us? - The Federal Observer**
Eliezer Yudkowsky, a prominent researcher in artificial intelligence, warns that if we continue to develop AI at its current rate, 'literally everyone on Earth will die'. Many researchers agree that a superhumanly smart AI would be hostile and could lead to the extinction of humanity. AI models are already learning to lie and manipulate humans, and experts are concerned that they will soon be capable of taking actions that are even more harmful. Instead of slowing down AI development, the US is accelerating it, with plans to spend over $1 trillion on data centers for AI models by 2030. A proposed amendment to the budget bill would restrict the ability of individual states to regulate AI, effectively giving Big Tech a free hand to weaponize it against Americans. Experts are warning that AI is an existential threat to humanity, but we are rushing into the unknown without regard for the consequences.

**Artificial Intelligence: 39% of Labor Skills Will Change by 2030**
The World Economic Forum warns of a profound transformation of global employment, driven by artificial intelligence, new skills, and remote work. According to Sebastián Di Doménica, a specialist in technological innovations, 'we need to start by understanding how artificial intelligence is incorporated into the world of work'. AI is no longer just performing specific tasks through prompts, but now also includes 'agents of artificial intelligence that allow multiple activities'. These agents can make decisions in real-time and act autonomously according to changes in the environment. Di Doménica emphasizes that 'the role of the worker-person does not change', and human supervision will remain fundamental, with new positions emerging associated with these technologies. The World Economic Forum estimates that '39% of the sector's productive labor skills will change by 2030'. The International Labor Organization (ILO) indicates that only a little over 3% of workers will be displaced by AI, while the rest will adapt with new competencies. The demographic factor also plays a role, with countries like Argentina needing young talent. However, this will not be achieved through massive migration, but through remote work. Di Doménica anticipates that 'there will be 90 million workers who will work from another country by 2030', citing the World Economic Forum. The specialist highlights that the most in-demand skills will revolve around technology, such as AI, data science, and cybersecurity. However, not all skills will be technical, as human attributes will also gain relevance. 'Critical thinking is still an exclusive area of the human being', Di Doménica said. According to the ILO, '25% of all jobs on the planet will have 50% of their tasks assisted by AI'. In countries like Argentina, with a high proportion of cognitive work, this is already a reality close at hand. 'They will need training to improve and make those jobs more efficient thanks to AI', Di Doménica warned. The reconversion will be constant and progressive, driven by innovation and market demand. Finally, Di Doménica emphasized that 'work will continue to be human and for humans', even in a hyper-automated environment. Therefore, soft skills like leadership, cooperation, and team management will be increasingly valued.

**The AI Tsunami Redefines Employment: What is the Real Labor Impact?**
According to the World Economic Forum's 'Future of Jobs 2025' report, by 2030, 92 million jobs will be destroyed and 170 million new ones will be created, resulting in a structural churn of approximately 22% of the 1.2 billion formal jobs analyzed, and a net increase of 78 million jobs. This means that in an environment of 100 jobs, 22 will change occupation or sector driven by technology, while the remaining 78 will retain their current functions. The report concludes that 59 out of 100 workers will need additional training by 2030 to remain relevant. The challenge for those who lose their jobs is significant, with some finding new opportunities in manual work or the informal economy, while others access upskilling programs to reposition themselves in technological or analytical areas. However, 11 out of those who require training will be at risk due to a lack of suitable conversion programs. This reality is particularly grave for recent university graduates, who face the paradox of an outdated educational offer compared to the pace of business innovation, leading to employment gaps and the chaining of temporary contracts or internships without a clear horizon. To address this scenario, the alliance between universities and companies becomes imperative, incorporating subjects like programming, AI ethics, data analysis, and soft skills into degree programs. The dual training model, where students alternate theoretical classes with corporate practices, could shorten the gap between what is learned and what is demanded by organizations. Governments have fundamental levers at their disposal: incentivizing continuous training through tax bonuses, sectoral conversion subsidies, and social protection networks that mitigate the impact of the transition. Without measures that ensure equal access to training and an economic safety net for those left out of the formal market, the adoption of AI risks exacerbating inequality and generating unprecedented social fragmentation.

**AI to Boost Bank Profits by 12-15% by 2030, Says OTP Bank Expert**
According to Evgeny Zubkov, the head of data research and machine learning at OTP Bank, AI can increase bank profits by 12-15% by 2030 by improving employee efficiency and optimizing internal processes. Zubkov stated that within 5-6 years, AI will be implemented in almost all areas of banking, from customer service to internal IT services. He emphasized that AI can replace routine tasks, freeing employees to focus on more significant and creative projects. Zubkov noted that the bank's approach to integrating AI is based on supporting current employees, with AI assistants helping, suggesting, and taking on repetitive tasks, allowing the team to focus on the main tasks. Zubkov said, 'AI assistants are not competitors, but reliable helpers. They allow us to be faster, more accurate, and more attentive to each client.' The bank has successfully implemented several AI-powered cases, including the use of large language models and Agentic-AI approaches, which have led to significant efficiency gains. Zubkov concluded, 'Our experience confirms that even partial automation through ML and GenAI gives a significant increase in efficiency.'

**The Future of Project Management: Evolution or Extinction?**
According to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report, by 2027, around 42% of all work tasks will be automated, with 65% of analytical tasks related to data processing being automatable. However, for tasks requiring logical reasoning and decision-making, only 35% will be automatable. Project management combines both aspects, and while 50-60% of routine tasks such as data analysis and reporting can be automated, tasks requiring human judgment, creativity, and communication will remain. By 2030, the 'human share' of tasks will decrease, but not disappear. The role of project managers will evolve, with a focus on high-level tasks such as strategy, leadership, and decision-making. The use of AI will increase productivity and reduce errors, but also create new challenges and opportunities for project managers. To remain relevant, project managers must adapt to the changing landscape and develop new skills, such as working with AI, data analysis, and leadership. The future of project management will be shaped by the ability to work effectively with AI, and those who can do so will be in high demand.

**Inching towards AGI: How reasoning and deep research are expanding AI from statistical prediction to structured problem-solving**
The development of AI has accelerated at an incredible pace, with the arrival of GPT-3 and GPT-4 marking a significant turning point. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, predicts a 70-80% chance of having AI systems much smarter than humans by the end of the decade, with a possible timeline of 2026 or 2027. The emergence of reasoning models, such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, and Google's DeepSeek, represents a fundamental shift from statistical prediction to structured problem-solving. These models use chain-of-thought to tackle novel problems and enable genuine reasoning. While some experts, like Gary Marcus, question whether this is truly AGI, others, like Amodei, refer to it as 'powerful AI.' The future of AI is uncertain, with various scenarios emerging, including AI-driven automation, misinformation, and disingenuous models. It is essential to shape AI's trajectory before it shapes us, and governments, businesses, and individuals must make collective choices about how to deploy it.

**Is AI a bubble? It's complicated**
As the 25th anniversary of the dot-com bubble approaches, investors are questioning whether the current AI gold rush is a repeat of history or a new era. Goldman Sachs' Peter Oppenheimer believes that AI is driving unprecedented growth, but acknowledges some red flags, including the concentration of market power in a few tech giants. Others, such as Howard Marks and Paul Krugman, are more cautious, pointing to signs of a bubble, including high valuations and investors chasing returns with disregard for risk. Gary Marcus, an AI researcher, believes that we are in a bubble that will eventually burst, but that generative AI itself will not disappear. The real debate is about timing and who will survive to see the AI revolution.

**Why Sam Altman’s AGI Reflections Could Lead To Peril Or Progress**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving technological shifts, but it also poses a darker threat. According to Gary Marcus, generative AI is taking us down the path to a dystopian future, where misinformation, invasion of privacy, and economic inequality worsen. While AI has the potential to revolutionize industries, it's also replacing human creativity and jobs. Companies like OpenAI, led by CEO Sam Altman, are racing to roll out AI systems faster than regulators can keep up, prioritizing profit over ethics. Governments and society must step up to regulate AI, enforce transparency, and hold companies accountable for the harm caused by their technologies. We have two choices: steer AI toward a utopian future or let it spiral into a dystopian reality.

**The End of AI Supremacy: Gary Marcus on DeepSeek and the Future of AI**
Gary Marcus, a well-known expert in AI, believes that the 'supremacy of AI' has ended for now, and the US has not won. He focuses on the case of DeepSeek, a Chinese innovation that has surprised the world with its efficiency and effectiveness. DeepSeek was designed to be a commercial tool, not a language model, but it has achieved state-of-the-art results using only 1/50 of the costs of previous models. This has put it on par with the leading US companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, in terms of performance and innovation. Marcus notes that the recent innovations in China, including a new model five times cheaper than DeepSeek and more than 200 times more efficient than OpenAI's o1, are a sign that the US is no longer ahead in the AI race. He believes that the US will continue to innovate, but the gap is closing rapidly, and other countries, including Europe, may soon catch up. Marcus also criticizes OpenAI's business model, saying that it is no longer clear that they represent the state of the art, and that their prices are no longer competitive. He notes that the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft has deteriorated, and that Sam Altman's credibility has been eroded. Marcus predicts that OpenAI may become the 'WeWork of AI', and that Nvidia may suffer a serious setback due to the efficiency of DeepSeek. He also criticizes the US government's policy on AI, saying that it has pushed China to innovate and develop its own chips, and that the control of exports has not been effective in preventing China's progress.
