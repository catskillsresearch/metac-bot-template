**New DOJ Initiative Expands FCA Use to Enforce Civil Rights Compliance and Target DEI Initiatives**
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched the Civil Rights Fraud Initiative, a new enforcement effort that uses the False Claims Act (FCA) to investigate and prosecute recipients of federal funding who allegedly falsely certify their compliance with federal civil rights laws. The Initiative targets institutions of higher education, research centers, and federal contractors who engage in discriminatory practices, including through diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The DOJ encourages whistleblowers to file qui tam actions, which could lead to an increase in investigations and litigation. Federal-funding recipients should take proactive steps to address potential issues and develop a defense strategy, as the Initiative signals a new era of FCA enforcement.

**The False Claims Act Enters the School Zone**
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a Civil Rights Fraud Initiative, using the False Claims Act (FCA) to investigate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices of recipients of federal funds, including colleges and universities. The initiative, announced on May 19, 2025, will focus on entities that knowingly violate civil rights laws and falsely certify compliance with these laws, particularly through DEI programs that result in racial discrimination. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche explained that the initiative will be co-led by the Civil Division's Fraud Section and the Civil Rights Division, and will enlist other federal agencies, state attorneys general, and local law enforcement to help. The initiative creates heightened FCA risk for clients that participate in government programs and scrutiny of the DEI practices of recipients of federal funds, especially academic institutions. Organizations should review their DEI policies and practices now to ensure they align with federal civil rights requirements and do not give rise to potential liability under the FCA. 'The initiative and the DOJ's new investigation into Harvard demonstrate a willingness to use the FCA in unique contexts as a tool to further the administration's priorities,' said the article. 'All recipients of federal funds and government contractors should evaluate their DEI or DEIA programs now to identify and remediate any areas of potential risk.'

**Trump Administration Announces New Enforcement Efforts Targeted at DEI**
The Trump administration has announced a new enforcement strategy to target Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the private sector. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a Civil Rights Fraud Initiative, which will investigate and pursue claims against federal contractors and universities that knowingly violate federal civil rights laws. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche stated that the initiative will 'aggressively pursue' False Claims Act (FCA) liability for false certifications of compliance with civil rights laws. The initiative will focus on universities, but any entity that receives federal funds and certifies compliance with civil rights laws could be a target. The DOJ has also encouraged private parties to report suspected civil rights violations, and has notified Harvard that it is investigating whether the university fraudulently received grant funding in violation of the FCA. This initiative is likely to result in a sharp increase in FCA investigations and litigation, and presents a substantial risk for federal contractors and universities.

**Harvard Sues Trump Administration Over Revocation of International Student Certification**
Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for revoking its certification to accept international students, citing a 'flagrant violation of the First Amendment' and a 'reprisal against Harvard' for rejecting 'its demands to control the institution, its curriculum, and the ideology of professors and students.' The university argues that the administration's actions are 'illegal', disregard government regulations, and lack 'rational explanation.' Harvard asserts that the certification is 'essential' for international students to remain legally in the country while completing their courses, and the revocation has 'disrupted numerous academic programs, research laboratories, and clinics.' The university also claims to have complied with the administration's requirements in April to maintain its funding and provided information on student visa holders to the government. President Alan Garber wrote, 'For the students and international academics affected by yesterday's action, they know they are vital members of our community. They are our classmates and friends, our colleagues and mentors.' Harvard previously sued the administration in April to recover its frozen federal funding (2.6 billion dollars) due to alleged antisemitic conduct. The administration has threatened to withdraw millions of dollars in federal funding and launched multiple investigations into the university, accusing it of promoting 'discriminatory positive policies' and not allowing 'diversity of ideas.' The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has eliminated the student visa program at Harvard, revoking its certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. As a result, Harvard can no longer enroll international students for the 2025-2026 academic year. Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the decision is due to 'pro-terrorist conduct' in student protests on campus and Harvard's refusal to comply with DHS requests for student behavior records. Noem accused the university of promoting violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on campus. She offered Harvard a 72-hour deadline to provide the requested information, with the opportunity to recover its visa program for the next academic year. The university has demanded the government in response to the threat of withdrawing billions of dollars in federal funding and has strongly opposed the various investigations, denying the allegations of irregularities.

**US Revokes Harvard's Certification Over Alleged Anti-Israel Sentiment and Non-Compliance with Federal Regulations**
The US Department of Homeland Security has revoked the certification of Harvard University's student exchange program, citing the school's failure to comply with federal regulations. As a result, the university will no longer be able to admit new international students and current students will have to transfer to another school or risk losing their legal status. According to the New York Times, there are approximately 6,800 international students at Harvard, making up 27% of the total student body. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Harvard failed to submit required documents and has policies promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) that are not aligned with federal regulations. The department also criticized Harvard's handling of anti-Israel sentiment on campus and its alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Harvard University responded by stating that the Department of Homeland Security's decision to ban international students is 'unlawful' and that the university is committed to maintaining its ability to accept students from over 140 countries. This is not the first time the Trump administration has taken action against universities with perceived anti-Israel sentiments, having previously revoked the student visas of Palestinian supporters. The US Department of Health and Human Services has also announced that it will withhold an additional $60 million in federal funding from Harvard due to its failure to address anti-Semitism and racial discrimination on campus.

**Trump Gives Harvard 72 Hours to Comply with SEVP Certification Requirements**
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has given Harvard University 72 hours to comply with a series of requirements to reinstate its certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). The requirements include providing videos, images, or audio recordings of protests and 'illegal' and 'violent' activities that have taken place on or off campus in the past five years involving students with J1 and F visas. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, this is 'a clear message to Harvard and all universities that the Trump Administration will enforce the law and eradicate the evils of antisemitism and anti-Americanism in society and on campuses.' Harvard has been accused of allowing 'agitators anti-American and pro-terrorist' to harass and physically attack students, including many Jewish students. The revocation of Harvard's ability to enroll international students is an escalation of the tension between the government and the university, which has been at odds with the Trump Administration over allegations of antisemitism. Harvard is one of several universities that have been threatened with funding cuts due to reports from the 'Federal Working Group to Combat Antisemitism' created by Trump, which accused the university of applying 'positive discrimination' policies and not providing a platform for 'diversity of ideas.'

**Trump Administration Revokes Harvard's Ability to Recruit International Students**
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on May 22 that the Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's ability to recruit international students, effective immediately. This decision means that Harvard can no longer accept international students, and current international students must transfer to another university or risk losing their legal status in the US. DHS Secretary Nom said that Harvard's campus promotes sympathy for the Palestinian militant group Hamas, implements diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies that discriminate against certain racial groups, and creates an unsafe environment that fosters violence, anti-Semitism, and collaboration with the Chinese government. Nom emphasized that the ability to recruit international students is a privilege and a benefit, not a right, and that Harvard has failed to comply with these expectations. Harvard spokesperson Newton said that the Trump administration's actions are illegal and will severely harm the university and the country. Harvard President Faust sent an email to students and faculty, stating that the university has filed a lawsuit and is seeking a temporary restraining order. The lawsuit argues that the revocation of Harvard's SEVP certification is a clear violation of the US Constitution and other federal laws, and will have an immediate and devastating impact on the university and over 7,000 students with valid visas. This move marks a significant escalation in the conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard. Trump had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to recruit international students if the university refused to comply with government demands. DHS had also canceled a $3 million grant to Harvard in April. Harvard is currently facing at least eight investigations from six government agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The university and its research partners have lost or had their federal funding frozen, totaling over $4 billion. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China opposes politicizing education and that the US actions will harm the US's image and international reputation. Chinese state media Xinhua wrote that Harvard's Chinese students have decreased from 1,016 in 2022 to an unknown number. Hong Kong's City University of Hong Kong has announced that it will unconditionally accept Harvard's international undergraduate and graduate students. Taiwan's Ministry of Education has estimated that 52 Taiwanese students will be affected and is considering adding extra seats for students who wish to complete their studies in Taiwan. The ministry has also invited Taiwanese universities that have signed MOUs with Harvard to discuss a dual-degree program to help students complete their studies.

**DOJ Ramps Up Anti-DEI Enforcement**
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced its Civil Rights Fraud Initiative, which will use the civil False Claims Act (FCA) to investigate and pursue claims against federal funding recipients who 'certify compliance with civil rights laws while knowingly engaging in racist preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities, including through diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.' The initiative will be co-led by the Civil Fraud Section and the Civil Rights Division, and will collaborate with other federal agencies, state attorneys general, and local law enforcement. The DOJ 'strongly encourages' whistleblower lawsuits in this area, which could lead to increased scrutiny of internal and external DEI policies and programs. Companies receiving federal funds should take proactive steps to review and reassess their DEI policies and practices to ensure they do not violate federal antidiscrimination laws. 'Cosmetic changes' to DEI policies will not suffice to ameliorate liability from unlawful practices. Potential consequences of FCA lawsuits include diversion of valuable time and resources, settlement costs, and reputational damage.

**Harvard University Takes a Stand Against US Government's Policies on Diversity and Inclusion**
Harvard University has taken a formal stance against the US government's policies on diversity and inclusion, which have been advancing against the entry of international students. The university has filed a lawsuit in the Federal District Court of Massachusetts and has also published a statement on its social media profiles. The US Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), removing the university's authority to sponsor F-1 and J-1 visas for international students for the 2025-26 academic year. This affects around 6,800 international students, who represent 27% of the university's student body. According to Harvard, the revocation 'continues a series of government initiatives to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and submit to the illegal assertion of federal control over our curriculum, faculty, and student body.' The university's president, Alan Garber, has called the decision 'illegal and unjustified.' The revocation of certification is the latest chapter in a dispute that has intensified since January 2025, when Trump returned to the presidency. The confrontation has multiple fronts. In April, the government froze $2.2 billion in funds destined for Harvard after the university rejected federal demands that included changes in governance, hiring practices, and admission policies. The federal subsidies represent approximately 11% of the university's revenue, on a budget of $6.4 billion. The Department of Education has announced investigations into 45 universities for alleged discriminatory practices based on race, while 60 institutions, including Harvard and Yale, have received warnings about possible cuts in funding related to allegations of anti-Semitic harassment. The University of Columbia has already suffered concrete consequences, with the cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal subsidies and contracts, after serving as the epicenter of protests related to the war in Gaza. The revocation of SEVP certification results in immediate operational consequences for Harvard. The impossibility of accepting new international students for the next academic year affects 7,000 visa holders between students and academics, who must transfer or lose their legal status in the US. The blockade compromises dozens of academic programs and research dependent on international presence, as well as the loss of specific investments of millions of dollars in programs to attract global talent. According to the lawsuit, Harvard has had federal certification for international enrollment for over 70 years, developing specific programs for this public. The government's offensive against policies of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) does not limit itself to the academic sector. Since January 2025, various American corporations have retreated from commitments to DEI. In the technology sector, Google, Meta, and Amazon have significantly reduced teams dedicated to diversity initiatives, while in the financial sector, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have moderated rhetoric on diversity goals. The administration has also signaled a review of federal contracts with companies that maintain DEI programs considered 'discriminatory.' In a letter to the university community in April, Garber defended the institution's autonomy: 'No government - regardless of which party is in power - should dictate what private universities can teach, who they can admit and hire, and what areas of study and research they can pursue.' In today's statement, the institution informs: 'In addition to the lawsuit already filed, it plans to request a preliminary injunction to suspend immediately the effects of the revocation, demonstrating urgency in protecting the rights of its international students and academics. The judicial dispute may redefine the relationship between institutions of higher education and the federal government in the United States. Garber warned of broader risks: 'The government's withdrawal from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals, but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.' The federal funds are destined for research on treatments for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and diabetes, as well as advances in artificial intelligence and quantum science. The resources also benefit affiliated hospitals whose doctors teach at Harvard Medical School. Parallel to the conflict, other universities are watching the developments closely, evaluating their own strategies to deal with federal demands without compromising academic autonomy.

**DOJ Launches Civil Rights Fraud Initiative to Investigate DEI Initiatives of Federal Fund Recipients and Contractors**
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a Civil Rights Fraud Initiative to investigate federal fund recipients and contractors that have certified compliance with federal non-discrimination laws while engaging in discriminatory practices, including through diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. According to a memo, the DOJ will use the False Claims Act (FCA) to investigate these organizations and will establish partnerships with state attorneys general and local law enforcement to share information and coordinate enforcement actions. The DOJ's actions stem from Executive Order 14173, which revoked Executive Order 11246 and added a new certification requirement for federal contractors. The new certification requires that contractors certify they do not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate federal non-discrimination laws. The DOJ has already launched an investigation into Harvard's admission policies, and further investigations are likely to follow. Federal contractors that underwent an OFCCP audit in the past several years could be particularly vulnerable. 'The days of using federal funds to further discrimination are over,' said the DOJ in a press release, strongly encouraging anyone with knowledge of discrimination by federal funding recipients to consider filing a qui tam action under the FCA.

**Over 50 US universities investigated for 'racial discrimination'**
The US Department of Education announced today that it will investigate several universities in the US, a month after warning schools and colleges in the country that they could lose federal funding due to 'race-based preferences' in student admissions, scholarships, and other aspects of student life. 'Students should be evaluated based on their merit and performance, and not based on the color of their skin,' said Education Secretary Linda McMahon in a statement. 'We will not back down on this commitment,' McMahon emphasized in the same note. The majority of the investigations focus on the partnerships of colleges with the PhD Project, a non-profit organization that helps students from underrepresented groups to form in Management. The US Department of Education representatives accused the PhD Project of limiting student eligibility based on 'racial discrimination' and claimed that colleges that establish partnerships with the organization are 'engaging in racial exclusion practices in their graduate programs.' Among the 45 colleges being investigated for links to the PhD Project are public universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State, and Rutgers, and prestigious private institutions like Yale, Cornell, Duke, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The Associated Press news agency tried to contact the PhD Project, but did not receive an immediate response. According to the Department of Education, six other colleges are being investigated for granting 'unacceptable scholarships based on race,' and another is accused of administering a program that segregates students based on their ethnicity. These seven are: Grand Valley State University, Ithaca College, New England College of Optometry, University of Alabama, University of Minnesota, University of South Florida, and University of Tulsa School of Medicine. The department did not clarify which of the seven institutions is being investigated for allegations of racial segregation. This decision reinforces a 2023 Supreme Court decision that prohibited institutions of higher education from using ethnicity as a criterion for admission. Despite the Supreme Court's decision focusing on Harvard University and the University of North Carolina's admission policies, the Department of Education announced that it will interpret the decision to prohibit policies based on racial discrimination in any aspect related to education, from elementary to higher education. Craig Trainor, interim assistant secretary for civil rights, stated that the schools' and colleges' diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts have 'introduced racial stereotypes and explicit racial consciousness into the formation, programming, and daily discipline.' The Department of Education's investigations are being contested in federal courts by the two largest teachers' unions in the US, which accuse the department of being too vague and violating the educators' freedom of expression rights.

**Education Department investigating dozens of universities after DEI warning letter**
The Education Department is investigating over 50 colleges and universities for allegedly using 'racial preferences' in academics or scholarships. The investigation comes after a warning letter sent by the department on February 14, which told universities to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The department claims that 45 schools are partnering with an organization that limits eligibility based on race, while seven schools are under investigation for 'alleged impermissible race-based scholarships and race-based segregation.' The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights is accusing the institutions of violating Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race in education. The department stated, 'The law is clear: treating students differently on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent.'

**U.S. Department of Education Releases Guidance on DEI Programs in Schools Receiving Federal Funds**
The U.S. Department of Education has released guidance on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs in schools receiving federal funds. The guidance, issued in a Dear Colleague Letter on February 14, 2025, states that colleges, universities, and K-12 schools have engaged in discrimination by using race as a factor in admissions, financial aid, hiring, training, and other programming. The Letter relies on the Supreme Court's decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which applied strict scrutiny to race-based admission practices. The Department advises educational institutions to remove illegal DEI/DEIA practices to avoid potential loss of federal funding. The Department will begin assessing compliance on February 28, 2025. School districts across Ohio will need to review their DEI/DEIA policies to ensure compliance with the Letter and the Civil Rights Law.

**Dear Colleague: Watch Out**
The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has issued a 'Dear Colleague' letter warning American educational institutions that they may be engaging in 'pervasive and repugnant race-based preferences and other forms of racial discrimination.' The letter, dated February 14, 2025, specifically targets the use of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as a justification for 'smuggling racial stereotypes and explicit race-consciousness into everyday training, programming, and discipline.' OCR cites the Supreme Court's 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, stating that even neutral programs can be unlawful if motivated by racial considerations. The letter advises institutions to assess compliance and warns that federal funding is at risk. While the letter does not have the force of law, it signals OCR's intent to take measures to assess compliance, beginning no later than February 28, 2025. Educational institutions are advised to consider how the interpretations in the letter would apply to their schools and to consult with legal counsel to determine the best course of action.

**President Trump Issues Executive Order Targeting DEI Programs, And Ensuing Legal Developments**
President Trump issued Executive Order 14173 on January 21, 2025, targeting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs. The Order instructs federal agencies to terminate discriminatory and illegal preferences, and directs the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to cease promoting diversity and enforcing affirmative action initiatives. Federal contractors are required to certify that they do not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate federal anti-discrimination laws. The Order also directs the Attorney General to submit a report with recommendations for enforcing federal civil rights laws and taking measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences. A group of plaintiffs, including university diversity officers and the City of Baltimore, filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Order. State Attorneys General have also taken action, with some sending letters to financial institutions challenging their DEI and ESG programs. The US Attorney General has issued a memorandum directing the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division to investigate illegal DEI and DEIA preferences in the private sector and educational institutions. Employers should evaluate their current DEI-related policies and programs to ensure compliance with existing anti-discrimination statutes. 'The Order's impact on pending compliance reviews, complaint investigations or other enforcement activities by the OFCCP is unknown,' according to the article. 'However, federal contractors should expect to see language implementing this directive in new procurements and modifications to existing contracts.'

**Attorney General instructs DOJ to investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI programs**
Attorney General Pam Bondi has instructed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs in the private sector and educational institutions that receive federal funds. The DEIA Memorandum builds upon President Trump's Executive Order 14173, which aims to end illegal discrimination and restore merit-based opportunity. The Memorandum introduces a new enforcement tool - criminal prosecutions of private sector entities allegedly engaged in illegal DEIA activities. DOJ is required to submit a report to the Associate Attorney General by March 1, 2025, containing recommendations for enforcing federal civil rights laws and taking other measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEIA. The report must include proposals for criminal investigations and up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private entities. The Memorandum also directs DOJ to work with the Department of Education to provide guidance to educational institutions that receive federal funds, consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll. (2023).

**Feds Warn Phil Murphy to End Illegal School DEI Programs or Lose Federal Funding in 10 Days**
The U.S. Department of Education has sent a warning letter to New Jersey and other states with Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs in their public school systems, stating that race-based discrimination in schools receiving federal funding is illegal. The letter, signed by Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor, warns that using race in admissions, hiring, scholarships, and student programming violates federal law. Trainor wrote, 'Discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin is illegal and morally reprehensible.' The department will assess compliance with anti-discrimination statutes within 14 days and may revoke federal funding for schools that continue to use race-based decision-making. The letter also encourages individuals who believe they have been discriminated against to file complaints with the Office for Civil Rights. According to the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, race-based considerations must meet the highest level of judicial scrutiny.

**New DOJ Memos Target Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Practices Under Attorney General Pamela Bondi**
Attorney General Pamela Bondi has issued two memos directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to focus on ending 'illegal discrimination and preferences' related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The memos, issued in the first 24 hours of Bondi's tenure, aim to eliminate DEI and DEIA preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities deemed illegal under the memos. Private sector companies and educational institutions that receive federal funds are the focus of the first memo, which directs the DOJ to investigate, eliminate, and penalize DEI and DEIA programs and initiatives. The second memo directs the DOJ's Civil Rights Division to submit recommendations and strategies to end illegal discrimination and preferences, and to prepare a report addressing entities with 'the most egregious and discriminatory DEI and DEIA practitioners.' According to Bondi, 'there is no place in [DOJ] materials for race- or sex-based preferences, diversity hiring targets, or preferential treatment based on DEI- or DEIA-related criteria.' The DOJ plans to work with the Department of Education to eliminate DEI programs at institutions of higher education that receive federal funds, citing the Students for Fair Admissions. v. Harvard (2023) Supreme Court case, which ended affirmative action in admissions.

**DOJ Takes Aim At Private Sector DEI And DEIA Policies**
The Department of Justice ('DOJ') has issued a memorandum directing the DOJ to initiate broad investigations of private companies for civil rights violations related to diversity, equity, and inclusion ('DEI') and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility ('DEIA') practices. The memorandum, issued by Attorney General Pam Bondi on February 5, 2025, aims to eliminate all DEI and DEIA policies and programs within the private sector, as per President Trump's January 21, 2025 Executive Order 14173. The DOJ will submit a report by March 1, 2025, which must include proposals for criminal investigations and civil compliance investigations of entities that meet certain criteria. The report will also contain recommendations for enforcing federal civil-rights laws and taking measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences. According to the memorandum, the DOJ will target DEI and DEIA practices that discriminate, exclude, or divide individuals based on race or sex, but will not target educational, cultural, or historical observances that celebrate diversity and promote awareness without engaging in exclusion or discrimination.

**Bondi: DOJ Will Investigate Private-Sector DEI**
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has sent a memo to Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys outlining plans to investigate and penalize private enterprises found in violation of federal civil rights laws related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEI and DEIA). The memo, titled 'Ending Illegal DEI and DEIA Discrimination and Preferences,' is a companion to President Donald Trump's Executive Order 14173, which repealed affirmative action requirements for federal contractors. Bondi warns that universities receiving federal funds will be held accountable for compliance with the precedent set by the Supreme Court's 2023 Students for Fair Admission ruling. The DOJ will compile a report by March 1 with recommendations to 'encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences,' and will use both criminal and civil enforcement mechanisms to deter DEI and DEIA programs that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences. 'Programs, initiatives, or policies that discriminate, exclude, or divide individuals based on race or sex' will be targeted, but 'educational, cultural, or historical observances' will be allowed as long as they are not exclusionary or discriminatory, according to Bondi. 'It is clear that the DOJ will make use of both criminal and civil enforcement mechanisms to deter DEI and DEIA programs that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences,' Bondi said. 'We will not tolerate programs that discriminate, exclude, or divide individuals based on race or sex.'
