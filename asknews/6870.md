**ILO revises downward job creation estimates in 2025**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) has revised its estimates of job creation in 2025 downward, reflecting a decrease in global economic prospects. The ILO estimates that nearly 84 million jobs in 71 countries are directly or indirectly linked to American consumer demand, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for the majority (56 million). However, Canada and Mexico have the highest proportion of exposed jobs (17.1%). ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo stated, 'We know that the global economy is growing at a slower pace than expected. Our report now tells us that if geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions continue, and if we do not address the fundamental issues reshaping the world of work, they will certainly have negative repercussions on labor markets worldwide.' The report highlights concerning trends in income distribution, with the share of labor income decreasing globally from 53.0% in 2014 to 52.4% in 2024. Africa and the Americas have experienced the largest declines. If this share had remained unchanged, global labor income would have been $1,000 billion higher in 2024, equivalent to $290 more per worker in terms of constant purchasing power. The erosion of the global share of labor income is putting pressure on inequalities and highlighting a disconnect between economic growth and worker remuneration. The report notes a shift towards high-skilled jobs, with women leading this trend. Between 2013 and 2023, the proportion of women in high-skilled jobs increased from 21.2% to 23.2%, while the proportion of men in high-skilled jobs was around 18% in 2023. As education levels continue to rise globally, the labor market remains characterized by significant mismatches between education levels. In 2022, only 47.7% of workers had qualifications matching their job requirements. The proportion of under-educated workers decreased from 37.9% to 33.4% over the past decade, while the proportion of over-educated workers increased from 15.5% to 18.9%. The report also addresses the effects of new technologies on the world of work, finding that nearly one in four workers could see their job transformed by generative AI. A greater proportion of jobs in moderately skilled professions are moderately exposed, but a greater percentage of jobs in highly skilled professions are highly exposed, with existing tasks potentially being automated by AI.

**Jeollanam-do Sees Significant Increase in Birth Rates After Introducing Basic Birth Allowance Policy**
Jeollanam-do, a province in South Korea, has seen a significant increase in birth rates since introducing the 'Basic Birth Allowance' policy, which provides a monthly stipend of 1 million KRW to parents of newborns. According to data from the National Statistical Office, the province's total fertility rate (TFR) reached 1.13 children per woman in the first quarter of 2025, the highest in the country. This is 0.31 children higher than the national average of 0.82 children per woman. The number of births from January to March also increased by 6.5% compared to the same period last year. The province believes that the Basic Birth Allowance policy has contributed to the increase in birth rates. The policy provides a total of 4.32 million KRW to parents of newborns from birth to age 18. In addition to financial support, the province plans to strengthen its integrated support system for pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare, including subsidies for infertility treatments and expanded public postpartum care facilities. According to Kim Myeong-sin, the head of Jeollanam-do's Population and Youth Affairs Bureau, 'The Basic Birth Allowance is not just a simple cash handout, but a message that families and communities are working together to raise children.' Netizens responded to the news with comments such as 'I think it's good that the financial support helps reduce the economic burden of raising children for young couples', and 'I think it's more necessary to have mandatory paid parental leave and reduced working hours'.

**Vietnam drafts first population law to tackle demographic challenges**
Vietnam is drafting its first-ever Population Law to address demographic challenges, including falling fertility rates, regional disparities, and population ageing. The law aims to maintain replacement-level fertility, improve population quality, and adapt to a rapidly ageing population. It prioritizes universal access to pre-marital counselling, prenatal and newborn screening, and stronger efforts to prevent genetic disorders and birth defects. The law also proposes state-purchased health insurance for the elderly and introduces stronger administrative penalties for violations in the population sector. Deputy Director General of the General Office for Population and Family Planning, Dr Pham Vu Hoang, said that Vietnam's population policy now faces a host of challenges, including falling fertility rates, regional disparities, persistent gender imbalance at birth, rapid ageing, slow improvement in population quality and ineffective migration management. Deputy Minister of Health, Associate Professor Dr Nguyen Thi Lien Huong, emphasized the pressing need for this legislative step, noting that the new law is intended to give legal form to the Party's strategic directions on population. She said the goal is to ensure that, by 2045, Vietnam becomes a country with high-quality human resources, a strong labour force, and is a high-income economy, thereby raising the nation's profile on the global stage. 'The draft Population Law is built around three key pillars aimed at addressing Vietnam's evolving demographic landscape,' she said. 'First, it seeks to maintain replacement-level fertility across the country through tailored strategies that reflect the unique characteristics of each region and population group. This approach is designed to prevent demographic imbalances and lessen the impact of population ageing, helping to secure a sustainable workforce in the years ahead.' 'Second, the draft prioritises improving population quality from birth. Proposed measures include universal access to pre-marital counselling, broader prenatal and newborn screening, and stronger efforts to prevent genetic disorders and birth defects. It also calls for better nutrition, mental health support and early childhood development to ensure a healthier, more resilient population from the outset.' 'Third, the law outlines policies to help the country adapt to a rapidly ageing population. These include safeguarding social security and healthcare access for older citizens. One notable proposal is to provide health insurance to elderly people who are currently uninsured, a proactive measure aimed at reducing the future burden on the healthcare and social insurance systems.' 'A landmark shift in the draft law is its departure from the traditional mindset of controlling population growth. Instead, it embraces a vision of population as a development driver. Rather than strictly limiting the number of children per family, the law seeks to promote reasonable fertility based on individual choice and socio-economic conditions. For the first time, couples would be legally empowered to decide freely on the number and timing of their children, a dramatic departure from past rigid controls.' This reflects a respect for personal autonomy and acknowledges the diverse aspirations of modern Vietnamese families. Supporting this shift is a recent policy change by the Party's Central Inspection Commission. From March 20 this year, Party members who have a third child will no longer face disciplinary action, a move hailed by Professor Nguyen Dinh Cu, former Director of the Institute for Population and Social Affairs, as both timely and necessary. He noted that in light of declining fertility rates, particularly in urban areas, the change would help slow the downward trend and create a foundation for future regulatory reforms. To address low fertility in key areas such as industrial zones and large cities, the draft law introduces a notable incentive that gives women with two children priority access to social housing. This policy is designed to both encourage childbearing and support young families in balancing work and parenting responsibilities. In a further show of support for the elderly, the draft proposes state-purchased health insurance for those without coverage, ensuring equitable access to healthcare and improved quality of life in old age. The law also introduces stronger administrative penalties for violations in the population sector, reinforcing legal compliance and public awareness. Vietnam stands at a critical demographic turning point. For the first time, population dynamics are shaping nearly every aspect of national life, from economic growth and healthcare to education, security and political stability. As the country faces major shifts such as ageing, falling fertility, gender imbalances and changing migration patterns, the need for a modern, flexible legal framework has become urgent. A recent Ministry of Justice review affirms that the draft Population Law introduces breakthrough measures absent from current legislation, directly targeting the country's most pressing demographic challenges. Population is no longer just a figure -- it is a strategic asset central to Vietnam's global competitiveness. This law is not merely a policy tool, but a roadmap for unlocking the nation's demographic potential and building a high-income, digitally-driven economy by 2045.

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**Climate Change Threatens Millions of Pregnant Women Worldwide**
A recent study by Climate Central found that millions of pregnant women around the world are at risk due to climate change, which can lead to health complications such as premature birth or fetal growth restriction. The study analyzed daily temperature data from 2020 to 2024 in 940 cities across 247 countries and found that extreme heat days, which are days with temperatures 95% above normal, have increased globally. In most countries, the number of extreme heat days during pregnancy has doubled over the past five years compared to a world without climate change. According to Dr. Christina Dahl, deputy director of science at Climate Central, 'each extreme heat day can increase the risk of severe pregnancy complications.' She added, 'climate change increases extreme heat, and increases the likelihood of unhealthy pregnancies worldwide, especially in areas where access to healthcare is limited.' The study found that the US has seen a 12-day increase in extreme heat days per year, with West Palm Beach, Florida, experiencing the largest increase at 48% between 2020 and 2024. Utah saw the largest increase in extreme heat days, with a 72% increase since 2020, and Hawaii's extreme heat days can be attributed entirely to climate change. Dr. Brigitte Becker, a women's health expert and expert on the effects of climate change on human health, said, 'extreme heat is currently one of the most pressing threats to pregnant women worldwide, pushing more pregnancies into high-risk areas, especially in areas already experiencing limited access to healthcare.' She added, 'reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning is not only good for the planet, but also a valuable step towards protecting pregnant women and newborns around the world.'

**Korea's birth crisis far from over**
South Korea's total fertility rate reached 0.82 in the first quarter of 2025, a 7.4% year-on-year increase, the highest since records began in 1981. Experts are cautiously optimistic, but warn that even if the government's target of a 1.0 fertility rate by 2030 is met, Korea would still be at the bottom globally in terms of fertility. The prolonged low birthrate has eroded the population of people capable of having children, and an increase in fertility rates may not translate into more births due to a smaller base population of parents. According to Statistics Korea, even under the agency's high-fertility projection scenario, the national population will fall to the 30-million range within 45 years. Complacency is not an option, and a fertility rate must rise to two or three children per woman to avoid a shrinking society. 'We must remember that we have merely bought a little more time to prepare for the demographic shock ahead,' said a warning from the article.

**Basque Country Faces Labor Shortage of 17% by 2036**
According to a study by Laboral Kutxa, the Basque Country (Euskadi) will face a labor shortage of 17% by 2036, with 171,000 job openings that cannot be filled. The study, 'Empleo y Transición Demográfica en la CAPV y Navarra: Horizonte 2036', projects that the region will not have enough workers to meet the demand, even in the most optimistic scenarios. The director of the Department of Studies at Laboral Kutxa, Joseba Madariaga, explained that the region's population is aging and the birth rate is low, with an average of 1.3 children per woman. Madariaga stated that 'although migrations contribute to maintaining the population, the combination of low fertility and high longevity is driving a significant demographic aging.' To address this issue, Laboral Kutxa recommends prolonging the working life, attracting and retaining migration, and accelerating professional requalification programs. The study also highlights the importance of adopting proactive policies and collaboration between the public and private sectors to ensure the sustainability of the labor market and the competitiveness of the regional economy.

**Russia Celebrates International Children's Day with Progress in Child Protection and Support for Families**
Russia celebrates International Children's Day on June 1st. The country has made significant progress in protecting children's rights, with the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 and the establishment of the institution of the Ombudsman for Children's Rights in 2009. The government has also implemented various measures to support families with children, including the introduction of the Maternity Capital program in 2007 and the extension of the program until 2030. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed an order establishing the status of multi-child families and defining measures to support them. The number of children in Russia has been declining, with a total of 25.5 million children under the age of 15 as of January 2023. The birth rate in Russia has also decreased, with 1.222 million births in 2024, a 3.4% decrease from 2023. The government aims to increase the total fertility rate to 1.6 by 2030 and to 1.8 by 2036. The country has also seen a significant decrease in child mortality, with a rate of 4.0 per 1,000 live births as of December 2024. The number of children in foster care has also decreased, with 340,055 children as of 2024. The government has also launched a unique program for screening reproductive health for women and men aged 18-45 in the framework of dispensary examination. Russia has declared 2024 as the Year of the Family, with key objectives including creating conditions for the birth of the first children in young families, strengthening reproductive health, supporting multi-child and multi-generational families, and forming a healthy trend towards multi-child families.

**Turkey's Fertility Rate Declines to 1.48 Children per Woman**
According to the latest report by the United Nations, the world is experiencing a 'baby crisis', with a decline in global fertility rates. The report states that the global fertility rate has decreased from 5 children per woman in the 1960s to 2.2 children per woman in 2024, and is expected to continue declining to 2.1 children per woman by 2050 and 1.8 children per woman by 2100. In Turkey, the total fertility rate has decreased from 2.38 children per woman in 2001 to 1.48 children per woman in 2024. The report also highlights that the highest total fertility rate in Turkey is in Şanlıurfa, with 3.28 children per woman, while the lowest is in Bartın and Eskişehir, with 1.12 children per woman. The report also notes that the total fertility rate in Europe has decreased to 1.38 children per woman in 2023, with the highest rate in Bulgaria, 1.81 children per woman, and the lowest in Malta, 1.06 children per woman. Turkey's total fertility rate of 1.48 children per woman in 2024 ranks 9th among European countries. The report also states that education level is a significant factor in determining fertility rates, with women with higher education levels having lower fertility rates. Additionally, the report notes that the average age of mothers has increased, with mothers having their first child at an average age of 27.3 in 2024, up from 26.7 in 2001. The report also highlights that the average interval between births has increased, with the average interval between the first and second births being 4.7 years in 2024, up from 4.6 years in 2019.

**Global Fertility Rate to Decline Sharply by 2100, Study Warns**
A recent study published in 'The Lancet' predicts that the global fertility rate will continue to decline, with the number of births per woman expected to drop from 2.4 in 2016 to 1.75 by 2100. This decline is expected to be more pronounced than previously thought, with the number of births projected to reach 72 million by 2100, down from 142 million in 2016. The study's authors warn that this decline will lead to a significant social change in the 21st century. According to the study, by 2100, only 3% of countries will have a fertility rate above 2.1, and the majority of births will occur in Africa, south of the Sahara. The study's authors also suggest that governments can take measures to mitigate the decline, such as providing extended parental leave, child benefits, and affordable childcare, but the impact of these measures will be limited. The study's authors also predict that there will be a competition among wealthy countries to attract migrants to address the demographic challenges. 'We are standing in the 21st century before a disturbing social change,' said Stein Emil Vollset, a member of the research group, in a statement about the study. 'We are facing a future where the number of births will be significantly lower than it is today.'

**Tatyana Golikova: Russia's Demographic Crisis Will End by 2046**
According to Tatyana Golikova, the main reason for Russia's demographic crisis is the decline in the number of women of childbearing age. 'Since 2016, fertility rates have begun to decline again. This was influenced by a number of factors, with the main one being the change in the age structure of the population as a result of previous decades,' Golikova said. She believes that this is a global trend, and Russia is not an exception. Golikova notes that the current generation prioritizes career advancement and only later considers having children, often by which time they have lost the opportunity to reproduce or have only one child. According to Golikova's forecast, this trend will continue until 2046, when the current generation of children will have grown up and the number of women of childbearing age will increase in Russia.

**Trump's baby bonus won't work  --  but we already know the real solution | Blaze Media**
The fertility rate in the United States has dropped to 1.62 children per woman, making it a laggard in the global race to zero. The author argues that modernity is the real culprit behind declining birth rates, not environmental toxins or falling sperm counts. People are losing faith in God and are no longer having children for the sake of family and community. The author suggests that religious people, who have high fertility rates, will inherit the earth in the future. The author's own church has a high fertility rate, with an estimated four children per woman, and fathers take an active role in raising their children. The author argues that secularists and progressives are living in the present moment and do not care about the future, while religious people live for the future and will inherit the earth.

**Global birth rate must rise to 2.7 to avoid extinction, researchers warn**
Researchers warn that humanity may need a higher birth rate than previously thought to ensure its long-term survival. According to a new study, women would need to have at least 2.7 children each, far above the widely accepted global replacement rate of 2.1, to prevent population decline over generations. The study, led by Professor Takuya Okabe at Shizuoka University, suggests that the current fertility rate of 2.25 in 2023 is not enough to sustain a stable population. The team's analysis shows that the minimum fertility rate needed to maintain population levels across generations is 2.7 children per woman, substantially higher than current targets. As fertility rates fall worldwide, concerns about shrinking populations are rising, with about two-thirds of the world's people living in regions where fertility is below the replacement threshold.

**The Fertility of Immigrants and Natives in the United States, 2023**
According to a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, the overall total fertility rate (TFR) in the United States in 2023 was 1.8 children, with immigrants having a TFR of 2.19 and U.S.-born having a TFR of 1.73. The presence of immigrants raised the nation's overall TFR by about 0.08 children or 4.5 percent. However, the report also found that immigration's ability to increase fertility is limited by the relatively low fertility of every major racial group among the U.S.-born. The report also notes that immigration does increase births per thousand for the entire U.S. population, but the impact is still quite small, with a 6.6 percent increase from 11.2 births per thousand without immigrants to 11.9 births per thousand with immigrants. Additionally, the report found a negative correlation between the immigrant share of the population and the fertility rate of U.S.-born women in the nation's largest metropolitan areas, suggesting that immigration may reduce the fertility of the U.S.-born. The report also discusses the possible reasons why immigration may lower the fertility of the U.S.-born, including driving up housing costs, lowering wages, and straining public services. 'The long-term decline in fertility has been more pronounced for the foreign-born than the U.S.-born since 2008,' said the report. 'Though there was a modest post-Covid uptick in birth rates in 2021 and 2022, this increase had largely abated by 2023.'

**Countries with the Lowest Birth Rates: A Global Trend**
The global birth rate continues to decline, with a 0.94% drop in 2024 compared to 2023, averaging 17.2 births per 1,000 people. Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore lead the list of countries with the lowest birth rates, with an average of 1.1, 1.1, and 1.2 children per fertile woman, respectively, according to Statista. Colombia is also experiencing this trend, with an average of 1.63 children per woman. The world's birth rate is 2.3%, with other regions such as Ukraine, Hong Kong, and Macao also having 1.2 births per woman. In Europe, Italy and Spain maintain a figure of 1.3 children per woman, while Poland and Bosnia and Herzegovina have an indicator of 1.3 and 1.4, respectively. The fertility rate is measured by taking into account the average number of children born per woman between the ages of 15 and 45. A replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman is considered stable, as it maintains the world's population balance. It is expected that the European population will decline by 7% by 2050, with a projected reduction in new births. However, populations in Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean are expected to continue growing, but will reach their peak populations before the end of the century. Countries have taken measures to mitigate the impact of low fertility rates on their economies, such as allowing foreign nannies in South Korea and allocating up to $22.3 billion annually in Japan to reverse the decline. Colombia has a birth rate of 1.63 children per woman, ranking it seventh in Latin America and the Caribbean, and closely following other countries such as Chile (1.14), Costa Rica (1.32), and Uruguay (1.4). According to the National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane), there were 445,011 births recorded in 2024, the lowest number in the last 10 years, representing a 33.4% drop in births.

**US births fell to lowest level in decades in 2023**
The total number of births in the U.S. has reached a 44-year low, with 3.5 million births recorded in 2023, a level not seen since 1979. The total fertility rate also fell to 1.6 births per woman, a 2% decrease annually since 2007. This decline in birth and fertility rates is reflective of the global trend of women delaying or forgoing having children. The average age of first-time mothers has increased to 27.5 years, a record high. Teen birth rates have plummeted by 68% since 2007, while birth rates for women in their 30s have fallen by 3% since 2022. According to the report, use of prenatal care for pregnant women decreased from 2022 to 2023, with only 76% of pregnant women receiving prenatal care during the first trimester. 'Absent net immigration, the U.S. population will shrink' due to the falling total fertility rate, a key metric for determining the future of population levels.

**The Future of the World: Will it be Made Without Children?**
A recent study published in The Lancet found that the global fertility rate has decreased by half since 1950, from 4.8 children per woman to 2.2 in 2021. This decline is expected to continue, leading to a demographic decline in 97% of the 204 countries studied by 2100. The African sub-Saharan region is expected to remain a dynamic region in terms of fertility. The demographic change already underway is affecting various areas, including healthcare needs, transportation accessibility, and immigration. While countries are competing with policies to limit the decline in births, their effectiveness is uncertain. Should we be concerned about a future without children, or can we seize the opportunities it presents? According to blogger Yves-Landry Kouamé, we should be skeptical about the COP29, while blogger Umbo Salama criticizes 'nionsologues', self-proclaimed experts on all subjects.

**Global Population Growth Slows Down: What's Behind the Decline?**
The world's population growth has slowed down significantly over the past few decades, according to IFLScience. The population has reached 8 billion people in 2024, but the UN predicts that the growth rate will slow down significantly in the next 60 years, adding only 2 billion people. By the 2080s, the population is expected to reach 10.3 billion, and by the end of the century, it will decrease to 10.2 billion. The probability of the population reaching its peak by 2100 is estimated to be 80%. This is largely due to a sharp decline in fertility rates. In most countries, the fertility rate is below the critical threshold of 2.1 children per woman. In fact, over 20% of countries have a 'below-replacement fertility rate', where a woman has fewer than 1.4 children. China, which was once the most populous country, is also experiencing a decline in population. According to forecasts, the population of these countries will decrease by approximately 14% from now until 2054. The decline in fertility rates can be attributed to the demographic transition phenomenon, where women have fewer children as societies become more industrialized. This is due to increased opportunities for women's career growth, leading to delayed family formation. Additionally, lower child mortality rates and reduced need for large families for agricultural work contribute to lower fertility rates. In combination with increasing life expectancy, this decline in fertility can significantly alter the demographic composition of the population, with people over 60 years old making up an increasingly large proportion. By 2070, people over 60 are expected to outnumber those under 18.

**Low Fertility Rates: A Threat to Russia's Population**
According to the UN, global fertility rates have reached a historic low, with an average of 2.2 births per woman in 2023. In Russia, the fertility rate was 1.41 in 2023 and is expected to drop to 1.32 in 2024. Experts warn that if fertility rates remain below 1.4 for decades, it will lead to a rapid decline in population and significant aging. Vera Nikišina, director of the Institute of Clinical Psychology and Social Work, notes that many young people are not planning to have children, with 70% of those aged 18-25 not having reproductive plans. When asked if they plan to have children, over half of respondents replied, 'Yes, but someday later', when they expect to have a stable career and a comfortable life.

**The Decline of Birth Rates: A Global Opportunity**
Over the past 100 years, the global population has quadrupled, from 2 billion in 1925 to 8.2 billion in 2024. This rapid growth is attributed to the decline in infant mortality, medical advancements, and increased global life expectancy, which has reached an average of 73.3 years. However, the expected demographic explosion by the end of the century is not materializing. According to the United Nations' 'World Population Prospects' report, which monitors global demographic trends, the actual growth rate is lower than predicted. The main reason is the decline in fertility rates. To maintain a stable population, the average number of children per fertile woman should be 2.1. Globally, this rate has decreased from 5.1 children per woman in 1965 to 2.2 in 2024. Today, 131 countries and regions have fertility rates below the threshold, although individual trends vary.
