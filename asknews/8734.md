**Special Depreciation for Electric Company Cars to Boost E-Auto Sales**
Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil has proposed a special depreciation for electric company cars to boost the sale of E-Autos. This would be a good news for private buyers as well. According to the draft law, companies that purchase new, purely electric vehicles between July 1, 2025, and December 31, 2027, will be able to claim particularly generous depreciation rules. In the year of purchase, 75% of the acquisition costs can be claimed as a tax deduction. In the following year, a further 10% can be deducted. In the subsequent years, the rate decreases: 5% in the second and third year after purchase, 3% in the fourth year, and 2% in the fifth year. This special depreciation also applies to electrically powered commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses. Klingbeil himself describes the measure as an 'Investitions-Booster.' The draft law also includes other investment incentives, such as a special depreciation of up to 30% on other movable assets, such as machines or office equipment, in the period 2025-2027. From 2028, a gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate is planned, from the current 15% to 10% by 2032. The financial consequences for the state budget would be significant, with estimated tax revenue losses of around 48 billion euros by 2029, with the special depreciation for electric vehicles accounting for a significant portion of this amount.

**India finalises new EV policy with reduced import duties, incentives to set up local manufacturing**
India has finalized a new electric vehicle (EV) policy with reduced import duties and incentives for global manufacturers to set up local production facilities. The policy, which was first announced in March 2024, requires approved applicants to invest a minimum of Rs 4,150 crore in manufacturing facilities and achieve a domestic value addition (DVA) of 25% within three years. The DVA is expected to rise to 50% within five years. The policy also allows for the import of completely built-in units (CBUs) of e-4Ws at a reduced customs duty of 15% for five years. This move comes as US-based Tesla is eyeing entry into the Indian market, having set up sales and operating teams in the country. According to Dhiraj Agrawal, CBO at Mufin Green Finance, 'The success of this policy will depend on efficient implementation and complementary support systems such as financing, charging infrastructure, and skill development.'

**Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Surge in May, Representing 19.4% of Total Market**
Electric and hybrid vehicles have seen a significant increase in sales in May, with a 138% growth compared to the same month last year. They now represent 19.4% of the total market, the highest historical figure in a single month. In contrast, gasoline and diesel vehicle sales have decreased. The 65% market share of hybrid and electric vehicles is 20 points higher than last year. The sales of electric vehicles have doubled compared to the same month last year, with 9,051 units sold, while hybrid plug-in vehicles have grown by 168%, with 12,810 deliveries. Félix García, director of communication and marketing of Anfac, stated, 'It's a positive news that sales are maintaining this pace. On the one hand, it's due to the renewal of the fleet, which is no longer driven by diesel and gasoline, but by conventional hybrids and electrified vehicles. And, on the other hand, by the increase in sales of electric vehicles that allow us to continue advancing in the objective of reducing emissions.' Raúl Morales, director of communication of Faconauto, added, 'The most notable thing about the month is that electric vehicles already represent 20% of the total. The offer is connecting with demand and brands and dealers are getting it right. Now it's the turn of the administrations: activating the Plan MOVES 2025 as soon as possible will be key to not slowing down this evolution.' Tania Puche, director of communication of GANVAM, highlighted that 'last month closed above 100,000 units registered; something we hadn't seen in a May month since 2019. In this way, the market continues to rise and accumulates nine consecutive months in positive. In this context, forecasts point to surpassing the million units at the end of 2025, slightly above the 2024 exercise.'

**Germany Aims to Boost Economy with New Investment Program**
Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil is pushing for a new investment program to boost the German economy. The program, which could be approved by the cabinet as early as Wednesday, includes tax relief measures such as improved depreciation options for company-owned electric cars. The package, which is expected to cost around 46 billion euros by 2029, is currently being reviewed by various government departments. If the cabinet approves the program, it will then need to be approved by the Bundestag and Bundesrat. The program's main focus is on an 'Investment Booster' that allows companies to claim up to 30% of investments in movable assets such as machines over the next few years. Another key aspect is the gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate from 15% to 10% by 2032, which is intended to provide companies with long-term security and strengthen Germany as a business location. Additionally, the tax rate for retained profits will be reduced, encouraging companies to invest in research and development. The purchase of electric vehicles will also become more attractive for companies: 75% of the costs can be written off in the year of purchase, followed by a declining balance over the following years. This regulation applies to vehicles purchased between July 2025 and December 2027. The government, consisting of CDU, CSU, and SPD, aims to act quickly and implement the measures before the summer break. Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Lars Klingbeil are optimistic that their tax policies will bring the desired growth boost to the struggling German economy.

**US Lags Behind in Electric Vehicle Transition, China and EU Lead the Way**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released its Global EV Outlook 2025, which predicts that the share of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) sold in the United States will increase from 10% to 20% by 2030. However, this growth is expected to be hindered by the US government's decision to eliminate subsidies and other policies that support EVs. The IEA had previously estimated that EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) would account for 55% of new car sales in the US by 2030, but this is now expected to be lower due to the elimination of incentives. In contrast, China is expected to have a strong EV market, with the IEA predicting that EVs and PHEVs will account for 80% of new car sales by 2030. The European market is also expected to grow, with EVs and PHEVs accounting for around 30% of new car sales in 2023. However, growth is being hindered by factors such as insufficient charging infrastructure, inconsistent incentives, and high prices. The IEA notes that the elimination of incentives in the US will lead to a decrease in EV sales of 1.1 million units in 2030, and will also cost the US 130,000 jobs in the EV production, battery, and charging infrastructure sectors. The article concludes that the US is at risk of falling behind other countries in the transition to electric vehicles, and that the EU and Italy must take a strong stance on green policies to avoid this fate.

**China Dominates Global Electric Vehicle Market, with 70% of Sales**
China dominates the global electric vehicle market, with an estimated 20 million units sold worldwide this year, accounting for over a quarter of all new vehicles. In the first quarter of 2025, electric vehicle sales increased by 35% compared to the same period in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). China accounts for 70% of global electric vehicle sales, with a predicted 60% of new registrations in 2025 being electric. The IEA forecasts that 25% of vehicles sold in Europe will be electric, while in the US, 11% of new registrations will be electric. By 2030, the IEA predicts that 80% of new vehicle registrations in China will be electric, 60% in Europe, and 20% in the US. The IEA notes that while higher tariffs and a weak economy may slow overall vehicle sales, the share of electric vehicles is expected to remain unchanged. China's dominance in electric vehicle production has increased significantly in 2024, with a 25% global increase in production largely attributed to Chinese manufacturers. In Europe, production stagnated, while in North America, production decreased in the US but doubled in Mexico, with 70% of Mexican production attributed to US companies. The IEA also notes that 2% of new trucks sold in 2024 were electric, with 80% of all new electric trucks sold in China, where a scrappage premium for conventional trucks led to a doubling of sales to 75,000 units. In China, the total costs of using an electric truck are already lower than those of a fossil fuel-powered vehicle, and this may be the case in Europe by 2030.

**Key reasons for optimism over EV adoption in the U.S.**
Despite President Donald Trump's executive order signaling a shift in the federal government's stance on EVs, industry experts remain optimistic about the future of electrified vehicles in the U.S. Key reasons for optimism include market forces, state-level initiatives, and ongoing advancements in technology. According to Cox Automotive, EVs are expected to account for approximately 10% of the market total in 2025, up from 7.5% in 2024. The forecast noted that consumers are still looking to reduce their dependence on gasoline, and that hybrids will become even more important as a steppingstone for consumers. Automakers like Kia, Ford, GM, Tesla, and Rivian remain committed to electrification, driven by factors such as consumer demand and the need to meet emissions targets. As one in four new vehicles sold is expected to be powered by electricity in 2025, the EV revolution is far from slowing down.

**US to Double Battery Production by 2025, Boosting Electric Mobility**
The United States is on the verge of doubling its battery production by 2025, with 10 new manufacturing plants set to be operational. This development promises to strengthen the local supply chain and reduce dependence on China. The new factories, built by companies like LG Energy Solution, SK On, and Panasonic, represent a significant step forward in the transition to electric mobility in the US. However, the Trump administration's policies may significantly impact the market for electric vehicles. Despite China's continued dominance in global battery production, North America has become the region with the fastest-growing planned production capacity. The 10 new plants that will come online this year will bring the US's annual production capacity to 421.5 gigawatt-hours, nearly doubling that of the previous year. Evan Hartley, analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said, 'the plants are already built. You can't stop the process, and the momentum is there. Most of it is in Republican states. It's hard to take away thousands of promised jobs from your key electoral base.' Despite the Trump administration's threats to eliminate tax incentives for electric vehicles and impose a 25% tariff on vehicles and components from Canada and Mexico, the industry appears determined to continue its path. The localization of battery production could help reduce costs and compensate for potential losses in incentives. Several automakers, including General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and Ford, have recorded record sales of electric vehicles in the US in recent years, thanks to generous incentives and attractive leasing and financing offers. The challenge now will be to maintain this growth in a potentially less favorable political context. Despite the uncertainties, industry experts believe that the transition to electric vehicles in the US has reached a point of no return. As one expert noted, we are in the 'hockey stick' phase of electric vehicle adoption, a period of initial slow growth followed by an explosive increase.

**2027 Revisited — Where Will Plugin Vehicles Be In 3 Years?**
The author revisits the topic of plugin vehicle sales, predicting that by 2027, a quarter of new car sales will be electric vehicles (EVs). The growth rate has slowed from 60% to 30% since pre-COVID times, but the author believes it is still achievable. The data from Rho Motion shows that 17.1 million plugin cars were sold in 2024, up from 13.6 million in 2023 and 10.4 million in 2022. The author uses arithmetic and geometric progression to predict sales of 26 million in 2027, or 37 million if the growth rate continues at 30%. The International Energy Agency predicts that by 2030, most new cars sold will be electric. The author notes that China is still the largest market for EVs, but other regions such as the EU, USA, and the global south are also increasing their purchases. The barriers to EV adoption have been overcome, but misinformation and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) persist. The author believes that EVs will succeed without Tesla's leadership and that the rEVolution can continue without the USA. However, the outlook is murky due to the rise of far-right parties in Europe and the impact of Trump tariffs and Musk's machinations.
