**Why don't we celebrate the King's Birthday on his actual birthday?**
The King's Birthday is a public holiday in all eight states and territories of Australia, but it is not celebrated on King Charles III's actual birthday. Instead, the holiday is observed on different dates in various states, with Queensland celebrating it on the first Monday of October and Western Australia choosing between the fourth Monday of September or the first Monday of October. The holiday was originally celebrated on the reigning monarch's actual birthday, but the current date was chosen for its suitability in the UK, taking into account the start of summer and warmer weather, as well as the proximity to other holidays. As the Governor of Western Australia says, 'The chosen date is announced by the Governor each year and will be observed on September 29 this year.' The holiday has been celebrated on different dates in some regions, such as Karratha, where it is marked on the first Monday in August, and Port Hedland, where it is celebrated alongside the Hedland Cup.

**King Charles is furious about what is happening in Sandringham and could cancel a legendary tradition**
King Charles III is reportedly 'livid' over a significant decline in pheasant numbers at his Sandringham estate, jeopardizing the royal family's traditional Boxing Day shoot. The 76-year-old monarch has maintained Sandringham as one of the UK's few remaining wild shoots, but this eco-friendly approach has led to a shortage of pheasants. A long-serving gamekeeper at the Norfolk estate has been dismissed, and a source described the situation as a 'total cock-up.' The King's commitment to sustainable practices has contributed to the current predicament, and the potential cancellation of the shoot marks a significant moment in the royal family's history. The fate of the Boxing Day shoot remains uncertain, and the King's dedication to both tradition and environmental stewardship will play a crucial role in determining the event's continuity in the years to come.

**King Charles III Receives 268 Gifts in 2023, Including a £355,000 Rolls-Royce SUV**
The British royal family has released a list of official gifts received by its members from 2020 to 2023. The list shows that King Charles III received 268 gifts in 2023, including a £355,000 (approximately $478,000) Rolls-Royce Cullinan Series II SUV from the King of Bahrain. The palace emphasized that the car is only for official use and not for the king's personal use. The list also includes a gift from the late Pope Francis, which is said to be a part of the True Cross, symbolizing its deep religious significance. Charles III is known for his concern for animals and the environment, and he received a wooden insect house and a Beethoven CD from the German President during his visit to Germany in 2022. The late Queen Elizabeth II received 65 gifts in 2022, including a walking stick from the British Army to help her with her mobility issues. Her last gift before her death was a colorful glass plate commemorating her 70th anniversary of accession to the throne. The royal family typically releases a list of gifts each year, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Queen's death, and Charles III's accession, the palace has only now released the list. The gifts reflect the contemporary context and needs, such as the hand sanitizer received by Princess Anne in 2020 and the local version of Monopoly received by Prince Edward during his visit to Nigeria. According to the rules, the gifts received by the royal family are not personal property and are not subject to tax, but they cannot be sold or exchanged. Gifts worth less than £150 and with a perishable nature can be donated to charity or assistants. Some valuable gifts will be added to the royal collection for future exhibition and preservation.

**Throne Speech reconfirms cap on international student permits - University Affairs**
In the Speech from the Throne, King Charles III announced that the federal government will set a limit on the number of temporary foreign workers and international students, with a cap starting in 2027 below five percent of Canada's population. This move aims to 'restore balance to the [immigration] system' while attracting the best talent to build the economy. The government also plans to ease the housing crisis by incentivizing a made-in-Canada modular housing industry and giving tax breaks to first-time home buyers. Although higher education was not explicitly mentioned, the goal of attracting top talent to help build the economy was named as a priority. According to Statistics Canada, there are currently 1.5 million temporary foreign workers and 944,000 international students in Canada, with a total of 2.5 million people residing in the country on work and study permits. The government plans to issue 437,000 new study permits and extensions in 2025, down from 485,000 in 2024.

**Charles III Visits Canada Amidst Tensions with Trump**
Charles III, the King of the United Kingdom, is visiting Canada for 24 hours, amidst tensions with US President Donald Trump. Charles III has never publicly commented on Trump's ambitions, but has accepted an invitation from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to read the Speech from the Throne at the reopening of the Canadian Parliament. The Queen Camilla will accompany him. The Speech from the Throne will outline the priorities of Carney's new centre-left government. 'The King and Queen are looking forward to the program, aware that it is a short visit, but they hope it will be significant,' said a Buckingham Palace spokesperson. The Speech from the Throne will be closely watched, particularly on issues of sovereignty and trade relations, given Trump's desire to annex Canada and impose tariffs on the country. Charles III 'will present the plan of our government to make Canada stronger,' said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. He had previously hailed the visit 'as a historic honor that reflects the gravity of our time.' This is Charles III's 20th visit to Canada, but his first as King, following his accession in September 2022. It is the sixth visit for Camilla, but her first as Queen.

**King Charles Presents New 'Great Seal of the Realm'**
King Charles III has approved a new seal, known as the 'Great Seal of the Realm', which will be used on official state documents to signify the monarch's consent. According to the Royal Family's Instagram, a new seal is created for each monarch during their reign. The new seal features King Charles sitting on a throne, wearing his coronation robes and holding the sceptre and orb. The reverse side of the seal shows the royal coat of arms, designed by artist Timothy Noad. As per tradition, King Charles, 76, would have symbolically struck the seal of his mother and predecessor, Queen Elizabeth II, with a hammer to signify its destruction. The old seal will be preserved for posterity. In a statement, the transfer of the seal is said to mark 'the final phase of the formal transition to the reign of His Majesty'. The tradition of the royal symbol dates back to the 11th century. King Charles ascended to the throne in September 2022, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II at the age of 96, whose 70-year reign led to the creation of two versions of her seal, one in 1953 and another in 2001.

**Nostradamus do Brasil predicts King Charles III's abdication in favor of Prince William**
Brazilian mystic Athos Salomé, known as the 'living Nostradamus', has predicted that British King Charles III will abdicate in favor of his son, Prince William, this year. According to Salomé, the abdication will be imposed by 'invisible forces' and 'energetic determination of destiny'. The mystic claims that Prince William has been acting as the true sovereign, making crucial decisions and reorganizing the British government. Salomé stated, 'While Charles makes scripted public appearances, William is already acting as the true ruler. He has taken key decisions, articulating changes in the State Council.' Salomé also mentioned that Prince William has 'strategically distanced himself from his father' and is already governing 'behind the scenes'. The mystic emphasized, 'William has vetoed his father's decisions, reformed the public image of the Crown, and initiated direct diplomatic contacts with Commonwealth leaders.' Salomé described this situation as 'silent regency', which he claims is 'unprecedented' in British monarchy history.

**Living Nostradamus claims Prince William already pulling the strings and King will abdicate - Daily Star**
The Living Nostradamus, Athos Salomé, claims that Prince William has taken over the king's decision-making and that King Charles is planning to abdicate the throne. Salomé, who has an accuracy rate of 92%, says he predicted Covid-19, the death of Queen Elizabeth II, and Charles III's illness. He claims that William has established direct contacts with key Commonwealth figures and is 'already acting as king behind the scenes.' According to Salomé, the abdication will be 'disguised as institutional restructuring' and will mark a break with the traditional line of command. He also claims that William has taken over diplomatic tasks and has chaired meetings that were previously exclusive to the monarch. Salomé predicts that by the end of 2025, the heirs will be officially declared Prince Regent under a new title that will disguise Charles' abdication. Meanwhile, Prince Harry has expressed concerns that some people want 'history to repeat itself' in a reference to his late mother Princess Diana's tragic death.

**Baba Vanga's Prediction: King Charles III's Reign Threatened and a New Successor?**
Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian fortune teller known as the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans', made a prediction about King Charles III that could threaten his reign and the line of succession. According to popular interpretations of her visions, Baba Vanga predicted that King Charles III's reign would be brief and marked by a crisis, either health or political, that would force him to abdicate before his time. This prediction does not specify the exact cause of his resignation, but warns of an event that would remove him from power without necessarily implying his immediate death. The prediction has gained attention due to recent public concern about King Charles III's health, who has been suffering from cancer for several months. Experts note that this health situation has intensified speculation about the duration of his reign and the future of the British monarchy. Baba Vanga's prediction also suggests that the successor to King Charles III will not be his son William, the current official heir to the throne, but rather an 'unexpected or controversial' figure. This statement has generated various interpretations among Baba Vanga's followers, but there is no clear consensus on who this person could be or what this change in the line of succession would imply. Some even speculate about a possible reform in the structure of the British monarchy.

**King Charles III Suspends Agenda Due to Cancer Diagnosis**
King Charles III of England has suspended his agenda due to cancer treatments. According to British media, his visit to Birmingham scheduled for this Friday has been postponed. The king, 76, was diagnosed with cancer after a prostate enlargement was found during an examination. The Palace of Buckingham has announced that the king was hospitalized briefly on Thursday as a precaution. His upcoming trip to Italy and the Vatican remains on schedule, but it is unclear due to the uncertainty surrounding his health. The queen, Camila, did not visit the king in the hospital as she had prior commitments at Wembley. The king's diagnosis was unexpected, given that he had only been in power for 18 months. Now, less than three years after his accession to the throne, health issues are affecting his reign. The Prince of Wales, William, continues with public appearances, but it does not seem that he will replace his father either symbolically or in the event of a possible abdication, as the king is determined to maintain the crown until his death, unlike Juan Carlos I.
