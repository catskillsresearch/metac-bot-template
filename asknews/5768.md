**Six Bulgarians Sentenced to High Prison Terms for Espionage**
A London court has sentenced six Bulgarian nationals to high prison sentences for proven espionage activities on behalf of Russia. The group was led by Jan Marsalek, the former Wirecard executive who is currently in hiding. The court found that the group, led by Orlin R., had been spying for Russia from summer 2020 to their arrest in February 2023. According to the court, R. was the leader of the group and communicated with Marsalek through the messaging app Telegram. 'There was a hierarchy in the group,' said Judge Nicholas Hilliard in his verdict. The group had planned several espionage operations, but only partially implemented them. They had been monitoring the 'Patch Barracks', a US military base in Stuttgart, and had taken photos of doorbells and searched for apartments near the base. They were arrested in February 2023 and found with fake IDs, passports, and 200 mobile phones. The court found that the group had opened 12 bank accounts in the UK using the fake documents. R. and two of his accomplices had confessed to the crimes during the trial, which would have resulted in much harsher sentences if they had not. The court noted that the crimes were so severe that even up to 14 years in prison could have been possible. The group will serve half of their sentences in the UK before being deported to their home country.

**Tap Executives Acquitted of Environmental Pollution Charges**
The Lecce court has acquitted 19 defendants, including the country manager of Tap Italia, Michele Mario Elia, and the project manager, Gabriele Paolo Lanza, of the charge of environmental pollution. The verdict was issued by Judge Chiara Panico and was based on the fact that the prosecution's case had prescribed. The public prosecutor, Alessandro Prontera, had requested a sentence of three years in prison and a fine of €66,667 for eight of the defendants. The acquittal also applies to the other four defendants, who were accused of the same crime but were acquitted with the formula 'per non aver commesso il fatto' (because they did not commit the crime). The court's decision was welcomed by Tap, which stated in a note that the verdict 'confirms the full correctness and transparency of the company's actions and management during the project.'

**Chinese Businessman Sentenced to Four Years for Producing 'Indecent' Dolls**
A Chinese businessman was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison and fined 100,000 yuan for producing and selling 'indecent' dolls with removable underwear. The case is the first of its kind in China, where animated toy models have led to a court trial. The owner of a toy factory in the province of Guangdong in southern China hired several workers to produce the figures and sold them on the online platform Taobao. Since 2022, the company has sold 20,000 models, which were later recognized as 'indecent items.' The businessman and 12 of his subordinates appeared in court. The police seized over 30,000 models from the factory's warehouse during the investigation. It was found that some of the buyers were minors who hid the figures from their parents, which the court considered evidence of the product's indecent nature. In April, the court sentenced the business owner to four years and nine months in prison and a fine of 100,000 yuan, and his partner to four years and three months and the same fine. The factory manager received a nine-month sentence and a fine of 50,000 yuan, while the remaining nine employees received suspended sentences. The case sparked a lot of public debate, with users' opinions sharply divided. Some suggested that the producers of 'Barbie' and sex toys should also be condemned, while others supported the court's decision, saying it was aimed at protecting minors. Earlier, the 'Barbie' manufacturer apologized for a link to pornography.

**Crime Ring Busted for Exploiting Children's Charity Tickets - Blogging.org**
Pennsylvania State Police have dismantled a sophisticated crime ring that exploited Tickets for Kids Charities, diverting thousands of free event tickets meant for disadvantaged children and selling them for personal profit. Six individuals, a Pittsburgh ticket business, and a Johnstown non-profit organization face felony charges in the scheme, which targeted Tickets for Kids Charities. According to State Trooper Rocco Gagliardi, the operation ran from at least 2019 through 2024, with evidence suggesting the fraud may have begun even earlier. Quan Britt, Executive Director of Hope4Johnstown, allegedly acquired 536 tickets valued at over $16,700 in 2024 alone, funneling them to co-conspirators who sold them through various channels. Tickets for Kids Charities executive director Brandice Miller expressed dismay at the betrayal of trust, stating, 'Children also see career opportunities when they are at events, they get to experience joy, it gives them a sense of belonging.' The defendants face multiple felony counts, including dealing in proceeds of unlawful activity, theft by deception, receiving stolen property, and participation in corrupt organizations, with the most serious charges carrying sentences of up to 20 years in prison.

A 73-year-old man, A, and a 64-year-old man, B, were sentenced to 3 years in prison with a 5-year suspension and 320 hours of community service, respectively, for embezzling over 11 billion won in elderly care funds.

C was sentenced to 1 year and 6 months in prison with a 3-year suspension. The court stated that the defendants' actions caused a significant financial loss to the government and harmed the public, and therefore, they should not be exempt from community service.

**French Company Executives Fined for Bribing Pneumologists**
Two former executives of a Val-de-Marne company were fined up to 300,000 euros for bribing pneumologists between 2010 and 2014. The executives offered cash, trips, football matches, and computer equipment to the doctors in exchange for medical equipment. The court described the executives' behavior as 'a perilous thesis of passive resistance', 'an opportunistic speech', and 'a serious disturbance to public order'. The president of the 31st chamber, Isabelle Prévost-Desprez, stated, 'Throughout the investigation and trial, you have attempted to shift the blame despite the evidence, you have participated knowingly, and you persist in a disturbing lack of good faith.'

**The massive penalties public bodies and water companies would face for ecocide in Scotland**
Labour MSP Monica Lennon has confirmed that her Ecocide Bill, set to be introduced at Holyrood later this month, would make public bodies such as councils and water companies liable for ecocide, alongside corporate businesses. The proposed law could see executives jailed for up to 20 years and have assets seized if found guilty. According to Scottish Water's assessment, almost one in five sewage spill outlets across Scotland are in an 'unsatisfactory' condition. Ms Lennon has secured the backing of the Unison trade union and 51 MSPs for the proposed legislation. Jojo Mehta, co-founder of Ecocide International, emphasized that the law would be reserved for the most severe cases and would require 'evidential clarity' to hold public bodies accountable. Ms Lennon confirmed that the Bill would include definitions that could see public sector decision makers liable for ecocide, citing the UK Companies Act 2006. 'There is huge public support for the criminalisation of ecocide and I am pleased that Scotland is at the forefront of this,' she said. 'Publishing the Ecocide Bill before June is my priority and I will continue to work with MSPs and the Scottish Government to ensure we get the legislation right.'

**CAC Give 6-Week Notice For Unregistered Businesses To Register Or Face Jail**
The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) has issued a six-week notice to unregistered businesses in Nigeria to register with the Commission or face jail term prosecution. According to the CAC, it is a criminal offence to carry on business in Nigeria without registration, and non-compliance may result in prosecution and a conviction that carries a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment. The CAC emphasized that all companies, limited liability partnerships, limited partnerships, and business name proprietors must comply with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020 within six weeks of this notice. Failure to comply will result in enforcement actions, including prosecution. The CAC stated, 'In particular, the general public should note the provisions of Section 862 (1) of the Act, which state that any person who, in any document required under the Act (including the aforementioned official publications of a company), knowingly makes a false statement in any material respect commits an offence and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term of two years, in addition to a daily fine imposed on the company for every day the offence continues.'

**The Paradox of the ERE Case: Former Officials Free, Cooperators Imprisoned**
The Spanish Constitutional Court's (TC) decision to annul or partially annul the sentences of several former high-ranking officials of the Andalusian government, including Manuel Chaves and José Antonio Griñán, has created a paradox. The officials who created and maintained a procedure that distributed almost 680 million euros in public aid without transparency are free, while those who were involved in the corruption scheme are being imprisoned. The authors of the crimes in the main case of ERE have regained their freedom after serving less than a third of their sentences, while the businessmen and cooperators involved in the scheme are being sentenced as beneficiaries of public funds in various pieces of the macro-case. The case has been divided into 136 separate investigations, one for each company that received aid through the opaque procedure. The latest person to be imprisoned is Antonio José Albarracín Muñoz, who was sentenced for the aid to the company Aceitunas y Conservas (Acyco). Others have avoided imprisonment because their sentence does not exceed two years and they have no previous convictions. They have signed sentences of compliance after returning the public money they received. This is not the case of the former director of the consulting firm Vitalia Vida, who entered the Alcalá de Henares prison (Madrid) a few days ago to serve a sentence of three years and nine months. The last chapter of the political piece of the ERE case has not been written. The Constitutional Court has overturned the interpretation of the crimes made by the Seville Audiencia in its 2019 sentence, ratified by the Supreme Court, and has ordered a new sentence after denying part of the criminal responsibility to the politicians who approved the budget items that fed the ERE fund. The Audiencia is deliberating whether to refer the review of the TC to the European Court of Justice (TJUE) for a possible violation of basic principles of European law.

**François Fillon Acquitted of Prison Sentence**
François Fillon, the former Prime Minister of France, has been acquitted of serving a prison sentence. The Paris Court of Appeal has overturned the original sentence, and Fillon will not have to serve time in prison or wear an electronic bracelet. Fillon, his wife, and his former parliamentary assistant, Mark Joula, were found guilty of 'embezzlement of public funds by a person in a public position', conspiracy, and covering up these crimes. The decision is final after the French Court of Cassation confirmed the verdict on April 24, 2024. Despite the three filing a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights in August 2024, the verdicts cannot be overturned within France. Fillon, now 71 years old and no longer actively involved in politics, was originally sentenced to four years in prison, with three years suspended and one year to be served. He was also fined €375,000 and banned from voting for ten years. His wife, Penelope, received two years' suspended sentence, the same fine, and a two-year ban on voting. Mark Joula was sentenced to three years' suspended sentence and a five-year ban on holding public office. However, in May 2022, the Court of Cassation in Paris decided to review part of the sentence. The Court of Cassation found that there was not enough justification for the one year of imprisonment that Fillon was required to serve. Today, the prosecutor's representative requested that Fillon be sentenced to four years' suspended sentence, a fine of €375,000, and a ten-year ban on voting, completely waiving the part of the sentence that required real imprisonment. This means that, despite being found guilty, the former Prime Minister is unlikely to be imprisoned. The trial against François Fillon has become an important precedent in French politics. It was the 'Penelopegate' scandal, which accused Fillon's wife of being employed fictitiously and the subsequent trial, that led to Fillon's defeat in the 2017 presidential election: his campaign was damaged, and he did not make it to the second round.
