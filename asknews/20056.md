**Cavallo Insists: Government Must Accumulate Reserves to Avoid 'Exchange Rate and Financial Instability'**
Former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo emphasized the importance of accumulating dollar reserves for the government, stating that it 'will benefit stability and growth'. He also argued that the purchase of dollars by the Central Bank will allow for the acceleration of the re-monetization process, which aims to increase credit in both pesos and dollars. Cavallo noted that Argentina's economy is 'heavily indebted in foreign currencies and practically has no external credit', making it necessary to hold external reserves. He also suggested that the government should allow for the multiplication of credit in dollars through financial intermediation with fractional reserve requirements, and that the Central Bank should have sufficient liquid reserves to provide liquidity in dollars. According to Cavallo, the current levels of monetization are 'barely at the level of September 2019', and the country's deposits (in pesos and dollars) are 'only $105 billion, equivalent to 17% of GDP', which is significantly lower than neighboring countries or the decade of convertibility in Argentina. Cavallo concluded that 'a good level of own reserves will allow for lower interest rates, eliminate the expectation of future devaluations due to a delayed exchange rate, and minimize the risks of exchange rate and financial instability'.

**Argentina's Economy Experiences Heterogeneous Recovery**
Argentina's economy is experiencing a heterogeneous recovery, with some sectors showing significant growth while others are struggling. According to the Estimador Mensual de Actividad Económica (EMAE), the economy grew 6.1% in March compared to the same period last year. However, the base of comparison is low due to the recession in 2024. The construction sector is still in a slump, with a 45% decline in April compared to the same month in 2023. The industry sector is also struggling, with a 9.4% decline in 2024 compared to the previous year. The consumption sector is showing signs of recovery, with a 0.1% increase in April compared to the same month in 2024. The credit sector is driving the growth of durable goods, particularly in the automotive industry. The agro-industrial sector is also performing well, with a 56% increase in exports in 2024. The energy sector is contributing to the country's trade surplus, with a $2.684 million surplus in the first four months of 2025. 'The economy is experiencing a false V-shaped recovery, it's an illusion. There are sectors that are growing and others that are declining,' said Esteban Domecq, economist at Invecq. 'The consumption sector is still in a slump, and the construction sector is still in a slump. The industry sector is also struggling,' added Diego Giacomini, economist. 'The economy is recovering, but it's not a sustainable recovery. It's a rebound effect,' said a source from the sector.

**Argentine assets put to the test by new tension in the global commercial war**
Following the recent debt issuance, there was a surge in tension over the official dollar rate as the city evaluated that the interest rate set a higher floor for the dollar. Investors will receive 29.5% annual interest in pesos while delivering US dollars, and although the term is until 2030, they have the option to exercise a put option in 2027 before the elections, as detailed in the report. While this led to a rise in the dollar, it also had a positive impact on bonds, which saw an increase in value after the news. However, in the last days of the week, the actions felt the return of international instability and had a cut in the value of the Merval, as added from Bell. The rumor also began to circulate that the International Monetary Fund would postpone the review of the Central Bank's reserves, led by Santiago Bausili, after the news of the debt placement that would help to increase the reserves. According to the credit international organization, the BCRA should have at least $4,000 million above the current targets. This week, the Government will also provide new details on the plan to incorporate the dollars that are outside the system into the bank. It is worth noting that two weeks have passed since the Minister of Economy, Luís Caputo, informed the increase in the amounts to be reported to ARCA in the transfers. Finally, with the closure of May, the consultants also closed their studies on the inflation of the fifth month of the year, all of which are around 2% monthly, but some risk that the figure would start with one. If so, the Government would achieve a new victory in its main goal.

**How the 'Plan Colchón' Can Boost the Economy and Benefited Sectors**
Argentina's Minister of Economy, Luis Caputo, explained to entrepreneurs that the goal behind the 'plan colchón' and the circulation of dollars is to increase private credit. The minister met with sector leaders who have a higher chance of pushing 'dollarization endógena'. Caputo stated that a 'healthy macro' makes people demand more money, and that Argentina has enough money to continue growing, but it needs to circulate to do so. The circulation of money, which the minister speculates will be dollars, would increase formalization, recaudation, and the availability of funds for banks to increase their credit capacity. The minister noted that banks are returning to lending to the private sector, with credit to the private sector increasing from 4% of GDP to 9%. The minister also mentioned that formalization and the decrease in inflation would fuel demand, and that he asked the Association of Automobile Manufacturers to sell directly in dollars and start facturing in dollars. The sector that has received the most dynamism is the automotive sector, with 54,001 units patented in April, a 63.9% increase compared to the same period last year. The credit has been a dynamizer of consumption, particularly of durable goods, since the beginning of President Javier Milei's administration.

**Argentina's Economy Faces Challenges as Election Season Approaches**
The Argentine economy is facing challenges as the country approaches the election season. The peso has been stable, but the demand for dollars has increased, causing concerns for the government. Luis Caputo, the Minister of Economy, has assured that the country's economic model is developed to prevent a currency shock. However, the problem is that many farmers are not selling their soybean harvest at the current dollar price, preferring to wait for the outcome of the elections. According to a consultant, 'the producers do not want to sell at this dollar price. And many do not care that there is only one month left with the benefit of the reduction of retentions. They prefer to wait and see what happens after the elections.' The country's cereal producers have recognized that they have liquidated around $3,000 million in dollars during May, but the Banco Central did not buy any dollars, and the private sector acquired the total amount. Economists Tomás Rodríguez Zurro and Emilce Terré estimate that the first semester will close with a liquidation of around $18,200 million, a 26% increase from the first semester of 2024. However, they project that in the second half of the year, without the tax incentives, the flow of dollars will moderate and be around $13,400 million, 17% less than in the second semester of last year. The government needs to start receiving the dollars from the 'colchón' and the financial capitals that are waiting for the reduction of the 'riesgo país' to buy Argentine debt bonds. The government does not show any concern about the incipient deficit of the current account, but the superavit commercial has decreased in recent times, and for April it was around $200 million, which is very little for the requirements of the economy.

**Argentina's Economy Minister Proposes 'Dollarization' of Car Sales**
Argentina's Minister of Economy, Luis Caputo, met with representatives of the automotive industry and proposed a key measure: allowing the purchase of cars in dollars, either upfront or in installments. The initiative aims to boost sales and attract dollars in the face of a lack of pesos. Toyota has announced that it and its network of dealers will begin accepting dollars as a form of payment for its vehicles, including its luxury brand Lexus. This move comes after executives from the automotive industry, including Toyota's CEO Gustavo Salinas, met with Minister Caputo. Salinas stated, 'The authorization of payment options in dollars is an alternative that seeks to expand the possibilities for our clients in accessing the acquisition of 0 km vehicles. This is in line with the search to offer quality products and increasingly better services and conditions to our clients.' According to Adefa, the production of automobiles in April 2025 grew by 5.8% year-over-year, with 45,479 units produced compared to 42,974 in the same month in 2024. In the first four months of the year, the industry has already produced 159,521 units, a 9.1% increase over the same period last year.

**Argentina's Economic Woes: A False Calm According to Economist Laura Testa**
According to economist Laura Testa, the situation in Argentina is not improving. Poverty is on the rise, and purchasing power is decreasing. In the second half of 2024, 38% of the population lived below the poverty line. Most categories of expenses, such as clothing and food, have reached prices equivalent to those in Europe. The Bigmac index, which compares the price of a hamburger worldwide, ranks Argentina second, behind only Switzerland. The median salary in Argentina is estimated at 400 euros, while in Switzerland it is 7,000 euros. Despite President Javier Milei's promise to switch to the dollar and curb inflation, the country has not seen significant improvements. The inflation rate in April 2025 was 2.8%, a figure shared with pride on the Ministry of Economy's Twitter account. However, Laura Testa believes that this low inflation rate is due to budget cuts in public sectors and the influx of dollars from international loans. 'We economists think this calm is a false calm. Inflation is low because of the dollars that entered with these loans. But once this amount of dollars is depleted...' Testa warns. To stabilize its economy, Argentina needs dollars. The government has announced a measure to encourage citizens to deposit their dollars in the bank, but so far, most people keep their savings in cash, preventing the state from accessing this money. Testa believes that this measure is insufficient: 'Milei responds to economic dogmas, follows strategies, but does not reform the Argentine system.' The country remains heavily dependent on its agricultural production, which generates little revenue. Testa suggests that the government could exploit and export the recently discovered copper reserves. She also criticizes the government's policy of giving away resources to international companies, which have no obligation to leave dollars in the country after two years.

**The Paradox of Economic Success Without Well-being in Argentina**
Argentina's economic indicators show improvement, but the reality for many citizens remains unchanged. The government highlights achievements such as inflation deceleration, IMF support, and fiscal surplus, but the gap between numbers and social reality persists. The Minister of Economy, Luis Caputo, emphasizes the importance of macroeconomic normalization, but the microeconomic situation remains unequal. The society values inflation deceleration and exchange rate stability, but does not perceive a concrete improvement in its purchasing power. This limits the impact of technical advances on politics and society. The situation can be summarized as a paradox: economic fundamentals improve, but well-being does not follow at the same pace. The causes are multiple, including social expectations and patience. The government aims for a strong economic recovery in the second half of 2025, but the margin of social patience is not infinite. If stabilization does not translate into tangible benefits for households, SMEs, and workers, social support could weaken. The government faces a classic challenge: sustaining macroeconomic order without neglecting the social fabric that must sustain it over time. This challenge will become even more relevant when the government initiates structural reforms in 2026.

**Argentina Sees Opportunity for Growth Under President Milei's Economic Plan**
Argentine President Javier Milei has stated that the country is in a position to resume economic growth after ratifying its program based on macroeconomic order, zero deficit, and the promotion of strategic productive sectors. According to Milei, the strong fiscal adjustment, estimated at 15% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), allowed for a reduction in the deficit in the Treasury and the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA), which, in his opinion, has paved the way for inflation to cease next year. 'Closing the fiscal deficit meant stopping the emission of money, and that ensures that by mid-2026, inflation will be a thing of the past,' Milei said, highlighting that the real public expenditure fell by 30%, a step he considered key to achieving a sustainable economy. The president also argued that these measures create conditions for a recovery of private investment. In this sense, he argued that the primary surplus improves 'inter-temporal' solvency and that, consequently, 'the country risk will collapse,' implying 'lower interest rates and, with it, greater capital accumulation.' Milei also stated that '10 million Argentines have left poverty,' linking this data to the reduction in inflation and macroeconomic stability. He emphasized that sectors such as oil, gas, mining, agriculture, nuclear development, and artificial intelligence present a huge potential to drive the economy and attract large investments, particularly through the Regime of Incentives for Large Investments (RIGI). 'We are facing an enormous opportunity for growth (...) There are sectors that offer broad opportunities, there are lower interest rates due to the decrease in country risk, there is less inflationary distortion and lower tax pressure (due to growth and expansion of the taxable base due to lower tax rates and regulations), so there are grounds to bet on the country,' he said. He added that a stronger peso should not cause alarm, as the foreign exchange that enters through strategic exports will dynamize the non-tradable sector of the economy, such as services, where, according to him, there is greater employment intensity and speed of job creation.'

**Caputo Insists on Dollarization and Urges Businesses to Invoice in Dollars**
Argentina's Economy Minister, Luis Caputo, has reiterated his proposal to start facturing in dollars in various sectors of the economy. He argued that 'it's almost more logical for the remonetization to occur in dollars, because there are almost ten times more dollars than pesos.' Caputo suggested that businesses start facturing in dollars, and also proposed that automakers launch plans of payment or savings that are factured directly in dollars. He explained that in contexts of macroeconomic disorder, 'no matter how many pesos you inject, they always seem to be enough.' However, he noted that with the economy more ordered, the demand for pesos has started to grow, but warned that the amount of pesos in circulation is still low. He stated, 'If we don't manage to remonetize the economy, to have more money circulating, there will come a time when you'll be left without gasoline.'

**Argentina's Economy: A Shift Towards the Peso**
The recent auction of the new Bono del Tesoro (Bonte) at 2030 has shown what investors expect for the next years in an economy that is becoming more attractive to domestic currency due to higher returns. This change in monetary preferences makes sense, as fiscal and monetary reforms are necessary to make dollarization unnecessary. The expected inflation rate for 2026 is around 15% or less, making the 29.5% annual return on the Bonte 2030 a promising investment. However, this is only possible if the Plan Milei is successful and the populist government does not return to power in Argentina. Some analysts are cautious, but the majority of investors are optimistic about the future of the peso. The government is also working to make the peso more attractive, with plans to sell cars in dollars and offer credits in dollars at 10% annual interest. The goal is to make the peso a more stable and reliable currency, and to reduce the country's reliance on the dollar.

**Argentina's Economy: Forecasts Revised Upwards Following IMF Agreement**
Following the new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the removal of the currency control, various consultancies and banks have revised their forecasts for the official dollar, inflation, and GDP upwards. According to the LatinFocus Consensus Forecast, the GDP is expected to grow by 4.8% this year, and 3.5% in 2026. The inflation projection for the end of 2025 is 29.1% (2.5 points higher than the previous estimate), and 18.8% for 2026. The dollar official major is expected to reach $1306 by the end of 2025 (a 14.3% increase from yesterday's close), while the blue is expected to be at $1437. For 2026, the expected prices are $1510 and $1572, respectively. The experts predict that the peso will depreciate to $1306.4 per dollar by the end of 2025 and $1509.8 by the end of 2026. 'The growth of the GDP for 2025 should be more than double the Latin American average, driven by the financial support from the IMF, lower price pressure, and lower interest rates, and less government intervention in the economy,' explained. 'However, it is likely that the dry climate will limit agricultural production,' they added. 'The inflation will continue to decrease in the future thanks to a high base of comparison, fiscal moderation, deregulation, and reduced import restrictions. However, the dry climate and peso depreciation will exert upward pressure,' warned.

**Argentina's Economy Shifts Towards a New Normalcy**
The Argentine economy is shifting towards a new normalcy after the agreement with the IMF and the start of the third phase of the program. The daily tension over the entry of reserves to the BCRA and the anxiety about knowing if the Government would have a sufficient volume of fresh dollars from the Fund to lift the currency control, conditioned almost all the decisions of the private sector. However, now the scenario is focused on a new sense of normality, with a floating exchange rate scheme that does not provide guarantees but transparent rules of the game, and an activity level that can become more dependent on the capital that enters than on the level of internal consumption. According to the economic team, 'volatility is no longer the exception, it may become the norm.' They defend the end of currency intervention and assure that one should not look obsessively at the reserve targets agreed with the IMF. The Government feels that it has more elements to inject calm into the market and that with that, it can advance without surprises. In a few days, the operation of recompra of non-transferable bonds will be concretized, which will allow the BCRA to capitalize with more than $12,000 million, with which it will be able to face any demand for dollars that may be generated by imports, service payments, or tourism. The agricultural sector is still evaluating whether to accelerate or not, as it must resolve how much stock it will keep and how much product it will sell to face debts and payments of inputs. The producers still do not feel adapted to this new normality, as for them, the tax pressure is a component as relevant as the price of soy and the value of the dollar, and no one has worked on this subject yet. Luis Caputo and his team have made some more explicit promises, but they understand that they will have to wait for the new Congress to materialize reform projects. The 2026 context is a bit far away. The Fund has resolved a good part of the dollar equation that the BCRA needs, but the rest must come from the external trade. It is time to work on internal competitiveness. Lowering a tax rate, worrying about the cost of ARTs, evaluating what happens with ports and routes, are tasks that also affect the daily decisions that drive the economy. It is an election year, but for the Government, it must also be the year of focusing on the micro.

**Milei Confirms Plan to Fully Dollarize the Economy**
Argentine President Javier Milei confirmed that he still maintains the plan to fully dollarize the economy. He revealed that his original intention was to set the lower band of the new floating exchange rate scheme below $1,000, and even stated that he could remove all pesos from the economy at a exchange rate of $911. 'We are too good at setting the floor of the band at $1,000, we should set it lower', Milei said. He also stated that the factors of the economy will push the exchange rate down: 'The indicators say that the exchange rates have to fall, the monetary factors of Argentina lead to that'. Milei denied that the new scheme implies a hidden devaluation, and said that the current value of the dollar has already fallen from $1,400 to $1,195. He also stated that if the exchange rate falls to the floor of the band, the state will start buying dollars. 'If this were not the case, tell me why the International Monetary Fund assumes that we will buy 4,000 dollars. Where do we buy them? At the floor of the band', he explained. Milei detailed that the system of bands is divergent: the upper band rises 1% monthly, while the lower band falls at the same rate. According to his vision, this dynamic favors a sustained fall in the exchange rate, which would facilitate an eventual dollarization. 'I can take all the money out of the economy at $911 pesos', he commented, and then added: 'At the ceiling of the band, I take all the pesos out of the economy and I have $15,000 million dollars left'. When asked if he will advance with the dollarization, Milei replied that 'it is a decision of the individuals' and added: 'We propose the endogenous dollarization and they did not respond, they use pesos. If people decide to have them, they have them, what are we going to do. But the possibilities are open'. Thus, the president hinted that he has not abandoned his plan to eliminate the peso as a currency.

**Argentina's Economy: Market Analysts' Predictions for the Next Months**
According to market analysts, the blue dollar is expected to close the year at around $1.340 and reach $1.484 in December of next year. 'Both types of exchange rates will weaken compared to current levels by the end of 2025', they noted in the report. The predictions reflect the impact of the monetary policy of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA), which reduced the devaluation of the official dollar from 2% to 1% monthly, following a slowdown in inflation. The Consumer Price Index (IPC) fell to 66.9% year-over-year in February, down from 84.5% in January, reaching its lowest level since June 2022. 'It is expected that the pressure on prices will decrease even more due to a solid base from last year, fiscal moderation, commercial deregulation, reduced taxes on goods, and a less pronounced depreciation of the currency under the floating exchange rate regime', they indicated in the report. LatinFocus estimates that inflation will close 2025 with a rise of 42.9%, implying a downward revision of 2.4 percentage points compared to the previous projection. For 2026, the forecast is 24.5%. The report also addressed the prospects of the GDP, which showed a 1.2% increase in the fourth quarter of 2024 on a seasonally adjusted basis. 'Our consensus is that the GDP will grow strongly in the first quarter of 2025, driven by lower inflation, lower interest rates, improved agricultural and energy production, and the positive impact of liberalizing reforms', the analysts stated. However, they warned that 'the available data has been disappointing'. In January, industrial production and exports fell, while the dry weather could affect the agricultural harvest. Another key factor will be the negotiation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to LatinFocus, a new agreement would allow the government to meet its debt obligations and lift capital controls, which could impact the economic recovery in the medium term. With these factors at play, the Argentine economy faces crucial months where inflation, the dollar exchange rate, and growth will be the main focus of attention for the market.

**Argentina's Economy: A Path to Dollarization**
The probable agreement with the IMF, lifting the currency controls and the high interest rate in pesos, will lead to a gradual and constant dollarization of the economy. The government aims to increase the stock of reserves to $50 billion by 2025, which is a very ambitious goal. The high interest rates in pesos, up to 35% annual, will make bonds in pesos adjusted for inflation decrease, while the high interest rates for borrowers, up to 42% annual, will make it difficult for companies to finance themselves. The government will try to capitalize the Central Bank of Argentina, which will buy debt from the bank to transform illiquid assets into liquid dollars. The main source of purchases for the Central Bank are dollar-denominated loans from the financial system. The government will maintain a wide base of money frozen at $47.7 billion, which will lead to a large market illiquidity, high interest rates in pesos, and a consumption that will suffer due to lack of financing at reasonable rates. The best investment is in letters (lecaps) and capitalizable bonds (boncaps or duales), especially capitalizable dual bonds (which adjust for a fixed rate of 2.25% monthly or Tamar rate, whichever is higher). If there is an agreement with the IMF, the country risk should fall to the 450-500 points zone, and if the currency controls are lifted, the target will be 350-400 points. It's a good time to have sovereign bonds in dollars. Stocks should arbitrate the increase, but it's essential to be selective based on the incoming balance sheets, there is value in local companies. Internationally, it's attractive to have euros and invest in the Brazilian stock exchange. The American stock market will continue with high volatility due to President Trump's decisions.

**Bank of America Predicts Argentine Economy to Grow with New IMF Agreement**
Bank of America, a major Wall Street bank, has released a report predicting the future of the Argentine economy. The report, titled 'Weeks that feel like years', focuses on Argentina's economic and financial situation, and recommends investing in Argentine dollar-denominated sovereign bonds. The bank gives a 'Overweight' rating, expressing optimism about the possibility of Argentina reaching a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the coming months. According to the report, a successful agreement would boost the country's economy, thanks to the expected disbursement of funds and the potential implementation of fiscal measures that would stimulate growth. The report also discusses the projected evolution of the exchange market in Argentina, marked by a possible gradual lifting of capital controls by the end of 2025. The government is reportedly optimistic about reaching an agreement with the IMF by April of this year, opening the door to new economic growth in the near future. Javier Milei, a prominent Argentine politician, has also expressed confidence in his promise to eliminate capital controls on January 1, 2026, potentially marking a shift in the country's exchange rate policy. The report predicts that the dollar will rise to $1.070 in the first quarter of 2025, $1.170 in the second quarter, $1.250 in the third quarter, and $1.400 by the end of the year, indicating a 33% increase in the dollar's value and a 25% devaluation of the peso over the course of 2025.

**Argentina's Economy: A Unique Challenge**
Argentina's economy is unique in that it does not have a currency that serves as a store of value due to decades of high inflation. As a result, the US dollar has become the primary price index in the country. The government claims to be ultra-monetary, but its actions are heterodox, as it focuses on fixing the price of the dollar. The key factors that determined the economy in 2024 were the draconian spending cuts and the encouragement of foreign exchange inflows through money laundering, which added around $30 billion to the internal supply of foreign exchange. However, this has led to a revaluation of the peso, which has artificially increased demand for foreign exchange, discouraging exports and creating a replacement effect for domestic production. This has resulted in a tense exchange market and the destruction of the labor market. In 2025, the variables that determine the price of the dollar, such as its supply and demand, will be crucial in predicting the economy's performance. The demand for dollars is expected to increase due to debt payments and the low price of the dollar, which will encourage imports. On the other hand, the supply of dollars is expected to decrease due to the lack of investment and the exit of large companies such as Telefónica, Mercedes Benz, and Procter & Gamble. The government's reliance on external debt to finance its deficit is a concern, and the true question is whether the economy will be able to meet its future obligations, including the new and massive ones that will be created in the process.

**Argentina's Economy: A 'Punto Anker' and the Fear of Devaluation**
The Argentine government is confident that the country's economy is on the right track, despite market volatility. The economic team believes that the risk country, which reached 700 points, is temporary. They think that the reduced predisposition of investors towards Argentina, which is now looking at Brazil after a strong punishment in 2024, was predictable. The big Wall Street funds that maintain their positions are not adding more to their portfolios, but nor are they selling. They also praise the economic plan of Luis Caputo and Javier Milei. The cherry on top is the agreement with the IMF, which Milei and Caputo confirmed will be imminent and will have fresh funds. The Minister of Economy said it will be in the first quarter. A high-ranking official at Casa Rosada, who enjoys the full support of the President, summarized it as: 'With the agreement with the Fund and the elections, we will crush it because the economy is our greatest asset, no one will doubt this process.' The official view is that there are few milestones left to clear the field completely. After that, doubts will no longer exist. 'I don't know, ask the President' said the official when asked about the possibility of lifting the currency controls in 2026. However, the economic team is optimistic about the future, with Morgan Stanley's Latin America chief, Fernando Sedano, saying that the economy has recovered faster and stronger than expected, and that 2025 looks promising. However, they also acknowledge that the currency risk remains a challenge. The government has launched a bond tied to the official exchange rate, which had little demand, leading some to believe that the market does not think the dollar is undervalued. The director of the Central Bank, Federico Furiase, explained that this is a positive sign, as it means the market does not think the government will devalue the currency, regardless of its current value. The government is also trying to reassure investors that the currency controls will be lifted, but the director of the Central Bank, Federico Furiase, said that the government will not be able to lift the controls completely in 2026, as the President had promised. Joaquín Cottani, a former economic advisor to Caputo, warned that the fear of devaluation is still present, and that the government needs to convince the market that the currency controls will not be lifted after the elections.

**Argentina's Economic Recovery: A Mixed Picture**
The first year of Argentina's new economic management has seen a contrast between sectors that have capitalized on new policies and those that have been left behind. Fiscal consolidation and monetary stability, praised by markets, have had a heterogeneous impact on different activities. While some sectors are emerging stronger, others face a challenging future amidst the adjustment that will continue this year. According to economist Camilo Tiscornia, 'Without respect for the minimum macroeconomic balances, there are no positive results.' Tiscornia highlights that macroeconomic stability is an indispensable condition for any sectoral development. Ernesto O'Connor, economist specializing in economic policy and growth, notes that the fiscal balance and the incipient bimonetarism have been key drivers for restoring market confidence. However, the type of exchange rate remains a major challenge, particularly after the crawling peg fell from 2% to 1%. Tiscornia emphasizes that Argentina 'does not have a high exchange rate destiny.' The sectors with sustainable competitive advantages are emerging as the main beneficiaries. Mining and energy, with lithium and Vaca Muerta leading the way, are consolidating as pillars of the recovery. The agro sector, a traditional export driver, faces an ambiguous reality. Although it remains a dynamic sector with extraordinary competitive advantages, the fall in international prices and the exchange rate lag have generated the need to review the tax pressure. The government has taken note and lowered the retentions on main crops, while eliminating export duties on regional economies. However, not everyone shares this optimism. The manufacturing industry, partly dependent on subsidies and protectionist tariffs, faces the challenge of adapting to a more open economic environment. According to Chameides, 'the reconfiguration of international trade and the reduced protection will require greater efficiency and competitiveness from companies in this new context.' The construction sector has been hit by the slowdown in public works and the increase in dollar costs, and it fell 27.4% in 2024, according to the Indec. However, in December it showed a monthly seasonally adjusted growth of 3.1%. The real estate market managed to reconcile a 40% growth in operations in 2024, driven mainly by mortgage credits and capital whitening. It is expected that the expansion will continue this year, supported by greater economic stability and reforms in rental laws. In commerce, the prospects are more encouraging. Chameides highlights that 'the rebound of real wages, the improvement in consumer confidence, and the greater availability of credit will be key to its recovery.' This optimism is also based on the stabilization of inflationary expectations, which could consolidate if the government manages to maintain the fiscal balance. Despite these advances, structural challenges persist that limit growth. The tax system, loaded with distortions such as the check tax, Ingreso Brutos, and export duties, is a barrier that hinders investment and job creation. 'To sustain the recovery, it is essential to reduce the 'Argentine cost,' which implies reforms in taxes, labor costs, and infrastructure improvements,' emphasizes Chameides. 'The key for this year will be to consolidate the macroeconomic advances while laying the foundations for a sustainable microeconomic transformation. This requires identifying and strengthening strategic sectors, as well as implementing ambitious but viable reforms,' concludes O'Connor.
