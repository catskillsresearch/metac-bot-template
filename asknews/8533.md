**Xi Jinping's Use of Hu Jintao's Phrase Sparks Speculation About CCP Leadership Change**
Chinese President Xi Jinping has recently emphasized the importance of 'scientific decision-making, democratic decision-making, and law-based decision-making' in the context of the '15th Five-Year Plan' (2026-2030). This phrase was a hallmark of former Chinese leader Hu Jintao, who last used it in 2012. Experts believe that Xi's use of this phrase is a sign that he is losing power and that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may be undergoing a significant change in its leadership structure. According to Wang He, a China expert, Xi's use of Hu's phrase is 'a testament to the fact that the CCP's highest leadership has undergone a significant change, and that Xi's power is waning.' Wang He also notes that the CCP has a history of using different phrases to describe its leadership style, and that Xi's use of Hu's phrase is a sign that the party is returning to its collective leadership model. 'In the CCP's political tradition, the pendulum can swing in the opposite direction at any time,' Wang He said. 'The CCP's leadership structure is undergoing a significant change, and this is a sign that the party is returning to its collective leadership model.' Shen Mingxiong, a researcher at the Taiwan Defense Security Research Institute, also believes that the CCP's leadership structure is undergoing a significant change. 'The CCP's leadership structure is undergoing a significant change, and this is a sign that the party is returning to its collective leadership model,' Shen said. 'The CCP's internal power struggle is very intense, and if a consensus is formed, the 4th Plenary Session of the 20th CCP Central Committee can be held to adjust Xi's position; if a consensus is not formed, Xi will still remain on the stage and continue to perform; if Xi himself cooperates, he will quietly step down after the 21st CCP National Congress.' However, the outcome is still uncertain.

**Xi Jinping's Power Eroding, Chinese Leadership to See Significant Changes**
Chinese President Xi Jinping has recently emphasized the importance of 'scientific decision-making, democratic decision-making, and law-based decision-making' in a speech on the '15th Five-Year Plan' (2026-2030). This phrase, which was previously used by former Chinese leader Hu Jintao, has not been heard in years. Experts believe that this is another sign of Xi's power being eroded, and that there may be significant changes in the Chinese leadership in the coming months. According to Wang He, a China expert, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is very particular about the language used by its leaders, and Xi's use of Hu's phrase is a sign that the CCP's power structure has undergone significant changes. The CCP's '15th Five-Year Plan' spans 2027, and if the CCP holds its 21st National Congress in 2027, Xi's ability to continue as the top leader will be closely watched. Recently, there have been frequent rumors that Xi will step down, and overseas social media has reported that the CCP Central Committee held a political bureau meeting on May 14 to discuss whether Xi will retire this year or delay his retirement until the 21st National Congress. Shen Mingxiong, a researcher at the Taiwan Defense Security Research Institute, said that there have been many rumors about Xi losing power within the party. From the surface, the use of the phrase 'the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping as the core' has become less frequent, indicating that Xi's power has weakened. Additionally, high-ranking officials affiliated with Xi have been purged one by one, which is likely a result of the anti-Xi faction's efforts. The current situation in the CCP is that the surface is maintained, but the underlying power struggle is very obvious. Wang He said that the CCP's internal factional struggle is very intense, and if a consensus is formed, the 4th Plenary Session of the 20th CCP Central Committee can be held to 'adjust' Xi's position; if no consensus is reached, Xi will still remain on the stage to continue performing; if Xi himself cooperates, he will likely step down quietly at the 21st National Congress. However, the outcome is still difficult to predict. Shen Mingxiong believes that the CCP's 4th Plenary Session has not been confirmed to take place at a specific time, and the longer the delay, the more variables there will be. Because Xi may use other means to provoke conflicts, delay or prevent the 4th Plenary Session from taking place, and prevent the anti-Xi faction's planned power arrangement from being implemented. He suggests that neighboring countries should pay attention to the possible changes in the CCP's internal politics in the coming months and prepare accordingly, such as: if the CCP suddenly provokes external conflicts, how to respond? If Xi insists on continuing to extend his term, how to respond? Or if a new leader takes over, what kind of policies will they adopt, and international communities should be prepared.

**New leadership navigates China on right course**
China has ushered in new leadership of its State bodies, with Xi Jinping being elected president by unanimous vote. Li, born in July 1959, was appointed premier by Xi. The NPC endorsed the nominations made by Premier Li for four vice-premiers and five state councilors. Analysts believe the new lineups of State bodies are characterized by their rich work experience at local levels and strong professional expertise, which will help them navigate the growth of the economy through various headwinds. Veronika S. Saraswati, a researcher at the Jakarta-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, 'China really focuses on research and development. That is why China's development is very scientific, which has even surpassed European countries.' Syed Ali Nawaz Gilani, secretary-general of the Pakistan China Friendship Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, said that China is expected to advance the Belt and Road Initiative, which will provide more opportunities for other economies.

**Xi Jinping's Unexpected Reference to Hu Jintao's Farewell Speech: A Sign of China's Political Future at a Crossroads**
Chinese President Xi Jinping has unexpectedly referenced a farewell speech by former leader Hu Jintao, in which he emphasized the importance of 'scientific', 'democratic', and 'law-based' decision-making. This has sparked debate, as Xi has been criticized for consolidating power and suppressing dissent since taking office. According to Nikkei Asia Review, Xi's sudden reference to Hu's speech is 'worth noting' and suggests that China's political future is at a critical juncture in 2025. The speech, delivered by Hu in 2012, called for strengthening party supervision, democratic supervision, and legal supervision to ensure the people's right to supervise and ensure that power operates in the sunlight. In contrast, Xi has strengthened the party's top-down decision-making and concentrated power in his own hands. The sudden reference to Hu's speech has raised questions about whether Xi is facing pressure from within the party or whether he is trying to send a message to the public. The article also notes that China's economic growth has slowed significantly since the housing market bubble burst and the long-term COVID-19 lockdowns, making it unlikely that China will surpass the US as the world's largest economy in the short term. The article concludes that the 2025-2030 economic plan is crucial for Xi, and that the success or failure of this plan will determine the fate of his ambitious 2035 goal to surpass the US.

**Xi Jinping’s plan to beat America at AI**
US Vice-President J.D. Vance described the development of artificial intelligence (AI) as an 'arms race' with China, warning that pausing AI development due to safety concerns could lead to the US being 'enslaved to PRC-mediated AI'. The idea of a superpower showdown in AI has been circulating in Washington, with tech leaders lobbying for lighter regulation and US President Donald Trump brokering an AI deal with the UAE to ensure American 'dominance in AI'. The US plans to spend over US$1 trillion on data centres for AI models by 2030.

**Del Pacífico al futuro compartido: China y América Latina consolidan su relación estratégica**
This year marks 10 years since Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the idea of a 'shared future community' between China and Latin America and the Caribbean (ALC) in Brazil. Since then, the initiative has taken shape through emblematic projects in infrastructure, trade, education, and healthcare, with Chile being a key player. Chile was the first country to sign a Free Trade Agreement with China and is now a crucial partner in the Belt and Road Initiative. The bilateral trade between the two regions has skyrocketed, reaching $500 billion, and Chinese investment has exceeded $600 billion. Locally, Chinese companies have driven high-impact projects and educational programs such as scholarships and technical training. Chile, along with Peru and Ecuador, is part of a select group with modernized free trade agreements with Beijing, facilitating economic integration in a rapidly changing world. Looking ahead to the next decade, the challenge will be to elevate cooperation to high-value areas such as digitalization, green development, technological innovation, and global governance. 'From Santiago to Shenzhen, mutual commitment aims to forge a more inclusive, sustainable, and beneficial alliance for the people,' said the article, highlighting Chile's position to lead the next chapter of the China-ALC community.

**The Political Thought of Xi Jinping: Party's history beyond question**
The book 'The Political Thought of Xi Jinping' by Steve Tsang and Olivia Cheung provides an in-depth analysis of Xi Jinping's ideology and its implications for China and the world. Xi Jinping Thought aims to make China great again and is driven by the agenda of creating 'one state, one people, one ideology, one party, and one leader'. The authors argue that Xi intends his Thought to guide the Party in steering the country and that it has strong global implications. Xi has introduced the 'Xi Jinping Thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era' and has abolished the term limit on the presidency, allowing him to rule for life. The authors contextualise Xi Jinping Thought, its shortcomings and strengths, and where it may be directed. They conclude that 'for all intents and purposes [Xi Jinping Thought] is already being treated as a proto-ideology and gives a broad-brush but clear outline of where Xi aims to take China until 2050 or at least while he stays in power'. The authors have successfully painted a picture of what China looks like under Xi and how it is different from earlier regimes.

**Chinese Dissident Yu Jie: China Won't Attack Taiwan in 2027, at Least Not During Trump's Presidency**
Chinese dissident Yu Jie believes that China will not attack Taiwan in 2027, at least not during Trump's presidency. According to Yu, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party's leaders are 'cowards who bully the weak and fear the strong.' Yu attributes this to the fact that when a strong leader like Trump is in power, Xi Jinping is less likely to take action. However, if a weak leader like Biden is in power, Xi Jinping's chances of taking action increase. Yu advises Taiwanese friends to 'stay vigilant but not too anxious.' Yu's own experience with Chinese authorities began in 2011, when he was leaving China. He recalls that Chinese security personnel tried to suppress his thoughts, talking about China's rise to power and how the West would eventually miss China. Yu remembers being taken away by two business cars, with his three-year-old son waving goodbye to the security personnel. Yu says, 'I will continue to comfort Taiwanese friends, while also advising them to be vigilant, but not too anxious.'

**China Prepares 15th Five-Year Plan with Focus on Technological Innovation and Domestic Consumption**
China is preparing its 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) with a focus on technological innovation, strengthening national industry, and stimulating domestic consumption, as reported by the South China Morning Post. President Xi Jinping has called on the population to contribute suggestions for the new plan, emphasizing the importance of science and modernization as pillars of economic development. Xi stated, 'In the next five years, China's development should be driven by technological innovation, anchored in the real economy, and promote the modernization of traditional industries, ensuring the well-being of the population.' Analysts predict that the new plan will continue to prioritize advancements in high technology, manufacturing resilience, and domestic consumption growth. The goal is to achieve 'basic socialist modernization' by 2035, including increasing per capita GDP to levels comparable to moderately developed countries. Yang Weimin, former vice-chief of the Central Office for Financial and Economic Affairs, stated that China can still achieve economic growth between 4% and 4.5% from 2026 to 2030, as long as growth is driven mainly by domestic demand. Wang Yiming, vice-president of the Chinese Center for International Economic Exchanges, emphasized the need to shift to a consumption-led development model, citing increasing external commercial pressures. He stated, '[External pressure] will lead China to transform its growth model from investment and export-driven to consumption and innovation-driven.' The 15th Five-Year Plan will also address issues such as population decline, innovation gaps, and the transition of traditional sectors to new economic drivers.

**Xi Jinping Outlines China's 15th Five-Year Plan: A Shift towards National Security and Resilience**
Chinese President Xi Jinping has outlined the key features of the 15th Five-Year Plan, which will run from 2026 to 2030. The plan focuses on national security, technological self-sufficiency, and internal resilience, both economically and socially. Xi emphasized that the external challenges, particularly the slowing global economy and US pressure on China, require a fundamental rethinking of the country's development trajectory. The Party's attention is now on China's ability to withstand a long-term competition, where the goal is not just rapid economic growth but the overall stability of the Chinese political and economic system. Xi invited Party officials to be 'forward-looking' in analyzing the impact of international changes on the country and to use China's advantages to adapt and optimize the national economic structure. The development of high-quality economy is now linked to national security, with investments in key sectors like semiconductors, AI, renewable energy, and aerospace presented as both growth drivers and foundations of China's technological sovereignty. The capital, both public and private, is being channeled towards strategic industrial objectives, transforming financial markets into instruments of national policy rather than neutral allocators of efficiency. This new approach marks a transition from crisis management to long-term strategic planning, with the guiding principle being 'resistance over time' rather than 'catching up' with the US in terms of growth.

Xi emphasized the importance of good governance and ensuring development and security.

The five-year plan is a guiding document for China's medium- and long-term economic and social progress, outlining general goals, main tasks, and policy orientations for various sectors over a five-year period. Xi stressed the need to adapt to changing circumstances and understand strategic priorities during the planning process for economic and social development over the next five years.

Xi also highlighted the need to focus more on ensuring development and security, conducting a comprehensive risk assessment and evaluation of internal and external challenges, and called for efforts to improve the national security system. According to the Chinese news agency, the five-year plan has been a comprehensive development plan for China since the 1950s. The plan is formulated within a well-organized framework, combining centralized and unified leadership by the Communist Party of China's Central Committee and extensive democratic participation. In 2020, Xi led a team to draft proposals for the 14th five-year plan and long-term goals until 2035. Wang Huoyao, president of the China and Globalization Research Center, said that the successive five-year plans for China have provided unparalleled certainty to the global economy, which is crucial in a world facing deep uncertainty.

**Xi Jinping Speaks at Online Leaders Summit on Climate Change**
Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech via video link at the Online Leaders Summit on Climate Change. Xi mentioned that the world is at a crossroads, with unprecedented global changes happening at an increasingly rapid pace. He emphasized that some major countries' insistence on unilateralism and protectionism has had a significant impact on international rules and order, but history has always found a way to navigate through turbulence. Xi stated, 'As long as we increase trust, solidarity, and cooperation, we can overcome negative developments and steadily advance the world's efforts on global climate governance and progress.' Xi also announced that China will declare its national contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and economic sectors by 2035 before the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Belem, Brazil. Xi highlighted that harmony between humans and nature is a key characteristic of China's modernization, and China is a committed and leading contributor to promoting global green development. Xi said, 'Since I announced our carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets five years ago, we have built the world's largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system and the world's largest and most complete new energy industry chain.' Xi added that China is a world leader in terms of 'greening' speed and scale, and they have planted a quarter of the world's newly forested areas. Xi emphasized that China will not slow down its climate actions, reduce its international cooperation, or stop working towards building a shared future for humanity, regardless of global changes. Xi stated, 'We will genuinely adhere to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, do our best individually, and work with all parties to build a clean, beautiful, and sustainable world.'

**President Xi Jinping Leading China's big changes**
Since becoming the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 2012 and President of the People's Republic of China in 2013, Xi Jinping has led transformative changes across China. His initiatives have focused on tackling systemic challenges, fostering national unity, and positioning China as a global leader. Key achievements include a tough fight against corruption, eradicating poverty, driving economic innovation, and addressing environmental concerns. Xi's policies have left an indelible mark on the nation's development, with over four million officials disciplined, nearly 99 million rural residents lifted out of poverty, and China achieving the poverty reduction target of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule. Xi's vision for a 'moderately prosperous society' and a 'Chinese dream' seeks to unify the nation under a shared vision of rejuvenation, blending nationalism, cultural pride, and socialist values. He has also pledged to build an 'ecological civilisation', investing in solar, wind, and electric vehicle technologies, and reducing air pollution in major cities. Additionally, China has revolutionised its e-payment system, becoming a global leader in digital payments, with over 80% of daily transactions conducted via mobile platforms.

**China's Xi Jinping: All-Powerful or Firing Candidate?**
As China's National People's Congress begins on Wednesday, the government in Beijing will present itself as a stable leadership, led by the powerful Xi Jinping. However, how firmly is the 71-year-old man still in the saddle? China's economy has not regained its pre-pandemic growth rate, with banks going bankrupt, large projects being halted, and people unable to move into their purchased homes. Youth unemployment has reached a record high of around 20%. There are protests across the country, with people expressing their discontent. The Chinese government will try to suppress all signs of crisis during the National People's Congress, where the Communist Party of China will outline its direction for the coming year. It is expected that the party will once again promise 'reunification with Taiwan', strengthen industrial production, and praise itself. Xi Jinping, who has been in power since 2012, will likely continue to rule until 2032. However, how solid is this self-presentation? How powerful is Xi Jinping really? The Chinese government's one-party system has developed cracks in recent years, not only due to the economic difficulties. The government is only expecting a growth rate of around 5% for the coming year, which is not enough for a country like China with widespread poverty. The goal of eradicating poverty is moving further away. There are speculations about how unchallenged Xi Jinping is at the top. In December 2023, the British think tank Council on Geostrategy surveyed several experts. Geremie Barmé from the China Heritage Institute saw Xi Jinping in a 'dialectical trap of the unattainable', between 'revolutionary enthusiasm and political stability; economic boom and egalitarian redistribution.' Andrew Peaple, host of the podcast The Wire China, recognized no fundamental problem in this tension field: Xi's rule is quite secure, thanks to the deep-seated desire of the party for stability, he said. Unplanned leadership changes are rare, and there is no obvious alternative to Xi. Xi has systematically eliminated competitors in the party over the years. He is now surrounded by yes-men. To maintain this situation, he must continue to act. In December, Xi initiated a comprehensive overhaul of the military. Miao Hua, who was responsible for personnel in the party's military commission and was considered a trusted associate of Xi, had to step down. Shortly before, there were reports that investigations had been launched against Defense Minister Dong Jun. These developments are interesting because both Miao and Dong were promoted by Xi himself. If he distances himself from them, it suggests errors in personnel selection or growing criticism against him. This can lead to problems in the defense sector, as it reduces the deterrent effect against geopolitical rivals like the US or Japan. So unanimous as the party presents itself to the outside, it does not seem to be inside. Roger Garside, a former British diplomat in China, believes it is only a matter of time before Xi's downfall begins: 'The collapse of the real estate sector will drive many local governments into a financial crisis; this will lead to a collapse of local government services, financial institutions and companies, and to mass unrest on the streets. Then Xi's opponents, who are currently waiting for their time, will take action against him.' But when exactly is this time? Claus Soong, a security expert at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), warns against hasty conclusions. Yes, there is growing frustration in the country over Xi's stricter control of society and economic policy, but his authority has not been challenged so far. 'The protests in the country are mostly local in nature, usually related to economic problems such as low wages or unfinished construction projects. So far, they have not come together to form a national movement,' Soong said. Everything depends on the economic situation. And that is simply 'not bad enough yet'.

**Xi Jinping's Opportunity: Seizing the Moment to Lead China to Global Economic Supremacy**
Chinese President Xi Jinping has stated that China cannot be a passive observer, but rather an 'active participant, a leader' by 2050. Jinping has remained calm and confident in the face of economic turmoil caused by Donald Trump's presidency and threats against countries like China, Canada, and Mexico. Experts in geopolitics believe that Xi sees Trump's actions as an opportunity to advance his agenda of global leadership. With over 120 countries as its largest trading partner, China is projected as a reliable and attractive partner, willing to meet the needs of its clients without drama or manipulation. While Trump is at odds with his neighbors and closest partners, Jinping continues to work towards making China the world's leading economic power. He has done this by rescuing abandoned investments, supporting international organizations previously sponsored by the US, and actively participating in organizations like the World Bank. Xi has seen Trump's lack of control and desperation as an opportunity for China, as he has created spaces for business, attracted new partners, and projected a balance and stability that many want to be a part of. Jinping's goal is to guide China to become the leader of an alternative global economic order, filling the spaces left by the US, including negotiations, commercial partners, and organizations that have helped less fortunate nations. This would project China as the leader of the world order, which is how Xi sees China and for which he has worked since taking power in 2013.

**Xi Jinping Emphasizes Importance of 'Practicing What One Preaches' and 'Leading by Example' in the Military**
Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the importance of 'practicing what one preaches' and 'leading by example' in the military. He stressed that leaders must set a good example and be a model for their troops, as their actions have a significant impact on the morale and discipline of the military. Xi noted that the Communist Party's leadership is not just about giving orders, but also about setting an example and being a role model. He cited the example of Mao Zedong, who said 'follow me' and 'follow my lead' during the Long March. Xi also emphasized the importance of self-discipline and self-cultivation among leaders, saying that they must 'practice what they preach' and 'lead by example'. He warned that if leaders do not set a good example, the troops will not follow, and the military will not be able to achieve its goals. Xi concluded by saying that leaders must 'dare to take the lead' and 'dare to be a role model' in order to promote the development of the military and achieve the goal of building a strong military by 2049.
