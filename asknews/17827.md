**EU Adopts White Book of Security: A New Era for European Defense?**
European politicians have adopted the White Book of Security, which includes two sections on cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, including the creation of a joint military-industrial complex and the accumulation of 800 billion euros by 2030 for defense purposes. However, according to political scientist Oleksiy Buriachenko, the EU's bureaucratic nature is a significant obstacle. Buriachenko noted that the EU was not created as a security union, but rather as an economically horizontal confederation. He emphasized that the EU should not try to solve all of Ukraine's security and arms supply issues, as this is not its purpose. Instead, the EU should focus on its own security, which should be guaranteed by the US through NATO. Buriachenko believes that the EU has finally realized that a reset in relations with the US is inevitable. He warned that the EU's attempt to scale up arms production will require significant state orders, which may come at the expense of other programs, such as migrant support or social welfare. 'This is money that needs to be taken from somewhere,' Buriachenko said. 'For example, from programs supporting migrants, social or humanitarian spheres. If this is done, right-wing and ultra-right forces will immediately start playing on the fact that Russia is not their threat.' Buriachenko emphasized that Ukraine and Europe need to find a common system of coordinates and come to a realization that only together can they guarantee their own security without a third player. He suggested that the 'Coalition of the Willing' format, which includes countries such as the UK, Norway, and Turkey, could become a united Europe, and NATO could transform into the EU's army.

**SAFE RMMO'nun silah alımındaki 'maliyet kilidini' kaldırıyor**
The SAFE program, which is expected to be implemented by the European Union through the 'ReArm Europe 2030' plan, is expected to bring both challenges and opportunities for the Greek government. According to the weekly Kathimerini, the program will remove the 'cost barrier' for the Greek National Guard (RMMO) in acquiring weapons. The SAFE program has allocated a budget of 150 billion euros to be used by member states to strengthen their domestic defense industries, with the majority of the funds expected to be allocated to countries with established defense industries such as Germany, France, and Italy. However, the program also allows for cooperation with third countries, which has raised concerns for Greece and Cyprus, as well as Turkey, which may also be able to participate and access European funding. Despite the political hurdles, the Greek government sees the SAFE program as an opportunity to boost its domestic defense industry, with over 30 Greek companies having already signed research and development agreements with foreign companies. The program also allows for the acquisition of defense systems, including drones and software, which could be exported to other countries, and has already seen cooperation between Greek and Cypriot companies. The Greek Defense Minister, Vasilis Palmas, has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Greek Defense Minister, Nikos Dendias, for cooperation between Greek and Cypriot companies working on defense systems. The program also allows for the acquisition of defense systems from other EU member states, which could help to reduce the cost of acquiring systems such as the Leopard tank and the Marder infantry fighting vehicle. As one source from the Greek government noted, 'the production will be done with European funding, and if the companies from Cyprus or other countries are not participating, the needs will be met by European sources, and this will not affect our cooperation with the US.'

**Turkey's Military Expansion Raises Concerns in Greece**
Turkey's plan to build nuclear-powered submarines has raised concerns in Greece, which has highlighted Ankara's efforts to strengthen its military presence in the region. According to Greek media, Turkey is using the 18th Balkan General Staff Conference as a platform to accelerate its expansion into the European Union. The report states that Turkey's defense industry has created over 100,000 jobs in 3,500 companies and that exports are expected to increase by 65% by 2024. Greek media also noted that 75% of Turkish-made systems are used by NATO, and that Turkey's hosting of the 2026 NATO Summit is a significant milestone. Additionally, Greece has expressed concern over Turkey's plans to build nuclear-powered submarines, which would make it the seventh country to possess such capability. As one Greek media outlet put it, 'Turkey is encircling Europe with its military products.'

**EU's Ambitious Plan to Ditch Russian Gas by 2027 Faces Complex Challenges**
The European Union has made significant steps to reduce its dependence on Russian gas since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but the ambitious plan to completely eliminate Russian gas and LNG imports by 2027 faces complex challenges. Despite a significant decline in gas pipeline supplies, Russia still covers around 19% of the EU's gas needs through liquefied gas and the TurkStream pipeline, which passes through Turkey to supply central Europe. The European Commission has recently presented a detailed roadmap to make the energy disconnection structural. By the end of 2027, Brussels proposes to ban all Russian gas imports under existing contracts, while by 2025 it wants to introduce a ban on signing new agreements or buying Russian gas on the spot market. 'It is a challenging task, but we are committed to reducing our dependence on Russian gas,' said the European Commission. 'We need to work together to make this happen.'

**Turkey Urged to Block European Delegations from Ukraine Peace Talks**
Turkey should prioritize preventing European delegations from participating in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, according to Aydinlik Gazetesi. The article argues that European efforts to support Ukraine are actually prolonging the war, and that Turkey must take a stance against European nations that want to continue the conflict. 'The outcome of these talks should not be the same as in 2022,' the article states. 'Turkey must insist on peace and prevent Europeans who want Ukraine to continue the war.' The article also notes that European supporters of Ukraine are increasing military budgets and threatening Russia, making it absurd to try to negotiate peace. 'Given this, Europe must make a decision,' the article concludes. 'Either the EU will risk its own unity by continuing the unbearable war, or it will end it to ensure peace and tranquility.'

**Turkish Women's Basketball Team Optimistic Ahead of 2025 European Championship**
The Turkish women's basketball team, led by Derin Erdoğan and Tilbe Şenyürek, has expressed their optimism after defeating Lithuania 73-68 in a friendly match. According to Derin Erdoğan, 'We are very motivated. We have a mix of experienced and young players. As a generation, we have a diverse team. I think this is a great thing. We played two matches in France. They were very tough, physically and mentally. We learned a lot from those matches and applied them against Lithuania. I think we're doing well. We're improving with each match. We're all very excited. Hopefully, we'll get good results.' Tilbe Şenyürek added that they are working to overcome their weaknesses and become ready for the 2025 European Championship. 'We've had some losses in the preparation process. Today, we got our first win, but what's important for us is to develop our basketball skills as much as possible. We're trying to adapt to each other. There are new players, and some of us haven't seen each other in a long time. This is a disadvantage. We're in an adaptation process. Our coach had an unfortunate accident and couldn't train effectively. This has caused some difficulties for us, but we're trying to develop our basketball skills. I think we're on the right track.' Tilbe Şenyürek also expressed her happiness with the win against Lithuania, saying, 'We played a very rotational game, which caused some ups and downs in the match. If we could settle our basketball skills and make some things clearer, this match would have been different. We want to cover our weaknesses and become more cohesive as a team to be better prepared for the championship.'

**Turkey's New Weapon Raises Concerns in Greece: Ankara Rapidly Arming Itself**
Turkey's domestic defense industry initiatives have raised concerns in Greece, as reported by the Greek press. Greece criticizes Turkey's growing ties with the EU, while highlighting that Turkey's nuclear submarine plan is rare among countries. Turkey's defense industry has been making significant strides, with over 100,000 people employed by over 3,500 firms in the sector. The sector's exports are expected to increase by 65% by 2024. Greece is concerned that Turkey's inclusion in the European Security Action (SAFE) will deepen its ties with Brussels. Turkey has made significant progress in the global drone market, with a 65% share, and has also made advancements in unmanned ground and sea systems. Turkish officials have consistently emphasized Turkey's long-standing role in European defense, with 75 of its systems used by NATO, and its upcoming hosting of the 2026 NATO Summit. Turkey has also accelerated its European Union ties, using the 18th Balkan General Commanders Conference as a platform. The Greek press notes that Turkey's military products are being sold, effectively encircling Europe. Turkey is also working on a plan to build nuclear-powered submarines, with the aim of becoming the seventh country to possess this capability, as reported by the Greek press. 'Ankara is rapidly arming itself,' the Greek press stated, 'and is using the 18th Balkan General Commanders Conference as a platform to accelerate its European Union ties.'

**Turkey's Military Ambitions Leave Greece Concerned**

Greece has acknowledged Turkey's capabilities, stating that Ankara is using the 18th Balkan General Staff Conference as a platform to accelerate its European Union (EU) integration. The Greek media reported that Turkey's military products are being sold to Europe, effectively encircling the continent. Additionally, Turkey plans to build nuclear-powered submarines, aiming to become the seventh country in the world with this capability.

**EU to Strengthen Defense Cooperation with Turkey through SAFE Mechanism**
The European Union's (EU) plan to strengthen its defense strategy through the SAFE mechanism has opened the door to new partnerships, including with Turkey. Despite Greece's lobbying efforts, the EU wants to include Turkey in its defense efforts, with experts saying, 'European security efforts without Turkey are narrow-minded.' The EU, which has been forced to become more autonomous in defense and security due to pressure from the Trump administration, will increase its cooperation with Turkey through the SAFE mechanism. The EU Commission recently announced a new strategy, the White Paper, which aims to increase military spending and production by 2030, and allocate resources to joint defense projects. This strategy has created opportunities for non-continent countries, such as Turkey, to participate, as seen in the Baykar-Leonardo partnership.

**Turkey's Role in Europe's New Defense Strategy**
The European Union (EU) has introduced a new defense strategy, known as the White Paper, which aims to increase military spending and production by 2030. The EU has also established a platform for sharing ideas on defense with its leading NATO member countries, dubbed 'fikirdaş ülkeler' (idea-sharing countries). Turkey, which is a candidate for EU membership, a NATO ally, and a rising player in the defense industry, has been included in this platform. The EU has proposed a 150 billion euro financing package, called the European Security Action (SAFE), to support the implementation of the White Paper's 2023 targets. According to the SAFE package, non-EU countries, including Turkey, can participate in the program by contributing up to 35% of the defense products. However, this would require a security and defense partnership agreement with the EU. The EU's defense spokesperson, Thomas Regnier, stated that the SAFE package would allow EU member states, EFTA member states, and Ukraine to purchase common defense products and participate in joint procurement. Regnier also mentioned that the EU has security and defense partnership agreements with Norway, Moldova, South Korea, Japan, Albania, and North Macedonia. International relations expert Ester Sabatino from the International Strategic Studies Institute (IISS) believes that Turkish companies can participate in the SAFE program through joint ventures with European companies. However, Sabatino also notes that the process is becoming increasingly politicized, and the EU's relations with Turkey are complex. Sabatino suggests that Turkish companies can establish a 'security wall' in Europe by separating their management and establishing a European subsidiary, which would make it easier for them to participate in projects. The NATO summit in June is expected to discuss the defense of Europe, and Sabatino believes that if the US reduces its support for European security, the EU will need to increase its defense spending and production, which could lead to more opportunities for Turkish companies to participate in the defense industry.

**EU Aims to Eliminate Fossil Fuel-Based Heating by 2040**
The European Union has set a goal to completely eliminate fossil fuel-based heating by 2040. As a result, natural gas boilers will be phased out, and renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy will take their place. The EU aims to increase energy efficiency by strengthening building insulation and promoting the use of energy-efficient devices. By 2030, all new buildings must meet the 'Zero Emission Buildings' standard, and existing buildings must be converted to this standard by 2050. Financial incentives for natural gas boilers will be discontinued as of January 1, 2025, and the EU countries will launch financial support and awareness campaigns to encourage citizens to switch to renewable energy. The EU's decision is seen as a critical victory for the environment and aims to contribute to global climate targets. Experts predict that this decision will balance energy prices and reduce household expenses in the long term. The EU's move may also inspire other countries, such as Turkey, which is closely following the EU's policies.

We are ready and determined to move our process forward. We expect the European Union to take concrete steps.' The Antalya Diplomacy Forum 2025, which was attended by over 4,000 people including 70+ ministers, 20+ heads of state and government, and 50+ foreign ministers, was officially opened with the participation of President Erdoğan. The theme of the forum, which was attended by President Erdoğan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, was 'Taking Diplomacy in a Fragmenting World'.

**EU Releases 'White Book' Defense Plan, Warning of Potential War by 2030**
The European Union (EU) has released a new defense plan, known as the 'White Book', which aims to strengthen the EU's military and defense capabilities by 2030. The plan, which is 23 pages long, aims to reduce the EU's dependence on the US and increase its ability to defend itself against threats from Russia. The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, stated that 'the international order is undergoing a transformation of unprecedented proportions' and that the EU must take responsibility for its own defense. The EU's Commissioner for Defense, Andrius Kubilius, added that 'the EU must take responsibility for its own defense, as 450 million EU citizens cannot rely on 340 million Americans to defend them against 140 million Russians.' The White Book aims to reduce the EU's reliance on the US by increasing defense spending and developing joint defense projects. It also warns that if the EU does not strengthen its defense capabilities, a 'full-scale war' could occur by 2030. The plan also calls for the EU to prepare for the worst-case scenario and to accelerate the production of weapons and ammunition. The EU's defense plan also includes a section on cooperation with Turkey, stating that 'Turkey is a candidate country and a former partner in the field of Common Security and Defense Policy. The EU will continue to engage constructively with Turkey to develop a partnership that benefits both sides in all areas of common interest.' However, the plan also notes that 'Turkey's stance, position, and roadmap remain unclear...'

**EU Releases New Defense Strategy, Excludes Turkey from Defense Fund**
The European Union (EU) has released a new defense strategy, known as the 'White Paper', which aims to strengthen its military and defense capabilities by 2030. The strategy includes plans to reduce the EU's dependence on the US and to increase its own defense capabilities. The EU plans to invest 800 billion euros in defense over the next few years, with 650 billion euros coming from increased borrowing and 150 billion euros from a new financial instrument called SAFE. The funds will be used to support joint defense procurements between EU member states and other countries such as Norway and Ukraine. The EU also plans to strengthen its defense industry and to develop new technologies such as artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. The strategy includes a section on partnerships with non-EU countries, including Turkey, which is an EU candidate country. The EU has expressed its commitment to developing a partnership with Turkey, but the country's defense industry will not have direct access to the EU's 150 billion euro defense fund. This is seen as a negative development for Turkey, but the EU has emphasized that it is committed to developing a partnership with the country. However, the recent tensions between Turkey and the EU, including the arrest of Istanbul's mayor, have raised concerns about the future of the partnership.

**EU Presents New Defense Plan: 'Readiness 2030'**
The European Union (EU) has presented its new defense plan, 'Readiness 2030', in Brussels. The plan is a roadmap for the modernization of Europe's defense and follows up on 'ReArm Europe', which two weeks ago laid the economic groundwork for large-scale purchases of defense equipment. The plan allows EU member states to increase their budget deficits if investments are made in defense, and EU countries can also borrow money from a newly established fund of 150 billion euros. Both Norway and Ukraine are included in the arrangement because we have security agreements with the EU. However, the US, UK, and Turkey are excluded. The plan also sets limitations on what EU countries can buy. For example, EU countries can only buy arms from US, UK, and Turkish manufacturers if they have security agreements with Brussels, according to Financial Times. Third countries cannot have control over the weapon systems purchased, such as by requiring a specific configuration or where they can be used, as the US often does. At least 65% of the funds will be used in the EU, Norway, and Ukraine. The rest will go to countries that sign security agreements with the EU.

**EU and Ukraine Set 2030 as Target for Membership**
The European Union (EU) and Ukraine are aiming for significant reforms to achieve membership by 2030. EU President Ursula von der Leyen has set 2030 as a possible target for Ukraine's accession if it maintains its current path of necessary reforms. Seven other candidate countries, mainly from the Balkans, could also join by 2030. To absorb them and continue functioning, the EU will need to undertake massive reforms: budgetary, logistical, and decision-making process reforms. This can be done without amending the treaties, but it requires 'political will', according to several EU sources. The EU membership would provide Ukraine with certain security guarantees, which are essential given its imperialist neighbor, Russia. This 2030 target also gives Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky something to offer his citizens in a peace agreement with Russia that may not be too favorable for Ukraine. Several countries, including Moldova, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Turkey, are waiting to join the EU. Their accession would mean adding new countries benefiting from the EU's budget. If not all join, Brussels is exploring a gradual integration system that would allow them to join programs or elements, such as the single market. The EU will need to reform its own processes to integrate new members, including a budget reform, linking payments to member states more strictly to the rule of law, and reforming the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This would generate significant tensions, especially with Ukraine, which has large agricultural lands. The EU will also need to reduce the number of commissioners and seats in the European Parliament, and move towards a system of voting by majority, rather than unanimity in the European Council.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated that 'only Turkey can get out of the deadlock that Europe has fallen into. Turkey's full membership in the European Union can save Europe.' He also emphasized that 'the liberal democracy, which was once considered the highest ideology of the 20th century, has entered a serious crisis and deadlock.' Erdoğan criticized the European Union for its inability to address the challenges facing the continent, saying that 'the EU's inability to address the challenges facing Europe has led to the rise of extremist movements in the continent.' He also emphasized the importance of Turkey's membership in the EU, saying that 'Turkey's full membership in the EU can provide a new perspective for the continent.' Erdoğan also discussed the recent visit to Southeast Asia, where he met with the leaders of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan. He emphasized the importance of the visit, saying that 'the visit was a success and we were able to strengthen our relations with the countries.' He also mentioned the TOGG, a Turkish electric car, saying that 'the TOGG is a symbol of the growing and strengthening of the new Turkey.'

He emphasized the importance of the strategy, saying that 'the strategy will provide a new perspective for Turkey's industry and technology.' Finally, Erdoğan mentioned the upcoming Ramazan, saying that 'we will start the Ramazan with the first teravih prayer on Friday and the first sahur and iftar on Saturday.'

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made several statements, including: 'Western organizations and leaders, who watched as over 61,000 civilians were killed, have failed the humanity test in Gaza.' 'The European Union has become defensive about its economy, and its politics have become international, but only Turkey can save the EU from this dead end with its full membership. The EU should confront these realities as soon as possible, and if they show the necessary will, we can achieve a result in a short time.' 'A Chinese company is investing 1 billion dollars in a new facility in Samsun, and another Chinese company is also investing in Samsun, with preparations already underway. We will see the foundation being laid in a very short time.' 'Today, during our Cabinet meeting, we discussed how to strengthen our country's industrial production and technological independence, and we also discussed our 2030 industry and technology strategy. Our reform program will bring a new horizon for our country in terms of advanced technology investments.' 'We believe that Ukraine should be included in the ongoing peace talks, as the war has caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and has imposed heavy costs on both countries. We have been working towards establishing peace since the beginning, with the slogan 'the winner of the war is peace, and the loser is war.' We have developed balanced relations with both neighboring countries, and we hosted direct negotiations between the two countries in Istanbul in March 2022. We have also implemented the Black Sea grain initiative. We welcome President Trump's initiative to end the war through negotiations, but a lasting peace can only be achieved with the participation of all relevant parties. Ukraine must be included in the process, and we are ready to provide any support for a lasting peace.' 'We are taking all necessary measures to prevent our citizens from being exploited by profiteers during the month of Ramadan.' 'Our trade, agriculture, and finance ministries are working hard to prevent profiteers from spoiling the joy of our citizens during Ramadan.'
