The Oman Society for Astronomy and Space (OSAS) observed the largest sunspot of 2025, Sunspot 4079, which exceeded 11 times the size of planet Earth. The sunspot was photographed from Muscat Governorate using specialized astronomical equipment, reflecting the peak of solar activity currently being experienced by the sun. According to Wesal bint Salem Al Hinai, Vice Chair of the Community Engagement Committee at the OSAS, 'Sunspots are one of the most prominent phenomena associated with the Sun's magnetic activity, and they represent a crucial indicator in understanding the behavior of our solar system's star and its multiple effects on Earth.' The Sun is currently experiencing the peak of the 25th solar cycle, which began in December 2019, and a daily average of about 215.5 sunspots was recorded in August 2024, the highest in more than two decades. This cycle is expected to continue until 2030, with solar activity gradually declining after the peak.

**The nation's oldest and largest Indigenous sorority is bracing for DEI orders**
Alpha Pi Omega Sorority Inc., the country's oldest Indigenous Greek letter organization, is facing uncertainty due to the Trump administration's executive orders aimed at curbing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) on college campuses. The sorority, which has chapters on 14 college campuses, provides a safe space for Native students, but its presence on campus may be threatened if the orders persist. Historians like Marc Robinson believe that the anti-DEI attacks are a threat to academic freedom and diversity of thought. 'Federally funded programs and universities currently have an administration that is opposed to the thought of being inclusive with different perspectives, histories, and experiences,' Robinson said. The sorority's grand president, LaDonna Richardson, is worried that without DEI, Indigenous women will have a harder time being accepted to colleges and universities. 'Our organization was founded to provide Indigenous women with a place of support on college campuses, without these supports the trickle-down will be Indigenous women not being accepted to college or dropping out,' Richardson said. The sorority's presence on campus is crucial for the enrollment and connectedness of Indigenous students, especially with only 26% of 18-24-year-old Native American students being enrolled in college in 2022. 'A Pi woman is born, not made. So, if you have the qualities of a strong and resilient woman who hones herself to the greatest extent, then you could be a Pi woman,' said Raven Boone, a member of the Haliwa-Saponi Tribe and parliamentarian of the Alpha Pi Omega chapter at UNC Pembroke.

**What Series Represents You, According to Your Birthdate**
Numerology suggests that each number is connected to a person's unique characteristics. To find out which series represents you, calculate your life number by adding the digits of your birthdate until you get a single number between 1 and 9. This number is believed to be connected to your 'vibe' or personality. For example, if your birthdate is May 11, 2025, your life number would be 1+1+2+0+2+5 = 11, but since 11 is a double digit, you would add the digits again to get 1+1 = 2. According to the article, this number could represent your unique characteristics and personality traits.

**March 14th: Celebrating Pi Day - A Slice of Mathematical Wonder**
March 14th is celebrated as Pi Day, honoring the mathematical constant π (pi), which is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. π is an irrational and transcendental number, approximately 3.14159, that appears in various scientific fields, including geometry, physics, and music theory. It has fascinated mathematicians and scientists for centuries and has been a symbol of infinity and mystery. The world record for reciting the most digits of pi is 111,700 digits, achieved by Rajveer Meena from India on March 21, 2015, who took over 10 hours to recite them. 'I'm proud to be an Indian,' Meena said. π is an integral part of various scientific fields, influencing calculations in architecture, waves, and planetary orbits.

**The Mystery of Pi: Why We Know It's Infinite**
Pi (π) is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is an irrational and transcendental number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or fraction. The digits of Pi appear to be randomly distributed and do not follow any particular pattern. This property was first demonstrated by Swiss mathematician Johann Lambert in 1768. Despite extensive calculations, Pi's value has not been precisely determined, with over 62.8 trillion digits calculated to date. However, it is widely accepted that Pi is a transcendental number, meaning its digits go on forever without repeating in a predictable pattern. As Turkish mathematician Elin said, 'Pi sayısının sonsuz olduğunu, onun irrasyonel bir sayı olmasından biliyoruz.' In other words, we know that Pi is infinite because it is an irrational number.

**The Calculation of Pi: From Ancient Times to Modern Computers**
The value of pi (π) has been calculated to over 200 trillion digits. In ancient times, people used the ratio of the perimeter of a circle to its diameter to calculate pi. The ancient Egyptians approximated pi as 3.16. The Greek mathematician Archimedes calculated pi by inscribing and circumscribing polygons around a circle. He started with a hexagon and increased the number of sides to 96, arriving at a value of 3.14. Later, the German mathematician Rudolf calculated pi to 461 trillion digits, and the Japanese mathematician Takebe Katahiro calculated it to 41 digits. Today, computers are used to calculate pi to over 200 trillion digits.
