Manchester City and Chelsea could receive a £70million payout for their participation in the upcoming Club World Cup, according to reports. The Premier League sides are among the favourites for the competition, which has a reported $2billion budget. The distribution of the funds is not yet official, but it's expected that some $575m will be allocated for participation and around $465m will be based on sporting performance. City and Chelsea could receive $60m-$90m (£46m-£70m) each, with operating costs estimated at around $850m. Tony Scholes, Premier League chief football officer, has ruled out delaying the start of the 2025-26 season for clubs in England's top tier, despite the tournament running into the summer. 'We've looked at it. We're having this imposed upon us, particularly by FIFA, so there's an element of us saying: 'why would we adjust our competition when they've imposed a competition that we don't agree with.,' he said. 'That's one element. But the more significant element, though, is that we simply can't. It's as big as it can be at the moment and we can't afford a delay to the start of the season.'

**Try The 2025 ACX/Metaculus Forecasting Contest**
The 2025 ACX/Metaculus Forecasting Contest is now open, despite some complications with the 2024 contest. The contest organizer, who has been less involved in recent years, is excited about the new forecasting bots and their potential to rank against top forecasters. The organizer hopes that the contest and the $10,000 prize will encourage participants to continue forecasting, even before knowing their results from the previous year.
