**What Happens When AI Replaces Workers?**
Several high-profile figures, including Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, a senior LinkedIn executive, Fiverr's CEO, and the new Pope, have expressed concerns that AI could replace a significant number of entry-level white-collar jobs. They point to the stated goal of major AI companies to build artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is defined as 'a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.' This has led to warnings that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within five years and is already starting to take jobs from new graduates. 'AI is coming for your job. Heck, it's coming for my job too,' said Fiverr's CEO.

**"Stop sugar-coating it": Anthropic CEO says AI will slash 50% of entry-level white collar jobs  --  leaving Gen Z out of work**
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that AI could take over up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs, saying that the government needs to 'stop sugar-coating' the threat AI poses to the job market. Amodei stated, 'We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming.' This comes as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicts that AI will replace humans for most things, with a few professions surviving the revolution. LinkedIn Chief Economic Opportunity Officer Aneesh Raman echoed similar sentiments, comparing AI's threat to the decline of manufacturing in the 1980s. Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed the claims, saying that the AGI moment will come within the next 5 years and have surprisingly little societal impact.

**Humans Have 4 Years Before AI Can Do Everything They Can Do, OpenAI COO Says**
OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap predicts that humans will have only four years before artificial general intelligence (AGI) surpasses human capabilities. He believes that AI models like ChatGPT are currently great tools for humans, but with the rate of improvement, a 'fairly steep takeoff' in AI capabilities is imminent. This has sparked debate among AI enthusiasts, with some arguing that AGI will lead to unmatched creativity and productivity, while others are worried about mass unemployment and the potential for AI to pose a 'fundamental risk' to humanity. Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, believes that the 'pure software part of Silicon Valley' will undergo a 'reckoning' in the next few years as a result of AI, while Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, Imagine Entertainment bosses, are 'excited' by AI but do not believe it can replace writers anytime soon.

**Anthropic CEO says AI could cause up to 20% unemployment within five years, wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs**
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that artificial intelligence could wipe out 50% of all entry-level white-collar jobs and increase unemployment by 10-20% within the next one to five years. Amodei says AI companies and the government should be honest about the future threat and prepare the country for the 'possible mass elimination of jobs.' He believes critics are ignoring warnings about the dangers of AI, and that business leaders will eventually realize the savings of replacing humans with AI. Amodei's company, Anthropic, has developed a model that can code at a near-human level and scheme, and he envisions a future where 'Cancer is cured, the economy grows at 10% a year, the budget is balanced -- and 20% of people don't have jobs.'

**AI could erase half of entry-level white collar jobs in 5 years, CEO warns**
Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and lead to 10-20% unemployment in the next one to five years. Amodei emphasized the need for people to prepare adequately and for AI companies and the government to be candid about the change. He noted that 'most of them [workers] are unaware that this is about to happen,' and that 'it sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.' However, Amodei also expressed hope that AI could lead to meaningful advances in other sectors, such as healthcare, and even cure cancer. He proposed solutions, including spreading public awareness of the incoming change, teaching AI literacy, and policymakers thinking of policy solutions in an economy where superintelligence is a reality. Amodei noted that 'when I think about how to make things more augmentative, that is a strategy for the short and the medium term -- in the long term, we are all going to have to contend with the idea that everything humans do is eventually going to be done by AI systems. This is a constant. This will happen,'

**Free Market Involvement in AI Is the Key to the US Military's Future Success**
The US military's success in future conflicts depends on tapping into the free market's innovation to rapidly develop AI systems and outpace emerging threats. The current reliance on expensive countermunitions to counter cheap Houthi drones and missiles is unsustainable and hinders AI progress. The Department of Defense needs to access different forms of funding, including research and development, procurement, operations and maintenance, and BA-8, at the speed of relevancy to develop critical AI architecture. The free market can move faster and empower leading software and defense firms to drive innovation in AI systems. Opening access to funding incentivizes private firms to innovate, and having the right AI systems in place is key to bolstering battlefield awareness. The US military needs to pursue a more open acquisitions process for AI technology to remain competitive and win future wars, which will be won by the side with the best information and access to it.

**Buy Stocks in These 3 Categories – or Get Left Behind**
The imminent arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the next 12 to 24 months poses a significant challenge to businesses, and investors must adapt their strategies accordingly. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the company already knows 'how to build AGI.' To survive and thrive, companies must adopt and integrate AI technologies quickly. Investors should focus on three categories: (1) companies providing key parts of the infrastructure that will accelerate AI technology toward AGI, (2) companies primed to rise in tandem with AGI, and (3) non-tech companies that will adopt and apply AI to reap huge gains in efficiency, productivity, and profits. Biotech is a sector that the author sees a bright future for, as AI in biotech is speeding up how we discover new drugs, making treatments way more personalized, and helping us predict diseases before they even show up. The author has 41 different investment recommendations that have reached over 1,000% gains on their track record.

**This Isn't a Tech Cycle, It's a National Reinvention**
The current era is not a tech cycle, but a national reinvention. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could be less than five years away. The rate of progress has never been higher, with large language models getting smarter, faster, and more integrated into daily life. The US is pouring capital into semiconductor production, cloud infrastructure, defense modernization, and energy scaling. Companies like Anduril, Palantir, and Valar Atomics are leading the innovation in defense, data, and energy. They're building AI-driven surveillance towers, autonomous drones, and battlefield operating systems, as well as next-gen nuclear sites for electricity, synthetic fuels, and industrial heat. Neuralink is focused on brain-computer interfaces, and Tesla is prototyping Optimus, a general-purpose humanoid robot. Energy is the most significant constraint to innovation, and whoever solves it will shape the progress timeline. The article concludes that the next wave of innovation will be unlike anything we're used to, and it's essential to understand what's real and what's noise to stay ahead. AI is not here to take jobs, but to help boost productivity if used properly. The companies mentioned are real innovators, and those who adapt and adopt these new technologies will be rewarded in the future. 'I believe you have to be willing to be misunderstood if you're going to innovate,' as said by an unknown author.

**The Beginner’s Roadmap to Investing in AGI**
Futurist Eric Fry believes that the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the next 12 to 24 months will revolutionize the business world. He suggests that investors should focus on companies that are adapting to this seismic shift by investing in AI technologies. Fry proposes a three-step approach: investing 'in' AI, investing 'alongside' AI, and investing in 'stealth' AI. Companies that provide key infrastructure for AI, such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, are good investments. Additionally, companies that will benefit from the rise of AGI, such as data centers and companies that provide raw land for data centers, are also good investments. Furthermore, non-tech companies that will adopt and apply AI to increase efficiency and profits, such as companies in the biotech sector, are also good investment opportunities. Fry emphasizes that only companies that adapt quickly to this change will survive, and he has 41 investment recommendations that have reached over 1,000% gains on his track record.

**To the winner of the Artificial Generative Intelligence race goes … EVERYTHING! * WorldNetDaily * by James Lacey, Real Clear Wire**
The development of Artificial Generative Intelligence (AGI) will have a profound impact on the world economy and military capabilities. AGI will be able to rewrite its own code and scale its cognitive capacity at speeds that will leave slow-footed rivals in the dust. According to James Lacey, 'there is no silver medal—only a collection of also-rans falling increasingly far behind.' AGI will compress the journey of industrial growth into a mortgage cycle, with capital formation doubling every seven years at ten-percent growth. This will lead to significant economic growth, with the United States reaching $285 trillion by 2050 and erasing annual deficits within five years. However, the article also warns of the risks of AGI-powered agentic warfare, where an AI-agent would control thousands of drones and have significant military advantages against an opponent. Lacey notes that 'any nation that obtains and keeps an agentic advantage will have the same military advantages against an opponent as the United States possessed during Desert Storm.' The article concludes that the development of AGI will lead to a 'third offset' in military capabilities, where the technological difference may seem 'godlike and unfathomable.'

**Human-level AI will be here in 5 to 10 years, DeepMind CEO says - ChinaTechNews.com**
Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, believes that human-level artificial intelligence (AI) will be achieved within the next 5 to 10 years. Speaking at a briefing in London, Hassabis stated that artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is as smart or smarter than humans, is still in development, but will eventually become a reality. Hassabis emphasized that while AI has made significant progress, it still lags behind human capabilities in many areas. However, he expressed confidence that the gap will be bridged in the near future, enabling AI to match humans at any task.

**The Rapid Development of Artificial Intelligence: A Double-Edged Sword**
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly, with many experts predicting that general AI (AGI) will be achieved within the next two to three years. AGI has the potential to solve almost any problem that a human can, but it also raises concerns about the risk of losing control over the technology, or its misuse for manipulation, mass surveillance, or military purposes. Ezra Klein, a journalist and host of The Ezra Klein Show, has expressed concerns that AGI could land in the hands of the Trump administration, which could potentially use it for nefarious purposes. However, others are more optimistic, seeing AGI as a tool for solving complex problems such as climate change, developing new vaccines, and creating solutions for global food shortages. The use of AI is already being explored in various fields, including healthcare and finance, and some experts predict that AGI will be a reality within the next decade. However, others are more skeptical, citing the risks of mass unemployment, the potential for AGI to be used for military purposes, and the risk of over-surveillance. 'AI is dumber than a door,' says Yann LeCun, a researcher at Meta, 'and even my cat is more intelligent because it has common sense and can move around in a room.' The question of when AGI will be achieved is still uncertain, but it is clear that the development of AI is a rapidly evolving field that will have significant implications for society.

**Unlike Nukes, AI Weapons Have No Mutually Assured Destruction Deterrent**
Some AI researchers predict that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could emerge within the next 2 to 5 years. However, even current AI iterations can cause social chaos. Unlike nuclear weapons, AI doesn't have a Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) deterrent, making it a potentially catastrophic threat. The article highlights the unpredictability of AI-powered warfare, citing scenarios such as AI-developed nano-drones, lethal sounds, and contagious viruses. The author notes that different AIs will develop novel ways to kill, and without the MAD doctrine, a rival power may be tempted to act on an overwhelming AI advantage. As one researcher noted, 'AI's many military applications will likely be well beyond current human imagination.'

**OpenAI safety researcher announces their departure over safety concerns while Anthropic CEO claims AI will extend human life "to 150 years"**
OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler announced his departure from the company, citing safety concerns and the risks of an AGI race. Adler stated, 'IMO, an AGI race is a very risky gamble, with huge downside.' He also expressed concerns that no lab has a solution to AI alignment today and that the faster we race, the less likely that anyone finds one in time. This echoes the concerns of AI safety researcher Roman Yampolskiy, who claims there is a 99.999999% probability of AI ending humanity. In contrast, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claims that AI will extend human lifespan by 150 years by 2037, citing major improvements in tech, military, and health. Amodei stated, 'If I had to guess, my guess is that we can make 100 years of progress in areas like biology in five or ten years if we really get this AI stuff right.' OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims that AI will be smart enough to solve the consequences of rapid advances in the landscape, including the destruction of humanity.
