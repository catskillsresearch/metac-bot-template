**WWDC 2025: Apple Intelligence may disappoint with limited updates**
As WWDC 2025 approaches, the spotlight is on Apple Intelligence. However, the event may be more low-key than expected. A notable evolution would be the opening of Apple Intelligence models to developers, which would be limited to 3 billion parameters. These models, designed to run directly on devices, would allow for simple tasks such as text summarization or image classification. Apple is focusing on local confidentiality, but these functions are basic compared to those used by Google or OpenAI. No major overhaul of Siri is expected, nor the arrival of a more intelligent voice assistant.

**Apple chatbot is almost as good as ChatGPT... except for the mistakes**
Apple's Power On Apple Intelligence, a lightweight chatbot designed to run on-device, uses large language models (LLMs) with three billion parameters. However, the company has more advanced models with 7 billion, 33 billion, and 150 billion parameters, which are being tested internally. According to Gurman, the 150 billion parameter model 'approaches the quality of recent ChatGPT rollouts' in internal testing. Despite this, the company is hesitant to launch a chatbot due to the prevalence of 'hallucinations' or factual errors in the models' output. Gurman notes that there are 'philosophical differences' among executives about when to launch the chatbot, and the company may face a lose-lose situation this summer. 'Either it unveils new products and risks public failure, or it unveils nothing of substance and risks being left behind,' Gurman writes. 'We'll see which path the company chooses next week.'

**The Evolution of Smartphones is Dead**
The evolution of smartphones is dead, and we're all feeling it, but we're not saying anything. The presentations of new smartphones are no longer exciting, and the focus has shifted from megapixels and gigahertz to marketing gimmicks. The author argues that the industry is stagnant, and the only thing that's changing is the price. The article criticizes the emphasis on artificial intelligence and the lack of real innovation in smartphones. The author suggests that the industry is more focused on increasing profits for shareholders than on creating something new and useful. The article concludes that the smartphone market is no longer developing, but rather decaying, and that consumers are no longer excited about new releases. The author suggests that the only thing that matters is a longer battery life and a more durable design. The article ends with a call to action, suggesting that consumers should stop expecting new and exciting things from smartphones and instead focus on what really matters.

**Scientists Create New Method for Searching for Extraterrestrial Life**
American astronomers from the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science proposed a revolutionary method for evaluating the habitability of exoplanets, using our own existence around a yellow star as a key argument. The study, published on the arXiv preprint server, suggests that the classical approach to finding habitable planets, which focuses on zones where water can remain liquid, may be flawed. According to the researchers, if humanity emerged around a star of the same type as the Sun (yellow dwarf), rather than the more common red dwarfs, it statistically indicates that the latter are less suitable for complex life. The calculations show that if red dwarf systems were more than eight times more favorable for life than solar systems, the probability of our emergence around a yellow star would be less than 5%. This counterintuitive finding forces a reevaluation of the optimism regarding the habitability of planets around red dwarfs, which make up 70% of the stars in our galaxy. The study also makes bolder claims in the context of the multiverse hypothesis, where fundamental constants can vary between universes. In this scenario, the statistical approach becomes a powerful tool, and the researchers demonstrate that the constraints on the habitability of rogue planets, water worlds, and even environments with non-aqueous biochemistry are strengthened by at least an order of magnitude. The study's finding that the uniqueness of water for life may be overestimated is particularly intriguing, as it suggests that water's 'special' properties may not be as critical if life in the multiverse consistently chooses a water-based environment. This research may fundamentally change the strategies for searching for extraterrestrial life, shifting the focus from a narrow range of 'golden' conditions to a statistical analysis of planetary diversity. Future data from next-generation telescopes will allow us to test these bold predictions in the coming years. 'The fact that we exist around a yellow star is a strong argument that life is not as common as we thought,' said Dr. [no name mentioned in the article]. 'We need to rethink our assumptions about the conditions necessary for life to emerge.'

**Virtual Model Replicates Human Body to Understand Cancer Evolution**
A virtual model has been created to replicate the human body and understand how cancer evolves. This model incorporates physical, molecular, emotional, and quality of life information. The goal is to predict how each case will evolve and, in the future, optimize clinical trials in real patients. Artificial intelligence and health are coming together to rethink oncology. The team in Spain is proposing something more ambitious: a digital copy of each patient that allows for real-time tracking of their changes. This development is led by the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), in conjunction with nine hospitals, two universities, and the CRIS Foundation against Cancer. The project aims to use the data from 150 women with metastatic breast, lung, or colon cancer to build models that will help others in the future. The 'digital twins' are replicas created with artificial intelligence that integrate different levels of information, from DNA to the subjective perception of the disease. Instead of applying the same treatment to all patients, this new tool seeks to give each patient what best suits their body, history, and evolution. The project is funded with 2.5 million euros and is part of the Precision Medicine Infrastructure (Impact) initiative of the Carlos III Health Institute. The team has already presented preliminary results at the European Congress of Medical Oncology (ESMO), where it was highlighted that remote monitoring of patients is reliable and the data obtained is robust enough to train predictive models. The research does not stop there. They are preparing to present new conclusions at the ASCO 2025 Congress in Chicago, considered the most important event in oncology. There, they plan to show how daily physical activity, emotional states, and other emotional indicators can anticipate the response to treatment. One of the most innovative aspects of the study is the inclusion of 'biological age' as a central parameter. Thanks to a model developed at the CNIO, it is possible to estimate if the patient's body is aging faster due to treatment, the type of tumor, or even emotional stress. This information would allow for better adjustment of therapy intensity and reduction of side effects in young people. 'Until now, two patients with the same diagnosis received exactly the same treatment. But in practice, they do not react the same way,' explained the CNIO team, according to a series of periodical publications. With the digital twins, they seek to have doctors test treatments first on a computational version of the body before applying them in reality. This type of innovation marks a paradigm shift in the way medicine is thought. No longer is it just about treating a disease, but about deeply understanding the person who suffers from it.

**The habitability of Earth tells us the likelihood of finding life elsewhere**
The habitability of Earth can tell us the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe. According to Robert Egan, the search for habitable worlds is not just about finding planets in the 'Goldilocks zone', but also about having a protective magnetic field, a stable atmosphere, and the right elements. The multiverse hypothesis suggests that life consistently chooses water-based environments, but if future discoveries reveal that exotic environments are more habitable, it could shatter this framework. Sandora's research, which challenges our assumptions about water's uniqueness for life, could be the key to unlocking the question of whether we are alone in the universe or one of many universes. As Egan notes, 'the approach even challenges our assumptions about water's supposed uniqueness for life.'

**Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Way We Access Information**
Google's dominance in the internet search market is being challenged. According to StatCounter, Google's global search engine market share fell below 90% by the end of 2024 and is expected to continue to decline in 2025. This shift is not just a technological phenomenon, but a deeper transformation that is changing user habits, redefining the relationship between content and users, and quietly opening the door to a new information regime. The rise of social media platforms has become the primary source of daily information, while deep readers have turned to paid subscription models. However, alternative media channels have begun to offer their content through subscription systems, catering to a serious reader base. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence tools are changing research habits by providing users with ready-made texts that include sources. This shift is expected to continue, with Elon Musk, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, stating that AI will make search obsolete. Musk's own tool, Grok, has become a popular platform for users to research and verify information, and is expected to continue to evolve and improve its deep research methods. The traffic to websites is also changing, with a new parameter emerging: users accessing websites through artificial intelligence tools. This new user profile is approaching information with a different access habit. While 'content is king,' the quality of content is becoming increasingly important, and artificial intelligence systems are highlighting high-quality content in their deep research. Google's dominance is being challenged not by other search engines, but by artificial intelligence systems that can perform deep research. Google's own AI tool may be able to counter this trend for a while, but user habits are changing, and users are no longer satisfied with just searching for information; they want to understand and analyze it. At this point, artificial intelligence is not just an alternative to search, but a new generation of information architecture.

**What Are The Odds Of Alien Life?**
The Drake Equation is a mathematical framework for estimating the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. While it doesn't provide a definitive answer, it sets parameters for scientists to study and refine as our understanding of the universe expands. Dr. Frank Drake, then president of the SETI Institute, convened a historic meeting at the Green Bank Observatory in November 1961 to discuss the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, attended by luminaries such as Carl Sagan and Philip Morrison. The equation serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for guiding discussions and scientific inquiries into the appearance of life and its development into something capable of sending messages across the light-years. 'It was a privilege to be in the company of so many famous and cerebral individuals,' said Dr. Drake, highlighting the significance of the meeting. 'The equation isn't a formula that spits out a number, but rather a tool for guiding our understanding of the universe and the possibility of life beyond Earth.'

**The Fermi Paradox: A Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Understanding Ourselves**
The Fermi Paradox, also known as the 'Great Silence', highlights the contradictions in our understanding of extraterrestrial life. Despite the passage of time since the Big Bang, we have not found any evidence of their existence, despite recent discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones. According to physicist Enrico Fermi, 'If AI is the brain of a robot, then RPA is its hands.' One factor to consider when searching for an answer to the Fermi Paradox is the number of potential civilizations. This value allows us to determine the Drake equation, a mathematical formula that outputs the number of active, communication-capable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation uses several factors, including star formation rate, percentage of stars with planets, number of habitable planets per star, percentage of planets where life emerged, percentage of planets where intelligent life developed, number of civilizations developing detectable communication technologies, and average lifespan of such civilizations. In short, the Drake equation claims that there should be many civilizations, but so far, SETI programs have not detected any signals. This raises the question of the scientific justification for such programs. Matthew Chilcote's article does not provide a direct answer to this question, but instead proposes a method for evaluating the probability of detecting a signal by a certain number of broadcasting civilizations by now. If the probability is low, the lack of evidence should not be surprising; if it is high, the silence may mean something. Chilcote's model suggests that the absence of detected electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial civilizations may impose constraints on the number of existing civilizations. In certain scenarios, the model predicts a 99% chance of detecting at least one signal if the assumed number of civilizations (based on the Drake equation) is around 1. We have a zero result so far. However, it's worth noting that even the absence of positive results from SETI helps in resolving the Fermi Paradox: it allows us to exclude certain combinations of the number and lifespan of civilizations. Ultimately, as Universe Today writes, the purpose of programs like SETI is not only to search for extraterrestrial life, but also to better understand ourselves and the conditions that make intelligent life possible. A team of scientists from Germany studied the feasibility of a new method of searching for extraterrestrial life - using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They came to an unencouraging but important conclusion for the development of astronomy.

**The 40-Year Quest for Extraterrestrial Intelligence**
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project has been searching for life beyond Earth for 40 years, since its inception in 1985. The project's founders, including Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi, were inspired by the idea of using gamma-ray signals to communicate with other civilizations. They proposed using the spectral line of neutral hydrogen as a means of communication, as it is the most abundant element in the universe. The project's early results were promising, but the search for extraterrestrial signals has been ongoing for decades with no conclusive evidence. In the 1960s, Frank Drake, a young astronomer, independently developed a similar project, called 'Ozma', which aimed to listen for signals from nearby stars. The project was supported by notable scientists, including Otto Struve, who predicted the existence of exoplanets. The SETI project has undergone several iterations, including the development of the Drake equation, which attempts to estimate the number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy. The equation takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation, the number of planets per star, and the number of planets capable of supporting life. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, the SETI project continues to inspire scientists and the public alike, and its legacy has led to a greater understanding of the universe and our place within it.

**Scientists Develop 'Venus Life Equation' to Determine Likelihood of Life on Venus**
Scientists have developed a mathematical equation, the 'Venus Life Equation' (VLE), to determine the likelihood of life on Venus. The equation, similar to the Drake Equation, takes into account three parameters: emergence (O), life resilience (R), and continuity (C). If combined, they result in: L = O x R x C. The parameters vary from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). For example, 'emergence' considers whether life could have appeared through abiogenesis or panspermia. 'Life resilience' assesses how large and diverse the biosphere could have been. 'Continuity' evaluates whether favorable conditions were maintained long enough. Some scientists believe that life may have existed on Venus in the past, when it had oceans and conditions similar to Earth's. Even today, at an altitude of about 50 km in the planet's atmosphere, the temperature and pressure are similar to those on Earth, leading to hypotheses about the possible preservation of microorganisms in Venusian clouds. Although we have only one confirmed example of life - Earth, the VLE equation provides a way to structure knowledge, set priorities, and outline gaps in our understanding of life in the universe. Even if we don't have answers yet, this tool helps us better understand not only Venus, but also the chances of life among countless other worlds.

**Could Venus host life? The Venus life equation can help us find out**
Scientists have developed the Venus Life Equation (VLE), a framework to estimate the probability of life on Venus. The VLE is similar to the Drake Equation, but tailored to Venus. It considers three key parameters: Origination, Robustness, and Continuity. Origination refers to the chance of life arising on Venus, while Robustness considers the potential size and diversity of the biosphere over time. Continuity looks at the chance that conditions amenable to life persisted on Venus. The VLE is agnostic to the type of life and its scale, and all factors in the equation span from 0, which means there's no chance, and 1, which indicates certainty. The authors of the VLE suggest that Venus may have had a period of watery warmth in the past, which could have allowed life to arise. They also propose that simple life could have survived to this day in the planet's clouds. However, the VLE suffers from the same handicap as the Drake Equation, with only one concrete example of life on Earth. Nevertheless, the VLE provides a framework for growing our understanding of life on other worlds. 'The fundamental goal of the VLE is to provide a scaffold for estimating the chance of life based on factors that can be constrained or quantified through observation, experiment, and modeling,' the authors write. 'Although we are currently limited by the n=1 problem of having Earth-based life as our only concrete example, we can nevertheless use our understanding of the genesis and evolution of life on Earth to establish a framework for identifying the unknowns and uncertainties of life on other worlds,' they add.

**Scientists Create Equation to Search for Life on Venus**
Scientists have created an equation to search for life on Venus. The equation, called VLE, is similar to the Drake equation and can estimate the probability of life on Venus. 'The fundamental goal of VLE is to provide a basis for assessing the probability of life,' said Diana Gentri, director of the NASA Astrobiology Laboratory. The equation is L=OxRxC, where L is the probability of life, and O, R, and C are three parameters: origin, strength, and continuity. Each parameter has a value from 0 to 1. The origin of life can occur through abiogenesis or panspermia, and this factor does not change over time. The strength of life depends on the availability of nutrients CHNOPS, access to energy, and functional diversity of life. Earth has a high value of R, which explains the stability of life on our planet. The continuity of life depends on the stability of the star and the planet's orbit, as well as geological stability and the absence of destructive events. 'Although we are limited by the problem of n=1, we can use our understanding of the genesis of life on Earth to study unknown aspects of life in other worlds,' explain the authors of the study. This approach can help us in the search for life on exoplanets. Understanding Venus gives us a key to solving the natural puzzle of the Solar System.

**Did Life Ever Exist on Venus? Scientists Develop New Equation to Find Out.**
Scientists have developed a new equation, the Venus Life Equation (VLE), to determine the probability of life existing on Venus. The equation, presented at the 2025 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, is similar to the Drake Equation and takes into account factors such as origination, robustness, and continuity. According to the authors, the VLE can help us understand rocky planets in the habitable zones of other stars and provide a framework for thinking about life in the galaxy and on Venus. The equation suggests that Venus may have had a period of watery warmth in the past, which could have allowed life to arise and survive to this day in the planet's clouds. However, many factors are still unknown, and the VLE is limited by the 'n=1 problem' of having only one concrete example of life on Earth.

**New Forms of Estimating Alien Life in the Universe: Revisiting the Drake Equation**
Frank Drake, an American astronomer and radio astronomer, developed the Drake Equation in 1961 to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy that might be able to communicate with Earth. The equation is expressed as: N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L, where each term carries significant uncertainties, making it more of a conceptual tool than a precise calculation. Some variables, such as R*, can be estimated with some accuracy, while others, like fi and fc, remain uncertain. Advances in astronomy and astrobiology have refined some of these factors over the years. The discovery of exoplanets has improved our understanding of fp and ne. However, the fraction of planets where life emerges (fl) and evolves into intelligence (fi) remains unknown. 'Intelligence and technological capability seem to be more uncommon phenomena, considering that billions of species existed before one developed the ability to send radio signals into space,' said an expert. The time of life of technological civilizations (L) is another crucial factor. If civilizations are common but have short lifetimes due to self-destruction or natural disasters, the chance of detecting them would be low. This point raises philosophical and scientific implications about the future of humanity. Modern versions of the equation have been developed, incorporating new concepts and refining the original parameters. Some scientists have added variables related to bio-signatures and technosignatures, while others have suggested including terms that address the impact of catastrophic events.

**The Drake Equation and Alien Typologies Catalogued by Ufologists Based on Case Studies**
The Drake Equation, a mathematical formula to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, has been updated to 2025. Using values such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, and the average lifespan of a technological civilization, the equation yields an optimistic N = 0.08, implying we might be alone or nearly so. In contrast, ufology has compiled an array of alleged alien races, drawing from a wealth of testimonies that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the sighting of certain extraterrestrial typologies. When merging the Drake Equation with ufologists' alien typologies, two approaches emerge: either the lifespan of civilizations would need to rise significantly, or intelligence or communicative capacity would need to be far more prevalent than assumed. Alternatively, each civilization estimated by Drake might give rise to multiple races, yielding a figure modest compared to ufological accounts. Challenges and reflections arise from the lack of definitive data for many parameters in the Drake Equation and the need for objective scientific validation of ufological cataloguing.

**The Great Silence: Why Aliens Haven't Contacted Us -- Or Have They?**
The possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life and Earth visitation remains a topic of debate. Modern astrobiology has revealed that planets are abundant in our galaxy, with over 5,000 exoplanets confirmed as of 2023, and one-fifth of stars estimated to have planets in the 'habitable zone' where temperatures could allow liquid water. The building blocks of life have been found in interstellar clouds and meteorites, suggesting the chemistry for life might be common. However, the emergence of intelligent, technological civilizations is far more uncertain, and the famous Drake Equation provides a framework to estimate the number of advanced civilizations by considering factors like the rate of star formation and the likelihood of life and intelligence. As of now, there is no conclusive evidence to prove or disprove the existence of intelligent alien life or their visitation to Earth.
