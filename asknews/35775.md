**US Economy Contracts By 0.2% In Q1, Labor Market Shows Signs Of Cracks As Jobless Claims Surge - NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)**
The US economy contracted by 0.2% in Q1 2025, with a sharp slowdown from the 2.4% expansion in Q4 2024. The downturn was driven by a spike in imports and a decline in federal spending. Consumer spending rose just 1.2% on an annualized basis, the weakest growth in household outlays since Q2 2023. Corporate earnings also took a hit, with a 3.6% decline in profits to $3.192 trillion. Initial jobless claims climbed to 240,000, the highest weekly print in over a month, and continuing claims rose to 1.919 million, the highest reading since November 2021. Markets responded with caution, with the US dollar index dropping 0.4% and futures tied to US equity indices paring overnight gains.

**Liberal debt to double, state companies face sell-off**
Tasmania's Liberal government has delivered a budget that forecasts a significant increase in net debt, from $5.3 billion in 2024/25 to $10.8 billion in 2028/29. Treasurer Guy Barnett said the debt is manageable and necessary for investing in economy-boosting infrastructure and increasing health and education funding. The budget includes over $600 million for a new waterfront stadium in Hobart, but does not include $300 million in state government borrowings needed to make up a funding gap. Labor opposition MP Josh Willie called the budget the worst in the state's history, while several independent MPs gave a scathing assessment. The government plans to rely on potential asset sales and a public service 'efficiency unit' to find money, and has announced plans to cut 2500 public servant jobs by 2032/33. Global credit ratings agency S&P has shifted Tasmania's AA+ position from stable to negative, citing weaker financial outcomes and a rising debt burden.

**Debt to soar, business sales flagged in Liberal budget**
Tasmania's Liberal government has delivered a budget that forecasts a significant increase in net debt, from $5.3 billion in 2024/25 to $10.8 billion in 2028/29. Treasurer Guy Barnett said the debt is manageable and necessary for the state to continue investing in growth and services. The budget also includes $602 million for a new waterfront stadium in Hobart, but the estimated cost has blown out from $775 million to $945 million. The government plans to sell state-owned businesses and surplus crown land to help pay down debt and return to surplus. An efficiency unit will review government programs and find savings of $150 million per year. Labor opposition MP Josh Willie said Tasmania is on track to have the 'worst finances in the country'.

**Bryce Wilkinson: Trump's big spending bill spells trouble for US economy**
The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that could lead to a significant increase in government borrowing, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating an additional US$4 trillion in debt between 2026 and 2034. Moody's has forecast that the federal government's budget deficit will rise to 9% of GDP by 2035, and the federal debt burden will increase to 134% of GDP. This is a concern, as high debt levels can be unsustainable and may lead to a loss of global influence. The US depends on global investors to fund its future deficits, and a loss of confidence in the US government's ability to manage its debt could have significant consequences. As Bryce Wilkinson notes, 'the more you owe, the more interest payments swallow your income.' The US is not yet at a point of crisis, but it is on the path to one, and this is a concern for countries like New Zealand, which rely on global trade and finance.

**Government submits second supplementary budget, state debt for 2025 climbs above €13bn**
Finland's government has submitted a second supplementary budget proposal for 2025, which will increase state spending by 757 million euros and decrease revenue by 187 million euros. This will lead to a net borrowing requirement of 13.2 billion euros, a 1 billion euro increase from last year's forecast. The increased spending is mainly due to national defence projects and transport infrastructure. The defence budget includes additional funding for the Finnish Defence Forces, procurement of defence materiel, and replacing equipment supplied to Ukraine. The government has also allocated funds for civil defence, emergency warnings, and the public warning system. State revenue is projected to be lower than forecast due to lower taxes received and weakening forecasts of tax bases. According to the Finance Ministry, 'The changes are explained, for example, by lower than expected taxes received and weakening forecasts of the development of tax bases.'

**US Budget Deficit and Debt: A Growing Concern**
The US government's budget deficit has increased significantly, with a deficit of $1.051 trillion for the first seven months of the 2025 fiscal year, a 23% increase from the same period in 2024. The rating agency Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing the increase in government debt and interest payments over the past decade. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warns that the public debt in the US is expected to rise to 117% of GDP by 2034, driven by a primary deficit of 2% of GDP and increasing interest payments. The CBO also notes that the current budget plans, including the Reconciliation Bill, would lead to a significant increase in the deficit and debt over the next decade. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimates that the additional debt and interest costs over the next decade would be around $3.3 trillion, or 7.8% of GDP. However, if the tax cuts and other measures in the Reconciliation Bill are extended, the CRFB estimates that the additional debt and interest costs would increase to around $5.2 trillion, or 12.3% of GDP. The uncertainty surrounding the budget and debt is causing concern among investors, with the yield on 30-year US Treasury bonds rising to over 5% in recent days. The US dollar has also weakened against other currencies. The Federal Reserve has not yet changed its stance on interest rates, but the uncertainty in the US economy and geopolitics may lead to a reevaluation of its monetary policy.

**Tasmanian government's road to surplus appears built on dreams**
Tasmanian Treasurer Guy Barnett's plan to achieve a surplus by 2029-30 appears overly optimistic, according to independent economist Saul Eslake. The plan relies on selling public companies, reducing spending, and cutting the public service, but these measures may not be realistic. The government's net debt is expected to reach $7.3 billion in the upcoming financial year and balloon to almost $10.8 billion in four years, with interest repayments expected to rise to almost $650 million a year. Labor says this is more than the state spends on ambulance and emergency services combined. The forward estimates continue to see Tasmania operating in deficit, albeit reducing to $236 million in 2027-28. Eslake described the budget as presenting an 'upbeat view' of the economy that 'may not come to pass'. The Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry pointed out that the pathway to surplus is only achievable if the government sticks to its spending promises. The government's plan to cut spending is also uncertain, with growing demand on the health system and little room for surprise events like state elections. Relying on 'efficiencies' to get back on track, the government has no clue where it will find them and is optimistically hoping to exceed its targets. 'It is just completely fanciful,' said Jessica Munday from Unions Tasmania. 'If the government were looking for a road map to take Tasmania forward, this is not it.'

**Elon Musk distances himself from Trump: says fiscal and budgetary project increases deficit**
Elon Musk expressed his 'disappointment' with the fiscal and budgetary project promoted by US President Donald Trump, stating that it increases the deficit, boosts public spending, and 'undermines' his work as a government advisor to increase efficiency and reduce waste. Musk, who serves as a special advisor to Trump as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), criticized the 'great and beautiful bill', as the president called it, approved by the House of Representatives last week and sent to the Senate for discussion. Musk stated, 'Frankly, I was disappointed to see the huge spending bill, which not only does not reduce, but increases the budget deficit, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.' The comments from Musk constitute a virtual break with the Republican president, whom he helped return to the White House after a first term from 2017 to 2021, with millions of dollars to finance the 2024 election campaign. The billionaire founder of Tesla offered the interview on Tuesday amidst the media campaign around the launch of the new Starship rocket, manufactured by Musk's SpaceX company. Trump avoided directly addressing Musk and his criticisms in response to questions from journalists at the White House, instead reiterating his support for the plan. The bill's approval by a narrow margin in the House of Representatives was a victory for Republicans, despite several dissenting voices within the party seeking to deepen spending cuts and speed up their implementation. Now, it faces a tough battle in the Senate for the final vote. The megaproject aims to extend Trump's tax exemptions from his first term (2017-2021) and add new reductions, along with an increase in funds for border management and the implementation of the president's tough migration policy. This would be partly offset by cuts to social security programs and aid. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in a report that the new legislation would add around three trillion dollars to the national debt over ten years, currently calculated at over 36 trillion dollars.

**Canada's $22B Military Bet Could Explode Into $64B Boom--If Carn**
CIBC economists believe that Canada's C$31 billion ($22.4 billion) defense spending plan could generate up to C$64 billion in economic output, nearly double the initial outlay, if executed correctly. However, the boost depends on how the spending is funded, as tax hikes or debt financing could reduce the multiplier. The plan is part of a strategic pivot by Prime Minister Mark Carney to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2030 and shift spending eastward, away from the U.S. Carney aims to sign Canada onto the Readiness 2030 defense procurement alliance with Europe by July 1, which could lead to a full-scale rebalancing of Canada's role in global defense. According to David McGuinty, Canada's defense chief, the government is taking 'immediate and decisive action' to rebuild Canada's military backbone.

**NZ Budget 2025 at a glance: follow the money here**
Finance Minister Nicola Willis presented a 'responsible budget' that balances fiscal discipline with economic growth. The budget 'controls growth in government spending' by slashing the operating allowance from NZ$2.4 billion to $1.3 billion, the tightest in a decade. The forecast outcome is a small surplus by 2029, with net core crown debt peaking at 46% of GDP in 2028. Despite the austere tone, the government has made targeted investments in key areas, including $6.8 billion in new capital investment, $1 billion for defence, and tax incentives for businesses. However, new funding for health and education is limited, and may barely keep pace with increasing cost pressures. The budget focuses on long-term growth, but may cause short-term pain, with the hope that it will ultimately lead to economic growth and higher wages.

**US Public Debt Trajectory and Interest Payments Set to Worsen and Exceed Sovereign Peers**
The US public debt trajectory is set to worsen, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that the gross federal debt ratio will reach 169% of GDP by 2055. Mandatory spending, including healthcare and Social Security, accounts for 60% of federal spending, while net outlays on interest represent 13% of total annual spending. President Trump's proposed reductions in discretionary funding are unlikely to significantly lower the budget deficit, and proposals to raise defence spending by 13% suggest that total discretionary spending will remain broadly unchanged. Reducing the budget deficit through spending cuts would require reductions in mandatory outlays, which is unlikely due to political constraints. Therefore, stabilising the federal debt trajectory will prove challenging without new revenue-raising measures such as broad-based tax increases.

**DOGE: US debt borrowing needs lower by $53bn  --  American Treasury Report**
According to the US Treasury report, US borrowing needs have decreased by $53 billion in the second quarter of 2025, thanks to the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to reduce the cost of governance. The report, cited by Zero Hedge, states that sustained fiscal prudence will result in improved inflows, easing the US debt ceiling challenge. The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has saved the US $160 billion, falling short of its $2 trillion target. As noted by the Treasury, 'Fiscal flows year-to-date are coming in better than expected,' with gross receipts tracking above prior-year levels and outlays closer to the historical range.

**Australian government delivers sham pre-election budget**
The Australian government's latest budget has been described as a 'sham' pre-election budget, full of misleading claims and false promises. Treasurer Jim Chalmers claimed that the Australian economy has 'turned the corner,' but this is contradicted by his own references to worldwide 'uncertainty' and 'volatility.' The budget includes 'cost-of-living' relief measures, but these are inadequate and will not alleviate the financial stress experienced by working-class households. The government has also announced plans to increase military spending, with Defence Minister Richard Marles confirming that $1 billion will be brought forward from the 2028-29 financial year to be spent in 2026-27 and 2027-28. This is a bid to appease the Trump administration, which is demanding an increase in military spending from 2 percent to 3 percent of GDP. The budget papers show that the Labor government is vowing to increase military outlays to nearly $59 billion this coming financial year, or about 2.04 percent of GDP, rising to $74 billion or around 2.23 percent of GDP in 2028-29. This will require further cuts to public health, education, welfare, and other social spending. Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said the government had found another $2.1 billion in 'savings and reprioritisations,' taking the total to $95 billion in its four budgets, mainly taken out of the NDIS disability scheme, public health, and public education. The Socialist Equality Party will stand candidates in the election, despite being denied the basic democratic right to have their party name on the ballot papers.

**Luis Caputo Defends IMF Agreement, Citing Need to Repair Fiscal Damage**
Economy Minister Luis Caputo defended the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a post on X, citing a Clarín newspaper headline that reads 'The Government will use the FMI money to pay the debt with the Central Bank that the Kirchnerism left behind'. He stated, 'This is the first time that an agreement will be made with the Fondo to repair the damage that the abuse of public spending and the consequent fiscal deficit has caused to citizens.' Caputo added, 'Having ended in 2024 with the inherited fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficit, this new Agreement will allow us to solve the problem of the accumulated deficits (stocks) that led to the appropriation of the Central Bank's reserves through the National Treasury's debt.' He concluded, 'Once the imbalance of the flow and stock is corrected, we will finally be able to defeat inflation and embark on a path of sustainable economic growth over time.' This response comes after criticism from the opposition, mainly from the Kirchnerist space, including a post by former President Cristina Kirchner, who questioned the agreement, stating, 'You're saying that you'll ask for millions of dollars from the FMI without generating new debt, because with those dollars you'll pay the Intransferible Letters that the Treasury owes the Central Bank. Are you seriously telling us that they'll give you millions of dollars and that it won't increase Argentina's external debt?'

**U.S. posts $129 billion January deficit on calendar shifts, higher outlays**
The U.S. government posted a $129 billion budget deficit for January, a significant increase from the $22 billion deficit in January 2024. The Treasury attributed the increase to calendar shifts in benefit payments and higher outlays for Social Security, Medicare, interest, and other items. Excluding the calendar shifts, the adjusted deficit increase for January would have been $21 billion. The year-to-date deficit reached a record $840 billion for the first four months of fiscal 2025, a 58% increase from the same period last year. A Treasury official stated that the prior year tax receipts were inflated by $85 billion in deferred tax payments from the previous fiscal year. Year-to-date receipts totaled $1.596 trillion, up 1% from the same period last year, while outlays reached $2.436 trillion, a 15% increase from the prior year period.

**What the data says about U.S. foreign aid**
The United States government is on track to spend $58.4 billion on international assistance programs in the 2025 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. In fiscal 2023, the U.S. government disbursed $71.9 billion in foreign aid, with Ukraine receiving the largest amount at $16.6 billion to help it fend off Russia's invasion. The U.S. government is the single-largest aid donor in the world, accounting for more than 40% of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024. Foreign aid was a bigger share of federal spending at the height of the Cold War, with international assistance amounting to about 4.7% of total federal outlays in fiscal 1963. The U.S. government's primary aid agency, USAID, distributed nearly $43.8 billion in aid in fiscal 2023, but the Trump administration has begun to dismantle it. Americans have mixed views about foreign aid, with 35% wanting to increase spending, 33% wanting to keep it the same, and 28% wanting to decrease it, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey.

According to the USISPF, the budget is a 'strong blueprint for propelling economic growth toward the government’s vision of a USD 5 trillion economy.' The budget promotes financial modernisation through strategic investments and landmark reforms in the tax structure, and signals to investors that India is committed to fostering a resilient, inclusive, and globally competitive economic environment. Dr. Mukesh Aghi, President and CEO of USISPF, said, 'USISPF is confident that the budget will accelerate India’s economic growth, drive increased investments, job creation, and innovation, while further cementing its status as a global economic powerhouse.' The budget maintains the path of fiscal consolidation with a projected fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent, driven by a large increase in net tax revenues and a moderate increase in expenditures. It also shifts spending priorities to domestic consumption, with increased spending outlays for rural and urban development, social welfare, and development of the Northeast states.
