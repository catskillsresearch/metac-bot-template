**Will Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Kill the Filibuster?**
Senate Democrats are sounding the alarm over a maneuver by Majority Leader John Thune to facilitate passage of a measure to cancel federal authority for California's auto emission standards. Thune's move has raised concerns that the filibuster is being weakened, as it allows for a simple majority vote to negate recently issued regulations. Senator Adam Schiff said, 'We are setting a precedent that the filibuster is essentially now meaningless.' Thune denied this, claiming the Senate has the right to interpret the boundaries of the Congressional Review Act. The filibuster is already riddled with holes, with exceptions for certain types of legislation, including budget-related measures and executive-branch confirmations. While some predict the filibuster will expire this year to facilitate the passage of Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, there's no reason to assume full-scale abolition of the filibuster is in the works. Senate Republicans have denied any interest in a filibuster-free chamber, and Trump has been quiet on the subject since his first term.

**The Filibuster, a Staple of the Modern Senate, Is on the Ropes**
The filibuster, a key procedural tool in the US Senate, is on the ropes, despite Republican efforts to protect it. Last week, Republicans used a loophole to block California's plan to phase out gas-powered vehicles, sidestepping the 60-vote filibuster requirement. This move has significant implications for national environmental policy and has left Democrats fuming about the abuse of the congressional review process. Sen. Adam Schiff said, 'We are setting a precedent that the filibuster is essentially now meaningless.' The Republican power play did not directly attack the filibuster, but rather claimed a loophole, arguing that the circumstances were a unique 'case of first impression.' This move has been criticized by Democrats, who argue that it undermines the filibuster and sets a precedent for future abuse. The filibuster has been chipped away at over the years, with Democrats led by Sen. Harry Reid lowering the filibuster threshold to a simple majority on lower-bench judicial nominees and most executive branch picks in 2013. The move had monumental consequences, including allowing President Trump to place three justices on the Supreme Court. The filibuster will be put to the test again in the coming weeks as Senate Republicans take up their version of the domestic policy bill passed by the House, which is being considered under special parameters that shield fiscal legislation from filibusters.

**U.S. Senate vote to nix California tailpipe emissions standard blocks 17 other states, including N.J. • New Jersey Monitor**
The U.S. Senate voted 51-46 to block California's regulations on tailpipe emissions from new cars and trucks, affecting 17 other states, including New Jersey. The resolution, which now goes to President Donald Trump's desk, would prevent California from enforcing its standards, which include a ramp-up to having no new gas-powered cars sold in the state by 2035. New Jersey Business & Industry Association's Ray Cantor praised the vote, saying it was 'pragmatic and with common sense.' However, Democrats blasted the move, calling it an 'unprecedented and reckless attack on states' legal authority.' Critics said the state regulation was effectively an electric vehicle mandate that robbed consumers of the option to purchase the vehicle of their choice. The Senate's use of the Congressional Review Act, which allows for a simple majority to repeal recent executive branch rules, has been described as 'going nuclear' to tank the chamber's filibuster rule. The move has sparked uncertainty and chaos in the marketplace, with critics calling for lawsuits to protect states' authority.

**Cory Booker Is Turning His Record-Setting Senate Speech Into a Book**
New Jersey Senator Cory Booker is turning his record-breaking 25-hour Senate speech into a book titled 'Stand'. The book, announced by The St. Martin's Publishing Group, will be published on November 11, 2025, and offers a 'compelling vision for the future' to readers who want to make a difference. Booker's speech, which surpassed Strom Thurmond's 24-hour filibuster record, was not a traditional filibuster as it was not intended to stop a specific bill, but rather to speak broadly against the Trump administration's policies. According to Booker, he was able to take control of the floor by not lying to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, unlike some of his colleagues, such as Rand Paul, who promised a short speech but ended up holding the floor for a long time.

**Angélica Lozano: 'The Government wants to hinder the spirit of the labor reform'**
Senator Angélica Lozano, who led the discussion on the labor reform in the third debate, remains optimistic but warns that petrista sectors and the Government will try to frustrate the project in the final debate. 'They need this to fail, they need there to be no law so they can have harassment and campaign', she warns. Lozano notes that the times are favorable for the project to be ready before June 20. However, she alerts that beyond the plenary debate, the eyes are on the conciliation, the last step for the project to become a law. 'They have a strategy of harassment and spreading lies', she adds. Lozano believes that the atmosphere in the Senate is good, as it is 'at the height of the country' and will pass a good labor reform 'on time, fair, and inclusive'. She also notes that the Government is trying to 'make a campaign out of it' and that they want to 'hinder the spirit of the project'. Lozano is confident that the project will be approved before June 20 and that it will be a good law, 'with a healthy and valid debate'.

**'GOP is acting in bad faith' with its new 'crafty move': analysis**
Senate Republicans are using a 'crafty move' to pass President Donald Trump's agenda into a single bill, according to MSNBC opinion writer Hayes Brown. The move, led by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, involves using the Congressional Review Act to bypass potential filibusters. Brown stated, 'A crafty move from Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., last week may ensure even more of the pet policy projects stuffed inside the House's 'big, beautiful bill' make it to President Trump's desk than would have previously been possible.' The Congressional Review Act allows a majority to move on a substantive piece of legislation without hitting the filibuster, which Senate Democrats argue is a breach of the GOP's promise to uphold the filibuster and follow the parliamentarian's advice. Brown said, 'Senate Democrats are right that the GOP is acting in bad faith on their promises to uphold the filibuster and follow the parliamentarian's advice.'

**White House: We'll Send Some DOGE Cuts to Congress Next Week, Enacting All Will Take 'Several Months'**
OMB Director Russ Vought announced that the White House will send a rescission package with some DOGE cuts to Congress next week. Enacting all the DOGE savings will take 'several months' and cannot be done in the reconciliation bill under Senate rules and law. The package will include foreign aid, USAID cuts, and waste reduction, and will not be subject to the filibuster. Vought stated that the goal is to make the DOGE cuts permanent through rescissions or impoundment, and that the executive branch has tools at its disposal to achieve this. He added that enacting all the DOGE savings will be a 'process over the next several months' and will not be included in a single bill. According to Vought, the total DOGE amount is $175 billion, and the White House has already sent up $160 billion in cuts to nondefense spending for fiscal year '26.

**Josh Hawley teams with Democrats to pass bills that stalled in Senate**
US Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) have teamed up to reintroduce a bill aimed at curbing child pornography. The bill would eliminate laws protecting tech companies from liability for hosting child sex abuse material and allow victims to bring federal civil lawsuits against companies promoting or storing such material. Hawley and Durbin previously had limited success with a similar measure in 2023, and are now attempting to pass legislation that failed to pass in years past. They are also co-sponsoring a bill with Mark Kelly (D-AZ) to offer education benefits to police officers and their dependents, in an effort to attract more people to law enforcement jobs. According to studies, law enforcement agencies saw 50% more resignations in 2022 than in 2019. 'Big Tech has woefully failed to police itself, and the American people are demanding that Congress intervene,' Durbin said.

**Minimum Wage Law Delayed in Congress, but Reajuste Will Be Retroactive to May**
The minimum wage law, which was supposed to take effect in May, has been delayed in Congress due to the Senate's rejection of two key elements of the government's proposal: the creation of a tripartite observatory on living costs and an initiative to strengthen the Union Fund. Despite this setback, Labor Minister Giorgio Boccardo assured workers that 'the law will be activated from May 1st and, regardless of the date it is approved, it will be retroactive for all salary and social security effects.' Currently, workers receiving the minimum wage earn 510,000 pesos, but with the approved proposal, it will be adjusted to 529,000 pesos from May and 539,000 pesos from January 2026. With the delay, workers will start receiving the adjusted minimum wage of 529,000 pesos in June, and they will also receive the difference of 19,000 pesos corresponding to May, thanks to the law's retroactivity.

Governor Mike Kehoe will hold a press conference to announce details regarding a special session on June 2, which will start with the Senate taking up its work on June 9. The session will focus on stadium subsidies for the Chiefs and Royals, with Cindy O'Laughlin expressing her support for the plan, citing the economic benefits of keeping the teams in Missouri. However, the Senate vote is uncertain, with three groups potentially opposing the plan: Democrats, the Freedom Caucus, and other conservatives. If all three groups coalesce in opposition, the math becomes tough. Additionally, the Senate will need to overcome a filibuster to pass the bill. In other news, the Hannibal school district has implemented a new policy to tackle truancy, which includes automated phone calls, meetings with parents and school personnel, and potential charges of neglect if attendance does not improve. The policy has shown promising results, with 63% of families implementing a plan and improving attendance following a meeting.

**Democrats warn GOP is weakening filibuster as Senate moves to nullify California's electric vehicle mandate**
The Republican-led Senate moved to overturn California's electric vehicle mandate, bypassing the 60-vote threshold, infuriating Democrats who warned that this is a weakening of the legislative filibuster. Senate Republicans denied this intent and vowed to preserve the filibuster. California's plan to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035 has been a point of contention, with Republicans arguing it will hurt the US economy and impact other states. Senate Democrats have argued that not accepting the parliamentarian's guidance sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to the destruction of the permitting and regulatory system. 'It's going nuclear, plain and simple,' said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. 'It's overruling the parliamentarian. And second, what goes around comes around.'

**Senate Democrats: Don't Pay Attention to What We Did Before | National Review**
Senate Democrats, led by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, are warning that overruling the parliamentarian on a legislative matter would be a catastrophic decision that would lead to the elimination of the filibuster. However, they are being hypocritical as they themselves overruled the parliamentarian on a legislative matter in 2011. On October 6, 2011, Senate Democrats, led by Harry Reid, overruled the parliamentarian on a post-cloture amendment series, effectively changing the rules of the Senate. This precedent was set despite McConnell's warnings that it would 'set a new precedent on how the Senate operates' and 'change the Rules of the Senate.' Despite this, Whitehouse and other Democrats are now claiming that overruling the parliamentarian would be unprecedented and would eliminate the filibuster, demonstrating a lack of self-awareness and hypocrisy.

**Booker called filibuster an 'abuse of power' years before setting Senate speech record - Rose Law Group Reporter**
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called the Senate filibuster an 'abuse of power' in 2022, years before his party praised him for setting the record for the longest Senate floor speech at 25 hours and 5 minutes. Booker's statement aligns with his previous views, as he wrote on X in January 2022, 'The filibuster has been abused to stop reforms supported by the vast majority of Americans—from background checks to protecting the right to vote. We must stop this abuse of power.' This stance contrasts with former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's views, who opposed abolishing the filibuster during President Joe Biden's administration.

**Kyrsten Sinema rips Senate Democrats for apparent flip-flop on filibuster now that they need it**
Former Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema criticized several prominent Democratic figures for their apparent flip-flop on the use of the filibuster. Sinema accused lawmakers like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, and Rep. Ro Khanna of hypocrisy for urging Senate Democrats to filibuster a government spending bill after previously calling for the end of the filibuster. Sinema pointed out that many Democratic Senators who voted to end the filibuster in 2022 are now using it to block the bill, while previously supporting its elimination. She also targeted former U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Robert Reich, sharing a screenshot of his 2022 post grilling her for voting to keep the filibuster. Sinema's rebuke caught the attention of the lawmakers, with Ocasio-Cortez responding, 'Still no... It's only used to block Dem policies. Never to block harmful GOP ones.'

**US 'Continuing Budget Resolution' Passes Senate, Avoids Government Shutdown**
The US 'continuing budget resolution' has been passed by the Senate with a majority vote, and will be signed by President Trump. This comes as the current continuing budget resolution was set to expire at night on the 14th, potentially leading to a government shutdown. The continuing budget resolution provides funding for the government until September 30, 2025. The Senate needed support from a certain number of Democratic Party members to avoid 'filibuster' and pass the resolution. Initially, the leader of the Senate Democrats, Schumer, expressed reluctance to cooperate, but later announced on the 13th that he would support the resolution, considering the potential negative impact of a government shutdown. This move helped push the resolution through the Senate on the 14th, avoiding a government shutdown that could have caused chaos in US society.

**US House Passes Short-Term Spending Bill to Avoid Government Shutdown**
The US House of Representatives passed a short-term spending bill on March 11, providing funding for the federal government until September of this year to avoid a partial government shutdown. With only three days left before the federal government runs out of funds, the bill will be sent to the Senate for review, but its approval is uncertain. The bill passed in the House with 217 votes in favor and 213 against, but it will need at least 8 Democratic senators to support it in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats, in order to avoid a filibuster and send the bill to President for signature. This is the second time the House has passed a short-term spending bill, with the previous one passed in December 2024, allowing the government to maintain current spending levels until March 14, 2025. If the new spending bill is not passed in time, some federal agencies will be forced to 'shut down'.

**Thune touts Washington Examiner report on Senate floor - Washington Examiner**
Senate Democrats have launched their third legislative filibuster of the new Congress, blocking GOP legislation that would bar transgender-identified biological males from competing in women's sports. According to a Washington Examiner report, some Democrats are embracing their hypocrisy by supporting the filibuster, which they previously tried to abolish or overhaul when they were in the majority. Senate GOP leaders, including Thune, have vowed to leave the filibuster unchanged, citing its importance as a tool in the minority's limited arsenal. As Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) said, 'I love it now. We all like rules that help us, and right now that we're in the minority, it's very useful to us.'

**'Shameless' Dems embrace filibuster they once tried to abolish**
Democrats have recently made liberal use of the filibuster, a procedural hold that forces legislation to require 60 votes to pass. This is a stark contrast to their previous efforts to abolish it. Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated, 'There's only one party in Washington that's been consistent on this issue, and it is not the Democrats.' They have used the filibuster to block sanctions on the International Criminal Court and the 'Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.' This shift in stance is a far cry from January 2022, when 48 Democrats voted to eliminate the filibuster. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had previously implied that nuking the filibuster would be on the agenda if Democrats held the Senate.
