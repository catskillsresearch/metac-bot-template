**As upbeat Indian economy closes gap with Japan, Germany, the real test will be at the podium**
India's economy is expected to surpass Japan's and close the gap with Germany, becoming the third-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP. According to the IMF, India's nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by FY26, while Germany's is expected to be $4.74 trillion. India's growth is driven by domestic consumption, services, and digitization, with a robust current account buffer and a rising trade surplus. However, challenges such as job creation, fiscal slippage, and institutional bottlenecks loom large. Experts warn that India must invest in human capital, strengthen its fiscal fundamentals, and deepen financial inclusion to truly consolidate its position in the top three. If India can achieve an 8% nominal GDP growth rate and maintain a stable rupee, its economy could cross $6.8 trillion-$7 trillion by 2030, firmly establishing it as the world's third-largest economy.

**Mexico's GDP Growth Slows Down in First Quarter of 2025**
According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the first quarter of 2025 was 34.65 trillion pesos, with a 0.8% real growth compared to the first quarter of 2024. This growth is the lowest in the same quarter of the last four years. At constant prices (adjusted for inflation) of 2018, the GDP totaled 24.919 trillion pesos, showing a slow but steady recovery after the pandemic-induced decline in 2020-2021. The agricultural sector's GDP has undergone significant revisions, with a corrected growth of 1.29% in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of -4.84% in the first quarter of 2024, and a disproportionate growth of 7.17% in the first quarter of 2025, reaching 1.26 trillion pesos in current prices, which is only 3.26% higher than its equivalent in 2019.

**Tinubu's reforms spur historic surge in capital market indices - Stockbroker**
According to Mr. David Adonri, Vice Chairman of Highcap Securities Ltd., the capital market in Nigeria has experienced a historic surge in the past two years due to micro-economic reforms of President Bola Tinubu. The total market capitalisation has doubled from N52.215 trillion in May 2023 to N119.58 trillion as of May 23, 2025. Adonri attributed this growth to the recapitalisation of the banking sector and the signing into law of the Investment and Securities Act 2024. He commended the President's economic policies, saying that if funds raised through the capital market were strategically deployed to critical sectors of the economy, Nigeria can exceed the one trillion dollar GDP target by 2030. However, he noted that the momentum was yet to fully gather pace, with the highest quarterly GDP growth under this administration being 3.84 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, which many analysts believe was largely inflation-driven and did not translate into real growth.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to deliver a keynote speech to attendees. This is the first time in 42 years that the IATA AGM has been held in India.

Including indirect, induced, and tourism impacts, the total number of jobs created is 770,000 and the GDP is $53.6 billion. IndiGo CEO and IATA Board Chairman Pieter Elbers said, 'The aviation industry is a powerful driving force globally, and in India, it is particularly evident. The Indian aviation market is rapidly growing and making a significant contribution to the country's social and economic development. We are proud to be at the forefront of this upward trend and are honored to host the IATA AGM in India again. We look forward to showcasing India's exciting market development and hospitality at this global event, which is truly India's time!'

**Chief Economic Adviser Nageswaran to brief Parliament panel on economic growth roadmap on Friday - The Statesman**
Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran will brief the Parliament Standing Committee on Finance on the 'Roadmap for Indian economic growth in light of global economic and geopolitical circumstances' on Friday. The committee, headed by Lok Sabha member Bhartruhari Mahtab, is reviewing the roadmap due to uncertainties in India's export growth and the need to understand strategies for domestic growth. India recently overtook Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy, with a GDP of USD 4.187 trillion and a per capita GDP of USD 2,934. The International Monetary Fund has projected India to become the fourth-largest economy in 2025, and the World Bank and other international development organisations have also projected high GDP growth trends in the coming years, with some expecting growth to exceed 6.5 per cent. According to the National Statistics Office, India's GDP growth for the fourth quarter of financial year 2024-25 stood at 7.4 per cent, while for the full financial year 2024-25, the real GDP growth stood at 6.5 per cent.

**India’s GDP victory over Japan is still a year away. Here's why**
India's GDP is expected to surpass Japan's in current dollars by March 2026, according to estimates. As of March 2025, India's GDP was $4.13 trillion, while Japan's was $4.38 trillion. Assuming a 10% annual growth rate for India and 3.4% for Japan, India's GDP is expected to reach $4.54 trillion by March 2026, surpassing Japan's estimated $4.53 trillion. However, changes in exchange rates can affect these calculations, and the actual date of surpassing may be delayed. Surjit S Bhalla, chairperson of the Technical Expert Group for the first official Household Income Survey for India, notes that the difference in GDP may not be significant and that what matters is equivalence in per capita GDP, which is still decades away. Bhalla also criticizes the decision-making bureaucracy for losing respect for data quality, citing the delayed release of bad quality household consumer expenditure data for 2017-18.

**Is India's $4 Trillion GDP a Trap?**
India has reached a $4 trillion GDP milestone, surpassing the UK and Japan, but experts warn that this may be a 'middle-income trap'. The country's economic growth is not as impressive as it seems, with two Indias existing side by side: one celebrating the achievement, and the other struggling to make ends meet. The article highlights the need for cultural and educational reforms, as well as a shift in mindset to create value and innovation. Critics point out that corruption, income inequality, and poor tax policies are major obstacles to India's economic growth. Some commenters suggest that the country needs to focus on human development and innovation, rather than just relying on population growth. Others argue that the middle-income trap is a real concern, and that India needs to be cautious not to fall into it. The article concludes that India's economic growth is not a guarantee of success, and that the country needs to address its underlying issues to achieve true prosperity.

**India's 2024 GDP Growth Rate: 6.5% - A Strong Performance Amid Global Uncertainty**
India's real GDP growth rate for the 2024 fiscal year was 6.5%, the lowest since 2021, but still one of the highest in the world, supported by a population of over 1.4 billion. The growth rate for the manufacturing industry was 4.5% (down from 12.3% in the previous year), while the construction industry maintained a high growth rate of 9.4% (down from 10.9% in the previous year). According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India's nominal GDP is the second-largest in the world, after Japan. However, according to the World Bank, India's per capita GDP in 2023 was lower than that of neighboring Bangladesh. Despite the uncertainty in the global economy due to the high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, India remains an attractive investment destination for foreign companies, including Japanese companies. The IMF predicts that India's GDP will reach approximately $4.19 trillion (around 603 trillion yen) in 2025, surpassing Japan and becoming the fourth-largest economy in the world. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated, 'Now India is the world's fourth-largest economy,' based on the IMF's prediction. However, this statement is seen as a 'premature' claim, and it is unclear whether it will come true.

**By focusing on GDP, India misses the point**
India has been claimed to have overtaken Japan as the world's fourth-largest economy by the Indian policy think tank NITI Aayog, citing International Monetary Fund (IMF) data. However, according to the IMF's World Economic Outlook report, India is still behind Japan's economy, with the leapfrogging expected to happen in 2026. The IMF estimates India's GDP to reach $4.187 trillion in fiscal year 2026, marginally higher than Japan's $4.186 trillion. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to make India a 'developed country' and a global manufacturing hub by 2047, with a per capita income of over $14,005. However, experts argue that India's real challenge is to increase per capita GDP, which is about $2,500, and pursue qualitative and sustainable development instead of quantitative growth.

**'India has potential to become world's 2nd-largest economy'**
Billionaire investor Mark Mobius believes that India has the potential to become the world's second-largest economy if it continues on its current path of resilience and policy continuity. According to the IMF, India's real GDP is projected to be $4.3 trillion in 2025, just behind Japan's $4.4 trillion and Germany's $4.9 trillion. Mobius estimates that India's larger population, with 1.2 billion people, compared to China's 800 million or less, will give it an advantage. He suggests that removing import restrictions will boost the manufacturing sector and drive the economy forward. Mobius also advises investors to be patient and wait for a market recovery, saying 'There will be a recovery in the market, so it is a good idea for investors to slowly start averaging into good stocks, and if they are already holding stocks, it would be best to hold them and wait for the recovery.'

**🧠 The Rise of AGI: What It Means for the Future of Intelligence (Part 2)**
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has the potential to revolutionize human history by handling any intellectual task a human can. In the second part of our series, we explore the areas where AGI's impact will be most groundbreaking. AGI may simulate consciousness without truly experiencing it, as suggested by David Chalmers. It will also enable highly adaptive, hyper-personalized learning experiences, as seen in Carnegie Learning's use of AI to improve math lesson retention by over 30%. However, AGI raises questions about human guidance and mentorship in education. AGI excels in logic and pattern recognition but lags behind humans in creativity, empathy, and moral judgment. If deployed fairly, AGI could inject $15.7 trillion into the global GDP by 2030, but it also risks exacerbating the gap between rich and poor if monopolized. Developing AGI without strong ethical guardrails is a disaster waiting to happen, and we need global standards and accountability to ensure AGI is aligned with human values.

**India emerging from valley of gloom, but economic nirvana will have to wait**
India's real GDP growth has improved to 6.2% in Q3, breaking a 7-quarter low of 5.6% in Q2. The growth was driven by the agriculture sector, private consumption, and government spending. For the full fiscal year FY25, growth is pegged at 6.5%, in line with consensus estimates. However, the RBI and Economic Survey have predicted growth below 7% for FY26 due to uncertain global growth prospects. The National Statistics Office's data revisions show real GDP growth rate at 9.2% for FY24, led by double-digit growth in the manufacturing sector. Real GDP for FY25 is estimated at Rs 187.95 lakh crore, up from Rs 176.51 lakh crore in the first revised estimates.

**Only Global Growth Will Reflect True Value of AI: Microsoft CEO**
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has emphasized the importance of global growth generated by artificial intelligence (AI) over the hype surrounding the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Speaking to podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Nadella said that the real value of AI will be reflected in a boost to GDP, citing the need for growth rates of 10%, 7%, or 5% in the developed world. He compared this to the Industrial Revolution, saying that AI needs to bring about a similar level of growth to be truly valuable. Nadella's views contrast with those of OpenAI, which has been racing to develop AGI. Nadella also addressed concerns about AI replacing human jobs, saying that it should act as a facilitator for productivity rather than replacing 'cognitive labour'. His comments come at a time when thousands of people have been laid off in favor of AI, and experts have warned about the potential for AI to cause economic harm.
