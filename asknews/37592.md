**What to Watch on Netflix: June 2025 | TV/Streaming | Roger Ebert**
Netflix has a relatively light month in June 2025, but there are some interesting drops, including a collection of late-career films by Alfred Hitchcock, topped by the Anthony Hopkins biopic of the filmmaker. Other notable releases include 'The American', 'Barbarian', 'The Blues Brothers', 'Dune', 'The Town', 'Us', and two music docs, 'The American' and 'Piece by Piece'. The latter is a biographical documentary about Pharrell Williams told through LEGOs, while the former is a drama starring George Clooney. 'Barbarian' is a horror film that defies prediction, and 'The Blues Brothers' is a Chicago comedy classic that Roger Ebert called 'The Sherman tank of musicals.' 'Dune' is a notorious '80s blockbuster by David Lynch, and 'The Town' is a tight thriller by Ben Affleck. 'Us' is a fantastic horror film by Jordan Peele, and the collection of Hitchcock films includes 'Rear Window', 'The Man Who Knew Too Much', 'Vertigo', 'The Birds', 'Frenzy', and 'Family Plot.' As Roger Ebert said, 'Watch 'em all! (Yes, even 'Family Plot.')
