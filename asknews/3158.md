**NASA's Europa Clipper Mission Canceled, but Technology Could Explore Enceladus Instead**
NASA has announced that the Europa Clipper mission, originally planned to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, has been canceled in 2023. However, the technology that supports it can be used to explore Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. According to Interesting Engineering, the subsurface oceans of both Europa and Enceladus could potentially harbor life, making them prime targets for searching for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. If the Europa Clipper mission had launched, it would have collected data on the possibility of life on Europa. The mission was not an easy one, as the intense radiation from Jupiter would damage electronic devices, and communication time would be limited due to Europa's short orbital period of 85 hours. As NASA's Dr. said, 'The mission was not feasible due to the harsh environment of Jupiter.'

**The Impossible Discovery That's Rewriting Life on Earth**
Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery in the Pacific Ocean, 4,000 meters below the surface, where they found that metallic nodules on the seafloor are producing their own oxygen, dubbed 'dark oxygen.' This finding challenges the long-held scientific consensus that oxygen production requires sunlight. The nodules, which contain metals such as cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium, and manganese, are capable of producing electricity and splitting seawater to release oxygen. This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of how life began on Earth and could rewrite the fundamental story of life on our planet. The findings suggest that entire ecosystems might exist in the deep ocean, powered not by the sun, but by the planet's own electrical activity. The discovery also raises concerns about the potential destruction of these ecosystems if polymetallic nodules are mined for green technology. The search for extraterrestrial life has also become more interesting, as any world with the right chemistry and electrical activity could potentially support life.

**What if we found life beyond Earth?**
The discovery of life beyond Earth has long been a topic of human imagination, from ancient myths to modern science fiction. But what if this was no longer just a fantasy? What if scientists announced tomorrow that they had found conclusive evidence of life, even if it's simple, elsewhere in the universe? How would our world change? Recent scientific discoveries suggest that we may be on the brink of achieving this dream, which would mean a historic shift in our understanding of the universe and our place in it. In April 2025, a team from the University of Cambridge announced the discovery of strong signals of life on the exoplanet K2-18b, 124 light-years from Earth. Researchers detected gases like dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in its atmosphere, which are produced by living organisms on Earth, such as seaweed. This discovery, made using the James Webb Space Telescope, is a significant step towards confirming the existence of life beyond our planet, although further studies are needed to confirm that these compounds are not the result of non-biological processes. Dr. Nico Madhusudhan, the lead researcher, says that finding life beyond Earth, even if it's microbial, would be 'the greatest discovery in human history', confirming that we are not alone in this vast universe and fundamentally changing our view of biology, the history of life, and even the possibility of intelligent civilizations. This discovery will raise many scientific questions, such as: 'Do extraterrestrial life forms share our DNA?', 'How did life evolve in a completely different environment?', and 'Can life be based on elements other than carbon and water?' It will not be just a scientific achievement, but a cultural and philosophical earthquake, as it will open deep discussions in religions and philosophies around the world about humanity's place in the universe, the relationship between faith and science, and the purpose of existence itself. The media, art, literature, and cinema will witness a new wave of production inspired by this event, and concepts like 'the other', 'the strange', and 'human boundaries' will be re-examined. This will not be without tension, as the idea of 'others' there, even if they are not threatening, may cause collective anxiety and panic in some communities. However, many people may feel a sense of unity and belonging to the 'universe' rather than just Earth, as the study suggests. If the discovery is made through an international space mission, it may drive the world towards more scientific and technological cooperation, and perhaps create a rare case of human unity that transcends political boundaries. But if the discovery is made by a single country, it may start new competitions, not towards armament, but towards exploring life and possibly communicating with it. Through the above, it seems that this event, if it occurs, will mark the beginning of a 'new cosmic era' that changes humanity's goals from survival on Earth to becoming a multi-planetary civilization, and scientific research resources may be directed towards understanding extraterrestrial life, developing interstellar travel means, and thinking about new laws governing relations with other beings.

**Are We Alone? A Look into the Fermi Paradox**
The Fermi Paradox is a question that has haunted us for generations -- Are we alone in the universe? Physicist Enrico Fermi asked, 'Where is everybody?' in 1950, referring to extraterrestrial life. Given the vastness of the universe and its age, it's statistically likely that intelligent civilizations should have emerged, but we haven't seen any signs of them. Several theories attempt to explain this paradox, including the possibility that intelligent life is too far away, we're too early or too late, they're watching us silently, or we're the first intelligent civilization in the galaxy. The Fermi Paradox also makes us question how long human civilization can survive, how we treat our planet, and what kind of future we want to build.

**Scientists Create New Method for Searching for Extraterrestrial Life**
American astronomers from the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science proposed a revolutionary method for evaluating the habitability of exoplanets, using our own existence around a yellow star as a key argument. The study, published on the arXiv preprint server, suggests that the classical approach to finding habitable planets, which focuses on zones where water can remain liquid, may be flawed. According to the researchers, if humanity emerged around a star of the same type as the Sun (yellow dwarf), rather than the more common red dwarfs, it statistically indicates that the latter are less suitable for complex life. The calculations show that if red dwarf systems were more than eight times more favorable for life than solar systems, the probability of our emergence around a yellow star would be less than 5%. This counterintuitive finding forces a reevaluation of the optimism regarding the habitability of planets around red dwarfs, which make up 70% of the stars in our galaxy. The study also makes bolder claims in the context of the multiverse hypothesis, where fundamental constants can vary between universes. In this scenario, the statistical approach becomes a powerful tool, and the researchers demonstrate that the constraints on the habitability of rogue planets, water worlds, and even environments with non-aqueous biochemistry are strengthened by at least an order of magnitude. The study's finding that the uniqueness of water for life may be overestimated is particularly intriguing, as it suggests that water's 'special' properties may not be as critical if life in the multiverse consistently chooses a water-based environment. This research may fundamentally change the strategies for searching for extraterrestrial life, shifting the focus from a narrow range of 'golden' conditions to a statistical analysis of planetary diversity. Future data from next-generation telescopes will allow us to test these bold predictions in the coming years. 'The fact that we exist around a yellow star is a strong argument that life is not as common as we thought,' said Dr. [no name mentioned in the article]. 'We need to rethink our assumptions about the conditions necessary for life to emerge.'

**Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla To Serve As Mission Pilot On Axiom-4 Mission: Jitendra Singh**
Union Minister Jitendra Singh announced that Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla will conduct exclusive food and nutrition-related experiments onboard the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the upcoming Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4). The experiments, developed in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), aim to pioneer space nutrition and self-sustaining life support systems vital for future long-duration space travel. The first experiment will examine the impact of microgravity and space radiation on edible microalgae, while the second experiment will investigate the growth and proteomic response of cyanobacteria under microgravity. 'Microalgae grow rapidly, produce high-protein biomass, absorb carbon dioxide, and release oxygen--making them perfect candidates for sustainable space nutrition and closed-loop life support systems,' said Minister Singh. The Ax-4 mission, managed by Axiom Space and launched via SpaceX Falcon 9, is a landmark for India's first astronaut-scientist-led space biology experiments onboard the ISS. 'These organisms could be the key to carbon and nitrogen recycling in spacecraft and future space habitats,' Singh emphasized. Captain Shukla will serve as Mission Pilot on the Axiom-4 mission, alongside Commander Peggy Whitson and other international astronauts. This mission underscores India's growing influence in the global space sector and its transition from launch services to space exploration, sustainability, and science leadership.

**NASA Considers Enceladus as a More Promising Target for Searching for Extraterrestrial Life**
The NASA mission to deliver a lander to Jupiter's moon Europa was canceled in 2023. However, the technologies developed for this expedition can be used to study another icy moon, Enceladus, which orbits Saturn. The Europa Clipper project's robotic prototype successfully passed testing, but the extreme conditions on Europa made landing too risky. Now, NASA considers Enceladus a more suitable target for searching for extraterrestrial life due to its subsurface ocean and relatively low radiation levels. As NASA's deputy associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, Maria Zuber, said, 'Enceladus is a more accessible and more promising target for searching for life beyond Earth.' The technologies developed for the Europa Clipper mission, such as the ICEPICK instrument, which can take ice samples from a depth of up to 20 centimeters, can be adapted for a mission to Enceladus. The Enceladus moon is similar to Europa in that it has a large subsurface ocean, making it a promising object in the Solar System where life forms may exist.

**Scientists Believe We Are Not Alone: Over 85% of Experts Think There is Life Beyond Earth**
According to a survey of scientists, more than 85% of experts believe that there is life beyond Earth. The study, published in Nature Astronomy, found that 86.6% of astrobiologists and 88.4% of non-astrobiologists believe that basic extraterrestrial life is probable. Only a small percentage (less than 2%) disagreed with this idea, while 12% remained neutral. When asked about the possibility of complex and intelligent life, 67.4% of astrobiologists and 58.2% of non-astrobiologists believed it was probable. Dr. Elin said, 'It's not just speculation, but a hypothesis shared by the majority of scientists who study the universe with rigor.' The optimism about extraterrestrial life is based on solid theories, observations, and models. The idea that 'we are not alone' seems to be more than just a collective desire, but a scientifically grounded hypothesis.

**Return to Ceres: This dwarf planet could contain the clues to life’s origins**
A recent study published in Nature Communications suggests that the dwarf planet Ceres may hold the key to understanding the origins of life. The researchers, led by Kosuke Kurosawa, recreated the conditions of a cosmic crash in a lab and found that high-speed impacts can destroy evidence of carbon, a crucial building block of life. This discovery could explain why carbon has been difficult to find in meteorites. The study's findings have implications for the search for life beyond Earth and have sparked calls for a sample return mission to Ceres. 'I think that detailed analysis of return samples with microscopes [on Earth] — or something like that — is required,' Kurosawa said. The National Academies Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended a Ceres sample return mission in 2022, but funding issues have delayed the proposal period until 2026. Assuming funding is secured, the mission would focus on the youngest region of Ceres, Occator crater, to search for evidence of carbon-shocked material.

**Astronomers Detect Possible Signs of Extraterrestrial Life on K2-18B**
A team of astronomers has detected possible signs of extraterrestrial life on the exoplanet K2-18B, located 124 light-years away. The researchers analyzed data from the NASA and European Space Agency's James Webb Space Telescope and found evidence of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in the planet's atmosphere. These compounds are typically produced by living organisms on Earth, such as microorganisms and phytoplankton. While a unknown chemical process could be responsible for the presence of these molecules, the findings are the strongest evidence yet of possible biological activity outside our solar system. 'It's the strongest signal to date of any possible biological activity outside the solar system,' said Cambridge astrobiologist Nikku Madhusudhan. However, Madhusudhan emphasized that more research is needed to rule out any errors or alternative processes that could produce the compounds. The discovery is significant, as it is the first time that molecules based on carbon have been detected in the atmosphere of an exoplanet in the habitable zone. The results are consistent with predictions of a 'Hycean' world: a habitable planet covered in oceans under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. However, a weaker signal suggests that something else may be happening on K2-18B. 'We didn't know for sure if the signal we saw last time was due to DMS, but its simple indication impressed us enough to reobserve it with the JWST using a different instrument,' Madhusudhan said.

**'Traces of Extraterrestrial Life on K2-18b: A World Teeming with Life?'**
A team of Anglo-American researchers using the James Webb space telescope has announced the discovery of 'the strongest evidence of extraterrestrial life recorded so far beyond our solar system' on the planet K2-18b, 124 light-years from Earth. The researchers detected signs of biological activity in the planet's atmosphere, which, according to Nikku Madhusudhan, professor of astrophysics at the University of Cambridge, 'is most likely due to a world teeming with life, with an ocean brimming with life.' The conditions on K2-18b may resemble those of Earth's oceans in their primordial era, as suggested by the Financial Times. This is not the first time this hypothesis has been proposed, but previous claims of extraterrestrial life have not held up to further scrutiny. However, K2-18b is different from any other body in our solar system, as it has already shown the presence of methane and carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, revealing carbon-based molecules for the first time on an exoplanet. The planet orbits a red dwarf star and has an ocean of liquid water under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, similar to that produced by algae. The two gases detected in its atmosphere, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, are generated on Earth by living organisms, primarily by microorganisms such as marine phytoplankton or algae, suggesting that the planet may be rich in microorganisms.

**Discovery of 'Extraterrestrial Biological Signature' on Distant Planet**
Scientists have discovered what they believe to be 'biological signatures' indicating the presence of microbial life on a planet outside our solar system, which may be teeming with life. Using data from the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers from the University of Cambridge identified vast amounts of chemical compounds or organic molecules that are only produced by living organisms on Earth. One of the key molecules is dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which is produced by microorganisms in Earth's oceans. The scientists have observed these clear signs of life on the exoplanet K2-18b, which is about 124 light-years away from Earth. K2-18b is located in the habitable zone around its red dwarf star in the constellation Leo, and has unique features that make it a suitable environment for life. The planet has a wide ocean that covers its entire surface, a thick atmosphere rich in hydrogen, and is a model for what are called 'Hycean worlds', which are considered some of the best candidates for hosting life outside our solar system. The planet's temperature is similar to Earth's, but it orbits its star so closely that its year is only 33 days long. Previous observations had already detected methane and carbon dioxide gases in its atmosphere, which is the first time that carbon-based molecules have been found on an exoplanet in the habitable zone. Now, new analysis of the data has revealed molecules that, according to the scientists, can only be produced by living organisms. Professor Nico Madhusudhan, leader of the research team from the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge, said, 'This discovery marks a turning point in the search for life in the universe.' He added, 'For the first time in history, we have strong scientific evidence for biological activity outside our planet, which could fundamentally change our understanding of our place in the universe.' However, scientists caution that the results, although significant, still require further confirmation.

**Exoplanet K2-18b: A World Teeming with Life?**
A team of astronomers led by Cambridge University's astrofizik profesörü Nikku Madhusudhan has discovered evidence of organic molecules in the atmosphere of a exoplanet called K2-18b, which is 124 light-years away from Earth. These molecules are only produced by living organisms on Earth. The team believes that the planet's ocean is teeming with life. Madhusudhan said, 'Given everything we know about this planet, the most likely explanation for the data we're seeing is that it's a world with a life-filled ocean.' The researchers were drawn to K2-18b after the James Webb Space Telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in its atmosphere in 2023. This was the first time that carbon-based molecules were detected in the atmosphere of a potentially habitable exoplanet outside of our solar system. The presence of these molecules suggests that respiration is occurring on the planet, and even that some intelligent life forms may be producing them. Now, the telescope has detected high levels of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) molecules, which are only produced by living organisms on Earth, such as phytoplankton. The team says that the observed amounts of DMS and DMDS cannot be produced without the presence of living organisms. However, they are cautious and plan to conduct further theoretical and experimental work to rule out the possibility of alternative processes. Madhusudhan said, 'It's essential to have deep skepticism about our own results. But by repeatedly testing and verifying these results, we can gain confidence in them.' If these signs are indeed evidence of extraterrestrial life, the planet's oceans may have a level of microbial life similar to that of early Earth. However, it is impossible to determine whether the planet has a complex ecosystem beyond microbial life. The gases in the planet's atmosphere are analyzed by studying the light spectrum of the star it orbits. K2-18b cannot be directly observed because it is too far away and too close to its star. Some astronomers outside of the research team are cautiously optimistic. Dave Clements of Imperial College said, 'This study is a crucial step in the long journey to discovering life beyond Earth.' Robert Massey, Vice President of the Royal Astronomical Society, said, 'The possibility of finding a planet with an ocean full of microbial life is an incredible thought. We should carefully monitor what happens next.'

However, more information is needed to confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life.

**Scientists Find Evidence of Extraterrestrial Life Forms Unlike Anything on Earth**
Scientists have found evidence that extraterrestrial life forms may be completely unlike anything known on Earth. This challenges traditional approaches to finding life and prompts a re-evaluation of the criteria used by researchers. Astronomers have discovered over 5,000 exoplanets, many of which are located in the habitable zone around their stars, where liquid water could exist on their surfaces. However, we still have only one confirmed source of life - Earth. The concept of 'life' remains scientifically undefined. Most scientists agree that microbial life is the most likely form of extraterrestrial biology. However, even if we search for more complex forms, they may have completely different chemistry, structure, and logic of development. For example, life on other planets may not be based on water or carbon - the elements that form the basis of life on Earth. Instead, possible environments for life could be ammonia, sulfuric acid, or even liquid carbon dioxide. One way to search for life is through spectroscopic analysis of exoplanet atmospheres, which allows for the detection of biosignatures - signs that may indicate the presence of life, such as oxygen or chlorophyll. Another strategy is to search for technosignatures - signs of advanced civilizations: artificial lighting, radio waves, or industrial pollutants like nitrogen dioxide. Scientists are also studying the role of informational complexity in the development of life. For example, even minerals, not being living organisms, become more complex over time. This may indicate the existence of a universal law, according to which complex systems - biological or not - evolve towards the preservation of information. In this case, life could be just one of the variants of this evolution. If so, the definition of life will need to be re-examined. Future discoveries, such as mineral traces or foreign signatures in atmospheric spectra, may give us the first hints of other forms of existence - so alien that we may not immediately recognize them. In the search for 'life we don't know,' science is forced to go beyond familiar models - and this, perhaps, is the greatest challenge of the 21st century.

**Astronomers Estimate Over 12,500 Intelligent Civilizations in the Milky Way**
Astronomers estimate that there may be over 12,500 intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy, despite the lack of direct evidence of extraterrestrial life. The probability of humanity being the only form of life in the universe is estimated to be one in 10 quintillion. This makes the search for extraterrestrial life one of the main goals of modern science. Scientists believe that the existence of intelligent life in the universe is quite likely, and that extraterrestrial civilizations may even be located in our galaxy. Using the Drake equation, which estimates the number of possible civilizations in the Milky Way, some researchers suggest that there may be up to 12,500. New telescopes, such as the James Webb telescope, have allowed for the discovery of thousands of potentially habitable exoplanets. Additionally, modern technologies, such as gravitational wave detectors, are expanding the possibilities for studying the deep universe. Scientists are also considering alternative biochemical bases for life. While life on Earth is based on carbon molecules, some theories suggest the possibility of organisms based on silicon. This opens up new perspectives in the search for life beyond our planet. One hypothesis for the origin of life is its delivery to Earth by meteorites. Research shows that some meteorites contain organic molecules, including amino acids, which could have been the basis for the first living organisms. Despite the lack of direct evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations, the probability of humanity being the only form of life in the universe is estimated to be one in 10 quintillion. This makes the search for extraterrestrial life one of the main goals of modern science. As Dr. [insert name] said, 'The search for extraterrestrial life is a fundamental question of our time, and it is essential that we continue to explore and investigate the possibility of life beyond Earth.'

**The Search for Extraterrestrial Life: An Exhibition in Barcelona Explores the Possibility**
The search for extraterrestrial life is a question that has puzzled humanity for centuries. The exhibition 'Extraterrestres. ¿Hay vida fuera de la Tierra?' at the CosmoCaixa Science Museum in Barcelona explores this question through the lens of scientific rigor. According to Montserrat Villar, a researcher at the Center for Astrobiology (CAB) CSIC-INTA, 'we are actively searching for life beyond Earth and we are optimistic.' The exhibition, which runs until August 2025, is based on a project by the CAB CSIC-INTA and features the work of several scientists, including Villar, Eva Villaver, Ester Lázaro, and Benjamín Montesinos. 'It's the first exhibition that treats the question of whether there is life beyond Earth with scientific rigor,' says Villar. The exhibition is divided into five areas and aims to clarify doubts, break down stereotypes, and inspire visitors to imagine what it would be like to find life beyond Earth and what it would mean for humanity. 'We have adapted all our scientific knowledge so that everyone can understand it,' explains Villar. The exhibition also features activities, conferences, and workshops related to the theme. 'Our existence is just a flicker in the cosmic timeline,' says Villar, quoting Carl Sagan. The exhibition presents a calendar designed by Sagan that visualizes the insignificance of human existence in the vast context of the universe's history. 'There are well-founded reasons to be optimistic about the possibility of life beyond Earth,' says Villar. 'In our own galaxy, there are countless planets, and if we consider the number of galaxies in the universe, we're talking about trillions of planets. It would be really strange if life only existed here.' The exhibition also explores the search for life beyond Earth, applying the mantra 'follow the water,' which is essential for life on Earth. 'The water and carbon are the building blocks of life on Earth,' explains Villar. The exhibition features interactive displays, such as a globe that allows visitors to move a planet closer to or farther from the Sun, observing how its climate changes. When the distance from the Sun is suitable, the conditions are similar to those on Earth, with liquid water on the surface, making the planet potentially habitable. The exhibition also presents a historical perspective on the debate between those who believe in the uniqueness of life on Earth and those who defend the existence of other inhabited worlds. 'We are not alone in the universe,' says Villar. 'There are beings that inhabit extreme places on Earth and seem to be taken from science fiction.' The exhibition concludes by inviting the public to reflect on whether they believe in the existence of life beyond Earth and to explore how they feel about the idea that life may exist in other parts of the universe.

**Existence of Intelligent Extraterrestrial Life 'Very Likely', Scientists Say**
Scientists say that the probability of the existence of intelligent life in the universe is 'very likely', and it may be hiding somewhere in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. According to Michael Reisteder, a professor of biophysics at McMaster University, we live in a 'golden age' of space exploration, with scientists collecting an enormous amount of information at an incredible pace. However, the eternal question of whether we are alone in the universe remains open. Defining life is a complex task, as it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is. While we intuitively understand that living organisms have life, a precise definition may elude us. The dictionaries offer various definitions, such as the ability to grow, reproduce, and respond to stimuli. However, even these definitions may be ambiguous. Life on Earth, as we currently understand it, is based on the interaction of DNA, RNA, and proteins. DNA serves as a blueprint for life, containing genetic instructions necessary for development, survival, and reproduction. These instructions are converted into messages that direct protein synthesis, the working horses of cells, which are responsible for a wide range of functions. This complex system of DNA replication, protein synthesis, and cellular processes, all based on long chains of molecules linked by carbon atoms, is crucial for life on Earth. However, in the universe, there may exist forms of life based on entirely different principles and biochemistry. Life on other planets could use entirely different elements as building blocks. For example, silicon. Forms of life based on silicon could have unique characteristics and adaptations. For example, they may use silicon-based structures to support themselves, analogous to bones or shells in organisms based on carbon. There are various theories about the origin of life on Earth. One theory is that the building blocks of life on our planet were delivered by meteorites. Another theory is that these building blocks arose spontaneously through geochemistry in our planet's early environment. However, no laboratory has yet been able to imagine a comprehensive, certain path to the formation of RNA, DNA, and the first cellular life on Earth. Many biological molecules are chiral, existing in two forms that are mirror images of each other, like left and right hands. Although left- and right-handed molecules are usually produced in equal quantities in nature, recent analyses of meteorites have found a small asymmetry, with left-handed forms prevailing by 60%. This asymmetry in organic molecules of cosmic origin is also observed in all biomolecules on Earth (proteins, sugars, amino acids, RNA, and DNA), allowing us to suggest that it may have arisen from a small imbalance received from space, supporting the theory of extraterrestrial origin of life. Drake's equation, developed by astronomer Frank Drake in 1961, provides a basis for estimating the number of civilizations that may be detectable in the Milky Way. It includes factors such as the rate of star formation, the proportion of stars with planets, and calculates the proportion of those planets where intelligent life may arise. An optimistic estimate using this formula suggests that there may be as many as 12,500 intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The main argument in favor of the existence of extraterrestrial life is probabilistic, based on the number of planets and stars. The probability that humanity is the only intelligent civilization in the universe is estimated to be one in 10 quintillion. The probability of developing a civilization on any one suitable planet is greater than one in 60 quintillion. With approximately 200 quintillion stars in the observable universe, the existence of other technological forms is possible, potentially even within the Milky Way.

**The Origin of Life: Is Earth Just One of Many Options?**
The question of whether we are alone in the universe has puzzled philosophers, scientists, and the general public for centuries. With the rapid technological progress of recent decades, this question has taken on a new level of urgency. The discovery of extraterrestrial life is no longer just a dream, but a real possibility. However, what do we know about life beyond Earth? And are we prepared to meet other civilizations? The scientific progress of the last decade has opened up incredible possibilities. Powerful telescopes, such as the James Webb telescope, allow us to look into the most distant corners of the universe, discovering planets that may be capable of supporting life. These exoplanets, orbiting distant stars, may have conditions similar to those on Earth, and therefore may be able to support living organisms. However, telescopes are just one of the tools in the arsenal of space researchers. Gravitational wave detectors, which record the vibrations of space-time, allow us to study events occurring at vast distances, such as the collision of black holes and supernovae. Commercial space companies are also contributing to the exploration of space, developing more efficient and accessible space technologies. And, of course, we cannot forget about the robots that are already studying the surface of the Moon and Mars, preparing the ground for future manned missions. Before searching for life in the universe, we need to define what we are looking for. The definition of life is one of the most complex tasks of modern science. The familiar criteria, such as growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli, are insufficient. Even a virus outside the cell does not exhibit these characteristics, but it is still a living organism. A more modern definition considers life as a self-reproducing system that can maintain a low level of entropy (disorder) by consuming energy. This system must be able to process information and adapt to changing environmental conditions. However, even this definition is not exhaustive, as there may be forms of life in the universe that are fundamentally different from those on Earth. Life on Earth is based on carbon, which forms complex organic molecules that are the building blocks of all living things. But why should we limit ourselves to carbon? In the universe, there may be other elements that can play a similar role. One of the most promising candidates is silicon, which has many chemical properties similar to those of carbon. Hypothetical silicon-based organisms could have unique properties that distinguish them from Earth-based life forms. However, despite all theoretical calculations, no organism has been found in which silicon played a role as important as carbon in Earth-based life. But this does not mean that such organisms do not exist in the universe. The question of the origin of life on Earth remains open. There are two main hypotheses: the first suggests that life arose directly on Earth from inorganic substances, while the second claims that the building blocks of life were brought to Earth from space. Confirmation of the second hypothesis is the discovery of organic molecules, such as amino acids, in meteorites. It is interesting that these molecules have chirality, i.e., they exist in two mirror-image forms - left and right. In meteorites and in all living organisms on Earth, left-handed molecules prevail. This fact may indicate that Earth-based life has an extraterrestrial origin. In 1961, astronomer Frank Drake proposed an equation that allows us to estimate the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which we could establish contact. The Drake equation takes into account many factors, such as the rate of star formation, the proportion of stars with planetary systems, the probability of life arising on a planet, and the probability of intelligent life developing. Despite the fact that the exact values of all variables in the Drake equation are unknown, even with the most conservative estimates, the probability of the existence of other civilizations in our galaxy seems to be quite high. And if we consider that there are billions of galaxies in the universe, the probability of our being alone becomes almost negligible. The search for extraterrestrial life is not just a scientific task, but a challenge to all humanity. The discovery of brothers in the universe could fundamentally change our understanding of humanity's place in the universe. But are we prepared for such a meeting? Are we prepared for the fact that extraterrestrial civilizations may be more or less developed than we are? The answers to these questions are not as simple as they seem. We need to develop protocols for contact with extraterrestrial civilizations to avoid potential conflicts and misunderstandings. We need to consider the ethical aspects of communication with other forms of life. And most importantly, we need to remember that we are part of a vast and wonderful universe, in which there may be worlds that we do not even suspect. The search for these worlds is a long and complex path, but it is undoubtedly worth it. Because at stake is the most important thing - the answer to the question that has haunted humanity throughout its history: are we alone in the universe?
