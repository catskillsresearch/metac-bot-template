**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak predicts a dystopian future for humanity, with the global population shrinking to 100 million by 2300 due to AI replacing jobs and causing a collapse in birth rates. According to Prof. Kak, 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He warns that major cities like New York and London will become ghost towns, and that the world will be devastated. Prof. Kak, author of 'The Age of Artificial Intelligence', says that people are unaware of the consequences of AI and that it's likely that the world population will collapse. He also mentions that billionaire Elon Musk has expressed similar concerns, suggesting that humans should consider colonizing space to avoid extinction. Prof. Kak states, 'It's likely. I have all the data in the book. This is not just my personal opinion.'

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to around 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that birth rates are already plummeting in many countries, including Europe, China, Japan, and Korea, due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. He also notes that the great cities of the modern world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to such a low number. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential risks of AI. He emphasizes that nobody really knows what the future holds, but a population collapse is already occurring.

**Indonesia has more people than Russia, Canada, Australia & Germany put together**
According to the UN projections for the year 2100, Indonesia is expected to surpass the combined population of Russia, Canada, Australia, and Germany. By 2100, African countries such as Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Egypt are expected to form more than 10% of the global population. In contrast, China is expected to lose nearly half its people by the end of the century, while Russia and Japan are also in demographic decline. As the author notes, 'a lot of demographic dividend is yet to be realized' in countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nigeria, which are currently ranked lowly in terms of GDP.

**The World's Population: A Complex Tapestry of Human Experience**
The world's population has reached over 8 billion people, with a total of around 107 billion people having lived on Earth throughout history. The first billion was reached in 1800, the second in the early 20th century, and the sixth in the year 2000. According to the UN, the population is expected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050. To put this number into perspective, if all people were lined up in a row, the line would be over 3.5 million kilometers long. The author of the article came across a website that displays real-time statistics, including the current population, births, and deaths, as well as the number of people doing various activities such as sleeping, working, eating, and using the internet. The author reflects on the diversity of human experiences and the fact that people are doing different things at the same time, from falling in love to experiencing pain and loss. The article concludes that every moment is important and that statistics can reveal the complexities of human life.

**Building a Sustainable Future: The Key to Successful City Development**
The world's population is becoming increasingly urbanized, with 54% of the world's population living in cities today, and this number is expected to reach 60% by 2030. Cities play a crucial role in economic development, with 90% of the world's GDP expected to come from cities by 2030. The demand for comfortable and eco-friendly urban environments has increased due to population growth and the pandemic. This demand is driving countries to renovate existing cities and build new ones that meet modern standards. However, renovating existing cities can be costly and complex, and may not solve all the problems. Building new cities can be a more effective and efficient solution, as it can create a strong economic driver, stimulate the construction industry, create jobs, and attract private investments. The article highlights several examples of new city projects in Central Asia, including the New Tashkent project in Uzbekistan, which is expected to cost up to 30 billion dollars and have a population of 1 million people. The article also mentions the importance of creating a sustainable and eco-friendly urban environment, and highlights the need for a clear and strategic approach to urban planning. According to the article, the five key principles for successful city development are: 1) a clear and strategic approach to urban planning, 2) a focus on sustainability and eco-friendliness, 3) a strong economic driver, 4) a clear and transparent investment model, and 5) a effective and efficient governance model. The article concludes by highlighting the potential for Central Asian cities to become a model for sustainable and successful urban development, and to set new standards for cities around the world.

**By 2080, 90% of global population will live in cities, says urbanist**
According to global urbanist Greg Clark, by 2080, the world's population will have peaked at 10 billion, with nearly 90% living in cities. Clark emphasizes the need for adaptable and sustainable cities to accommodate population growth, and notes that once global numbers start to decline, there will be a need for strategies to redistribute the world population in ways that preserve the planet's well-being. Clark highlights the challenges of urban concentration, including inequality and environmental pollution, and outlines the need for innovation in food, housing, and transport sectors. He expresses optimism about the transport sector, but notes that the housing and food problems will require more ingenuity. Clark also emphasizes the need to reconcile cities with the natural world, and suggests that integrating nature into urban spaces could address many pressing challenges.

**'I'm from Africa's largest mega-city that's set to have 100m people by 2100'**
Olu Asuni, a 25-year-old public relations expert, shares her experiences growing up in Lagos, Africa's largest mega-city, which is expected to have 100 million people by 2100. She describes Lagos as 'vibrant, loud, and full of life,' but also 'intense, unpredictable, and chaotic.' Despite the city's challenges, Olu says there's a strong sense of community and a 'whole experience' that's 'incredibly fun.' However, she notes that the city is currently facing a 'very uncertain political climate' and a 'Japa culture' where young people are leaving Nigeria to find better opportunities. Olu says she'd love to move back to Lagos, but only if the city becomes more 'liveable.' She also highlights the city's hidden gems, such as JazzHole and Bogobiri, and encourages people not to write off Lagos too quickly, saying it's 'full of heart' and 'culture, tradition, humour, and resilience.'

**The Case for 100 Million Canadians | The Walrus**
Canada's population is expected to decline in the coming years, and some experts argue that the country needs to increase its population to 100 million by 2100 to survive. This idea was first proposed by Wilfrid Laurier in the early 20th century, and has been revived by the Century Initiative, a group of scholars and business leaders. The economic case for increasing the population is compelling, as it would help to address Canada's aging population, rising healthcare costs, and plummeting fertility rates. However, critics argue that the plan is nothing more than a corporate push for more profits, and that it would have devastating impacts on Canada's ecosystems and francophone culture. Some experts also raise concerns about the readiness of Canada's resources to support a larger population, and the potential for rapid population growth to backfire and turn public opinion against immigration. Despite this, many experts believe that striving for a population of 100 million by 2100 is the right thing for Canada, and that it would provide the country with the population density it needs to build out green infrastructure and reduce suburban sprawl. However, careful planning and collaboration with First Nations, French Canadians, and environmentalists would be necessary to achieve this goal. 'Canada is now a more complex, multilayered, difficult, and expensive place,' writes Saunders, 'If we expect another 65 million people to become successful Canadians, we need to ask whether we have the ready resources that helped the current 35 million get there.'

**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**
British paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species. 'If we make a concerted effort to expand into the Universe, we could 'live -- potentially -- for millions of years,' he says. However, he warns that if we don't take action, 'there might be no one left on the Earth for you to wave back to.'

**World Population Expected to Peak at 10.3 Billion by 2100**
The world's population is expected to peak at 10.3 billion by 2100, with an 80% chance of reaching this number, according to the United Nations (UN). After that, the population will start to decline. This is a more pessimistic prediction than 10 years ago, when it was estimated that the peak population would be over 12 billion. The UN's report, 'Perspectivas da População Mundial em 2024', states that many countries have already reached their peak population, including 63 nations such as Germany, Russia, China, and Japan. The report also predicts that 48 countries, including Brazil, will reach their peak population between 2025 and 2054. In contrast, 126 countries, including the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan, are expected to continue growing after 2054. According to the UN, despite the predicted decline in population, life expectancy is expected to increase. 'In the last three decades, mortality rates have decreased and life expectancy has increased significantly,' said the UN. 'After a brief decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy at birth is increasing again, reaching 73.3 years in 2024, up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.'

**From India To Egypt, 10 Countries Likely To Be Most Populated By 2100 - News18**
According to the United Nations Population Division, by 2100, the world population is expected to reach 10.4 billion. India will remain the most populous country, with an estimated 1.53 billion people, while China's population will decline to 771 million. Africa will experience exponential growth, with Nigeria becoming the third most populous country, followed by Pakistan, the DRC, the US, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Egypt. The population growth is influenced by fertility rates, longevity, and migrations. While population growth brings challenges such as resource strain and environmental degradation, it can also be an opportunity for investment in education, job creation, and healthcare.

**Dire Future Predicted for the World by 2100: Rising Sea Levels, Extreme Weather, and Catastrophic Air Pollution**
A study using Google's ImageFX generator and the latest scientific research predicts a dire future for the world by 2100. Cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main factors will be rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions. If nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these changes will continue for a century. Climate scientist Professor Julian Stoye said, 'The biggest impact that everyone will feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will be increasing over the century if we do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.' The IPCC predicts that the global temperature will rise by 2.7°C by 2100 under a medium scenario and by 4.4°C under a worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than double, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. Countries like France, already struggling with water scarcity, will likely face devastating droughts. It is predicted that only extreme heat will lead to 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. Barcelona will be the most affected city, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. The study predicts that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather events will become more frequent, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. The risk of sudden floods will be high in areas where droughts have already weakened the land. Mega-tornadoes will become more common, posing a threat to countries like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the southern states of the US. Large-scale forest fires will also become more frequent, with a 50% increase in extreme forest fires by 2100. The World Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with 60,000 additional deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.

**Scientists Predict Bleak Future for Earth in 2100**
Scientists from Google and MailOnline used a generator with artificial intelligence to predict what the world will be like in 2100. The picture is bleak: cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main impact will be the rise in sea levels and extreme weather conditions. 'The biggest impact we'll feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will increase over the century if we don't do anything to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,' said Dr. Julian Stowell, a climate expert from University College London. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that the global temperature will be 2.7°C higher than the pre-industrial average by 2100, and 4.4°C higher in the worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than twice, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. 'This will lead to devastating droughts in countries like France, which are already struggling with systematic water shortages,' said Dr. Stowell. It is predicted that only excessive heat will cause 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. The city of Barcelona will be the most affected, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. 'This will warm the Arctic even faster, leading to more melting of Greenland and a faster rise in sea levels, destabilization of permafrost zones, and disruption of deep ocean currents,' said Dr. Stowell. It is predicted that more than half of the world's glaciers will disappear by 2100, and the European Alps will lose 75% of their glaciers under a high-emissions scenario. Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore predict that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather will become more frequent and intense, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. 'When these sudden downpours hit areas where drought has already weakened the land, the risk of catastrophic flooding becomes extremely high,' said experts. The number of 'megastorms' will increase, which occur when warm, moist air rises from the ocean. For places like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and southern US states, these destructive storms will become much more common by 2100. Large forest fires will also become more frequent, as a combination of strong heat and low rainfall makes some regions extremely vulnerable to fires. The UN Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. The frequency of extreme fires will increase by 14% by 2030, 30% by 2050, and 50% by the end of the century. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with cities like Delhi in India facing even worse conditions. Warm air and less rainfall mean that pollution stays in the air longer. In countries experiencing rapid industrial growth, poor environmental regulation has led to hazardous levels of pollution. Research shows that if climate change continues, air pollution will cause an additional 60,000 deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.

**World Population Growth Slows Down, According to UN Report**
According to a report by the United Nations, the world's population is growing at a slower rate than previously predicted. The population is expected to reach 10.8 billion by the end of the century, 200 million fewer than previously forecast. The growth rate of the population is slowing down, with the number of people on Earth growing at its annual rate since 1950. By 2030, the population could reach 8.5 billion, and by 2050, it will reach 9.7 billion. The peak population is expected to be 10.4 billion, which will be reached in the 2080s and will remain at that level until 2100. The key factor behind this slowdown is the decrease in fertility rates, with 61 countries experiencing a decline of 1% or more in fertility rates between 2022 and 2050. Additionally, more than half of the population growth expected by 2050 will be concentrated in eight countries: Egypt, Ethiopia, India, the Philippines, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the United Republic of Tanzania. The population in the working-age group (25-64 years) has been increasing due to recent reductions in fertility rates. As a result, the population is becoming more unevenly distributed across regions, with Africa being the main driver of population growth. This growth is expected to be a challenge to sustainable development, with the population aged 65 or older increasing from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050, coinciding with an increase in life expectancy.
