**Lee backs nuclear power - for now**
Presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables like offshore wind to supply industrial hubs and aims to phase out coal by 2040. He supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60% of the mix. South Korea's latest energy blueprint aims for nuclear to make up 35% of the power mix by 2038, with renewables at 29%. If elected, Lee is expected to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30% of the power mix by 2030.

**Why the spectre of Trump looms over Starmer's defence review**
The Labour Party's defence review, written by George Robertson, Richard Barrons, and Fiona Hill, will draw on lessons from the Ukraine war to determine the UK's defence strategy for the next decade. The review aims to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP within two years and potentially reach 3% by 2034. However, US President Trump has called for Nato countries to spend 5% of GDP on defence, and Lord Ricketts suggests the UK may need to rise to 3.5% of GDP. The review recommends building up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of the Aukus programme with the US and Australia, and potentially buying US equipment, including American-made planes armed with tactical nuclear weapons. The full scale of the government's response to the review, which is thought to have accepted all 62 of its recommendations, will reset the UK's defence strategy for the next decade.

**South Korean presidential front-runner backs nuclear power - for now**
South Korea's presidential front-runner Lee Jae-myung has pledged to keep nuclear power 'for the time being,' but plans a long-term shift to renewables if elected. Lee's 'energy expressway' policy framework relies on renewables, like offshore wind, to supply industrial hubs, and calls for phasing out coal by 2040 and curbing natural gas consumption. Lee supports extending the life of existing nuclear plants, but opposes new reactors, citing land constraints and waste management issues. Lee said, 'Nuclear power is inherently dangerous and there are sustainability issues. Let's utilise it, but not too much. And we should transition to renewable energy.' In contrast, Lee's main rival Kim Moon-soo supports the addition of six new reactors and aims to raise nuclear's share to 60 per cent of the mix. Analysts expect Lee to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30 per cent of the power mix by 2030, while Kim is likely to retain the current push for nuclear power.

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey, is planning to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War. This move includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. The goal is to increase the resilience of Britain in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The funding will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. Sir Keir Starmer said, 'In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests, is vital.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also set to meet with NATO heads of government in The Hague next month to discuss defence spending targets, with NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte suggesting a high defence spend target of 5%.

However, Mr Han Byung-Hwa, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities, expects Lee to focus on renewables, potentially aiming to lift the energy source to more than 30 per cent of the power mix by 2030. 'One of the hurdles to entering the AI era is power,' said Mr Jaeseung Kim, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities. 'Whoever wins will have no choice but to accept and use nuclear power for the time being.'

**British fighter jets will carry nuclear weapons for the first time**
British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time as part of the country's biggest defense expansion since the Cold War. The decision, backed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. Defence Secretary John Healey has promised a 'certain decade of rising defence spending', with the goal of reaching 3% GDP by 2034. The Government will also conduct a strategic defence review, exploring 'deliverable and affordable' solutions within the resources available. This move comes after the Government previously set out a goal to reach the 2.5% GDP target by 2027. The Defence Secretary has stated that the UK will meet its target, and the new defence money will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI.

**Russia's Airspace Closure Sparks Concerns Over Potential ICBM Test**
Russian President Putin recently expressed his reluctance to use nuclear weapons, but just a few days later, Russia closed the airspace around its strategic missile test site, sparking international concern that Russia may be preparing to test its intercontinental ballistic missiles. Putin said in a state TV interview, 'I hope we will never need to use those weapons... They try to provoke us into making mistakes, but for now, there is no need to use those weapons.' However, on May 10, Ukraine's military media outlet Militarnyi reported that Russia had issued a NOTAM (flight notice) for the Kapustin Yar missile test site in Astrakhan, closing the airspace from May 12 to 13, and imposing a 'no upper limit' flight restriction. Analysts believe that this 'unrestricted height' airspace closure is likely related to a strategic test of intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear systems, not just routine training. The Kapustin Yar test site is one of Russia's most important missile development bases, and is currently a key location for testing and deploying new missile systems. The international community is concerned that Russia may be planning to test a new type of ICBM, possibly even one that can carry nuclear warheads. US former CIA Director William Burns has previously warned that there was a risk of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons in 2022, and although it did not happen, Moscow's nuclear threat has never truly dissipated. Putin's statement on not wanting to use nuclear weapons has not alleviated concerns about Russia's strategic upgrade, especially given its repeated attempts to shift the blame for the war to NATO's eastward expansion and 'Western humiliation of Russia.' Russia's actions are creating significant uncertainty for Ukraine and neighboring countries, and international observers believe that Putin's goal is to maintain pressure through ambiguous strategy, trying to deter Western support for Ukraine on both diplomatic and military fronts.

**Putin Claims Russia Has Sufficient Forces to Win Ukraine War Without Nuclear Weapons**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in a documentary that Russia has sufficient forces to win the war in Ukraine without using nuclear weapons. According to Putin, 'there was no need to use the weapons you referred to. And I hope it won't be necessary.' Putin also mentioned that there were attempts to provoke Russia into making mistakes, but they were successful in avoiding them. The documentary, which will be broadcast on television today, marks the 25th anniversary of Putin's first inauguration as president. Putin also stated that he thinks about his potential successor, but ultimately, it will be up to the Russian people to choose who they trust. 'A person who does not have the trust of the people will not have opportunities to do something serious. It's a matter of principle,' Putin said. Putin's current term as president will end in 2036, but he could potentially run for re-election in 2030 due to constitutional changes made in 2020.

**UK Seeks to Use Nuclear Weapons Without US Approval**
The UK government wants to use nuclear weapons without prior US approval, according to a report by 'Glavkom' citing Daily Express. A high-ranking representative of the British Royal Navy stated that the UK's nuclear deterrent forces are 'completely independent' of the US position. This move is reportedly due to concerns in London about the UK's vulnerability in light of the changing US foreign policy course. British military officials believe that this could make it difficult to effectively use nuclear potential to prevent 'Russian aggression in Europe.' The Continuous At-Sea Deterrent (CASD) plan involves having at least one nuclear-powered submarine always on standby, ready to launch nuclear weapons at a moment's notice. This move comes as France's President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to deploy a base for hypersonic missiles with nuclear warheads and fighter jets by 2035 to counter Russia. 'We will have the first base with Rafale jets of the new modification,' Macron said.

**UK Seeks Independence from US in Nuclear Arms Use Against Russia**
A high-ranking representative of the British Royal Navy has stated that the UK and its nuclear deterrent forces are fully independent from the US position, according to the Daily Express. This means that the UK can use nuclear weapons without prior US approval. The move comes as concern grows in the UK capital over the country's potential vulnerability, partly due to the White House's policy. British military officials have expressed concerns that using nuclear capabilities to deter 'Russian aggression in Europe' may pose some challenges. The UK's Continuous At-Sea Deterrent (CASD) plan involves maintaining at least one nuclear-powered submarine on standby, ready to receive a potential order to use nuclear weapons, as reported by the publication. This move follows France's announcement to deploy hypersonic missiles with nuclear warheads and new-generation fighter jets by 2035 as part of its 'deterrence' strategy against Russia, as stated by French President Emmanuel Macron.

**Macron's Nuclear Posturing: A Challenge to Russia?**
French President Emmanuel Macron is eager to challenge Russia with his 300 nuclear warheads, despite Russia having over 6,000 warheads. Macron has announced plans to deploy nuclear-capable Rafale fighter jets to a base near Germany starting in 2035. France has a nuclear triad, including land, sea, and air components, with 11 nuclear-powered submarines and new ones on the way. In contrast, Russia has a vast territory of 17 million square kilometers and a population density of 8 people per square kilometer. Macron's comments have been met with criticism, with one author saying, 'Thank you, Macron. Even if the British join in (with around 220 thermonuclear warheads), Russia will not be defeated. But we can defeat them. So, the nuclear deterrence forces of NATO without the Americans are unable to compete with us. The US has been avoiding even mentioning the possibility of using nuclear weapons, understanding that in such a war, there will be no winners or losers.' The author also suggests that the Western 'partners' have forgotten the dangers of nuclear weapons and the threat they pose to humanity.

**Polish President Calls for US to Station Nuclear Weapons in Poland Amid Ukraine Crisis**
Two days after the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire in the Ukraine war, Russia has announced that it will respond to the proposal. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has visited the Kursk region on the border with Ukraine, where Russian troops are expected to fully liberate the area occupied by Ukrainian soldiers. Polish President Andrzej Duda has called on the US to station nuclear weapons in Poland. The EU Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the unrestricted use of Western weapons for Ukrainian attacks on military targets in Russia. Duda said, 'I am calling on the US to station nuclear weapons in Poland.' The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine continues, with millions of people, especially children, women, and the elderly, fleeing to neighboring countries or safe areas within the country. The Glückskette charity is collecting donations to support refugees through its partner organizations in Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary, and Switzerland.

**Macron: Russia Threatens All of Europe, Discusses Using Nuclear Weapons**
French President Emmanuel Macron stated on Wednesday that Russia poses a threat to all of Europe, citing plans to mobilize three million soldiers and produce 4,000 tanks by 2030. Macron emphasized the need for Europe to be prepared for all scenarios, with or without US support, saying, 'I would like to believe that the United States will remain by our side, but we must also be prepared in case they leave us.' He added that the French army is the most ready to fight in Europe and that France has nuclear weapons that ensure European defense. Macron also initiated a discussion on using French nuclear weapons to protect the entire European Union. He stated, 'We have started discussing the possibility of using French nuclear weapons to protect the entire European Union.' Macron also emphasized that Europe's future cannot be decided by the US, and that they are prepared for all scenarios with or without US support. He added, 'Remaining a spectator in this dangerous world is madness.' Macron rejected any ceasefire in Ukraine that does not lead to a lasting peace, saying, 'The path to peace cannot pass through abandoning Ukraine.' He also stated, 'Peace cannot be built at any cost and under Russian dictates, nor can it be an Ukrainian surrender.' Macron announced that Paris will host a meeting next week with the heads of the armed forces of countries willing to contribute to ensuring a future peace in Ukraine, saying, 'Perhaps peace in Ukraine will also require the deployment of European forces. These forces will not go to fight today (...) but they will be there when the peace treaty is signed to ensure its complete respect.' Starting next week, Macron will gather in Paris the heads of the armed forces of countries willing to take on responsibilities in this regard.'

**What Trump got right about nuclear weapons—and how to step back from the brink**
President Donald Trump's recent remarks about nuclear weapons are accurate, stating that the US already has enough nuclear capabilities to destroy the world multiple times over. Trump suggested that the country should focus on other priorities rather than spending $75 billion annually on new nuclear weapons until 2032, which will total over $1.7 trillion over 30 years. This spending is counterproductive, as the US already has a strong nuclear arsenal and engaging in a massive build-up will waste taxpayer dollars and undermine national security. The current US nuclear modernization program is already over budget and behind schedule, and has forced the US to extend the service lives of current systems. The article suggests that the US should pursue a course of hard-nosed diplomacy like President Reagan did to secure the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and negotiate with Russia and China to limit the growing numbers of new nuclear weapons. President Trump has the opportunity to push the US and other nuclear-weapon states to abide by their disarmament promises regarding nuclear weapons, and could even win a Nobel Peace Prize if he succeeds.

**Is a Return to Nuclear Disarmament Among Major Powers Possible?**
U.S. President Donald Trump called on China to reduce its nuclear arsenal during an online address at the World Economic Forum in Davos. China responded by urging the U.S. and Russia to cut their nuclear stockpiles first. Russia expressed its readiness to engage in discussions. However, indicators suggest that nuclear disarmament is unraveling, with a surge in nuclear arms spending and modernization efforts. The U.S. has increased its spending by $10.8 billion in 2023, with a projected budget of $1.5 trillion for modernization until 2040. China has risen to second in terms of spending, estimated at $11.9 billion. Russia, the U.K., and France are also increasing their nuclear capabilities and infrastructure. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is a common theme in nuclear modernization programs, enhancing the effectiveness, safety, and flexibility of nuclear weapons. Despite the challenges, opportunities for initiating a multilateral nuclear disarmament process exist, including a ceasefire in Ukraine and a flexible agenda that does not begin with bans or disarmament. However, constraints, such as the technical vocabulary surrounding the nuclear race and the formation of technical multilateral teams and committees, make it difficult to initiate discussions. The expectation is a continuation of arms races in the coming phase, despite increasing calls for and initiatives toward disarmament.
