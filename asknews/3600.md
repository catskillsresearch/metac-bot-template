**Dems Weigh High-Risk, High-Reward Plan to Win the Senate**
Democratic strategists are considering a high-risk, high-reward plan to win the Senate by quietly backing independent candidates in traditionally Republican states. The strategy involves minimal disclosure and late-cycle involvement to avoid angering the party's base and ruining the candidates' aura of independence. Potential target states include Nebraska, Iowa, and Alaska, where Senate contests are taking place this year. This approach highlights the difficulty of the Senate map for Democrats and the need to repair their brand among a wide swath of the country. Some officials have reached a more dire conclusion, anticipating a challenging midterms next year.

**Toxic exposure**
Iowa Senator Joni Ernst sparked outrage with her comment, 'Well, we're all going to die,' in response to a question about Medicaid cuts. This remark has been compared to the dystopian novel and film Logan's Run, where people are put to death at the age of 30. Many Democratic lawmakers, including Governor JB Pritzker, have criticized Ernst's comment, with Pritzker calling it 'MAGA's one, big, beautiful healthcare plan.' The remark is expected to be used in Democratic commercials, exposing the values of Ernst and the Republican party, which have been described as a 'death cult' and a 'space where only the MAGA are welcomed and embraced.'

**GOP Sen. Joni Ernst gives mock apology to lefty critics for...**
Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst sparked controversy when she acknowledged that everyone dies during a town hall meeting. A heckler shouted 'people will die!' and Ernst responded, 'People are not -- well, we all are going to die. For heaven's sakes, folks.' Ernst later posted a mock apology video on Instagram, saying, 'I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall... And I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this Earth.' Ernst also criticized the 'hysteria that's out there coming from the left' over the blowback to her comments. The proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which features Medicaid reform provisions, including work requirements, could lead to 7.6 million people losing benefits and saving $723 billion more than a decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.

**Joni Ernst doubles down on bleak 'We are all going to die' comments in non-apology**
Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst doubled down on her bleak comments about potential Republican Medicaid cuts by posting a sarcastic apology video on social media. Ernst said, 'We all are going to die,' when responding to a question about the proposed cuts during a town hall in Parkersburg. She then shared a video on Instagram where she spoke directly to the camera, seemingly from a cemetery, and said, 'I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall.' Ernst's comments were widely criticized by Democrats, who pointed out that the Republican tax bill will cut Medicaid spending by $723 billion over the next 10 years, potentially leaving 7.6 million more people uninsured. Ernst argued that the goal of the legislation is to ensure that those not eligible for Medicaid don't get the benefits, but her comments were met with criticism from both sides of the aisle.

**Will Iowa Sen. Ernst's "we're all going to die" comment hurt her political career?**
Iowa US Senator Joni Ernst's comments about Medicaid cuts, saying 'we are all going to die,' have gone viral and are being used against her by Democratic opponents. According to KCRG-TV9 political analyst Megan Goldberg, the comment is 'made for viral explosion' and could be 'fodder for democratic opponents come 2026.' However, Goldberg believes Ernst's chances of winning re-election in 2026 have not been sunk. Ernst has responded to the controversy, saying 'this is the hysteria that's out there coming from the left' and 'we know two things are true, death and taxes.' Ernst has not yet announced her candidacy for re-election, but is expected to run.

**Ernst doubles down on Medicaid comment with sarcastic video 'apology'**
Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) released a sarcastic video 'apology' for her recent comments on Medicaid, a public health insurance program for low-income families and individuals with disabilities. Ernst brushed aside life or death concerns about cuts to Medicaid during a town hall event, saying 'people are going to die' in a sarcastic tone. She then encouraged viewers to 'embrace' Jesus Christ for 'eternal and everlasting life'. The Iowa lawmaker previously promised to 'protect' social services for the most vulnerable, but the current GOP-House passed spending bill would cut millions from Medicaid. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warned that the bill would 'hurt' children, women, and people with disabilities, and lead to hospital closures and nursing home shutdowns. Every Democrat who voted in the House opposed the bill.

**"We Will Fight for Every Seat!" - WhatsUp News**
The National Democratic Congress (NDC) is determined to secure every parliamentary seat it believes was stolen in the 2024 general election, despite already holding a commanding majority in Ghana's Parliament. According to Hon. Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor, the party's Majority Whip and South Dayi MP, 'We are still in court over a couple of seats that we are fighting to recover.' He dismissed rumors of discontent among NDC MPs due to a perceived lack of ministerial appointments, saying 'My MPs are not hungry! They are not idle. And they are not jobless. They are not.' Dafeamekpor credits President John Dramani Mahama's promise to appoint only 60 ministers with resonating deeply with the electorate, contributing significantly to the high turnout and solid support for the NDC. He revealed that President Mahama is currently operating with a mere 56 ministers, allowing more MPs to be appointed to statutory boards, ensuring their continued engagement and responsibility within the legislative cohort. The NDC holds a clear two-thirds majority in the current Ninth Parliament, with 187 seats, including four independent MPs caucusing with the party. Dafeamekpor boldly proclaimed, 'We can do anything we want in the house. We can turn a woman into a man in this house,' underscoring the immense influence the party now wields in the chamber.

**Before they name a 2028 nominee, Dems will have to decide which state will weigh in first**
Before the 2028 presidential election, Democrats must decide which state will be the first to weigh in. Traditionally, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina have been the early-voting states, but President Joe Biden changed the calendar in 2022, moving South Carolina's primary ahead of the others. Now, officials in these states are vying for top billing nearly two years before the Democratic National Committee solidifies the order. Each state offers advantages to different candidates and elevates or diminishes different parts of the Democratic base. Prospective candidates are making early-state visits, giving a glimpse into their own path to the nomination. 'All we have to do is look at the Democratic National Committee and say, 'Sorry, we're going first,' said former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle, who proposed that the Iowa Democratic Party commit to first-in-the-nation status regardless. 'It's ours if we have the courage.' New Hampshire rebelled in 2024, holding an unsanctioned primary in January, and the DNC dropped its threat to not seat the state's national convention delegates. Nevada and South Carolina are also pushing to keep their states early in the nominating conversation, citing their diversity and the importance of their voting populations.

**Before they name a 2028 nominee, Democrats will have to decide which state will weigh in first**
Before the 2028 presidential election, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) will need to decide which state will be the first to weigh in. Traditionally, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina have been the early-voting states, but the DNC has shaken up the calendar in recent years. Officials from these states are now positioning themselves to get top billing nearly two years before the DNC solidifies the order. Each state offers advantages to different candidates and elevates or diminishes different parts of the Democratic base. For example, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker visited New Hampshire, a majority-white state, while Maryland Gov. Wes Moore will appear in South Carolina, where Black voters are influential. Pete Buttigieg will join a VoteVets Action Fund gathering in Iowa, which has been criticized for its lack of diversity. The DNC's decision will be a crucial one, as it will impact the nomination process and the party's direction after losing the 2024 election to Republican Donald Trump. 'We expect that there will be a fair process and that we will be given every consideration to be an early state,' said Scott Brennan, a DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee member. 'All we have to do is look at the Democratic National Committee and say, 'Sorry, we're going first,' Nagle said. 'It's ours if we have the courage.'

**National Democrats plan to target Iowa US congress members in 2026 midterms**
The National Democrats have identified three US Representatives from Iowa, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, and Zach Nunn, as potential targets for the 2026 midterms. DCCC chairperson Suzan DelBene stated, 'From tanking the economy, gutting Medicaid, abandoning our veterans, to making everything more expensive, they’ve broken their promises to Iowans, and it’s going to cost them their seats.' State Democratic legislators, including Sarah Trone Garriott, Jennifer Konfrst, and Austin Baeth, have expressed interest in running against Zach Nunn. Meanwhile, a new Iowa grassroots organization, MAGA Nation Networks, has been formed, with co-founder James McLaughlin saying, 'I don’t drink the Trump Kool-Aid, but I am dedicated to his principles, because I think they’re a good fit for Iowa and for our country.'

**Democrats Unite Against Republican Budget Plan, Vow to Regain Majority in 2026**
Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have stated that they are united in rejecting the Republican budget plan. The plan affects a large portion of the population and helps multimillionaires. 'Democrats in the House have come together to defend Medicaid and keep healthcare more affordable', said Jeffries. 'We have been united to protect Social Security, even when the President of the United States used his joint address to set the stage for cutting these benefits by lying to our country about the claims of beneficiaries of a hundred years'. Jeffries emphasized that the conference, which took place from March 12-14, will serve to establish their route towards the 2026 elections. 'In our understanding that we must regain the majority next year with the fierce urgency of now', he said. House Minority Leader Jeffries presented Representative Catherine Clark, who he highlighted as the one who kept Democrats united in the House to reject the Republican plan. Clark is the Whip of the Democratic Caucus, responsible for ensuring votes on certain legislative actions and initiatives. 'We are fighting to stop a Republican Party that promised to put more money in the pockets of the working class, but turned their backs on them', said Representative Ted Liu, Vice President of the Democratic Caucus. Liu mentioned that Democrats are gaining the trust of voters, citing that in January they won a seat in the Senate in Iowa. 'And just this week, in another special election in Iowa for a local seat, our candidate got a result 24 points higher', he said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer dismissed the idea that Democrats support the Republican budget plan and reminded them that they do not have the necessary votes. 'Our parliamentary group is united in a clean legislative resolution for April 11 that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can be passed', he said. 'I hope our Republican colleagues will join us to avoid a shutdown on Friday'. Schumer expressed hope for significant victories for his party in 2026. 'We surpassed our results in the last electoral cycle: we gained seats. We changed 10 Republican seats to Democrats, and now we have 215, which puts us in an incredible position. So we need three more seats', he said. 'We also won in Trump districts across the country. And I think, given that was before the chaos and dysfunction we've already seen in the Republican Party, and the outrage we've heard from the American people across the country, we're going to demand accountability'. DelBene said that the party's campaign will focus on candidates who will help achieve a majority in 2026, during the midterm elections.

**Lawmakers propose restricting political party changes before caucuses, primaries**
A House proposal in Iowa, House File 353, would require voters to be registered with a political party one month in advance of that party's caucuses or primary elections to participate. The measure aims to maintain the integrity of the caucus process and keep Iowa's Republican caucuses first in the nation. However, critics argue that the bill discriminates against nonpartisan voters and restricts political freedom and participation. They also express concerns about potential violence and harassment towards election workers. Supporters see the measure as leading to a more informed electorate participating in primary elections and caucuses. Rep. Derek Wulf said the bill is part of ongoing discussions on election integrity, especially as it relates to the Iowa caucuses.

**On the Trail: In NH, first-in-the-nation battle begins**
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has officially begun the process to protect New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation presidential primary in the 2028 nominating calendar. The DNC's election of Minnesota chair Ken Martin as the new national party committee chair has triggered a two-year process to rebound from the 2024 election. Martin has pledged to hold a 'fair and transparent' calendar selection process, but New Hampshire Democrats are concerned that the DNC may try to move the primary to a later date. National Democrats have criticized Iowa and New Hampshire for being unrepresentative of the party, but New Hampshire Democrats argue that the state's tradition of grassroots politics and high voter participation make it the perfect location for the first-in-the-nation primary. 'We don't need any special favors, but we don't need somebody putting their thumb on the scale against us, either,' said veteran New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley.
