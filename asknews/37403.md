Five candidates are vying for the position, including a strong female candidate from South Africa, Mme Bajabulile Swazi Tshabalala, who served as the bank's vice president from 2018 to 2024. The other four candidates are from Senegal, Zambia, Mauritania, and Chad. They are Amadou Hott, a former Senegalese economy minister and former AfDB vice president; Samuel Munzele Maimbo, a former World Bank vice president; Sidi Ould Tah, a former head of the Arab African Economic Development Bank and former Mauritanian economy minister; and Abbas Mahamat TOLLI, a former head of the Central Bank of Central African States and former Chadian finance minister.

**Trino Márquez: Those Who Called for Abstention Are Not Responsible**
Many who feel affected by the disastrous results for the opposition in the May 25 elections have created a justificatory discourse based on the simplification of reality and the distortion of facts that occurred during recent years. The opposition fell into a prolonged lethargy after the failed attempt with Juan Guaidó, and desperation and frustration took over most Venezuelans. The first attempts at unity in 2022 helped to revive the intention of Venezuelans to participate in the 2024 election to choose the President of the Republic, which was initially very low, around 35%. The numbers changed as the opposition smoothed out its rough edges, and the possibility of building a coordinated action platform and choosing a single presidential candidate emerged. María Corina Machado was the winner of the primary election held on October 23, 2023, but she was later disqualified, and Edmundo González Urrutia was authorized as a candidate just before the deadline. Trino Márquez argues that those who called for abstention are not responsible for the opposition's failure, and that the true causes of the defeat lie elsewhere. He points out that some opposition leaders who criticized the PUD and MCM for 'abstentionism' during the campaign had a very moderate or marginal participation. Márquez concludes that the opposition's failure cannot be attributed to the PUD's call to abstain, but rather to the lack of a compelling message and the failure to mobilize and organize voters.

The election marks the end of Dr Akinwumi Adesina's two-term presidency tenure, which ends in September 2025.

Five candidates are in the running for the presidency: Amadou Hott, Samuel Munzele Maimbo, Sidi Ould Tah, Abbas Mahamat Tolli, and Bajabulile Swazi Tshabalala.

**BAD Presidential Candidates Arrive in Abidjan, Amadou Hott Stands Out with Commercial Flight**
The five candidates vying for the presidency of the African Development Bank (BAD) have arrived in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, ahead of the annual meetings. The candidates, Samuel Munzele Maimbo from Zambia, Swazi Tshabalala from South Africa, Sidy Ould TAH from Mauritania, Mahamat Abbas Tolli from Chad, and Amadou Hott from Senegal, have chosen different modes of transportation. While some arrived by private jet or chartered flights, Amadou Hott stood out by choosing a commercial flight with Air Ivoire, according to Le Témoin. 'It is a discreet arrival that contrasts with that of his competitors,' said the publication. Samuel Munzele Maimbo arrived on a private jet on Sunday, while Swazi Tshabalala benefited from a special flight arranged by the South African government. Sidy Ould TAH traveled from Riyadh on a regular flight accompanied by the Mauritanian Minister of Finance. The mode of transportation for Mahamat Abbas Tolli was not specified.

**Mauritania Participates in the African Development Bank Group's Annual Meetings for 2025**
Mauritania is participating in the annual meetings of the African Development Bank Group for 2025 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, under the slogan 'Achieving the maximum benefit for Africa from its capital to promote its development'. The official opening of the meeting is expected today, Tuesday, in the presence of Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara, as well as several African leaders, politicians, and financial personalities at the continental and international levels. Yesterday, the bank's governors' council met, with the participation of the Mauritanian delegation led by Minister of Economy and Finance, Sidi Ahmed Ould Abeid. This year's meeting is of particular interest, as its agenda focuses on electing a new president of the bank and discussing ways to strengthen the bank's capital base. The election for the presidency of the bank, which will take place on Thursday, May 29, will be by ballot, with five candidates competing to succeed the current president, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina. The council has decided to hold meetings with the candidates by the Secretary-General of the African Development Bank. Mauritania has nominated former Minister, Dr. Sidi Ould Taha, for the presidency of the bank for the next five years. These elections are of great interest to African and international circles due to the important role the bank plays in financing development on the continent.

**Ivory Coast on the Brink of a New Cycle of Electoral Violence?**
As the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire approaches on October 25, 2025, the country is plagued by rumors of a coup spread on social media. Videos and messages, mainly in English, claimed that President Alassane Ouattara had been overthrown and that major unrest was sweeping Abidjan. However, the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) quickly denied these allegations, calling them 'false and totally unfounded', and highlighting that they resulted from a 'deliberate and coordinated disinformation campaign'. The Ivorian authorities have called on the population to be vigilant and to refer only to official sources for information. No tangible evidence has been provided to support these rumors, and no major incidents have been reported on the ground. A tense political climate is approaching the elections The Ivorian political context is marked by growing tensions as the presidential election approaches. The potential candidacy of outgoing President Alassane Ouattara for a fourth term has sparked controversy. The 2016 Ivorian Constitution limits the number of presidential terms to two, but Ouattara was re-elected for a third term in 2020, invoking that the new Constitution reset the term counter. Furthermore, opposition leader Tidjane Thiam, a prominent figure of the Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire (PDCI), was disqualified from the presidential race in April 2025 due to his dual French-Ivorian nationality. Although he renounced his French nationality in February 2025, the justice deemed that he did not meet the eligibility conditions at the time of his registration on the electoral lists. Contested candidacies and a fragmented opposition In addition to Tidjane Thiam, other major political figures are at the heart of the debates. Laurent Gbagbo, former president, has been designated as a candidate by his party despite his current ineligibility. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Vincent Toh Bi Irié, former prefect of Abidjan, is running as an independent, while Jean-Louis Billon, former minister, has confirmed his candidacy. This multiplicity of candidacies, often from the opposition, reflects a political fragmentation that could complicate the formation of a united alternative to the ruling power. Calls for calm and initiatives for peace In the face of these tensions, initiatives aimed at promoting peace and social cohesion are multiplying. On May 24, 2025, an interconfessional conference was held in Abidjan, bringing together Christian and Muslim religious leaders to promote non-violence and national unity ahead of the elections. On the other hand, the UN, through its special envoy for West Africa and the Sahel, Leonardo Santos Simão, met with the main Ivorian political actors in April 2025 to urge them to prioritize dialogue and avoid any escalation of violence. Thus, as the 2025 presidential election approaches, vigilance, respect for institutions, and dialogue between the different stakeholders will be essential to ensure a peaceful and transparent election.

**2027: Shetima's Fate Hangs As Tinubu's Running Mate; Muslim Group Wants Him Dropped | The Source**
A Muslim group in Nigeria, the Concerned Northern Muslim Ummah, has called on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to drop Vice President Kassim Shetima as his running mate in the 2027 presidential election. Instead, the group wants a Christian northerner to be selected as the vice presidential candidate, citing the need for 'religious balance' and 'fairness, equity and justice'. The group's Convener, Bala Duguri, said that the decision was arrived at after wide consultations with Muslims and other stakeholders in the region. He added that the choice of a Christian running mate will 'assuage the feelings and reciprocate the gesture extended to him in 2023, when they massively voted for the APC Muslim-muslim ticket.' The group also urged potential Muslim aspirants to drop their ambition to ensure that the idea of a Christian vice presidential nominee is realized. Duguri said, 'Our group has undertaken wider consultations across the northern states with different Islamic organisations in a bid to speak with one voice over the political direction in the APC-led administration. The outcome is very encouraging.' The group believes that this move will 'not only stabilise our democracy but also improve the electoral chances of President Tinubu, who, with this adjustment, will surely win by a landslide.'

**Meambly Evariste Announces Candidacy for 2025 Presidential Election**
Meambly Evariste, the former president of the Regional Council of Guémon and president of the party 'Agir pour le Peuple', has announced his candidacy for the presidential election in October 2025. He explains the reasons for his engagement: 'We are the voice of a whole generation of young people, well-educated but forgotten, devoted but marginalized, who since 2018 have been waiting for their first chance, their first job, their first responsibility. We say today: this youth deserves to be heard, represented and served.' Evariste proposes his candidacy as an alternative, rooted in the realities of the Ivorian people, carried by a proven political experience, a strong territorial commitment, and a clear ambition: to put youth and regions at the heart of development. He presents a realistic and transformative project of society, with three major commitments: employability of young people, industrialization of raw materials, and social cohesion. Evariste also announces that he will propose a law of amnesty and indemnization of victims after his election, to turn the page on the dark crisis of 2010 and to rebuild a reconciled, confident, and forward-looking nation.

**Ivory Coast is gearing up for an unfair election**
The disqualification of opposition candidate Tidjane Thiam, a former boss of Credit Suisse, from the upcoming presidential election in Ivory Coast raises concerns about the fairness of the election. Thiam was struck off the electoral register after a court ruled that he was not an Ivorian citizen, despite having renounced his French citizenship in March. This decision, along with the disqualification of three other candidates, including former president Laurent Gbagbo, has led to protests from Thiam's supporters. The ruling party claims it has nothing to do with Thiam's exclusion, but the move is seen as a similar strategy to the one used in the 2020 election, where 90% of potential challengers were disqualified, making President Alassane Ouattara's victory all but certain. The use of citizenship to disqualify candidates is a sensitive issue in Ivory Coast, a diverse country with a history of welcoming people from all over west Africa. As the election approaches, Ivorians must hope that it will be free and fair, and that the country will avoid another violent conflagration, as it did in the past. 'I will not give up,' Thiam said, vowing to continue his campaign despite the setback.

**Tidjane Thiam Vows to Fight Election Disqualification**
Tidjane Thiam, a former minister and international finance expert, has promised to fight a court decision that invalidated his candidacy for the 2025 Ivorian presidential election. The decision was made due to a lack of Ivorian nationality at the time of his registration on the electoral list in 2022. Thiam, who has renounced his French nationality, has vowed to take the case to the ECOWAS Court of Justice to have the verdict overturned. He has also called for protests in front of the country's courts on Thursday, April 24. Thiam's candidacy has been seen as a strong challenge to incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, with whom he has a similar background in international finance. However, some analysts question his ability to unite a broad electorate, citing his perceived ties to Western imperialism and his image as a technocratic, polished figure that may not resonate with rural voters.

**Tidjane Thiam Disqualified from Ivorian Presidential Election**
Tidjane Thiam, the leader of the PDCI-RDA, the main opposition party in Côte d'Ivoire, has been disqualified from the presidential election by a court ruling. The decision was made due to his loss of Ivorian nationality, which he automatically lost when he acquired French nationality in 1987. As a result, the opposition leader is barred from running in the presidential election scheduled for October 25. 'This judicial decision relaunches the accusations of electoral manipulation and crystallizes the tensions around the Ivorian democratic process,' notes Afrik.com. Thiam denies the decision is a 'political maneuver' aimed at excluding him from the presidential race, and accuses the ruling party's militants of initiating the judicial proceedings. Despite this decision, Thiam affirms his determination to fight for his candidacy, stating, 'I am determined to fight so that Ivorians can choose freely who will lead them over the next five years.' The exclusion of Thiam, along with other opposition figures, raises concerns about the transparency of the upcoming election and the potential for a one-sided outcome.

**Bettié Calls on President Ouattara to Run for 2025 Presidential Election**
The populations of Bettié have called on President Alassane Ouattara to run for the 2025 presidential election, in order to ensure continuity and progress for all, and to complete the construction of major infrastructure projects and to promote Côte d'Ivoire on the international stage. The call was made during a meeting marking the end of the RHDP's remobilization tour in the Indénié-Djuablin region. The Minister of State, Siandou Fofana, welcomed the engagement and called on the population and political leaders to unite and massively support the President's candidacy. 'Mobilize in large numbers. Continue to defend the values of peace, dialogue, and solidarity. Working for the RHDP's victory is working for the happiness of Ivorians and all of Côte d'Ivoire,' he said. The Minister also urged the population to remain faithful to the ideals of peace and development promoted by the RHDP and its President, Alassane Ouattara. 'Together, let's make Indénié-Djuablin a model of success, a land of prosperity and unity for future generations, which we have no right to disappoint,' he said. He also called on officials and elected officials to prioritize unity, saying that 'what is most beautiful in the region is unity and cohesion.' 'United, we will go further. Unity unites our forces and our progress. Let's make it a strength,' he advised.

**Côte d'Ivoire Presidential Election 2025: Key Players and Debates**
The national news in Côte d'Ivoire on February 5, 2025, is dominated by political topics, particularly the debates surrounding the upcoming presidential election in October. According to L'Expression, the two main opponents of the RHDP are Cissé Bacongo and an unnamed second opponent. Le Matin criticizes the opposition for trying to discredit the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI). Le Patriote quotes Cissé Bacongo, saying that President Alassane Ouattara 'deserves to continue' and that the opposition's goal is to elect the president in the first round. Le Jour plus states that Ouattara is the favorite to win the election, citing reasons why Ivorians support him. L'Avenir presents alternative candidates for the PDCI and PPA-CI, who are reportedly out of the running for the election. Le Bélier suggests that Ouattara is seeking international support for a fourth term. Le Nouveau Réveil argues that Ouattara's fourth term is a big equation and a big concern. Dernière Heure Monde claims that Tidjane Thiam cannot be disqualified from the election, despite opposition from some groups. Le Quotidien d'Abidjan states that a 'big mission' has been given to Laurent Gbagbo in the context of the election, and Le Canard déchaîné suggests that Gbagbo will be a candidate in the election. Koné Daouda explains why he has chosen to support Pascal Affi N'guessan, the president of the FPI. L'Inter reports that former demobilized soldiers have called on Ouattara, Gbagbo, and Thiam to preserve peace in Côte d'Ivoire during the election.
