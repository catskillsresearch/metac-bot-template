**UPDATE 3-Britain unveils radical defence overhaul to meet new threats | Politics**
Britain's Defence Secretary John Healey said, 'Drones now kill more people than traditional artillery in the war in Ukraine and whoever gets new technology into the hands of their armed forces the quickest will win.' In response to growing threats from Russia, nuclear risks, and cyber-attacks, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged the largest sustained increase to UK defence spending since the end of the Cold War. The government plans to invest in drones and digital warfare, rather than relying on a larger army, and has accepted a Strategic Defence Review that includes expanding the fleet of attack submarines, building new munitions plants, and launching new communication systems for the battlefield. The review also recommends increasing the total number of regular personnel when funding allows, likely after 2029. Starmer said he was '100% confident' that UK defence spending would hit 3% in the next parliament, likely between 2029-2034.

**Israeli Drones Kill at Least 18 Journalists in Gaza, Investigation Finds**
At least 18 journalists have been injured or killed in Gaza by Israeli drones since October 7, 2023, according to an investigation by Forbidden Stories. The investigation found that the Israeli military has the technological capabilities to minimize civilian casualties, but is instead using drones in a disproportionate response strategy against civilians, including journalists. The investigation also found that the Israeli military is using a program called Lavender, which is based on artificial intelligence and is used to generate a list of targets for drone strikes. The program has been used to identify and target journalists in Gaza, including Samer Abu Daqqa, a cameraman for Al Jazeera who was killed in a drone strike on December 15, 2023. 'I am sure he filmed until the end,' said Ibrahim Qanan, a colleague and friend of Abu Daqqa. The investigation also found that the Israeli military has expanded its authorization to bomb non-military targets and has relaxed restrictions on civilian casualties since October. The investigation was conducted by a team of 50 journalists coordinated by Forbidden Stories, and was supported by experts in drones and international law. 'The precision could mean avoiding civilian lives, or it could mean attacking civilians; a precise attack only means the guaranteed destruction of a target you hit,' said James Rogers, an expert in drones at Cornell University. 'We live in a world of very proliferated unmanned aerial vehicles with a variety of state and non-state groups, some that want to reduce the costs of war and others that want to maximize damage.'

The Collectif pour la défense des droits du peuple de l'Azawad/Nord-Mali (CD-DPA) has released its semi-annual report on human rights violations in northern Mali. The report, covering the period from October 2024 to March 2025, documents over 350 civilian deaths, with the majority attributed to the Malian army and its Wagner group allies. According to the report, 355 people were killed during this period, 'mainly' by the Malian army and its Wagner group allies: out of 236 'security incidents' recorded, 216 are attributed to them. Fifteen are the work of jihadist groups, including six by the Groupe de soutien à l'islam et aux musulmans (Jnim, linked to al-Qaïda) and nine by the État islamique au Sahel, according to the collectif, and five are attributed to ' unidentified bandits '. The report also documents 191 cases of 'inhuman treatment' and drone attacks, and 304 people abducted or missing. The CD-DPA points out 'at least 21 cases' of women victims of rape, execution, or arbitrary arrest, and 'at least 22 cases' of children killed or arrested. Finally, 2076 acts of 'looting' and 'destruction' are reported: money stolen, livestock taken or slaughtered, homes and infrastructure destroyed...' said the CD-DPA, 'the situation is catastrophic'.

**Ukrainian Forces Launch Counterattack, Destroying 41 Russian Aircraft**
On June 1, Russian forces attacked a Ukrainian army training facility, killing at least 12 soldiers and wounding over 60. In response, the Ukrainian army formed a special commission to investigate the incident and conduct a service investigation. The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) also launched a massive drone attack on Russian military airfields, destroying or damaging 41 Russian aircraft. The operation, codenamed 'Spider's Web', aimed to destroy Russian strategic aviation in the deep rear. The SBU warned that any Russian claims of detaining Ukrainian saboteurs would be an 'informational spectacle' for internal consumption. The SBU has calculated the losses suffered by the Russian Federation in a single day of Ukrainian special operations. The second meeting between Ukrainian and Russian delegations is scheduled to take place in Istanbul on June 2. Ukraine is expected to present a roadmap for resolving the conflict, including a 30-day ceasefire, prisoner exchange, and return of Ukrainian children. President Zelensky revealed that Ukraine will also make proposals to Russia. Starting from May 2025, the Ukrainian army will publicly report on the work of the Tactical Command and Staff (TCC) and the Special Purpose (SP) units, including information on confirmed and unconfirmed incidents, and 'cleaning' in the TCC. A second wave of mandatory evacuations of children from frontline villages has begun in the Dnepropetrovsk region due to the threat of shelling. The US National Intelligence Director, Tuli Gabbard, is exploring ways to modernize daily intelligence briefings for President Trump, including the possibility of creating a video version of the briefings that would resemble a Fox News broadcast. Israeli Defense Minister, Gantz, has ordered the Israeli army to continue its offensive in Gaza and achieve all its goals, 'regardless of any negotiations'.

**The Genocide and Artificial Intelligence in Gaza**
The Israeli military has been waging an exceptional war on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, targeting civilians, buildings, and vital infrastructure to achieve unprecedented destruction. To achieve its genocidal plan in Gaza, Israel has relied on its two pillars, military and material, and political support from its natural allies, particularly the United States and European countries, as well as some Arabs. However, achieving this exceptional level of destruction was not possible without Israel's reliance on advanced military and war applications, particularly the dark side of artificial intelligence, to launch a new and advanced war to exterminate Palestinians through the use of applications for killing and destruction provided by artificial intelligence to implement the project of getting rid of Palestinians deeply rooted in the Zionist ideology. The Israeli military, 'Tsahal', has used the 'Lavender' system, a part of the arsenal that includes the 'Gospel' artificial intelligence, which can identify around 100 targets per day, to determine the degree of each person's involvement in Hamas or the Islamic Jihad movement, or the likelihood of being a fighter. After determining the target's location, the army is given the order to kill them. According to sources, the Israeli army relied heavily on 'Lavender' in the first weeks of the war, which identified around 37,000 Palestinians as fighters to be killed. The 'Habsora' system, also known as 'The Gospel', is used to choose the buildings to be targeted, and its use has accelerated the pace of attacks to expand the circle of collective killing and urban destruction. The Israeli military's ideology of killing and destruction, which aims to implement a genocidal plan against Palestinians, has not differentiated between the various roles of Palestinians, but has instead targeted all Palestinians, including children, women, and elderly, as evident in the bombing of many inhabited buildings at night to achieve the maximum damage among civilians. The existence of a arsenal of programs specialized in killing Palestinians is a clear indication of a real intention to exterminate Palestinians and destroy the strip.

**Israeli Defense Minister Orders Army to Advance in Gaza Without Negotiations**
Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz has issued clear military orders to the Israeli army to continue advancing in the Gaza Strip without considering negotiations, and to use all means to eliminate Hamas. Katz said, 'On the evening of the holiday, the army continues its operations in Gaza with great force, crushing the enemy and paving the way for the advancing ground forces.' He added, 'I have instructed the army to continue advancing inside Gaza towards all objectives, without any relation to any negotiations, and using all necessary means from the air, land, and sea to protect soldiers and eliminate Hamas and kill its members.' Katz also said, 'Those who kill and slaughter our soldiers will pay the full price, as I said: either Hamas releases the prisoners or it will be destroyed.' The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that the death toll in the strip has risen to 54,418, with the majority being children and women, since the start of the Israeli aggression on October 7, 2023. The ministry also reported that the number of injuries has increased to 124,190, with many victims still trapped under the rubble, and rescue teams unable to reach them.

**Russian Officer Calls for End to 'Senseless Slaughter' in Ukraine War**
A Russian officer has spoken out against the ongoing war in Ukraine, calling for an end to the 'senseless slaughter'. The officer, who spoke to a military blogger, said that 'defence is much easier than attack' and that the current military strategy is 'doomed to fail'. He warned that the consequences of continuing the conflict will be devastating and called for a stop to the 'senseless fighting'. Another military blogger, Maksim Kalaschnikow, agreed with the officer's assessment and criticized the Russian military's strategy, saying that 'we can't continue this mass slaughter if nothing will change strategically'. Kalaschnikow also pointed out that the Russian military has suffered heavy losses, with over 984,940 soldiers killed, according to the Ukrainian Defence Ministry. He said that the conflict has become a 'Verdun of the 21st century' with enormous casualty numbers. 'We need a pause to get things in order', Kalaschnikow said. 'We missed the chance for a quick victory in 2014 and were not prepared for a blitzkrieg in 2022.'

**Gaza Slaughter: Israel Targets Civilians Trying to Access Humanitarian Aid**
Israel targeted Palestinians trying to reach a humanitarian aid distribution point in the town of Rafah in the Gaza Strip, resulting in at least 30 deaths and 115 injuries. This is the latest in a series of attacks by Israel on Palestinians trying to access humanitarian aid, which has been deemed a systematic and intentional effort to kill civilians. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been continuously attacking Palestinians, and in the past few days, 17 civilians have been killed and dozens more injured while waiting for aid. Israel has been blocking all border crossings to Gaza for over 90 days, preventing essential goods such as food from entering the territory, leaving millions of people facing mass starvation. The ongoing attacks have resulted in over 54,000 Palestinian deaths, 124,000 injuries, and 11,000 people missing, with hundreds of thousands more displaced. The Israeli government's policies are being viewed as a systematic attempt to starve and exterminate the Palestinian population, even going so far as to kill those trying to access humanitarian aid.

**SOFREP Evening Brief: US-Backed Gaza Aid Group Sparks Concerns as Launch Nears, Russia and Ukraine to Resume Peace Talks in Istanbul Without Top Leaders**
Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have killed over 80 people, including a journalist and his family, amid an intensifying military campaign that has now killed more than 53,000 Palestinians since October 2023. The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has announced plans to deliver aid to Gaza, but faces criticism from the UN over its legality and neutrality. Russia and Ukraine will hold peace talks in Istanbul, but expectations remain low after Russian President Vladimir Putin declined a face-to-face meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The US is pushing NATO allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2032, citing rising threats from Russia, terrorism, and China. Latvia's intelligence agency has warned of Russian saboteurs infiltrating the country under the guise of lost tourists or unassuming hikers. Japan has grounded its entire fleet of T-4 training aircraft following a crash that occurred shortly after takeoff.

**'You Will Kill Me': Dozens Arrested Protesting GOP Medicaid Cuts at US Capitol | Common Dreams**
Over two dozen people were arrested at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday for protesting Republicans' plans to cut Medicaid as part of a sweeping reconciliation package. The protesters, who were targeting a U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, were calling for the bill to be killed before it kills all of them. 'The only humane thing to do is to kill the bill before it kills all of us,' said Analilia Mejia, co-executive director of Popular Democracy in Action. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that under the committee's proposal, Medicaid enrollment would drop by 10.3 million people and the number of uninsured individuals would rise by 7.6 million by 2034. Protesters, many of whom are disabled and rely on Medicaid, were arrested for demonstrating inside the congressional buildings. 'People feel very strongly because they know they're losing their healthcare,' said Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.).

**Russia's Army Slaughter: The Human Cost of Putin's War**
2024 has been the deadliest year for the Russian army in Ukraine since the invasion began. According to BBC and 'Mediаzona', at least 45,287 Russian soldiers have been killed, with many more bodies unaccounted for. The ratio of soldiers to land captured is staggering, with 27 soldiers killed for every square kilometer of territory gained. This is only the confirmed deaths, with estimates suggesting the real number of casualties could be over 260,000. The Russian army's tactic of 'meat waves' - poorly trained and equipped groups of soldiers - has been criticized as a 'shameful hallmark' of their strategy. Even American military analyst Michael Kofman has noted that the repeated use of these tactics, particularly in battles for Ugledar, Ropotye, Toretsk, and Avdiivka, has led to massive losses. The date of February 20, 2024, has become a symbol of the Russian army's idiocy, as 65 soldiers were killed in a HIMARS strike while being awarded medals. The Russian government is trying to downplay the numbers, but journalists have been able to identify 106,745 confirmed deaths, which is only 45-65% of the real number. The true number could be as high as 250,000.

**Mass Slaughter Terror**
A Russian drone attacked a bus in Marhanets, killing 9 people and injuring 49. The incident is part of a series of kamikaze terrorist attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including companies, public spaces, and energy facilities. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, over 163 drones were launched in less than 24 hours, targeting civilian targets. The attacks have caused widespread destruction and blackouts, with at least 62 urban settlements in Kherson left without lighting. The US has been criticized for its 'peace proposal', which has been described as a 'mafia-style' final offer that benefits Russia but offers vague advantages to Ukraine. As one source notes, 'the Americans improperly call a 'peace proposal' what is, in fact, a cynical and repeated violation of every signed agreement.'

**BONIOR: Israelis bring shame through horrific slaughter**
In March 2025, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) killed 15 medical responders, including 8 Red Crescent workers, 5 civil defense responders, and 1 UN staff member, in Southern Gaza near Rafah. The responders were attempting to collect the bodies of two paramedics who had been killed by the IDF earlier. The IDF initially claimed that the responders were advancing suspiciously without headlights or emergency signals, but witnesses and forensic evidence contradict this claim. A video recorded by one of the paramedics shows that the ambulances and fire truck were clearly marked and had their emergency signal lights on when they were attacked by the IDF. The Geneva Convention and other international laws protect medical and humanitarian workers in war zones, and killing them is considered a war crime. Jonathan Whittall, the head of Ocha in Palestine, said, 'The dead were shot “one by one” then buried in the mass grave.' Tom Fletcher, the head of Ocha, reported, 'They were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives. We demand answers and justice.'

The Russian military has targeted civilians in Sumy, repeating the atrocities seen in Kryvyi Rih. The attack, which used 9K720 Iskander ballistic missiles, resulted in 34 reported deaths, including small children. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy stated, 'I would like to thank everyone who remembers that wars end when the crimes of war are not forgotten -- and when the aggressor is met with enough pressure.' He emphasized that decisive action is needed to stop Russia's attacks, which have increased since they rejected a US proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire. The attack occurred on Palm Sunday, a day when people were gathered together, making the incident even more horrific.

**Ukraine deploys 15,000 'silent killer' robot soldiers to war frontlines to defend against Russia - The Mirror**
Ukraine is deploying 15,000 'silent killer' combat robot soldiers to the frontline against Russia's troops along the eastern front. This is the largest number of auto-killers commanders have sent into the bloody war, as Kyiv tries to combat Russia reinforcing its military strength in the region. The robots, including the deadly Lyut, which is armed with 7.62mm bullets, are designed for surveillance and fire support, and can operate both during the day and at night. Ukraine has stepped-up production of the robots at secret factories inside Ukraine, where a number of remote-controlled killers are being developed. A Ukrainian source said, 'Anything that can be done to leverage the war against the Russian invaders is being done and we are world beaters in technology.' Ukraine has been integrating robotic technology into its military operations to enhance effectiveness and minimise dangers to troops, with contract spending reaching £120million in the first quarter of 2025.

**Russian Military Personnel Kill Civilians in Russia, Resulting in 294 Deaths**
According to 24 Kanal, citing 'Nastoyashchee Vremya', Russian military personnel who returned from the war in Ukraine have begun killing people in Russia, resulting in at least 294 deaths. Journalists analyzed court verdicts against participants in the war in Ukraine for six criminal articles, including murder, manslaughter, and causing death by negligence. A total of 271 verdicts were handed down to the occupiers, with the majority being for murder. In 110 crimes, 124 people were killed. This is not the first time Russian military personnel have been accused of violence upon their return from war, with 227 cases reported in September 2024. 'Nastoyashchee Vremya' notes that many of these crimes are committed by former prisoners who went to fight and are now back behind bars, said 'Nastoyashchee Vremya'.
