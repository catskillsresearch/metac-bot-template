**OPEC expects slower 2025 oil supply growth from rivals after price drop**
OPEC has trimmed its forecast for oil supply growth from non-OPEC+ countries in 2025, citing a decline in oil prices. The organization expects supply growth to rise by about 800,000 barrels per day in 2025, down from 900,000 bpd previously forecast. This slowdown in supply growth would make it easier for OPEC+ to balance the market. OPEC also expects investment in exploration and production outside OPEC+ to decline by about 5% year-on-year in 2025. The report noted that the decline in upstream E&P oil investments will 'constitute a challenge' for production levels in 2025 and 2026. OPEC left its forecasts for global oil demand growth unchanged in 2025 and 2026. The report also found that crude production by OPEC+ fell in April by 106,000 bpd due to a reduction in Kazakhstan's output.

**US Shale Oil Producers' Hedging Levels Remain Low, But Outlook Remains Optimistic**
According to OEXN platform, despite the increase in hedging activities by US shale oil producers over the past three months, the hedging level remains low compared to historical standards. As of April 2025, only 25.7% of 2025 production has been hedged, indicating producers' optimistic expectations for future oil prices. OEXN platform notes that, based on a survey of 40 US independent oil and gas companies by Standard Chartered, the first quarter 2025 liquid production was 7.359 million barrels per day, down 3.8% from the previous quarter. Although the hedging ratio has increased slightly from the previous survey (up 4.7 percentage points), it is still far below the levels of over 60% in 2018 and 2020. Additionally, the 2026 hedging ratio is only 6.1%, indicating a bullish attitude towards oil prices in the US shale oil industry. OEXN platform also points out that the hedging ratio for natural gas is much higher than for oil, at 42.2% in 2025 and 26.0% in 2026. However, Standard Chartered believes that the new hedging activities have not fully offset the expiring hedging contracts, resulting in a 0.8% decrease in total oil hedging contracts. Furthermore, OEXN platform notes that recent oil price surge, with Brent crude price rising by over $5 per barrel in the past week, has broken through a series of key Fibonacci retracement levels and the 20-day moving average. However, Standard Chartered believes that this surge is mainly due to market positioning and macroeconomic news, rather than oil prices entering a new stable range. Standard Chartered's oil fund manager positioning index fell to -67.9 in April, far below the highest bearish level of -100.0 reached in September 2024. Finally, OEXN platform concludes that, despite the market's bearish sentiment towards the energy complex, improving macroeconomic news may trigger a short squeeze rebound. Additionally, the recent US agreement to reduce tariffs has had a positive impact on market sentiment. However, from a supply perspective, Kazakhstan appears not to have fulfilled its commitment to reduce production with OPEC+, with its April oil liquid production increasing by 6.5% month-on-month. Standard Chartered expects OPEC+ to further accelerate the unwinding of voluntary production cuts in the coming months, despite global inventories remaining at low levels.

**AIE Forecasts Oil Supply to Double Demand Growth This Year**
The International Energy Agency (AIE) has revised its forecast for global oil supply upwards, particularly due to the anticipated end of production cuts by OPEC+, which means that its growth this year will double that of demand, which is slowing down due to the commercial war climate. According to the AIE's monthly report on the oil market, the agency has increased its estimates of production this year by 380,000 barrels per day, and by 390,000 for 2026. This means that in 2025, an additional 1.6 million barrels per day will be released onto the market, compared to last year (104.5 million in total), when consumption is expected to increase by only 740,000 barrels (to 103.9 million). In 2026, the increase in supply will be another 970,000 barrels per day, to 105.6 million, while demand will increase by 760,000 barrels, to 104.66 million. 'This sets the stage for a new balance of supply and demand fundamentals,' warn the authors of the report, indicating that the recent decline in prices is unlikely to be a fleeting phenomenon. The main source of uncertainty is the sanctions against three major producers, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. The AIE notes that Russia's production increased by 170,000 barrels per day in April, and its exports by 150,000 to 7.6 million, but this did not prevent its revenues from falling by $1.13 billion to $13.2 billion, the lowest level since June 2023. In the case of Iran, although the US increased pressure, its exports rose by 100,000 barrels per day in April to 1.6 million, although at the same time shipments to China, its main importer, were reduced by almost half in that month. Venezuela was the one that had the greatest impact due to the sanctions, with a production that decreased by 130,000 barrels in April to 840,000. Behind this are the measures of the US, which make some buyers fear secondary penalties from Washington to the ships that transport that crude. The AIE notes that the arrival in early May of diluent (chemical product necessary for the extraction of crude) from Russia and Iran, which replaces the one that arrived from Western companies that the US has prohibited, shows that Caracas is adapting its logistics. For the rest of the year, it has revised its estimates upwards for Venezuela and calculates that from June its production will be 600,000 barrels per day. The AIE notes that the decline in oil prices in recent weeks has made it less profitable to extract shale oil in the US and has led independent companies to reduce their capital expenditures by 9% this year. This has led to a downward revision of its global expectations for the US, which will still increase its production by 440,000 barrels per day this year (to 20.7 million) and by 180,000 the next (to 20.9 million). As for consumption, the agency has practically maintained its predictions from last month and believes that after a significant increase of 990,000 barrels per day in the first quarter, the growth will slow down and will be 650,000 barrels per day by the end of 2025 (740,000 on average for the entire exercise). Emerging economies will continue to drive demand, as they will absorb 860,000 barrels per day more in 2025 and a million more in 2026. The other side of the coin are the OECD countries, where consumption of oil will be accelerated, with 120,000 barrels per day less in 2025 and 240,000 in 2026.

**Nigeria Hits 99% Of OPEC Quota As Crude Production Rises To 1.48m bpd, Says NUPRCBy**
Nigeria's crude oil production rose to 1.48 million barrels per day (bpd) in April 2025, representing 99% of the 1.5 million bpd quota allocated by OPEC. This marks a significant improvement from March 2025, when production dropped to 93% of the quota. The total daily oil output, including condensates, averaged 1.68 million bpd in April, with a peak of 1.73 million bpd and a low of 1.60 million bpd. According to the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), these figures signal continued efforts by Nigeria to stabilise output and meet its production targets amid ongoing reforms in the oil and gas sector.

**IEA revises up oil demand growth forecast by 20,000 barrels for 2025**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised up its global oil demand growth forecast for 2025 by 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 741,000 bpd, reaching 103.9 million bpd. This revision is due to an upwardly revised GDP growth forecast and lower oil prices, despite weaker-than-expected non-OECD delivery data, especially in India. Emerging economies will remain the dominant drivers of global oil demand growth, with increases of 860,000 bpd in 2025 and 1 million bpd in 2026. The IEA noted that 'in a break from trends of the past decade, when growth was heavily dependent on China, non-OECD gains this year and next will be highly diversified geographically, with China, India, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East each accounting for about 15% of the increase.' Global oil supply increased by about 160,000 bpd in April to 104.46 million bpd, with non-OPEC+ countries accounting for three-quarters of the growth in global oil supply in April.

**US Crude Oil Inventory Increases, Global Oil Demand to Rise in 2025 and 2026**
According to the US Energy Department's report, the US crude oil inventory increased by 3.5 million barrels last week, while the oil product inventory decreased. The US refinery processed an average of 16.4 million barrels of crude oil per day, up 330,000 barrels from the previous week. The refinery utilization rate increased to 90.2% from 89% in the previous week. Gasoline production decreased to 940,000 barrels per day, while distillate production decreased to 460,000 barrels per day. The US imported an average of 5.8 million barrels of crude oil per day, down 214,000 barrels from the previous week. The US Energy Department estimates that global oil demand will increase by 100 million barrels per day in 2025 and 90 million barrels per day in 2026, but supply growth will be faster, leading to oil stockpiling. The report predicts that global oil inventory will start to increase in 2025, with an average daily increase of 500,000 barrels in the second quarter and 700,000 barrels in the fourth quarter. The report also predicts that the US oil demand will increase by 200,000 barrels per day in 2025 and decrease by 100,000 barrels per day in 2026.

**OPEC Reduces Forecast for Global Oil Demand Growth in 2025 and 2026**
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reduced its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2025 and 2026, citing the impact of trade tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the report, OPEC expects global oil demand to grow by 1.3 million barrels per day in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 1.5 million barrels per day. The organization also expects non-OPEC countries to increase their oil production by 800,000 barrels per day in 2025, down from its previous forecast of 900,000 barrels per day. OPEC Secretary-General Haitham al-Ghais said, 'The agreement between the US and China on a 90-day trade truce is a positive development, but it does not necessarily mean that the trade tensions will be resolved.' The report also noted that OPEC's member countries have reduced their oil production in April, with Kazakhstan reducing its production by 41,000 barrels per day. The report stated that the decline in oil production is due to a combination of factors, including the impact of trade tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic. 'The impact of the decline in oil production will be felt in the coming months, and it will be a challenge for OPEC to maintain its production levels,' said al-Ghais. The report also noted that the price of oil has fallen in recent days, with the Brent crude oil price falling by 0.5% to $66.31 per barrel, and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price falling by 0.5% to $63.35 per barrel.

**US drillers add oil and gas rigs for first time in four weeks, Baker Hughes says**
US energy firms added oil and gas rigs for the first time in four weeks, according to Baker Hughes. The oil and gas rig count rose by two to 585 in the week to April 17. Despite this week's increase, the total count is still down 34 rigs, or 5% below this time last year. Analysts forecast US spot crude prices to decline for a third year in a row in 2025, but the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects crude output to rise from 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.5 million bpd in 2025. The EIA also predicts that US oil output will peak at 14 million bpd in 2027 and then rapidly decline, while shale production will peak at 10 million bpd in 2027 and fall to 9.3 million bpd by 2050.

**US Oil Production to Peak in 2027, Then Decline Rapidly**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has predicted that US oil production will peak at 14 million barrels per day in 2027 and remain close to this level until the end of the decade, before declining rapidly. The EIA's annual energy outlook report also forecasts that US oil production will decrease to around 11.3 million barrels per day by 2050, down from around 13.7 million barrels per day this year. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has also reduced its forecast for global oil demand and US oil production in 2025 due to the uncertainty surrounding the US-China trade war and the new US tariffs on steel and equipment. The IEA has also warned that the new US tariffs could increase the cost of buying steel and equipment, which could deter oil producers. The EIA has also reduced its forecast for global oil demand and US oil production in 2025, citing the uncertainty surrounding the US-China trade war and the new US tariffs on steel and equipment. The agency has also reduced its forecast for oil prices, predicting that the average price of Brent crude will be $67.87 per barrel in 2024, down from its previous forecast of $74.22 per barrel.

**US crude oil output to peak by 2027, EIA projects**
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that U.S. crude oil output will peak at 14 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2027 and remain at that level through the end of the decade. However, oil output will then rapidly decline to around 11.3 million bpd in 2050. The EIA also forecasts that U.S. oil demand will end its post-pandemic recovery next year, with total product supplied increasing from 20.51 million bpd this year to only 20.52 million bpd next year. This is a decrease from the pre-pandemic average of 20.54 million bpd in 2019. The EIA has lowered its global oil demand growth forecasts due to weaker economic activity and reduced its outlook for U.S. oil production growth for 2025 and 2026. 'The all-time record high was in 2005 at 20.80 million bpd,' according to the EIA. The agency has also sharply cut its oil price forecasts as a result of the demand uncertainty.

**US Slashes Its Outlook for Global Oil Demand Growth in 2025**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has reduced its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2025 by 400,000 barrels a day, citing concerns over the economic outlook due to US President Donald Trump's tariff moves. The EIA now expects global oil demand to grow by about 900,000 barrels a day in 2025. US crude prices have plummeted over 15% in April, trading near a four-year low, as traders assess the outlook for demand amid the trade war between the US and China. US production is expected to fall to 13.56 million barrels a day next year, down from a previous projection of 13.76 million. The EIA also projected that gasoline prices will average $3.10 a gallon in the peak summer months, the lowest inflation-adjusted summer cost for drivers since 2020.

**US Oil Production to Drive Global Supply Growth in 2025**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has downgraded its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2025, citing the impact of US tariffs on trade partners and the worsening macroeconomic outlook. The IEA now expects daily oil demand to reach 103.9 million barrels, down 700,000 barrels from its previous forecast. The agency attributes the downward revision to the increasing uncertainty caused by the US's trade tensions with several countries. On the supply side, the IEA expects global oil production to increase by around 1.5 million barrels per day in 2025, driven mainly by the US's significant increase in oil production, which is expected to be the largest source of oil supply growth in 2025. If OPEC and other major non-OPEC producers continue to increase production in April and beyond, and some countries remain in excess production, the daily surplus production will increase by an additional 400,000 barrels. As of March 3, eight OPEC and non-OPEC producers, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, announced that they would gradually increase oil production starting from April 1, as per their previously announced plan, to withdraw the voluntary production cut of 2.2 million barrels per day implemented in November 2023. On the same day, the price of Brent crude oil futures in London approached $71 per barrel.

**IEA: Global oil demand to accelerate in 2025 despite economic uncertainty**
The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that global oil demand will grow by over 1 million b/d in 2025, reaching 103.9 million b/d, with Asia driving nearly 60% of this increase. However, the outlook remains uncertain due to economic conditions, with recent delivery data falling short of expectations. 'The macroeconomic conditions that underpin our oil demand projections deteriorated over the past month as trade tensions escalated between the US and several other countries,' IEA said. Oil production trends show that world oil supply rose by 240,000 b/d in February, driven by higher output from OPEC+ members. Non-OPEC+ production is forecast to rise by 1.5 million b/d in 2025, led by producers in the Americas. OPEC+ output could hold steady in 2025 if voluntary production cuts are maintained beyond April. 'The US is currently producing at record highs and is forecast to be the largest source of supply growth in 2025,' IEA said. Crude refining activity fell by 570,000 b/d in February, but is projected to average 83.3 million b/d in 2025, up 570,000 b/d from 2024. Global oil stocks fell by 40.5 million bbl in January, but preliminary data for February suggest a rebound. Oil prices dropped by about $7/bbl in February and early March due to weakening macroeconomic sentiment and escalating trade tensions.

**US Energy Information Administration Predicts Tight Global Oil Markets in 2025**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its Short-Term Energy Outlook report on March 11, predicting that global oil markets will remain tight in the first half of 2025 due to declining oil production in Iran and Venezuela under US sanctions. However, as OPEC+ gradually resumes voluntary production cuts from April, non-OPEC production is expected to grow, leading to increased oil inventories and a potential decline in oil prices. The report predicts that Brent crude oil prices will rise to $75 per barrel in the third quarter of 2025, but decline to $68 per barrel in 2026. The report also forecasts that US oil production will continue to set new records, reaching 1.36 million barrels per day in 2025 and 1.38 million barrels per day in 2026. The report notes that the US energy market's future is influenced by international trade policies, including the new round of tariffs on China and China's retaliatory tariffs on US energy products. However, the report does not consider the potential impact of US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which have been delayed until April 2025. The report predicts that natural gas consumption will increase in 2025 and 2026, leading to a decrease in inventories and an increase in Henry Hub natural gas spot prices. The report predicts that Henry Hub natural gas spot prices will reach $4.20 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, an 11% increase from the previous month's forecast, and $4.50 per MMBtu in 2026, an 8% increase from the previous month's forecast. 'The uncertainty of tariff policies makes the global oil demand growth forecast highly uncertain,' the report says. 'This uncertainty has been a major factor in the oil price decline over the past year.' The report predicts that global oil production will exceed demand by the end of 2025, leading to a buildup of inventories and downward pressure on prices. The report predicts that Brent crude oil prices will decline to $66 per barrel in December 2026, with an average price of $68 per barrel in 2026. The report also predicts that global liquid fuel production will continue to grow in 2025 and 2026, driven by OPEC+ production increases and growth in non-OPEC countries. 'Although OPEC+ recently announced plans to gradually increase production from April 2025, we expect OPEC+ member countries to produce less than their announced target to limit the growth of global oil inventories,' the report says. 'We predict that OPEC+ production will increase by less than 20,000 barrels per day in 2025, decrease by 130,000 barrels per day in 2024, and increase by 50,000 barrels per day in 2026.' Non-OPEC countries will lead the growth in production, with the US, Canada, Brazil, and Guyana being the main drivers. The report predicts that global oil consumption growth will be lower than pre-pandemic trends. Global liquid fuel consumption is expected to increase by 130,000 barrels per day in 2025, reaching 1.041 billion barrels per day, and by 120,000 barrels per day in 2026, reaching 1.053 billion barrels per day, driven by demand growth in non-OECD Asia. The report predicts that India will increase its liquid fuel consumption by 30,000 barrels per day in 2025 and 2026, up from 20,000 barrels per day in 2024, driven by increased transportation fuel demand. China's liquid fuel consumption is expected to increase by 30,000 barrels per day in 2025 and 20,000 barrels per day in 2026, up from less than 10,000 barrels per day in 2024, driven by China's economic stimulus measures. 'The uncertainty of tariff policies makes the global oil demand growth forecast highly uncertain,' the report says. 'This uncertainty has been a major factor in the oil price decline over the past year.'
