**US Government Reports 757 UFO Sightings, Raises Concerns of Cartel-Operated Drones**
In 2023, a unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported to have collided with a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft. According to The New York Post, these unidentified objects have been seen in groups of up to eight and have been classified as drones on occasion. 'Pentagon and Federal Aviation Administration investigators have confirmed that these sightings have been documented every time a pilot has reported them to the corresponding air traffic control facility', The New York Post states. Additionally, a UFO that collided with a US combat aircraft 'is just one of a cloud of mysterious objects that are flying over the Air Force's training fields in Arizona', according to multiple reports revealed by The New York Post. Three more encounters with these objects were detected the following day, reports said. 'What I can tell you is that there has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly at the border' with Mexico, said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to that medium. The US government presented 757 reports of this type between May 2023 and June 2024, of which 708 occurred in the air, and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report issued by the Office of Anomaly Resolution. In context: US government dismisses, for now, security threat after sightings of drones in several states The drones and other flying objects, such as the Chinese spy balloon of 2023, are 'clearly passing through multiple US military information channels', added the medium. Some US officials, including Ron Vitiello, chief advisor to the US Customs and Border Protection Office, suggest that the mysterious flying objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. Vitiello told NewsNation Prime earlier this month that the 'unlimited funding' of the cartels could explain the impressive cutting-edge technology never seen before. 'Perhaps they have technology that we are not used to seeing in the drone sector', Vitiello said. 'That's part of their business model: to be able to iterate and innovate constantly in order to continue selling their poison to the United States', concludes the medium.

**UFO crashes into US Air Force fighter jet over Arizona**
A US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet was hit by an unidentified flying object, believed to be a drone, over Arizona on January 19, 2023. The collision cracked the canopy protecting the pilot, but no injuries were reported. The incident is one of 22 reported UFO sightings by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), there have been hundreds of UFO reports made in recent years, with Arizona becoming a hotspot for sightings. AARO, the Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, has received 757 UAP reports worldwide between May 2023 and June 2024, with at least 410 occurring over the US. Whistleblowers have revealed that many UFO sightings are taking place in Arizona, particularly on the border, and some believe that Mexican cartels may be involved in launching high-tech spy missions into the US. 'A lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border,' said Luis Elizondo, a former government intelligence officer. 'I've seen orbs that were off in the distance. I've seen crafts that were cigar-shaped, I've seen triangles,' said Bob Thompson, a former US Customs and Border Protection agent.

**UFOs Are Swarming U.S. Military Zones -- And One Just Crashed Into a Fighter Jet**
A U.S. F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified flying object (UFO) during a training mission over Arizona in January. The object, described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system,' or UAS, hit the plane's canopy mid-flight. This incident is one of dozens of reported midair encounters between military pilots and strange objects over restricted airspace in the Southwest. Since 2020, military pilots have reported encountering objects such as metallic spheres, drones, and objects moving at high speeds. Former Pentagon UAP investigator Luis Elizondo said, 'These reports are coming in constantly,' and former CBP official Ron Vitiello speculated that the technology behind these objects may be more advanced than what's publicly known. The U.S. government has logged 757 sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena from May 2023 to June 2024, with only 49 marked 'case closed.'

**US Scientists Report 757 Documented UFO Sightings, Cartels Suspected of Using Drones for Espionage and Drug Trafficking**
US scientists have reported 757 documented cases of UFO sightings. According to Ron Vitello, a US Customs and Border Protection advisor, cartels have 'unlimited funding' that allows them to implement new technologies, including drones, to smuggle drugs into the US. In 2023, a US military F-16 Viper fighter jet was damaged by a UFO while flying over Arizona, forcing it to be temporarily taken out of service. The incident was confirmed by official documents from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA has confirmed that it is investigating all reports of UFO sightings, especially those that are confirmed by radar data. The US government has documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of them occurring in airspace. Only 49 cases have been officially closed. Many of the sightings occurred in areas where military exercises were taking place in Arizona and surrounding states. Some officials, including Vitello, believe that these objects may be drones used by cartels for espionage or drug trafficking. According to NewsNation, cartels have already used similar devices to transport up to 10 kg of cargo at a time. Vitello stated, 'They have unlimited funding, which allows them to implement new technologies that the US has not seen before.' This, he believes, is part of the business model of criminal organizations that continuously improve their methods of delivering prohibited substances into the US.

**Mysterious UFOs Swarm Over US Air Force Training Fields in Arizona**
A UFO that collided with a US Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet in January 2023 is just one of a swarm of mysterious objects buzzing around the Air Force's training fields in Arizona, according to multiple reports. The unidentified flying object struck the 'bubble canopy' of a $63 million F-16 Viper, damaging it and temporarily grounding the aircraft, according to FAA documents. The military aircraft was hit by an orange and white 'UAS' (unmanned aerial system) while in the air, according to the FAA documents. 'There's been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things from Arizona, particularly along the border with Mexico,' said former Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo to NewsNation this month. The FAA told The Post in a statement that the agency 'documents unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) sightings whenever a pilot reports one to a air traffic control facility.' The government reported 757 such incidents between May 2023 and June 2024 (708 of which occurred in the air) and only 49 were marked as 'Case closed' in the latest report from the Office of Anomaly Resolution. The small unidentified objects seen in Arizona fly in groups of up to eight and are sometimes characterized as drones, according to War Zone, which noted that the incidents took place at high altitudes near military combat training sites since January 2020. 'They're clearly being transmitted through multiple military reporting channels,' added War Zone. Some US officials, including Ron Vitiello, chief advisor to US Customs and Border Protection, speculate that the mysterious flying objects could be drones used by foreign cartels to spy or smuggle drugs. 'Maybe they have technology we're not used to seeing in the drone space,' said Vitiello.

**Florida's Chances of Surviving an Alien Invasion: A Study Reveals the State's Preparedness**
Florida is one of the states with the most UFO sightings in the US, with 8,623 reported cases since 1944, according to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). However, a recent study analyzed factors such as population density, cave availability, forest and water coverage, military and police presence, and the number of scientists, engineers, and healthcare professionals in each state to determine which state would be best prepared to survive an alien invasion. Florida ranked sixth in the list with a score of 7.55 out of 10. The state has 12 caves that could serve as makeshift hiding spots, 0.51% of its territory covered in forests, and 0.19% covered in water, which could be used as escape routes. Additionally, Florida has four military personnel per 1,000 inhabitants and two law enforcement agents per 1,000. However, the state has fewer scientists and engineers than other states, which could hinder a technological counterattack. Virginia topped the list with a score of 8.06, followed by Alabama, Massachusetts, New York, and Minnesota.

**Have you seen a UFO? In Florida, you're not alone. What to know about sightings**
Florida ranks second in the US for UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases. On March 22, an object was spotted over Green Cove Springs, but its nature remains unclear. Some common objects are often mistaken for UFOs, such as drones, rockets, and Chinese lanterns. The National UFO Reporting Center has processed over 180,000 reports since its inception. If you think you've seen a UFO, you can report it on the center's website. According to the report, the object over Green Cove Springs made no noise and was at least a few hundred feet off the ground. The first known UFO sighting in Florida occurred in 1942, when a black cylindrical object was spotted over P-38s. The most recent sighting reported to the National UFO Reporting Center was outside Deltona, where five flying objects were seen making schematic movements and disappearing quickly.

**US Military Aircraft Encounters 'Swarm' of UFOs Over Florida**
A US military aircraft may have encountered a 'swarm' of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the skies over Florida. According to unconfirmed reports, the pilot contacted the Eastern Sector Air Defense Command dispatcher and reported that the aircraft was suddenly surrounded by a 'cluster of glowing spheres' while flying over the state of Florida. When the aircraft flew through this 'swarm' of unidentified objects, the electrical equipment began to malfunction, and communication with 'ground control' was abruptly severed. The pilot also stated that the aircraft began to glow when it approached the UFO. A military Lockheed AC-130 Spectre aircraft was quickly dispatched to the scene of the aerial incident, with a clear mission to locate the UFO over Florida. However, representatives of the US Armed Forces have not provided any comments on the matter. It is worth noting that NASA has recently formed a new expert group to analyze information about UFOs. As a reminder, on August 16, 2024, a UFO was spotted over the Volgograd region.

**New map of UFO hotspots reveals best US states for 'alien spotting'**
According to the National UFO Reporting Center, California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974, or one sighting for every 1,075 residents. Washington state comes in second, with 7,125 sightings, followed by Florida, Oregon, and New York. The data also revealed that pilots in these states have reported seeing mysterious lights and objects in the sky, including a recent incident in California where a US Air Force pilot described 'three orange-like lights' hovering above Los Angeles. Former FBI agent Ben Hansen estimated that the object must have been traveling at Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound, to get so far away so fast. The states with the fewest UFO sightings are Louisiana and North Dakota, with one sighting for every 3,815 people and 0.0004 per capita, respectively.

**New map of UFO hotspots reveals best US states for 'alien spotting' | Daily Mail Online**
According to data from the National UFO Reporting Center, California has recorded the most UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 reported encounters since 1974. This translates to one sighting for every 1,075 residents. The state's clear night skies and dense population have created perfect conditions for UFO sightings. Washington state comes in second, with 7,125 reported sightings, followed by Florida with over 11,000 encounters. Oregon and New York round out the top five, with one sighting per 1,156 and 1,301 residents, respectively. In contrast, Louisiana and North Dakota have the fewest UFO encounters nationwide, with one sighting for every 3,815 and 0.0004 per capita, respectively. 'It had capabilities just to zigzag and change color, so that was a little daunting, to the say the least, but you know, it's also something fascinating that I was able to see and capture with my phone,' said Cassandra Martin, a flight attendant who witnessed a UFO sighting in Oregon.

**US Air Force pilot reveals encounter with UFO during secret mission**
A US Air Force pilot, identified as 'Troy 21,' reported a close encounter with a UFO while on a secret mission over California on September 17, 2024. The pilot's voice was heard on a recording of local air traffic control, where he described the object as a 'dark gray cylindrical object' no bigger than a football that passed underneath his wing. The UFO was traveling at a high speed, estimated to be Mach 2, and was seen again 60 miles away from the aircraft. Former FBI agent Ben Hansen, a UFO expert, analyzed the recording and concluded that the chances of the object being a drone were unlikely. Hansen noted that the incident raises serious concerns, especially since the object passed so close to a manned airplane in controlled airspace. The incident has sparked renewed interest in the possibility of alien life visiting Earth, with some government officials, including Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, calling for the truth to be exposed.
