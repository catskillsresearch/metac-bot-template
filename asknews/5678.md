**Emmanuel Opens Up About His Wife's Illness: 'She Lives in an Internal World'**
Emmanuel, a Mexican singer, has spoken publicly for the first time about his wife Mercedes Alemán's illness, which has left her without mobility. He explained that she lives in an 'internal world', always silent but aware of her surroundings. Emmanuel has been sensitive and reserved about the situation, but has shared his feelings and experiences in an interview with the program 'Hoy'. He said, 'I'm quite reserved about my private life because I always said that the artist doesn't have a private life, the little that you have if you let it go, you're at zero...'. He also mentioned that his wife is surrounded by love and care from their family, and that she is 'totally conscious of everything that's happening, but can't move...'. Emmanuel has found comfort in his faith and hopes that God has something 'marvelous' in store for his wife and their family. He also shared a touching moment from the reality TV show 'Juego de Voces', where his wife appeared moving her hand, which was a 'gigantic effort' for her due to her condition.

**Hospital could not stop disabled man's death, inquest hears**
Balram, a disabled man with multiple disabilities, was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital in July 2023 with a raised infection rate and fluid build-up. Due to a Covid outbreak at the hospital, it was decided to transfer him home, where oral diuretics were administered instead of intravenous ones. Dr Emmanuel testified that hospital treatment would not have altered Balram's ultimate prognosis, and that his condition had worsened due to his heart condition. Mr Patel, representing himself, argued that intravenous diuretics could have prolonged Balram's life, citing his 30-year survival after being given a three-week prognosis at birth.

**GHF says videos from dawn show nobody hurt at Gaza aid site; AP says shooting incident occurred at 3 a.m.**
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) released videos showing no Palestinian civilians were hurt at one of its aid distribution sites in the southern Gaza Strip, contradicting Hamas' claim of 31 deaths. However, AP eyewitnesses reported that Israeli forces fired on a crowd gathered at the aid site at 3 a.m., resulting in dozens of wounded, including women and children. The IDF stated it was unaware of any casualties within the aid site, but is investigating further. Emanuel Fabian, The Times of Israel's military correspondent, reports on the conflicting accounts.

**Murder of clerk leads to shocking discovery: The corpse of another victim**
Torrey Moore, 34, was sentenced to three consecutive life terms for the murders of a convenience store clerk, Ayalew Wondimu, 61, and his pregnant girlfriend, Denise Middleton, 8½ months pregnant with their unborn son, Ezekiel. Moore shot Wondimu at a convenience store in Montgomery County, Maryland, after earlier killing Middleton at their apartment. Surveillance video showed Moore arguing with Wondimu, pulling out a gun, and firing multiple rounds. He then picked up his tea and walked out, leaving Wondimu on the floor. Investigators found Middleton's decaying body in their apartment, with Moore claiming he didn't know what happened to her. Attorneys for Moore stated that his mental illness and schizophrenia drove his actions. The case marked the first conviction for the murder of an unborn child in Montgomery County. 'These were three intentional murders,' said Montgomery County Circuit Judge Rachel McGuckian. 'He was my everything,' Wondimu's widow said in court. 'I am heartbroken.' 'He was my everything,' Wondimu's widow said in court. 'I am heartbroken.' 'I'm glad he won't be free to hurt anyone else,' said Chinita Coates, a sister of Middleton's. 'We're left to wonder why he did what he did,' McGuckian said. 'And really no one knows but him, and maybe not even him.'

**Family Accuses Hospital of Negligence in 5-Year-Old's Death**
The family of 5-year-old Sophie Emanuelle Viana is accusing the Santa Casa hospital in Campo Grande of medical negligence after her death. According to the family, Sophie suffered a head injury when a gate fell on her at home on Sunday (25). She was taken to the UPA Vila Almeida, where she received initial treatment and had five stitches on her head. Due to the severity of her injuries and her pre-existing heart condition, an emergency bed was requested at the Santa Casa, which was made available within 30 minutes. However, the family claims that the on-duty doctor did not order the necessary tests to identify possible trauma, only requesting an X-ray. Despite Sophie's fragile state, she was discharged from the hospital in less than 4 hours. The next day, Sophie presented with high fever, headache, and vomiting, and the family returned to the Santa Casa, where a CT scan revealed blood in the skull and a fracture. Despite this, the medical team chose to keep Sophie under observation without ordering additional tests. As the days passed, Sophie complained of pain and her face began to swell. She was given morphine, but her condition worsened until she was taken to the emergency room on Thursday, where she suffered a cardiac arrest and died. The family alleges that their requests for help were ignored and that Sophie did not receive adequate care. The Santa Casa has been contacted for comment, but has not yet responded.

**Biden's Prostate Cancer Likely Grew Undetected for Years, Experts Say**
Former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis has raised questions about screening guidelines for older men. Biden's last prostate screening was in 2014, more than 10 years ago. Experts say the cancer likely developed over many years, with Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel stating, 'The cancer had likely been 'growing there and spreading' for a long time.' Dr. William Dahut added, 'We definitely would anticipate that he has had prostate cancer for many, many years.' The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend PSA testing for men 70 and older due to the risk of false positives and the fact that older men often die of other causes. However, some doctors still choose to screen older patients, as seen in President Donald Trump's recent PSA test. As a result, experts recommend that men over 70 talk to their doctor about whether a PSA test makes sense for them.

**Biden’s Prostate Cancer Likely Grew Undetected for Years, Experts Say**
Joe Biden, 82, was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer last week, which doctors say is treatable but cannot be cured. His last prostate screening was in 2014, more than 10 years ago. Experts say the cancer likely developed over many years, and because of this, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend PSA testing for men 70 and older. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel stated that advanced prostate cancer can sometimes grow quietly for years before being detected. In Biden's case, doctors say the cancer is serious but still treatable, though not curable. A spokesperson for the former president said, 'President Biden's last known PSA was in 2014, prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer.'

**Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis renews scrutiny of screening guidelines for older men**
President Biden's recent prostate cancer diagnosis has sparked debate about screening guidelines for older men. Doctors have been discussing the pros and cons of PSA screenings, which can catch cancer early but also lead to false alarms or find slow-growing tumors. Dr. Otis Brawley, a prostate cancer specialist, said he wouldn't have recommended screening for Biden due to his age and other health issues. Brawley noted that there is no organization of medical experts that recommends screening for men over 70, but rather encourages informed decision-making. Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel argued that presidents should be held to stricter health standards, while Rep. Ronny Jackson criticized Dr. Kevin O'Connor for not identifying the cancer earlier. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises against PSA screening for men 70 and older, but some experts hope to update the guidelines to encourage more screenings.

**Bayden's Former Doctor Reveals His Remaining Life Expectancy**
A former doctor of Bayden said, 'I have spoken to many urologists since this information became known, and they all agree that he may live for 12 to 18 months. Hopefully, time will give us more, and I believe they will find a way to effectively treat this illness. He will live for many years, but this is a very advanced illness.' Earlier, oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel had speculated that the disease may have begun to develop during Bayden's 2021 presidential term. This statement has raised public suspicions that the politician's true health may be hidden. In particular, the White House's 2024 February medical report stated that there were no problems with Bayden's prostate gland, but rather that his health was 'good'. Bayden is currently 82 years old. In 2024, he frequently became disoriented, forgetful, and would often collapse in public, leading to concerns about his physical and mental state, ultimately forcing him to drop out of the presidential race.

**Former White House Doctor Estimates Joe Biden's Remaining Time**
Former White House doctor and Republican congressman Ronny Jackson has estimated that Joe Biden, who has been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer, may have 12 to 18 months left to live. Jackson stated, 'This is not my specialty, but I've talked to many urologists since it became known, and they all agree that he may have 12 to 18 months left. I hope there will be more time, and I believe they can effectively treat this disease, and you know, he will live many, many years. But this is a far-advanced disease.' Earlier, oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel suggested that Biden's aggressive prostate cancer may have developed as early as 2021, during his presidency. This has sparked new suspicions in the US about Biden's potential health issues being concealed. A February 2024 White House doctor's report claimed that Biden's health was 'fine' and that there were no issues with his prostate. Biden is currently 82 years old and withdrew from the 2024 presidential election due to concerns about his health.

**Ezekiel Emanuel on Biden's Cancer: There Are a Lot of Treatments, He Could Live a Long Time**
Ezekiel Emanuel stated on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' that former President Joe Biden has a lot of life-extending treatment options for his prostate cancer, which has spread to the bone. Emanuel said, 'There are a lot of treatments. There's androgen blockade, androgen receptor signaling inhibitors, chemotherapy, and treatment for the metastatic lesion near the spine.' He added that Biden could live a long time with these treatments. Emanuel also mentioned that it's rare for prostate cancer to be diagnosed at this late stage, and that Biden likely had the cancer for many years, possibly even a decade, before it was detected. When asked if Biden had the cancer while he was President, Emanuel replied, 'Oh yeah, he did not develop it in the last 100 to 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021.'

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former member of President Biden's transition team, expressed shock that Biden's prostate cancer was not detected earlier, suggesting he may have had it for 'a decade.' Emanuel stated, 'He's had this for many years, maybe even a decade, growing there and spreading.' He also mentioned that there's no evidence in Biden's medical records that he had a prostate-specific antigen. Emanuel insisted that Biden would have definitely had the disease even before he was elected president, and that he likely had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. 'He did not develop it in the last 100 to 200 days,' Emanuel said. 'He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021.

**Doctor who worked with Biden says he had cancer ‘while he was president: ‘He did not develop it in the last 100 to 200 days’**
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former member of Biden's transition team, believes that the 82-year-old president likely had cancer while serving as president. Emanuel stated, 'He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don’t think there’s any disagreement about that.' The diagnosis was announced two days after Biden learned of it, and doctors have speculated that the cancer may have been present for a decade. Emanuel noted that Biden should have had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) exams when he was younger, and that it is 'inconceivable' that the cancer went undetected for so long. Emanuel also mentioned that former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush both underwent PSA exams while in office, which is 'a little surprising' that Biden's doctor did not do the same.

**Joe Scarborough Stunned as Doc Suggests Biden's Had Cancer for 10 Years  --  and Either Skipped Tests or 'Didn't Report'**
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a cancer doctor and former member of Joe Biden's COVID Advisory Board, suggested that Biden's advanced prostate cancer should have been caught earlier. Emanuel stated that it's 'a little surprising' that the cancer was not diagnosed until now, and that it's possible that Biden either skipped the test or the White House failed to report the results. Emanuel estimated that Biden has had the cancer for 'many years,' possibly even a decade, and that it's 'a little surprising' that he wasn't diagnosed earlier. Emanuel also stated that it's 'troubling' if the doctor didn't take the test and didn't report the results, and that it's 'very unlikely' that the test would have missed the diagnosis given the advanced nature of the disease. 'If he has had prostate cancer that has spread to the bone then he most certainly had it when he was president of the United States,' Emanuel said. 'He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that.'

**NYT: Suicide for the Elderly | Evolution News and Science Today**
The New York Times has published an opinion piece by Daniel Kahneman, 'A Lesson to Learn', which discusses the recent suicide of a 90-year-old man who was still intellectually active and healthy. Kahneman argues that the man's decision to end his life was a result of his desire to maintain control over his life and avoid 'miseries and indignities' that may come with old age. However, bioethicist Wesley J. Smith criticizes the piece, stating that it promotes a 'depraved' and 'anti-intrinsic dignity of life' view. Smith argues that the piece should not have been published, as it may encourage others to consider suicide. The article also references an opinion piece by Ezekiel Emanuel, 'Being Made Dead', which suggests that being made dead when one wants to die is 'dignity'. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available for those struggling with suicidal thoughts, at 988 or SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources.
