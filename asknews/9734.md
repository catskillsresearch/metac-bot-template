**FO° Exclusive: US Budget and US-China Tariff Deal Unleash New Economic Uncertainty**
The US House of Representatives has passed a budget bill that will increase the country's debt by trillions of dollars. The bill, which was passed by a single vote, extends corporate and individual tax cuts, cancels green energy incentives, and tightens eligibility for health and food programs for the poor. The bill also funds Trump's crackdown on immigration and loosens regulations on firearm silencers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will increase the US government's deficit by $3.4 trillion by 2034. The US debt has already reached 124% of the GDP. Markets are worried about growing US debt, and the dollar has depreciated, which could add to inflationary pressures. The bill still has to go through the Senate and will have global consequences. Additionally, the US and China have agreed to a trade truce, with the US decreasing extra tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China removing non-tariff barriers on American goods and decreasing extra tariffs to 10%. The US tariffs on Chinese goods will remain about 40%, while Chinese tariffs on American goods will be 25%. The US administration is divided between Bessenomics, a more transactional take on traditional Republican economics, and Navaronomics, a more isolationist and protectionist economic policy. Bessenomics aims to use tariffs as a transactional tool to gain greater market access into China, while Navaronomics seeks a total reordering of global trade through punitive tariffs.

**Dr Mahathir says China will overtake US and stay as world’s top power, downplays India’s potential as competitor**
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad has stated that China is poised to become the world's leading power, citing its long-standing civilization and resilience. Dr Mahathir believes that the United States lacks the capacity to halt China's rise due to growing domestic preoccupations. He also criticized US President Donald Trump's use of tariffs, saying they have alienated the US globally and would ultimately harm American consumers. Dr Mahathir dismissed the idea that India could rival China's influence, citing its complex social structure and decentralized governance. He also expressed concern over the US dollar's dominance in international trade, advocating for a new gold-based international trading currency. According to Dr Mahathir, 'I don't think the US will recover and become No. 1 again. China looks like it is going to be the No. 1 country in the world.' He also stated, 'Trump has made the whole world the enemy... I give Trump three months before he will have to do away with the tariffs.'

**US-China Trade War: Who Will Be the Dominant Power?**
The trade war between the US and China has raised questions about who will be the dominant power in the future. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, but China has retaliated with its own tariffs. The situation has led to a decline in trade between the two countries, with the US experiencing a trade deficit of $700 billion in 2025. In contrast, China has a trade surplus of $700 billion, with a focus on exporting electronics and other goods. The US has a large national debt of $35 trillion, while China's debt is $15 trillion, but its total debt is 300% of its GDP. According to the IMF, China is expected to become the largest contributor to global growth in the next five years, with a 23% share. The US is still expected to be a major contributor, but its share is expected to decline. The two countries have different economic systems, with the US relying heavily on services, while China relies on industry. The US has a strong military, with over 6,100 tanks and 40,000 armored vehicles, while China has a large military with over 3.3 million soldiers and 3,260 aircraft. The US has a strong navy, with 490 ships, including 11 aircraft carriers, while China has a large navy with 777 ships. The US has a strong defense budget, with $740 billion in 2025, while China's defense budget is $178 billion. According to a report by the Telegraph, China has surpassed the US in terms of military strength, with over 1 million soldiers and a larger navy. The US is concerned about China's rapid military modernization, including its nuclear capabilities. The trade war between the US and China is not just about tariffs, but also about the future of the global economy and the balance of power between the two countries.

**US and China to Meet to Resolve Trade Dispute over Minerals**
The US Treasury Secretary, Bessent, believes that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will speak to resolve trade issues, including a dispute over essential minerals. 'I think we'll see something very soon,' Bessent said, in the context of new attacks made by President Trump, accusing China of violating an agreement to reduce tariffs and trade restrictions on essential minerals. The two countries agreed to temporarily reduce 'reciprocal tariffs' between them for 90 days. US tariffs on Chinese imports will decrease from 145% to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US products will fall from 125% to 10%. 'I'm confident that when President Trump and President Xi speak, this will be resolved,' Bessent continued. 'But the fact that they are holding onto some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement - perhaps it's a flaw in the Chinese system, perhaps it's intentional. We'll see after the President speaks with President Xi.' The interview was given to CBS. Last Friday, Trump said he was certain he would speak with President Xi Jinping. China said in April that the two leaders had not spoken recently. China is at the forefront of countries with a non-hegemonic foreign policy towards the US. Some statistical data also explains the fear of Americans. In 2024, for example, China was among the top 10 countries with the highest growth rate - 5%, according to official numbers. The first place was held by India (6.5%), followed by the Philippines (5.6%), Malaysia (5.1%), Indonesia (5.0%) and China (5.0%). In 2024, China's GDP totaled around 134.9 trillion yuan, equivalent to around $17 trillion to $19 trillion. In the first quarter of 2025, China's economy grew 5.4% compared to the same period last year. The market estimated a 5.1% increase in China's GDP (with Reuters). China was also one of the countries that most defended the expansion of the BRICS, hosted in the Asian country. One of the main debates within the bloc is the use of a common currency, which reduces dependence on the dollar for commercial transactions. Currently, the BRICS is formed by Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran. The BRICS also includes partner countries - Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda and Uzbekistan.

**China's steady economy: fostering global certainty amid turbulence**
China's economy has shown remarkable resilience and maintained steady growth, with a 5.4% year-on-year GDP increase in the first quarter of 2025. The country's industrial added value, services sector index, and retail sales rose by 6.1%, 6%, and 5.1% respectively. International media have commended China's economic performance as 'exceeding expectations', 'resilient', and 'steadfast.' China's continued economic resilience and growth can be attributed to its solid foundation, diverse advantages, and notable resilience. The country's immense consumption potential, innovation-driven growth, favourable business environment, and competitive edge have all contributed to its economic stability. China's relatively sound fiscal status also provides ample space to cushion external shocks. As President Xi Jinping pointed out, 'Believing in China is believing in a better tomorrow.' China will remain a pillar of stability and certainty in an increasingly uncertain world.

**World Economic Forum Warns of Global Economic Fragility**
The World Economic Forum's 'Chief Economists Outlook' report highlights growing concerns about the fragility of the global economy. Based on a survey conducted between April 3 and 17, 2025, the report collects the perspectives of chief economists from the public and private sectors. Experts warn that the state of the global economy will significantly deteriorate, mainly due to abrupt changes in US commercial policy. The US has imposed historic tariff increases, including a 10% general tariff and up to 145% on Chinese products. China has retaliated with export restrictions on strategic minerals. Although a 90-day pause in the tariff escalation was agreed upon, experts believe that uncertainty persists. The report states that US commercial policy decisions are perceived as a long-term structural change, not a temporary disruption. 79% of surveyed economists share this view. The risks are not limited to the US. In Europe, a weak growth persists, but signs of recovery are seen, driven by more expansive fiscal policies, particularly in Germany. In China, the 5% growth target is met with skepticism, with the IMF reducing its projections to 4% due to internal and external factors affecting demand and the dynamism of the real estate sector. In Latin America, the situation is equally challenging, with a 2% growth expectation for 2025, down from 2.4% in the previous year. The report highlights the growing fragmentation of the global economy, with 98% of economists expecting it to accelerate in the remainder of the year. 94% anticipate that economic nationalism will increasingly influence policy decisions. The uncertainty has led to a paralysis in business decision-making, with 87% of experts believing that companies are delaying strategic investments, reorganizing supply chains, and diversifying operations to reduce risks. The uncertainty has become a structural feature of the global economy, with over 80% of surveyed economists rating it as 'very high' and only a slight majority expecting it to decrease in the next year. The areas most affected will be trade, GDP growth, and foreign direct investment. In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a double-edged factor. While 45% expect it to be disruptive in 2025, 81% believe it can contribute between 1 and 10 percentage points to global growth in the next decade. However, its impact on employment is uncertain, with 47% anticipating net job losses and only 19% expecting net gains. The most promising areas are automation of tasks and acceleration of innovation. The report concludes that AI can become the main driver of economic innovation if it is properly channeled, but also warns of associated risks, such as market concentration, unemployment, increased inequality, and disinformation. Governments and companies must prepare to integrate AI into their operations, with 89% of economists believing it is essential to invest in AI infrastructure and 75% seeing a need for public investment in training and labor retraining. Businesses should prioritize redesigning processes, improving data infrastructure, and strengthening cybersecurity.

**China's 'Made in China 2035' Plan: A Response to US Pressure or a Desperate Attempt to Revive Economy?**
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has announced its plan to prioritize manufacturing, dubbed 'Made in China 2035', in response to pressure from the US. However, experts question whether this shift will be enough to address the country's deep-seated economic issues, including inflation, overcapacity, and extreme imbalance. The CCP's plan is seen as a response to the US's efforts to promote American re-industrialization, led by President Trump's global tariffs. The tariffs have been a key factor in the US-China trade war, with the US seeking to block China's practice of 'dumping' goods on the global market. The CCP's financial system is also facing risks, with six major state-owned banks experiencing declining profits and rising non-performing loans. Some experts warn that China may enter a period of negative interest rates, which could have significant implications for the economy.

**India Overtakes China as Global Oil Demand Engine, Says Moody’s**
Moody's has predicted that India will overtake China as the global oil demand engine, driven by the country's strong economic growth. According to the agency, India's real GDP is expected to grow by 6.3% in 2025 and 6.5% in 2026, making it the top performer in the G20. India's oil consumption is projected to rise from 5.55 million barrels per day in 2024 to 5.99 million bpd in 2026, while China's oil demand is expected to grow by only 1.5% in 2025 and 1.25% in 2026. Moody's also expects India to make significant strides in natural gas usage, with the government targeting an increase in gas's share of the energy mix from 6% to 15% by 2030. 'With India emerging as the new epicentre of energy consumption, global oil producers and energy stakeholders are increasingly reorienting their strategies toward the subcontinent, marking a decisive shift in the global energy order.'

**Moody's Downgrades US Credit Rating, Citing Rising Debt and Increasing Costs**
Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating, citing rising debt and increasing costs of servicing it. The rating agency warns that US government debt could reach 134% of GDP by 2035, up from 98% in 2024. The US government is trying to address the issue with a comprehensive tax package and planned spending cuts, but Moody's remains skeptical. The agency has criticized the government for not taking effective measures to consolidate public finances. The downgrading has led to a decline in US Treasury yields, with the 10-year yield rising to 4.54%. The dollar has also weakened, with the dollar index falling. The US government has responded with criticism, accusing Moody's of political bias. The agency's move has sparked debate about the independence of rating agencies and the timing of the downgrading. China, a major creditor of the US, has been reducing its holdings of US Treasury bonds in recent years, and the geopolitical tensions between the two countries could further reduce China's willingness to hold US debt. Investors should be cautious and consider hedging strategies to mitigate risks.

**Lin Yifu Predicts China's Economy to Surpass the US by 2049**
Lin Yifu, honorary dean of the National Development Research Institute at Peking University, predicts that China's economy will surpass the United States by 2049. He believes that China's per capita GDP will reach half of the United States' by then, and its total economic volume will be twice that of the US. Lin emphasizes that the US will find it difficult to pressure China through technological means, and US companies will become increasingly dependent on the Chinese market. He attributes China's economic growth to its complete industrial chain, vast domestic market, and improving talent advantages. Despite facing challenges such as aging population and international trade pressures, China has the potential for annual growth of 5%. Lin also notes that China has 16 years of potential growth space from 2019 to 2035, with a possible actual annual growth rate of 5-6%, and 6% potential growth rate from 2036 to 2049, with an actual growth rate of 3-4%. He dismisses the 'China collapse theory' as a misunderstanding of China's reform path, and emphasizes that China's gradual reform has allowed it to avoid systemic crises and maintain high growth for decades. He also criticizes the 'Washington Consensus' for ignoring China's actual conditions and experiences. Lin responds to critics who label him as 'optimistic' by saying, 'I am objective.' He believes that based on objective data and historical experience, China's economic performance in the medium and long term is highly predictable and resilient.

**Aakar Patel | China's GDP Will Outstrip US Soon: Tariff War Last Bid To Check Beijing?**
China's GDP is expected to surpass the US in the mid-2030s, according to Citigroup's analysis. This is unacceptable to the US, which has been the dominant global power for the last century. The US has been trying to handicap China through tariffs and restricting its access to semiconductor chips, but these efforts have failed. China has made significant advancements in technology, including artificial intelligence, and has already surpassed the US in certain areas such as naval ships and space programs. The tariff war is the latest attempt to decouple the West from China, but it may ultimately fail. The US will be hurt more by the trade standstill than China, as it relies heavily on imports from China. The US will have to undergo economic pain and uncertainty to produce what it wants to consume, as it cannot bear to see someone else as number one.

**US and China GDP to Remain Top 2 Until 2075, But Trump's Policies May Change the Ranking**
According to a recent report by the Japanese Economic Research Center, the GDP of the United States and China will continue to be ranked 1st and 2nd respectively until 2075, with no change in the ranking. However, if the policies of former US President Donald Trump are implemented in the long term, the US GDP may be surpassed by China as early as 2049. The report also predicts that the global average economic growth rate will decrease from 3.3% between 2021 and 2030 to 1.3% between 2071 and 2075, due to the decline in population and birth rate. The report also notes that the population of Asia will decline by 2075, while Africa's population will continue to grow and surpass East Asia in the mid-2040s. 'If the US continues to deport 1 million illegal immigrants every year and strictly limits legal immigration, the US economy will decline, and China's GDP will surpass the US by 2049,' the report said.

**What Western media get wrong about China's economy**
Contrary to Western media's claims of China's economic doom, the country's economy remains dynamic and poised for long-term growth. China's gross domestic product (GDP) reached a record 134.91 trillion yuan ($18.81 trillion) in 2024, marking a 5-percent year-on-year increase. John Ross, a senior fellow of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, said, 'The much faster growth in China than in the United States exposes the absurdity and the pure propaganda character of such claims made by US media.' China's economic growth was broad-based, with all key sectors showing strong performance. The country's research and development (R&D) spending totaled 3.61 trillion yuan in 2024, up 8.3 percent from the previous year. Green development remains a key priority, with clean energy technologies experiencing significant growth. China has also achieved 126 indicators ahead of schedule for the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Meanwhile, China's high-standard opening-up has continued to serve as a cornerstone of its economic vitality and global integration. Foreign giants like Tesla and BMW have expanded their presence in China, leveraging its vast industrial ecosystems and consumer markets to drive breakthroughs in electric vehicles, renewable energy and advanced materials. A new report by the American Chamber of Commerce in South China showed that China holds a strong position in global investment, with 58 percent of foreign companies considering China one of their top three investment priorities.

**China Will Not Surpass the US by 2050, Says Professor**
A professor from Incheon National University analyzed the possibility of a power struggle between the US and China and proposed a national strategy for South Korea. His conclusion is that China will not surpass the US by 2050. He argues that South Korea's diplomacy should aim for 'global central diplomacy' based on the common interests of many countries and nations, rather than a binary choice between the US and China. The professor's reasoning is that China's military power will not surpass the US by 2050, considering military expenditure and population size. Economically, China's GDP growth rate is not sufficient to surpass the US, according to the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook. The professor also notes that China's cultural influence is limited due to its strict social and cultural control, as well as its poor response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He suggests that South Korea should lead the formation of diplomatic alliances or cooperative communities with countries that aim for global centrality, such as those in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and South America.

**Lin Yifu: China's Economy Will Surpass the US by 2030**
Lin Yifu, a Taiwanese-born Chinese economist, spoke at the 'Taiwanese Enterprises Association Great Lecture Hall' in Beijing, saying that it's difficult to say whether the US will benefit more than China in the trade war, as the US is an extremely practical country that will 'follow you and live in peace' when it can't 'strangle' you. He believes that China has a strong belief in its own abilities and will 'ride the wind and break through the waves' as long as it does its job well. According to Lin, China's economy will surpass the US by 2030, and its per capita GDP will reach 50% or even higher than the US by 2049, assuming no external influences such as trade wars. He also stated that the US is not only targeting China, but also other countries like Canada and Mexico. Lin believes that China's internal market and supply chain advantages will allow it to thrive in this challenging environment and even widen the gap with other countries. He also emphasized that China's goal of becoming a modernized strong nation and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation by 2049 is 'inevitable' and that Taiwan will not be left behind.

**Analysis: Clean energy contributed a record 10% of China’s GDP in 2024 - Carbon Brief**
China's clean-energy sectors contributed a record 10% of the country's GDP in 2024, with a total value of 13.6tn yuan ($1.9tn). The sectors, which include renewables, nuclear power, and energy storage, grew three times as fast as the Chinese economy overall, accounting for 26% of all GDP growth in 2024. Electric vehicles and solar power were the top growth drivers, making up 39% of the total value of the clean-energy industries. The growth in clean-energy sectors played a key role in driving their overall contribution to GDP in 2024, whereas investment was the driver in 2023. The analysis notes that the growth of clean-energy sectors is expected to continue into 2025, driven by major projects aiming to finish before the end of the current five-year plan. However, the sectors are plagued by weak profitability and oversupply, and returning them to profitability would require maintaining strong domestic demand and measures to address overcapacity. The government's economic stimulus measures are likely to support investment in the clean-energy sectors, given their significant role in investment growth.

**China’s economy in 2024 continued to far outgrow the U.S.**
China's economy in 2024 continued to outperform the US, with a GDP growth rate of 5.0% compared to the US's 2.8%. This marks the 7th consecutive year that China's economy has grown faster than the US. China's strategic economic development goals, set out in the 14th Five-Year Plan, aim to double GDP between 2020 and 2035. The plan requires an average annual GDP growth rate of 4.7%, which China has exceeded, with a growth rate of 23.4% over the past 4 years. In contrast, the US's GDP growth rate has been stagnant, with a growth rate of 15.0% over the same period. The article argues that the US's tariffs and sanctions against China have been unsuccessful in slowing down China's economy. Instead, China's high level of net fixed capital formation, at 15.8% of GDP in 2021, has contributed to its rapid economic growth. The article concludes that for China to achieve its 2035 goals, it must maintain a high level of net fixed investment, while the US would need to find a way to cut China's level of net fixed capital investment in GDP to slow down its economy. However, the US lacks the military and economic leverage to force China to reduce its investment, and its tariffs and sanctions have had a marginal impact on China's economy. The article suggests that the US may attempt to persuade China to commit economic 'suicide' by promoting confused anti-Marxist economic ideas, but this is unlikely to be successful.
