**Tesla's Market Share Continues to Decline in France and EU**
Tesla's market share continues to decline in France and worldwide. In May, only 721 Tesla vehicles were registered in France, a 67% decrease from the same month last year, according to the French Automobile Platform (PFA). In the first five months of the year, Tesla's market share dropped from 2.14% to 1.23%. Guillaume Longeon, an automotive expert, explains that Tesla's lineup has become outdated, while new innovations have flooded the European market. Additionally, Elon Musk's past controversies, such as his 'salut nazi' gesture, and the increasing competition from Chinese hybrid car manufacturers have contributed to Tesla's decline. In the EU, Tesla's sales have decreased by 52.6% in the past year, and in France, the number of electric vehicle registrations has stagnated at 18% since January 2025, with 119,475 vehicles registered, 10,000 fewer than in 2024. According to the PFA, the French government's decision to cut its budget for electric vehicle incentives by three times has contributed to the decline in demand.

**Is Lucid Group Stock Your Ticket to Becoming a Millionaire? | The Motley Fool**
Lucid Group has the potential to become the next Tesla, with a market capitalization of $8 billion and a growth trajectory that could turn a small investment into millions of dollars. However, investors should be aware that starting an electric car company from scratch is incredibly difficult and requires patience. Tesla's history shows that high-growth stocks require extreme patience, even during periods of heavy growth. Lucid has been following Tesla's path for growth, selling luxury models and preparing to launch mass market vehicles in 2026. Analysts predict 73% sales growth this year and 96% sales growth in 2026. The company's long-term growth prospects are exciting, but investors should be prepared for a bumpy road forward, suitable for risk-tolerant, long-term investors only. As one analyst noted, 'The formula is to create impressive luxury vehicles to establish reputation and scale, and then move into the mass market to produce affordable models for millions of new buyers.'

**Prediction: Tesla Stock Is a Buy Before July 23 | The Motley Fool**
Tesla's stock has been volatile in 2025, but its growth story remains compelling. Two reasons to buy more shares before the next earnings call in late July are Tesla's capital advantages and its potential robotaxi business. Despite the challenges of bringing an electric vehicle to market, Tesla has a significant lead over its competitors, with a market cap of around $1 trillion. Famous tech investor Cathie Wood believes that Tesla's robotaxi service will 'proliferate' and achieve a stranglehold on the U.S. ride-hailing market, potentially sending Tesla's stock price nearly 1,000% higher. While Wood's optimistic timelines and projections are skeptical, the upside potential is clear, and Tesla's capital advantages will give it the time and funding necessary to bring this vision to fruition. Analysts think Tesla's robotaxi business could bring in $1.7 trillion by 2040, making Tesla's current market cap a relative bargain.

**Prediction: Tesla Stock Is a Buy Before July 23**
Despite concerns about Tesla's stock being overvalued, the electric vehicle company's growth story remains compelling. With a market cap of around $1 trillion, Tesla is the largest pure-play EV company in North America, far surpassing competitors Rivian and Lucid Group, which have a combined value of $30 billion. According to analysts, Tesla's heavy capital advantages allow it to think big and invest aggressively into new models and next-gen technologies, giving it a significant long-term growth potential. As one analyst noted, Tesla could raise $30 billion in new cash by diluting shareholders by just 2.5%, giving debt holders more confidence and lowering the cost of debt for the company. With less than 10% of vehicles on America's roads being electric, there's significantly more growth on the way for EV companies, making Tesla a buy before its next earnings call in late July.

**Tesla's Market Capitalization Falls Below $1 Trillion Amid European Sales Slump**

**Tesla's Stock Plummets as Musk's Politics Harm Sales**
Tesla's stock has plummeted by nearly 9% in recent days, bringing the company's market capitalization below the record $1 trillion mark. The decline is attributed to disappointing sales data in Europe, which has fueled concerns that Elon Musk's political activities are harming sales. In January, Tesla's European sales plummeted by 45% compared to the previous year, while overall electric vehicle sales in Europe increased by 37%. The stock has fallen by over 35% from its historic high of $480 on December 17, wiping out around $570 billion in market capitalization. Musk's repeated interventions in European politics and his role in the Trump administration have been criticized by some observers, who believe they are causing a negative reaction from consumers. Since Trump's inauguration on January 20, Tesla's stock has fallen by around 29% and $400 billion in capitalization. Analysts have revised their forecasts downward, with Ryan Brinkman of JP Morgan setting a new price target of $135, far below yesterday's closing price of $302. 'The biggest challenge for Tesla in 2025 is not technology, but public perception,' said Jacob Falkencrone, global head of investment strategy at Saxo Bank. 'Elon Musk is becoming a liability for sales, brand loyalty, and investor trust.' Tesla is facing intense pressure from multiple fronts, including a decline in new registrations in Europe, where sales fell by 45% in January. The company is also facing growing competition in the Chinese market, where new entrants like Byd, Li Auto, and Xpeng are gaining ground. Tesla is pinning its hopes on its robo-taxi and robo-humanoid Optimus projects, but it remains to be seen what will come of them.

**Tesla's stock slide drops its market cap under $1 trillion**
Tesla's stock has dropped 37% from its peak of $479.86 in mid-December, closing at $302.80 per share on Tuesday. This decline has pushed the company's market capitalization under $1 trillion. The drop is partly due to a 45% decline in Tesla's sales in Europe in January, as well as a decline in new vehicle registrations in California. Elon Musk's increased political visibility and alienating buyers have also contributed to the decline. Additionally, Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings fell below analysts' estimates, and deliveries narrowly missed the company's own targets for the year. The company is betting on a revamped Model Y SUV and interest in autonomous technology to keep investors happy.

**Tesla's Market Capitalization Falls Below $1 Trillion Amid Weak European Sales**
Tesla's market capitalization fell below $1 trillion for the first time in three months, as the company's stock price dropped 8.4% to $302.8, the lowest level since November 7. This decline is attributed to weak European sales, with new car registrations in Germany plummeting 60% in January, the largest drop among automakers selling over 1,000 vehicles in the country. Analysts are concerned about Elon Musk's increasing involvement in politics, but note that it's difficult to draw conclusions based on one month's data. They still believe that favorable changes in autonomous driving regulations could be a positive factor. Tesla also reported a decline in annual sales for the first time in nine years, with 1.788 million vehicles sold in 2024, compared to 1.808 million in 2023.

**Tesla's Market Capitalization Falls Below $1 Trillion Amid European Sales Slowdown**
Tesla's market capitalization fell below $1 trillion on February 25, 2025, due to a significant slowdown in sales in Europe. According to Bloomberg, the company's stock price dropped by 8.4% to $302.8, and the market capitalization decreased to $973.962 billion. The sales of Tesla in Europe in January fell by 45%, while the overall European market for electric vehicles grew by 37%, particularly in Germany and the UK. Tesla is changing its production lines for its best-selling Model Y, and Elon Musk has been criticizing the leadership of Germany, the UK, and Ukraine, while supporting far-right European parties. As a result, Tesla's sales in Germany were the worst since 2021, in France since 2022, and in the UK, the company lost to its Chinese competitor BYD. 'Tesla's ambitions in Europe are failing,' said Steve Man, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noting that the company is facing competition and scandals related to Elon Musk. The biggest problem for Tesla this year is not technology, but perception, according to Jacob Falkenkrone, a strategist at the Danish Saxo Bank. He believes that Musk's political activities are putting pressure on the company's sales, consumer loyalty to the brand, and consumer trust. In Germany, activists projected an image of Musk giving a Nazi salute, while in the US and the Netherlands, Tesla showrooms were vandalized, and dozens of stores were picketed.

**Tesla's market capitalisation slips below $1 trillion as Europe sales sink**
Tesla's market capitalization fell below $1 trillion on Tuesday due to a 6.2% drop in shares, amid reports of a 45% decline in European car sales. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that EV sales soared 37% overall, but Tesla's sales plummeted. Steve Man, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said, 'Tesla's European dreams are stalling out with January sales plummeting.' The decline in sales and Elon Musk's preoccupation with politics have overshadowed the company's ambitions to develop a fully self-driving car. Tesla shares are now the biggest decliner among mega-cap technology stocks, weighing heavily on the group's overall performance.
