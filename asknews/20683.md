**Yankees' Aaron Judge makes admission on 2024 World Series error against Dodgers**
New York Yankees' star Aaron Judge reflected on his error in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series, where he dropped a fly ball in center field, allowing the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the series in five games. When speaking to Bob Nightengale of USA Today, Judge acknowledged that the error is something he thinks about, but emphasized that it's baseball and mistakes happen. He noted, 'Stuff like that happens. I've just got to make the play. There were five other plays after that could have changed the course of that.' Judge demonstrated a professional mindset by dismissing the error and focusing on making the next play, saying, 'Once the play is over with, there's nothing you can do about it. Go out and make the next play. That's what it really all comes down to.'

**Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman Warns His Employees: 'AI Is Coming For Your Jobs. It's Coming From My Job Too. This Is A Wake Up Call' - Fiverr Intl (NYSE:FVRR)**
Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman warned his employees that AI is coming for their jobs, including his own. He encouraged them to automate repetitive tasks and focus on uniquely human strengths, such as non-linear thinking and judgment calls. Kaufman believes AI will force people to double down on their human capabilities, rather than erasing humanity from work. LinkedIn's Aneesh Raman also sounded the alarm, citing AI's replacement of entry-level jobs like junior software engineers and retail associates. Raman warned that college graduates are feeling the pressure hardest, with unemployment among them rising to 30% since 2022. He suggested that companies must rethink entry-level work and give new hires higher-level responsibilities, using AI to augment, not replace, them.

**Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman Warns His Employees: 'AI Is Coming For Your Jobs. It's Coming From My Job Too. This Is A Wake Up Call'**
Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman warned his employees that artificial intelligence (AI) is coming for their jobs, including his own. In a company-wide email, Kaufman wrote, 'AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it's coming for my job too. This is a wake-up call.' He encouraged employees to embrace AI as a tool to increase output and quality, saying it should feel like gaining 'superpowers.' Kaufman believes AI will force people to double down on their uniquely human strengths, rather than erasing humanity from work. He urged his team to automate 100% of their repetitive tasks, freeing up time for non-linear thinking, judgment calls, and other tasks that require human capabilities. This warning is echoed by others in the industry, including LinkedIn's Aneesh Raman, who wrote that AI is already replacing entry-level jobs like junior software engineers and retail associates. According to LinkedIn data, 40% of Gen Z workers would be willing to take a 2 to 5 percent pay cut for more advancement opportunities.

**Mandelson: Tariffs are just the beginning, AI is the key to the future**
Peter Mandelson, the British Ambassador to the US, has stated that tariffs are just the beginning. He believes that the Trump administration wants to go beyond trade and establish a technological alliance between the two countries. Mandelson, known as the 'Prince of Darkness', has been a key figure in promoting globalization and the US-led order. However, he now argues that the era of hyperglobalization is over and that the world is entering a new era of power, where national economies and protectionism are on the rise. He believes that China is a major threat and that the UK must reorganize its economy to defend itself. Mandelson sees artificial intelligence as a solution to the problems faced by Western societies and believes that the UK should focus on developing its AI capabilities, particularly in Silicon Valley. He also thinks that the new relationship between the UK and the US should be centered around AI and that it should be used to drive economic growth and improve public services. This new approach is a significant departure from Mandelson's previous views on globalization and highlights the changing landscape of international relations.

**Odyssey Develops AI Model for Interactive 3D Video Worlds**
Odyssey, a startup company specializing in artificial intelligence technology, has developed a new AI model that allows users to 'interact' with videos in real-time. According to TechCrunch, the company has released a 'beta version' of the AI model, which generates and broadcasts a new video frame every 40 milliseconds (equivalent to one-thousandth of a second). Through basic control tools, viewers can explore multiple areas within the video, similar to 3D video games. Odyssey stated, 'Considering the current state of the video world being broadcast and the next development, and recording the history of cases and events in the video, the model attempts to predict the expected shape of the video world.' This model relies on a new global model, which demonstrates capabilities such as generating realistic pixel units, maintaining spatial coherence, learning video actions, and producing and broadcasting cohesive videos for 5 minutes or more. Many startups and major tech companies, including DeepMind, World Lab, Microsoft, and Dicart, are working on developing AI models of the world. They believe that these models could be used to create interactive media, such as games and films, and to conduct realistic simulations of training environments for artificial intelligence systems. However, the opinions of creators are mixed, as a recent investigation by Wired revealed that game development studios, which have laid off dozens of employees, are using AI to reduce costs.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, including decision-making in offices, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that demographers are predicting a population collapse due to AI, and that the great cities of the world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to 100 million. He also notes that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, and suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing space may be a viable option to ensure humanity's survival.

**Odyssey Launches Interactive 3D World Generator Using AI**
Odyssey, a startup, has launched a test version of an interactive video technology generated entirely by artificial intelligence in real-time. The technology uses GPU H100 clusters in the US and Europe to generate new frames every 40 milliseconds based on user actions and frame history. In the demo version, several locations are available: a forest with a cabin, a shopping center, and a parking lot in front of a building. Each user input slightly changes the details of the world, but the image quality remains 'blurred, like in Google Street View.' Users control movement through the keyboard, and sometimes errors occur: for example, a fence can stop movement, while passing through a house is possible. If the user is inactive, the camera may randomly shift. The developers noted that improving image quality will take time, and problems with textures and sounds will be solved using neural network filters. Although the current version cannot replace video games or movies due to instability and distracting details, it demonstrates high potential.

**An AI Identifies Where All Those Planets That Could Host Life Are Hiding**
Researchers in Switzerland have developed an AI model that can identify potentially habitable worlds that are hiding from view. The model, which achieved a precision value of up to 0.99 in simulations, suggests that nearly four dozen systems with at least one known planet and a G-type, K-type, or M-type star may harbor an Earth-like world. According to the researchers, the strongest indicators of an Earth-like planet are its mass and orbital period, particularly in the system's innermost detectable planet. As Dr. Landymore noted, 'anything to narrow down astronomers' hunt for Earth's cousins through the unfathomably vast cosmos could be a gamechanger.'

**Deathenomics to drive the new AI world order - Asia Times**
The economist Paul Samuelson noted that the Second World War was the 'economists war.' The US came to realize that economic planning, the role of the Federal Reserve and mobilization of the civilian sector were crucial in times of war. The article argues that the increasing mobilization of resources (both natural and human) has led to the idea of the 'zero-sum' concept of winners and losers. The emphasis in mercantilism is the feature of one or two 'hegemonic' powers. The world has changed for a few dollars more, with the fiat currency of the dollar replacing gold. Hegemony is policed through global payment systems, sanctions, etc. The implementation of geoeconomics, and the need to establish hegemony leads to inevitable conflict. This is endemic to the 'third revolution', that of technology. The move towards automation and AI means that labor as the predominant factor in capital creation will be overtaken by technology and automation. This will heap pressure on the rate of return on capital and profits. The new world order rests on the diminishing importance of labor as seen in its traditional mode. Robotics and AI will replace human labor. Elon Musk estimates there will be demand for 20 billion robots, considering a one-off price of US$20,000-30,000 per unit. This is a win-win for capital. However, what of labor? The future will abandon labor in all areas such as administration, retail, nurses and even agriculture. The problem with Keynesian 'Deathenomics' is that it will ultimately eradicate the consumer. The laborer was traditionally a consumer. The future of this new world will mean a dichotomy between tech/machine-owning elites and a surplus lumpen proletariat. In a world where surplus value of the worker is eliminated, value is replaced by machines. Human beings will thus become dependent on the state for sustenance.

**Netflix brought back A Different World of AI-upscaled nightmare fuel**
The Netflix version of the 1980s sitcom A Different World has been criticized for its poor AI upscaling, resulting in distorted faces, garbled text, and misshapen backgrounds. Developer Scott Hanselman explained, 'You can make one blurry pixel into four pixels, or four pixels into sixteen pixels but you gotta have that information come from somewhere.' The issues have not arisen on other platforms that support the show's original 4:3 format, leading to speculation that the problem lies with the licensing rights holder, Carsey-Werner. Netflix has been reached out to for clarification, but the company's quality control checks have been called into question. This comes as Netflix faces criticism for its use of AI in other areas, including reproducing the voice of murdered influencer Gabby Petito and broadcasting a true crime documentary with AI-generated images.

**Open Worlds 2025: Finally Asking the Why**
The gaming industry is at a turning point with open-world games, shifting away from overcrowded maps, collectible quests, and checklists towards more organic and realistic worlds. GTA 6 is expected to set new trends, and AI could potentially aid in building immersive worlds like Kingdom Come 2. Developers should focus on the 'why' behind creating open worlds, rather than just the 'how'. Fritz wonders why developers rarely ask themselves 'why' when building worlds, citing Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 as an example of the importance of this question. The discussion also touches on the possibility of creating a world that reacts to player activities, essentially an open world with an open story.

**‘AI and the Human Future’ presented at Marshalltown Public Library**
Scott Samuelson, a philosopher from Iowa State University, presented a thought-provoking program at the Marshalltown Public Library on the topic of 'AI and the Human Future.' He discussed the ethical, moral, political, and environmental concerns related to artificial intelligence. Samuelson highlighted three AI roads: substitution, collaboration, and certified organic, and posed big questions such as who we are, what we care about, and how we can reinvent ourselves and our institutions to focus on what matters. He also discussed the limitations of AI, including its lack of common sense, creativity, and emotional intelligence, and the risks of over-trust in AI, deskilling, and mass unemployment. Additionally, Samuelson touched on the environmental concerns of AI, including resource depletion, and the question of who should control our data. He ended the presentation by endorsing the humanities and emphasizing the importance of not allowing AI to take our humanity away. 'We still need arts and crafts, we still need deep connection, to the world and to each other,' Samuelson said.
