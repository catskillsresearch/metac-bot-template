Johan Hansen, a Danish handball player and multiple-time world champion, is returning to Denmark after five years abroad and will play for Skanderborg AGF (SAH) in the Danish handball league. Hansen has signed a three-year contract with the club. According to SAH's director, Mads Lind, 'At byde en spiller med Johans internationale og landsholdserfaring velkommen til SAH er intet mindre end en milepæl i klubbens historie. Han bringer både verdensklasse på banen og en stærk kultur uden for den.' Hansen has previously played in the Bundesliga for Hannover-Burgdorf and Flensburg-Handewitt, but chose to return to SAH because 'den samlede pakke var rigtig god.' Hansen's ambition is to 'skabe betingelserne for, at SAH kan tage det næste skridt' and help the club take the next step in its development.

Safonov has been included in the final squad for Russia's games in June. 'It was a great day,' Safonov might say, but for now, he's focusing on his national team duties.

**Retiree Wins Lawsuit Against Conafer for Unauthorized INSS Deductions**
A 65-year-old woman from Independência, Ceará, won a lawsuit against the Conafer (Confederação Nacional dos Agricultores Familiares) after being charged with unauthorized deductions from her INSS benefit. The woman claimed she never authorized the monthly fees linked to Conafer, which appeared as 'contribution' on her previdenciário benefit. Despite being sued, Conafer failed to provide any proof of authorization or service contract. The judge ruled that there was no legal relationship between the parties and ordered the return of double the amount charged, totaling R$ 1,633.48. Additionally, the court recognized the moral damage caused by the repeated deductions and awarded R$ 1,000 in damages. The sentence highlighted the woman's vulnerability and criticized Conafer's lack of transparency.

**Delacroix leads the way as 20 remain in Derby contention**
The 2025 Betfred Derby at Epsom has confirmed 20 contenders, led by Ante-post favourite Delacroix. Trained by Aidan O'Brien, Delacroix has won two spring Derby trials and finished second in last year's Futurity Trophy. He is one of four contenders from Ballydoyle. Other notable entries include Ruling Court, Pride Of Arras, and New Ground, who has been supplemented at a cost of £75,000. Juddmonte's European racing manager Barry Mahon said, 'His form is good and we think he is crying out for a mile and a half. We could have taken him to Chantilly, but decided to wait to go to Epsom. He's in great form.' The field also includes Midak, trained by Francis Graffard, who will carry the colours of the Aga Khan Studs.

**'Setback, not a defeat': Non-confidence vote falls short of ousting youth soccer club's board**
A non-confidence vote at a special meeting of Airdrie's youth soccer club, ADSA, fell short of ousting the board of directors. Despite a narrow majority of 138 attendees (52%) voting in favor of the motion, the tally fell short of the 75% threshold required for removal. Kris Hanson, a parent and coach involved in the non-confidence campaign, described the outcome as a 'setback, not a defeat.' The parents' grievances with the current board included alleged conflicts of interest, lack of transparency, poor fiscal management, and poor communication. ADSA president Keith Mills welcomed the opportunity to discuss parents' concerns and noted that the board will set an annual general meeting date in the coming months. Hanson suggested that the parents behind the attempt may use the upcoming AGM as another opportunity to shake up the board, stating, 'We're definitely not stopping the fight.'

**Barnett's Origin fitness clouded as Warriors top Souths**
The Warriors hope Mitchell Barnett has avoided a serious knee injury after he limped off in their 36-30 win over South Sydney. Barnett, a NSW State of Origin prop, will undergo scans on Monday to determine the extent of the injury. Warriors coach Andrew Webster said, 'He's done a knee injury of some description, but we're waiting for scans. We honestly don't know what it is at the moment.' Meanwhile, Stefano Utoikamanu's back-up front-rower for the series opener, Keaon Koloamatangi, made his case in Souths' loss, running 189m and scoring the Rabbitohs' first try. Souths coach Wayne Bennett said, 'Keaon's numbers are great, and he is playing a full 80 minutes. He is not even looking to be brought off the ground. That is the remarkable thing at the moment.' The Warriors' win keeps them deeply entrenched in the top four at the halfway mark of the season, with a 5-1 record for games in Australia.

**Robin Gosens' Peculiar Interview: 'I Feel Like Kordula'**
Before the Champions League final, German national team player Robin Gosens gave his assessment of the game in an interview with ZDF. The interview started in a peculiar way, with Gosens joking about the weather conditions in Herzogenaurach, where he was being interviewed remotely from the DFB camp. When asked if the weather was good, Gosens replied, 'I feel like Kordula, the crazy reporter from Benjamin, but I'm doing okay.' He was actually referring to Karla Kolumna, a journalist in the children's series 'Benjamin Blümchen.' Gosens then discussed the dramatic loss of Inter against Manchester City in the previous year's final, saying, 'It's very high praise when you see that almost the same team is on the field, the one that played in the final two years ago. It means everything to the team.' He expressed his hope that the team would win the title this time. Gosens is currently enjoying being back with the DFB team, saying, 'Even though the weather is a bit poor right now,' he's happy to be back with the team and hopes that not only Inter but also Germany will win the title.

**Is Culture Degeneration Biological or Ideological?**
Robin Hanson argues that cultural decay is a biological response to a lack of threats to species survival, rather than an ideological issue. He claims that humans have evolved to prioritize status recognition, which has led to the importance of educational attainment as a status marker. However, this has resulted in lower fertility rates, as people prioritize wealth and education over having children. Hanson also notes that the 'massification' of cultures, where smaller cultural units are absorbed into larger ones, has led to a loss of traditional structures and values. He believes that this process is a consequence of inflationism, which erodes the value and distinctiveness of individuals. In contrast, Misesians argue that human action and culture originate from the human mind, not from materialistic processes. They believe that the differing fertility choices made by couples are driven by their unique ideas and values, and that external forces like central bank-imposed fiat inflation can lead to a 'massification' of attitudes and cultural degeneration.

**Novo party demands data on INSS judicial processes**
The Novo party has filed a request with the Advocacia-Geral da União (AGU) for data on judicial processes involving the Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social (INSS) over the past 10 years. The move comes as the government of President Lula faces criticism over the scandal of unauthorized deductions from pension and retirement benefits. The party aims to make public the extent of the irregularities. According to Adriana Ventura, 'The unauthorized deductions in consigned loans represent another chapter in the absurdities that have been revealed, further tarnishing the image of the government and the INSS. That's why we also want to oversee how the judicial processes on unauthorized deductions from retirees have progressed.' The party has also sent a request for information to the Minister of Previdência, Wolney Queiroz, seeking data on judicial processes against the INSS.

**'Playing chess': Drug Lord's Aussie taunt**
Owen 'O Dog' Hanson, a former US college athlete turned Sydney cocaine kingpin, has revealed how he 'played chess' to avoid a potential life sentence in Australia. Hanson, who played American football for the University of Southern California, was arrested in 2015 and sentenced to 21 years in a US federal prison. He claimed to have cooperated with authorities by naming one person involved in cocaine supply in Sydney, Raphael Joseph, who was already dead by the time Australian cops came asking in 2017. Hanson said he told police Joseph was introduced to him by a figure from a Mexican cartel who was using the American as a Sydney plant for a cocaine trafficking operation. Hanson has openly declared he's in the clear from Australian authorities and claimed a NSW prosecutor even urged a US judge to reduce his sentence. He has also been preparing his best friend, Matthew Bowyer, for a potential stint in federal prison after he was caught up in a federal probe into illegal gambling. Bowyer has pleaded guilty to running sports betting books in Las Vegas and California, where it is illegal. Hanson and Bowyer have regularly appeared on each other's social media pages, which feature highly-stylised videos about their colourful pasts. Hanson said he saw the opportunity to give evidence at a lawyer's NSW District Court trial as a form of pay back against the 'dodgy' lawyer he had put his trust in. 'You call it ratting, you call it playing chequers or you call it playing chess. I was playing chess,' Hanson said on Fresh Out. 'At the end of the day, I ain't no sucker. I went to USC. I'm a businessman.'

**Victor Davis Hanson on The Tyrants Running America**
Democratic attorneys general are preparing for a potential second Trump administration by mapping out an aggressive legal strategy to fight him in court. They are identifying staff members and states best equipped to lead cases, particularly on issues like reproductive health, immigration, and the environment. According to Nolette, 'We're in a situation where AGs are primed and ready to go, and are much more proactive in challenging [the federal government].' Victor Davis Hanson has criticized the judiciary's role in delaying Trump's administration, saying, 'It's sort of delay, delay, delay, eat up a year of the Trump administration.' He argues that the judiciary has become too powerful, with ultra-liberal judges becoming 'the most powerful people in the United States' without being elected. The article notes that since Trump's return to office, there have been 120 lawsuits targeting executive orders and actions, resulting in 30 nationwide injunctions.

**Nebraska AG Hilgers says Delta-8 lawsuits to get costlier, prosecutions coming • Nebraska Examiner**
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers announced that he will no longer negotiate with retailers selling Delta-8 products, a synthetic version of THC, and will instead pursue lawsuits and criminal prosecutions. Hilgers claims that Delta-8 is a dangerous and unregulated drug, and that retailers are breaking state law by selling it. He has sent letters to 35-37 owners of 104 stores in the Omaha area demanding that they remove the products from their shelves, and has threatened to sue for maximum penalties if they do not comply. Hilgers also stated that his office will refer any relevant investigative reports to local county attorneys for the filing of possible criminal charges. Some retailers have argued that the sale of Delta-8 is allowed under the 2018 Farm Bill, but Hilgers claims that it is a loophole that needs to be closed. He is pushing for legislation to explicitly ban the sale of Delta-8 products, and has filed 15 lawsuits against retailers who have allegedly violated state consumer protection laws. Hilgers acknowledged that he has no local data on injuries or deaths from Delta-8, but is relying on national data to support his claims. Douglas County Sheriff Aaron Hanson also spoke out against Delta-8, stating that it is an industry that cannot be trusted and that it puts people at risk.

**Davison, Hanson county boards approve forming ambulance district, setting up April 1 special election**
The Davison and Hanson county commissions voted unanimously to form an ambulance district, paving the way for a special election on April 1. The district would provide paramedic coverage to over 900 square miles around Mitchell, including rural areas and small communities. A tax increase of $102 to $118 annually on a $300,000 valuation is estimated, but would ultimately be decided by the seven-person board. Without the district, Mitchell's personnel would be stretched too thin to cover EMS calls in outlying areas. Amy Storm, a part-time ambulance worker and volunteer EMT, said it would be a 'gut punch' if Mitchell EMS stops answering calls in rural Davison and Hanson county. Mitchell Fire and EMS Chief Dan Pollreisz said the estimated expense of $700,000 for additional paramedics is a budget-friendly option compared to starting a small town's own ambulance service. 'It's an extraordinary amount of money,' he said. 'Mitchell will still maintain a deficit to run its EMS. … If this passes, we can continue to respond. We will do everything we can to keep you alive.'
