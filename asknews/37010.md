**China Sees Uptick in COVID-19 Cases, XDV Variant Dominates**
China has seen a recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, with many regions reporting an increase in positive rates. According to the China CDC, the national acute respiratory infection sentinel monitoring situation from April 3-5 showed that the positive rate of new coronavirus detection was on the rise, with southern provinces having higher rates than northern provinces. The positive rate of new coronavirus detection in emergency department influenza-like cases rose from 7.5% in the 14th week to 16.2% in the 18th week, and the positive rate of severe acute respiratory infection cases rose from 3.3% in the 14th week to 6.3% in the 18th week. The Hong Kong government's health department also reported an increase in COVID-19 cases, with a positive rate of 8.21% as of April 19, up from 1.71% four weeks prior. The number of new COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong increased by 134 in the week of April 27-May 3, with 31 severe and fatal cases reported. In Macau, the positive rate of influenza-like patients testing positive for COVID-19 has been rising since late February, peaking at 44.3% in mid-March and then declining, but has recently shown a slight increase, with positive rates of 12%, 17%, and 11% in the 17th, 18th, and 19th weeks, respectively. The current outbreak is primarily caused by the XDV variant, which was first reported by the China CDC in May 2024 and has been the dominant strain since July 2024.

**COVID-19 Cases on the Rise in Asia, with Hong Kong and China Taking Precautions**
According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 detection rate has been rising since April, with southern provinces having a higher detection rate than northern provinces. Hong Kong has started administering vaccines against the JN.1 strain. The CDC predicts that the domestic COVID-19 epidemic will continue to rise, but the likelihood of a large-scale outbreak is low. The CDC stated that the current COVID-19 infection situation in China has a small upward trend, but remains at a low level of transmission. Based on multi-channel monitoring data, it is expected that the epidemic will continue to rise in the near future, but the fluctuations in April and May will not exceed those seen in the summer of 2024, and the likelihood of a large-scale outbreak is low. In Hong Kong, the Department of Health's Centre for Health Protection reported two severe cases of COVID-19 in children. A 17-month-old girl was critically ill after being infected with COVID-19, adenovirus, and rhinovirus simultaneously, while a 13-year-old girl was severely ill with pneumonia caused by COVID-19. Since mid-March, the activity of COVID-19 in the Hong Kong community has continued to rise, with sewage monitoring data showing an upward trend in the prevalence of XDV, which is related to JN.1. However, the current COVID-19 vaccine used in Hong Kong is still effective in preventing the disease.

**Hong Kong's COVID-19 Activity Level Reaches New High**
Hong Kong's COVID-19 activity level has reached a new high, with 81 severe cases reported in adults over the past four weeks, including 30 deaths. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) has urged the public to be vigilant and take personal protective measures, including getting vaccinated as soon as possible. High-risk individuals, particularly the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, are advised to get vaccinated with the additional booster dose to reduce the risk of severe illness and death. According to the latest monitoring data, the number of COVID-19 cases in wastewater, the positivity rate of respiratory samples, and the number of new nucleic acid tests have all increased over the past four weeks. The CHP expects the COVID-19 activity level to remain high for several weeks. Centre Director Dr. Lo Ka-chun said that the data shows that Hong Kong has experienced two periods of high COVID-19 activity, one from April to July 2023 and another from February to March last year. The virus became more active in mid-April this year, and based on past data, the CHP predicts that the activity level will remain high for at least several weeks. Dr. Lo Ka-chun emphasized that even healthy children can develop severe symptoms after contracting COVID-19, and he urged parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as possible. The Centre is concerned that the vaccination rate for high-risk groups, particularly the elderly, is low, and Dr. Lo Ka-chun urged them to get vaccinated with the additional booster dose as soon as possible. The Centre also noted that the current dominant COVID-19 variant, XDV, is related to JN.1, and the JN.1 vaccine used in Hong Kong is effective in preventing severe illness and death, and boosting herd immunity.

**COVID-19 Cases Reach New High in Hong Kong**
The COVID-19 virus has reached a new high in a year, with 18 cases of severe illness and death reported last week. According to the Centre for Health Protection, the virus is still active and some monitoring indicators have exceeded the highest level of the past year. Centre Director Dr. Xu Lok-kin said, 'Based on past data, we predict that the COVID-19 activity level will remain at a relatively high level for at least the next few weeks.' The Centre noted that after the pandemic, Hong Kong experiences a new COVID-19 active cycle every 6-9 months. The virus has evolved into a seasonal disease. In 2024, the dominant strain in Hong Kong changed from XBB to JN.1, then to KP.2 and KP.3 in the third quarter, and finally to XDV in late March this year. There is currently no evidence that XDV will cause more severe illness. Dr. Xu added that the COVID-19 virus strain is constantly changing and cannot be taken lightly. The Centre will continue to closely monitor the situation and take precautions against the emergence of more virulent or vaccine-mismatched strains, as recommended by the World Health Organization.

**COVID-19 Cases on the Rise, but Severity Decreasing, Says Dr. Liu Yulong**
According to the Centre for Health Protection, the number of COVID-19 cases has been increasing over the past two weeks, with some monitoring indicators, such as the positive rate of respiratory samples and the amount of viruses in wastewater, exceeding the highest levels in the past 52 weeks. Dr. Liu Yulong, chairman of the Vaccine Preventable Diseases Scientific Committee and professor at the Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said that although the spread of COVID-19 has increased compared to the peak period last year, the number of severe cases has decreased, and the impact on society is becoming lighter. Dr. Liu Yulong stated, 'The current trend of COVID-19 cases is increasing, and according to the data from the Centre for Health Protection, the average amount of COVID-19 virus in wastewater per liter is around 700,000 copies, which is higher than the 400,000 copies in March 2024, indicating that the virus is spreading more than it was during the peak period in 2024.' Dr. Liu Yulong explained that the severity of COVID-19 is decreasing over time, and people have the opportunity to be infected multiple times. He emphasized that it is essential to let the most vulnerable groups, including the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, receive vaccinations to boost their antibodies and prevent the spread of the virus. He also pointed out that the body's memory cells, particularly T cells, learn to defend against new variants of the virus with each infection, making the symptoms of the disease milder over time. Dr. Liu Yulong advised that healthy citizens can now go out without wearing masks, but vulnerable individuals should wear masks when using public transportation and maintain good hygiene practices, such as using handkerchiefs or paper tissues when coughing and not touching their noses with their hands. He warned that the risk of infection is high, saying, 'No matter if it's the flu, COVID-19, or other viruses, we're on the edge of a cliff, and if we're not careful, we'll fall.'

**COVID-19: Dr. Liu Yulong says the virus's impact on society is becoming lighter**
According to Dr. Liu Yulong, the chair of the Joint Scientific Committee and a professor at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, the COVID-19 virus is more active in the community than it was during the peak last year, but the number of severe cases is lower. He believes that the virus's impact on society is becoming lighter. Dr. Liu said that healthy citizens no longer need to wear masks when going out, and while he recommends that high-risk individuals consider getting vaccinated, he emphasizes that it's a personal decision. He also joked that people can go out more and 'struggle to make a living' without worrying about the virus. Dr. Liu noted that the virus's social transmission is higher than last year, but the number of severe cases is lower. He believes that the virus's impact on society will continue to decrease in the next two years, similar to other coronaviruses. He also emphasized that healthy citizens can go out without masks, but should wear them when they have symptoms and take personal hygiene precautions to protect themselves and others. '脆弱人群' should take extra precautions to protect themselves. Dr. Liu also mentioned that the current variant of the virus is a branch of Omicron, and it's unlikely to escape the human immune system without significant mutation. He expects the virus's impact on society to continue to decrease in the next two years. He also recommended that high-risk individuals, such as those with immunodeficiency, cancer, or kidney failure, get vaccinated every six months to protect themselves. However, he emphasized that whether or not to get vaccinated is a personal decision. He also noted that there have been cases of children being infected with multiple viruses, leading to severe symptoms, and that this is not a new phenomenon, but rather a result of increased detection methods. He also mentioned that some rare conditions, such as brain damage, may be related to congenital immunodeficiency.

**WHO Recommends Targeted Measures to Prevent Spread of MERS**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) after nine new cases were reported, resulting in two deaths. According to the United Nations Information Center, the WHO stated that the reporting of these cases does not change its overall risk assessment, which remains moderate at the global and regional levels. The cases show that the virus causing MERS still poses a threat in countries where it is prevalent among camels and can be transmitted to humans. MERS is a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus, which can be transmitted to humans through direct or indirect contact with infected camels. The virus can also be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets, especially in close proximity. The mortality rate among confirmed cases is approximately 36%, but the WHO notes that this may be an overestimation, as mild cases are often not detected. The WHO has taken several measures to prevent and control the spread of the disease, including close monitoring, testing, and raising public health awareness. As of April 21, 2025, a total of 2,627 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the WHO, including 946 deaths. The WHO does not recommend conducting special tests at entry points and does not currently advise implementing any travel or trade restrictions. 'We are closely monitoring the situation and will take further action if necessary,' said the WHO. 'The risk of transmission remains low, but we must remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the disease.'

**New Coronavirus Raises Concerns of Deadly Pandemic**
Scientists have discovered a new coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, which is capable of infecting humans and has a high potential to cause a deadly pandemic. The virus, found in bats, has a mortality rate similar to MERS, which is around 33.3%. This discovery has sparked concerns about a possible pandemic and has raised questions about the accuracy of Nostradamus' 2025 prophecy, which stated that 'a great plague from the past is returning, and there is no more deadly enemy under the sky.' Shi Zhengli, a virologist from the Wuhan Virology Institute, said, 'The virus has a high risk of transmission to humans, either directly or through intermediate hosts.' The scientists are warning that the virus may be difficult to contain due to its ability to infect human cells, similar to Covid-19. As of now, there is no vaccine or effective treatment for HKU5-CoV-2.

**New Coronavirus HKU5-CoV-2: A Potential Pandemic Looms**
Scientists have discovered a new coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, which is believed to be 10 times more deadly than Covid-19. The virus, found in bats, can infect human cells in the same way as Covid-19, but its similarity to MERS, which has a 33.3% mortality rate, is a major concern. The possibility of a new pandemic is being taken seriously, with experts warning that the virus could cause a major health crisis if it spreads to humans. Nostradamus had predicted in 2025 that England would be plagued by great wars and a return of an old plague, saying 'A great plague from the past will return, and no enemy in the sky will be more deadly.' The discovery of HKU5-CoV-2 has raised concerns about a potential pandemic, with scientists urging early precautions to be taken. Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment available for HKU5-CoV-2, and experts warn that the virus could mutate and spread easily among humans if not addressed promptly.

**New Coronavirus Variant HKU5-CoV-2: No Immediate Threat to Humans, Says Virologist**
Recently, the HKU5-CoV-2 virus was discovered in bats in Hong Kong. According to Dr. Sergey Netesov, a renowned virologist, the virus does not currently pose a threat to humans. 'After studying the primary sources, I can say that the discovery of the HKU5-CoV-2 virus, a variant of the HKU5 virus, is an interesting fact, but the virus does not currently pose a visible threat to humans,' Netesov said. The HKU5 virus was first identified in China in bats in 2006. According to recent studies published in the Cell and Nature journals, one of its variants has a region in the S protein that binds to the same human cell receptors as the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. However, the virus has not yet caused any human diseases, despite having the potential to do so. Netesov noted that such a possibility exists for almost any animal virus. He also observed that the peak of influenza cases this year appears to be delayed by several weeks compared to last year, which he attributes to the 'anomalously warm winter' and the large number of vaccinations administered in the summer and fall of 2024. According to the press service of the Rospotrebnadzor's Novosibirsk region office, there has been a slight increase in the number of cases of influenza and respiratory viral infections in the region as of the seventh week of 2025.

**New Coronavirus in China: Can HKU5-CoV-2 Cause Another Pandemic?**
Scientists in China have identified a new coronavirus, named HKU5-CoV-2, in bats, according to a study published in ScienceDirect. The study, led by Shi Zengli, a scientist who also worked at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, suggests that the virus can be hosted in bats, which were previously identified as possible carriers of SARS-CoV-2 that infected humans and triggered a pandemic in late 2019. The new coronavirus has the potential to infect humans and other mammals, as it can adhere to ACE2 receptors in cells, similar to the COVID-19 virus at the beginning of an infectious episode. Scientists consider it possible that the virus can be transmitted to humans through an intermediate host. The study suggests that the new coronavirus has a lower efficiency in infecting living beings compared to SARS-CoV-2. The potential for a pandemic cannot be ruled out, as this new coronavirus belongs to the same family as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which is considered a pandemic-capable pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO). Experts recommend strengthening epidemiological surveillance to prevent future outbreaks and a new pandemic. There are currently no confirmed cases of the HKU5-CoV-2 virus in humans. The announcement of this new coronavirus has caused an increase in the stock prices of some vaccine manufacturers, such as Moderna (6.6%) and Novavax (7.8%). The discovery was made in a laboratory. The COVID-19 pandemic caused 6,881,955 deaths, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University until October 2023, in addition to over 676 million cases, which is equivalent to 5.2 times the population of Mexico (estimated at 130 million inhabitants).

**New Coronavirus HKU5-CoV-2: A Potential Threat to Humans?**
Scientists in China have identified a new coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, that infects bats and can also infect humans, sparking new concerns about the spread of the disease in the future. According to experts, HKU5-CoV-2 is a part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. It was first found in bats in Hong Kong and has now been identified as a new strain that can bind to human cells. The virus can also bind to cells of different animals, increasing the chances of transmission between species. However, a report in the South China Morning Post states that according to scientists, the virus's ability to infect humans is much weaker compared to the coronavirus. There are hundreds of coronaviruses in various categories, with only a few, including SARS, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, infecting humans. Experts around the world say that while a new virus can infect human cells, there is a need to remain vigilant, despite claims that it does not seem as threatening as the new coronavirus. Researchers say that although the risk of its spread is considered low, viruses like this can evolve over time. A study noted that 'although there is a potential risk, there is no need to panic.' 'The structural and functional analysis indicates that HKU5-CoV-2 has a better adaptation to human ACE2 than the HKU5-CoV-1 strain. Human cells expressing ACE2 infected with HKU5-CoV-2 and human respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues.' This study reveals a unique strain of HKU5-CoVs in bats that uses human ACE2 efficiently and highlights its potential animal risks.

**New Bat Coronavirus Identified with Potential Human Infection Risk**
A team of Chinese researchers, led by virologist Shi Zhengli, has discovered a new bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, which has the potential to infect humans through the same receptor used by the virus responsible for COVID-19. The study, published in the journal Cell, has raised concerns about the potential for human transmission, with some experts warning against alarmist reactions. While there are currently no reported cases of HKU5-CoV-2 infections in humans, laboratory tests indicate that the virus can infiltrate human cells in a manner similar to SARS-CoV-2. The new virus is believed to be linked to minks and pangolins, which were previously suspected as intermediate hosts that facilitated the transmission of COVID-19 from bats to humans. Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease specialist, stated that public immunity to SARS-related viruses has increased since 2019, and that the fears sparked by the study are 'overblown'. However, the stock market has reacted negatively to the news, with pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer and Moderna experiencing a surge in stocks, while the broader stock market saw sharp declines. Economists have cautioned that market instability could be linked to inflation concerns and potential tariffs proposed by President Donald Trump. Inflation in January reached 3.0%, the highest since June of the previous year, with the 2024 average standing at 2.9%.

**New Coronavirus Strain HKU5-CoV-2 Discovered in China: Expert Weighs in on the Threat**
Scientists in China have discovered a new strain of coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, in an exotic species of bats, the Japanese pygmy flying fox, in Hong Kong. According to virologists, there is no risk of a new wave of coronavirus spread, but further research is needed to confirm this. Dr. Alexei Agranovskiy, a professor of virology at Moscow State University, explains that the virus is a potential threat and should be studied by experts. 'This virus is one of the subvariants of HKU5, a coronavirus found in bats. It has naturally mutated to bind to the human ACE2 receptor, and it can infect human cells in a petri dish. However, there are no natural infections in humans yet. For experts, it is an interesting case that requires further study.' Agranovskiy notes that there is no need to panic about the new strain, as it is not a cause for a new pandemic: 'In virus research, there are moments when we need to sound the alarm and warn people. This is not the case. HKU5-CoV-2 is not an immediate threat. We are studying it, and it is already known.' Agranovskiy also explains that the virus's ability to cause an outbreak or epidemic is not solely dependent on its ability to bind to the human ACE2 receptor, but also on other properties: 'There are other coronaviruses that can use the human ACE2 receptor, some of which cause severe infections like atypical pneumonia and COVID-19. In the Netherlands in 2004, a coronavirus was discovered that causes a relatively mild infection like the common cold. We know nothing about HKU5-CoV-2 in this regard. Research is ongoing, and experts are working on it, but there is no need for the general public to be alarmed.'
