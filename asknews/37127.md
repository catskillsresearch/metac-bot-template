**Asia-Pacific Ignites 2025 Travel Fever**
The Asia-Pacific region is experiencing a surge in travel, with eight of the world's 15 fastest-growing summer destinations located there, according to a new Mastercard Economics Institute report. Tokyo and Osaka in Japan, and Nha Trang in Vietnam, are leading the charge, with Nha Trang making its debut on the list due to its white-sand beaches, nightlife, and social-media-ready scenery. The report attributes Nha Trang's surge to travelers' growing appetite for authentic coastal escapes and social-media-ready scenery. Japan's appeal has been super-charged by a weak yen, which has led to a 1.5 percent jump in visitors from China for every 1 percent depreciation of the yen against the Chinese yuan. China and India continue to shape regional flows, with China favoring visa-friendly neighbors such as Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore, and Indian travelers fanning out to Abu Dhabi, Hanoi, and Bali on the back of new direct flights and a booming middle class. The report argues that purpose-driven travel, prioritizing dining, wellness, and nature motifs, is no fleeting fad, but rather a deeper desire to nourish both body and spirit.

**Bremen Airport's New Summer Flight Plan 2025: More Destinations and Frequencies**
The new summer flight plan 2025 for Bremen Airport is now available, with 14 airlines offering direct flights to 20 international and 3 national destinations. Passengers can reach numerous destinations in Europe and around the world with just one connection.

**Weakness of Japanese yen ‘a major issue’ for NMI tourism**
The weakness of the Japanese yen is a major issue for the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI) tourism industry, according to Yu Ishida of the Marianas Visitors Authority's Japan office. Ishida stated that while the number of Japanese international travelers is increasing, most prefer non-U.S dollar destinations due to the current exchange rate. In 2023, 7,762 Japanese travelers visited the CNMI, compared to 13,779 in 2024, with the majority of the increase attributed to cruise ship arrivals. Ishida emphasized that the CNMI still has a chance to attract Japanese tourists due to its special ties with Japan. However, he noted that the decline in the number of experienced and mid-level tourism staff familiar with the Marianas, as well as the decline in service levels among operators, are significant challenges. Ishida also mentioned that the communication between Japanese travel agencies and local operators has disappeared over the past 10 years. To revive the Japan market, Ishida said United Airlines has started a digital advertising campaign for its Narita-Saipan route, and MVA Japan's office has formed strategic partnerships with travel agencies, resulting in scheduled visits of two high school groups this year.
