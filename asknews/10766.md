**Visa-Free Travel for Russians in 2025: Where to Go and What to Consider**
Roman Garayev, a candidate of economic sciences and head of the hospitality and tourism management department at the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, has outlined the countries where Russian tourists can travel without a visa in 2025. These include Turkey, Thailand, UAE, Serbia, Montenegro, Israel, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea (up to 60 days), and the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union - Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan. Additionally, Russians can enter Abkhazia and South Ossetia without a visa. Some countries allow visa-free entry under certain conditions, such as Egypt (15 days for Red Sea resorts), Indonesia (30 days), the Dominican Republic (tourist card upon arrival), and Mexico (electronic permit for short-term visits). However, most European countries, including the Schengen area, the UK, and the US, still require a visa. Garayev notes that visa requirements can change, and it's essential to check the official websites of embassies for the latest information. Some countries have introduced electronic visas, such as India, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka, which simplifies the process. Garayev also highlights the changes in visa rules for Russians over the past two years, with some countries easing entry requirements and others tightening them.

**Russia to Establish Material-Technical Base for Black Sea Fleet in Abkhazia**
According to Abkhazian President Bada Gumba, a material-technical base for the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Navy will be established in the area of the city of Ochamchira in Abkhazia. As Gumba stated, 'There is no plan to create a Russian naval base as such, but a material-technical base for the Black Sea Fleet is planned to be opened in the Ochamchira area.' The president emphasized that this project will also continue to strengthen cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the field of defense. This comes after Bellingcat published photos of the construction of the Ochamchira port, where the Russian base is reportedly to be located.

**Russia's Summer Tourism Boom: Vietnam, China, and Africa Lead the Way**
According to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia (ATOR), 6.4 million Russians are expected to travel abroad this summer, a 25% increase from last year's 5.15 million. The growth in tourism is attributed to several factors, including a stronger ruble and cheaper air travel to many destinations. The most popular tourist destinations this summer are: Vietnam (a 2.5-fold increase in demand), China (a 25% increase in demand), Egypt (due to the expansion of flight programs), Turkey, and Abkhazia. Other countries gaining popularity include Malaysia, Morocco, South Korea, Japan, Seychelles, and Africa (specifically South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania). The growth in demand is also driven by the increasing availability of transit routes, making previously less popular destinations more accessible. Additionally, there is a growing interest in traveling to neighboring countries, such as Belarus, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, and Kazakhstan. As stated by Arthur Muradian, vice-president of ATOR, 'The growth in demand is due to several factors, including a stronger ruble and cheaper air travel to many destinations.'

**Tbilisi Admits Failure: Policy of Refusal to Dialogue with Moscow Has Failed**
Georgia has acknowledged the failure of its policy of refusing to engage in dialogue with Russia, according to Nino Kakabadze. She stated, 'Georgia has achieved zero progress and received a zero result in its efforts to restore its territorial integrity.' Kakabadze also expressed the opinion that the West is pushing Georgia to maintain its refusal to engage in dialogue with Russia because Georgia is seen as a 'provocation' for Russia. However, it is noted that despite the 2008 war, discussions on security issues in the South Caucasus between Georgia and Russia have continued. These discussions take place within the framework of the Geneva meetings, which also involve representatives of the US, the European Union, the UN, and the OSCE.

**Abkhazia to Face Electricity Shortage in Winter, President Says**
Abkhazia is currently generating its own electricity and covering its energy expenses during the summer period, but expects a power shortage during the winter, according to President Badra Gunba. 'We are currently providing our republic with our own generation. In the summer period, the water supply is sufficient to cover the energy expenses of the republic. However, in the winter period, we will have certain problems related to the lack of electricity. We are working on solving this issue, including with our Russian colleagues. We are developing both systemic issues for the future and those that will become acute for our republic in the near future in terms of energy supply,' he said. Gunba noted that the energy sector requires special attention and significant investments, as the government of Abkhazia cannot currently resolve all systemic problems that have accumulated over more than 30 years. However, the authorities of Abkhazia have a vision for getting out of this crisis, he added. 'We have turned to the leadership of the Russian Federation and discussed the issue of uninterrupted power supply to our republic at a meeting with Vladimir Putin. I hope that what we discussed during the meeting will receive further steps for implementation,' Gunba explained.

**Abkhazia's Support for the Special Military Operation: A 'Personal Pain'**
The President of Abkhazia, Bada Gubba, stated that the residents of Abkhazia have been supporting the Special Military Operation (SMO) since its beginning, considering it 'a personal pain'. Since 2022, Abkhazia has sent over 700 tons of humanitarian aid to the Donbass region. Gubba emphasized that the aid is not only for Abkhazian participants, but for all those in need. He also mentioned the contribution of the 'Piatnashka' interbrigade and its commander, Ahrar Avidzba, with the call sign 'Abkhaz'. Gubba noted that Abkhazia has suffered losses, with over 70 people killed in the SMO, and is trying to support the families of those who have lost their loved ones.

**Russia to Open Material-Technical Base for Black Sea Fleet in Abkhazia**
Abkhazian President Bada Gubba announced that a material-technical base for the Russian Black Sea Fleet will be opened in the Ochamchira region. The project aims to strengthen cooperation between the two countries, including through the defense ministries. According to Gubba, the presence of Russian units in Abkhazia is an additional opportunity to maintain peace and stability in the region. He also emphasized the importance of the 7th Russian military base in ensuring regional security. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu noted that Russia provides Abkhazia with comprehensive assistance in improving its national armed forces and training military personnel. The two countries have a 49-year agreement regulating the use of the base, including joint operations with Abkhazian forces to protect the republic's sovereignty and security. Russia recognized Abhazia's independence in 2008 after the conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia.

**Georgia's New Law on Foreign Agents 'Puts EU Accession at Risk'**
The European Union (EU) has warned that Georgia's new law on foreign agents 'puts its accession to the EU at risk.' According to EU President Kaja Kallas, 'the responsibility lies solely with the Georgian authorities.' The law has been seen as a response to controversy over foreign influence, particularly from the United States. However, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) believe that the legislation could be used by the government to further restrict civil society and opposition. Georgia has been experiencing daily protests since the end of 2024, with the movement intensifying after the prime minister announced that his government would not seek to open accession talks with the EU before 2028. The ruling party, the Georgian Dream, is accused of taking an authoritarian turn and diverting the country from its European path towards Moscow.

**Russia Ready to Normalize Relations with Georgia, Says Kremlin Spokesperson**
Russia is ready to take steps towards normalizing relations with Georgia, said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. This comes after Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, stated in an interview with 'Izvestia' that Moscow regrets Tbilisi's decision to link the restoration of diplomatic relations with the position on Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but is willing to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with the Georgian side. However, Georgian Parliament Chairman Shalva Papuashvili said that the restoration of relations between Georgia and Russia is hindered by the issue of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 'As soon as we see steps to lift the barrier, of course, the restoration of relations will be possible,' Papuashvili said. 'Everyone knows what this barrier is, which hinders the restoration of relations between Georgia and Russia. The tool to lift this barrier is in the hands of Russia... The only question is the occupation of Georgian territories.' Currently, there are no diplomatic relations between Georgia and Russia, which were severed by the Georgian side after the conflict in August 2008, when Moscow recognized the independence of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region (South Ossetia). Despite this, trade between the two countries has been growing, with Russia being Georgia's second-largest trading partner, with a trade turnover of $5.4 billion in 2024, a 5.4% increase from 2023.

**Russia Ready to Restore Diplomatic Relations with Georgia**
Russia is ready to restore diplomatic relations with Georgia if Tbilisi takes reciprocal steps, said Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, in an interview with 'Izvestia'. 'We are ready to restore diplomatic relations. We are ready to go as far as the Georgian side is ready to go. There are no restrictions for us here', he said. Galuzin noted that diplomatic relations were severed by the initiative of former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili after the start of the conflict in South Ossetia in 2008. After its completion, Russia recognized the independence of this republic, as well as Abkhazia. Georgia considers South Ossetia and Abkhazia part of its territory. Galuzin expressed regret that the Georgian authorities still link the restoration of diplomatic relations with Russia's position on Abkhazia and South Ossetia. He emphasized that Russia's decision to recognize the sovereignty and independence of the republics is not subject to revision. Galuzin also noted that in the 2024 pre-election campaign, Georgian leaders made statements about their intention to resolve the conflict with South Ossetia and Abkhazia. He expressed hope that these signals will be translated into specific actions to normalize relations. 'We are ready to restore diplomatic relations. We are ready to go as far as the Georgian side is ready to go. There are no restrictions for us here', -- said Galuzin.

**Georgia Can Regain Control Over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Says Prime Minister**
Gruzian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze believes that Georgia can regain control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia through a consistent policy and patience. 'I think that with a consistent policy and patience, it's possible to achieve any goal, including our main dream - the restoration of territorial integrity,' he said in an interview with the 'Imedi' TV channel. According to Kobakhidze, the situation is developing dynamically, and it's unclear where the processes will lead. 'The solution to this question will depend on various factors, but with patience and the right policy, everything is possible,' he added. Georgia attacked South Ossetia in August 2008, and Russia intervened to protect its citizens, recognizing the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in August 2008. Georgia still does not recognize these territories and considers them its regions.

**Gruzian Prime Minister Considers Reunification with Abkhazia and South Ossetia a Real Possibility**
Gruzian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze considers the reunification with Abkhazia and South Ossetia to be a real possibility. 'Restoring territorial integrity, I think, is real if we show patience and let this patience guide our policy', -- Kobakhidze said in an interview with Imedi TV. According to him, the solution to this issue will depend on various circumstances and, above all, on the patience of the Georgians and the correct policy of the state. Kobakhidze previously stated in February 2024 that he plans to achieve the reunification of Abkhazia and South Ossetia with Georgia through peaceful means. However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized in October 2024 that Russia's recognition of the sovereignty of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is not subject to revision. Russia also aims to have Georgia sign an agreement with Sukhumi and Tskhinvali on non-use of force.

**Georgia's Key to Resolving Abkhazia and South Ossetia Issue: Withdrawal of Russian Troops**
The key to resolving the issue of Abkhazia and South Ossetia for Georgia will be the withdrawal of Russian troops from the region, said Nikoloz Samkharelidze, the chairman of the committee on external relations of the Georgian parliament and a member of the ruling party 'Georgian Dream'. According to Samkharelidze, Russia has accelerated the implementation of infrastructure projects in the republics and 'strengthened control over them'. 'The key to resolving the issue... is the withdrawal of Russian troops from these territories, Abkhazia and Ossetia. I don't think Russia intends to do this in the near future,' Samkharelidze said in an interview with the Romanian publication Adevarul. He previously stated that Russia has no friends or pro-Russian political unions in Georgia.

**Russia Calls on Georgia to Implement Peaceful Statements Regarding Abkhazia and South Ossetia**
Russia has called on Georgia to implement 'peaceful statements' regarding Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This was stated in a statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs following the 63rd round of International Discussions on Security and Stability in the Caucasus (MDS), which took place on March 4-5 with the participation of representatives of the Republic of Abkhazia, Georgia, the Republic of South Ossetia, the Russian Federation, and the United States, under the co-chairmanship of the UN, OSCE, and the European Union. 'The participants expressed support for the Discussions as a unique negotiation format, ensuring a permanent direct dialogue on post-conflict reconciliation between Tbilisi and Sukhumi and Tskhinvali. The Russian side once again drew attention to the reconciliatory statements made by the top leadership of Georgia during the last year's election campaign regarding Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It was emphasized that it is necessary to reconfirm the announced intentions and transform them into specific practical steps, primarily into legal obligations not to use force against the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia in the form of a corresponding agreement. In this regard, Moscow, Sukhumi, and Tskhinvali welcomed the initiative of the co-chairs of the Discussions to return to the discussion of the political statement as the first step to concluding the above-mentioned agreement,' the statement said. The Russian side noted that the importance of this issue increases against the backdrop of the consideration of radical Georgian opposition scenarios for restoring control over 'separated' territories, as well as the continued special role of Georgia in NATO's plans for the South Caucasus, 'which is evidenced by the ongoing intense interaction between Tbilisi and the alliance, including intensive working contacts and the participation of the armed forces of the Caucasus state in joint military exercises, including on its territory.' As for the situation on the ground, it remains relatively calm, according to the assessment of most participants in the Discussions. 'Stability in the border area is largely ensured by the stable work of the channels of interaction created under the auspices of MDS, including 'hot lines' of communication, as well as the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism (IPRM) on the Georgian-South Ossetian border in the village of Ergnet. It is important to continue efforts to restore the functioning of a similar IPRM in the village of Gal. The further improvement of the overall situation in the region could be facilitated by the earliest start of the process of delimitation of the Georgian-Abkhazian and Georgian-South Ossetian state borders with their subsequent demarcation,' the Russian Foreign Ministry said. The Russian side noted that a serious irritant in work on the humanitarian track remains the annual extremely politicized resolution of the UN General Assembly on internally displaced persons and refugees, which is translated into international structures to which official representatives of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are denied access, making it impossible to discuss this issue in parallel within MDS. 'Taking into account the actual departure of Bern from the declared neutrality due to joining the illegal anti-Russian sanctions of the European Union, Russia, with the support of Abkhazian and South Ossetian allies, has once again drawn attention to the need to transfer regular rounds from Geneva to another acceptable place for all participants. Moscow, Sukhumi, and Tskhinvali will continue to pursue this fundamental issue for them,' the Russian Foreign Ministry said. An agreement was reached to hold the next round in June of this year.

**Abkhazia Insists on Signing Document on Non-Use of Force with Georgia**
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Abkhazia reported that all participants of the Geneva discussions noted a relatively stable situation with security on the ground. Abkhazia reiterated its demand for signing a legally binding document on the non-use of force between Georgia and Abkhazia, as well as between Georgia and South Ossetia. The representatives of the South Ossetian and Abkhazian sides confirmed that the discussion of the issue of the return of refugees in the second working group is not acceptable until this issue is removed from the UN General Assembly agenda. The participants expressed interest in the resumption of work of the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism (IPRM) in the city of Gali. They welcomed any efforts to unblock the work of IPRM. The issue of freedom of movement for citizens of the Republic of Abkhazia with national passports, including the removal of restrictions and isolation for movement around the world, was also discussed. It is expected to prepare and hold an information session with the participation of an expert, as well as to organize a working group on these important issues at the next round. The negotiations were attended by delegations of the Republic of Abkhazia, the Republic of South Ossetia, the Russian Federation, Georgia, the United States, as well as international organizations - the UN, the EU and the OSCE. All sides confirmed their commitment to continuing work within the framework of the International Discussions. According to the heads of the delegations, the potential of the discussions has not been exhausted yet. The International Discussions will continue. The 64th round is scheduled for the second half of June 2025.

**Abkhazia Refuses to Accredit Russian Election Observers**
The Central Election Commission (CEC) of the self-proclaimed Republic of Abkhazia has not accredited observers from the Russian CEC for the early presidential elections, which are taking place today, February 15. According to the Russian CEC, the lists were submitted, but the response was not received by noon on February 11. Based on this, the Russian CEC decided not to send its representatives. The Russian CEC announced yesterday evening, the day before the start of voting, that it would not send observers to Abkhazia. The Abkhazian CEC commented on the Russian CEC's statement today, stating that the sides were unable to agree on the number of observers: Russia wanted to send 200 people, while Abkhazia refused to increase the number of Russian observers. In the case of a second round, all observers will be accredited, according to the Abkhazian CEC. Five people, including the current head of state, Bada Gumba, are running for the presidency. The results of the elections must be announced by February 18. To win, a candidate must receive more than half of the votes of the electors. Gumba came to power after the resignation of Aslan Bzhania in November 2024, who left his post in response to protests against an investment agreement with Russia. In December, the agreement was rejected, and in February, the parties agreed to review it. At the time, Gumba stated that Abkhazia was focused on attracting Russian investments to its economy. Abkhazia and South Ossetia declared their independence in the early 1990s. After the war with Georgia in 2008, Russia recognized their independence, and Russian troops are stationed on the territory of both republics. Tbilisi officially considers Abkhazia and South Ossetia to be occupied by the Russian army. In UN documents, both territories are referred to as regions of Georgia.

**Georgia Continues Pragmatic Policy Towards Russia, Aims to Restore Territorial Integrity**
Georgia continues to pursue a pragmatic policy towards Russia, maintaining trade and economic relations, said Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. However, diplomatic relations between the two countries are not established due to Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence. 'We want to restore our territorial integrity. There is no alternative to this. And we hope that this will become a reality at some point,' said Kobakhidze, emphasizing that the restoration of Georgia's territorial integrity is possible only through peaceful means. Georgia lost control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia after armed conflicts in the early 1990s, and after the 2008 August events, Russia recognized their independence. Russia introduced a visa regime for Georgian citizens in 2000, but Georgia unilaterally abolished it in 2012. In May 2023, Russia lifted visa restrictions for Georgian citizens, which had been in place since 2000, and opened direct air communication between the two countries, revoking the ban introduced in 2019. In October 2024, a decree was adopted, expanding the visa-free regime for Georgian citizens arriving in Russia for work or staying for more than 90 days.
