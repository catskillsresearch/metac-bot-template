**Why Taiwan fears outside world will abandon it if China invades**
Taiwanese officials are concerned that their country will struggle to gain international support if China invades, as Taiwan's independence is recognized by only 12 countries worldwide. Liang Wen-Chieh, deputy minister of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said, 'Ukraine is a [United Nations] member state, and Taiwan is not. Therefore, if there is war between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, we will undoubtedly receive much less aid from the international community than Ukraine.' China is expected to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, and Beijing regularly threatens any nations that attempt to recognize Taiwan's sovereignty. However, some experts believe that global skepticism of the China-Russia axis following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 could work in Taipei's favor. Ukrainian Armed Forces Cmdr. Oleh Shyriaiev said, 'Civilized capitalist countries will be protecting the world from the plague that is communism.'

**Taiwan's Central Bank Warns of Financial Instability due to US Tariff Policy**
The Central Bank of Taiwan has warned that the US's 'equal tariff' policy could lead to financial instability, affecting exports and the life insurance industry. According to the bank's report, the main factors affecting financial stability include the US's tariff policy, geopolitical risks, and climate change. If the US decides to impose higher tariffs on Taiwan, it will not only impact the financial market but also affect the export industry, leading to a decrease in corporate revenue, unpaid leave, and an increase in unemployment rates. This will have a double impact on household income and wealth, and may even lead to an increase in bad loans. The tariff policy may also affect the financial sector, as the recent tariff negotiations have led to an expectation of a rise in the New Taiwan dollar, which will put pressure on the life insurance industry's capital adequacy ratio. According to the bank's report, the life insurance industry's cash outflow was NT$269.6 billion in 2024, but the industry's cash and quasi-cash assets are still sufficient to meet their obligations. However, the bank will continue to monitor the life insurance industry's cash flow situation. If the public expects the New Taiwan dollar to continue rising, it may delay the purchase of US dollar-denominated insurance policies, affecting the sale of new insurance contracts and leading to a decrease in premium income. On the other hand, policyholders who hold US dollar-denominated insurance policies may cancel their policies early to avoid exchange rate losses, leading to an increase in premium payments and worsening the cash outflow situation. However, the Financial Supervisory Commission has strengthened its monitoring of the life insurance industry's cash flow and has required insurance companies to improve their liquidity management to ensure financial stability and policyholder rights.

**Taiwan Premier Lai Ching-te: Overcoming Challenges to Achieve 20% Renewable Energy by 2026**
Premier Lai Ching-te said, 'Taiwan has entered the non-nuclear era, and we will continue to overcome difficulties in land acquisition, environmental impact assessments, and negotiations with landowners to achieve our goal of having 20% of our energy generated from renewable sources by next year.' Taiwan has a unique advantage in offshore wind farms in the western part of the island, and the government will continue to work towards this goal. Lai also mentioned that the President is pushing for a second energy transformation, which includes developing diverse renewable energy, deep energy saving, technological energy storage, and strengthening the national grid's resilience. He also noted that the recent shutdown of the Taipower's No. 2 reactor at the Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant marked the beginning of Taiwan's non-nuclear era. Currently, Taiwan's main sources of electricity are coal, natural gas, and renewable energy, and research is being conducted on geothermal energy, which will be an important reserve resource once it is successfully developed. Lai said that wind and solar energy will play a crucial role in Taiwan's energy policy, and the government will continue to work towards achieving the goal of having 20% of its energy generated from renewable sources by next year.

**Taiwan Seeks Deal with US to Avoid Additional Tariff**
Taiwan has proposed a deal to the US to increase imports of energy, industry, and agricultural products, as well as military equipment, in exchange for not implementing a 32% additional tariff on US goods. Taiwan's leader, Lai Ching-te, stated, 'We want to balance bilateral trade by buying more energy, industry, and agricultural products, as well as military equipment from the US, while also contributing to Taiwan's economic security.' Lai also emphasized the need for Taiwan and the US to develop industrial cooperation and create a 'red-free' supply chain, separate from China's manufacturing networks. Taiwan has also expressed a desire to increase its investments in the US and support the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize the US manufacturing sector. According to Taiwan's agency CNA, Taiwan's trade with the US reached $158.6 billion in 2024, with the US exporting $42.3 billion to Taiwan and Taiwan exporting $116.3 billion to the US, resulting in a trade deficit of $73.9 billion in favor of Taiwan.

**Taiwan to become first Asian country to be recognized as non-pandemic area for three major pig diseases**
Taiwan is expected to become the first country in Asia to be recognized as a 'non-pandemic area' for three major pig diseases (African swine fever, swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease) by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) before the Mid-Autumn Festival. The country's Agriculture Department has been working towards this goal for several years, with the last case of swine fever reported in 1994. Taiwan has implemented a three-stage plan to eradicate swine fever, including mass vaccination, environmental risk monitoring, and industry communication. The country has already been recognized as a non-pandemic area for foot-and-mouth disease in 2019 and African swine fever in 2022. According to the Agriculture Department, being recognized as a non-pandemic area for swine fever will reduce the cost of purchasing vaccines and minimize the risk of side effects, ultimately increasing Taiwan's competitiveness in the global market. 'It is a significant milestone for Taiwan's animal disease prevention and control efforts,' said Agriculture Department Deputy Minister Du Wen-jen. 'We will continue to work towards becoming a non-pandemic area for all three diseases and promoting Taiwan's high-quality agricultural products globally.'

**Taiwan's COVID-19 Situation Expected to Peak in Late June to Early July**
Taiwan's Minister of Health and Welfare, Chou Tai-yuan, said that the COVID-19 situation is expected to peak in late June to early July. The number of severe cases and deaths has reached a new high last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) spokesperson, Lo Yi-chun. To avoid a repeat of the emergency room congestion seen in January, Chou said that the government will implement a tiered and divided system to allocate patients to hospitals and clinics based on their needs. He also urged people to get vaccinated quickly to avoid severe symptoms. Chou said that the medical system has a good foundation after three years of experience with COVID-19, and the division and allocation system is already in place. He also assured that there is sufficient medication and that the production of rapid test kits has been increased to meet the demand. Chou said, 'Please don't worry, people can buy rapid test kits at convenience stores and pharmacies soon.' The CDC has again urged people to wear masks and get vaccinated. Chou said that people who have not been vaccinated since October last year can get an additional dose after evaluation by a doctor. People aged 65 and above, or those between 45 and 65 with low immunity, can get two additional doses. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced that it will no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children and pregnant women. Lo said that the US CDC will discuss this issue in June, and it is expected that the recommendation will be limited to specific groups. Taiwan's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will discuss the public funding for COVID-19 vaccination for the fall and winter seasons in mid-June.

**Taiwan Says US Trade-Deal Push Still On Despite Court Ruling**
Taiwan is continuing efforts to secure a trade deal with the US, despite a court ruling that blocked many of the tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump. Deputy Foreign Minister Chen Ming-chi said, 'We are glad to see that there are some debates among different branches of government in the US. That will make everything more reasonable and more acceptable.' Chen added that Taiwan is 'serious about our negotiations and we are serious to have a fair trade with the US.' Taiwan President Lai Ching-te has expressed willingness to increase imports from the US to lower the trade imbalance. Chen remains confident that his government will reach a deal before the US pause is set to lift and will push for Washington to drop Taiwan's tariffs 'as low as possible.' He also indicated that Taiwan has room to lower tariffs on some US goods, such as automobiles, which are subject to a 17.5% levy.

**Taiwan USV prototype set to take part in military exercise  | Taiwan News | May. 29, 2025 16:22**
The Kuai Chi attack unmanned surface vehicle (USV) prototype, developed by the National Chung Shan Institute for Science and Technology, is set to participate in a military exercise later this summer. According to Sun Chun-ching, a project lead at NCSIST's Systems Development Center, the USV will undergo combat evaluations in June to ensure it meets the military's requirements. If successful, a live demonstration is planned for August at Jiupeng Base in Pingtung during a missile test fire exercise. The Kuai Chi USV has in-house developed internal guidance and control systems, differing significantly from commercial off-the-shelf systems. Sun said, 'One drill will simulate a scenario in which the USV engages surface targets.' A joint demonstration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is also under consideration. The Kuai Chi USV may be unveiled at the Taipei Aerospace & Defense Technology Exhibition in September. Additionally, a USV demonstration is scheduled for next month in Suao, Yilan, featuring four participating companies: Thunder Tiger, Carbon-based Technology, Corum International, and Lung Teh Shipbuilding Co.

**Taiwan Open to Negotiations on Additional US Customs Duty**
Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te stated that Taiwan is open to negotiations regarding the additional 32% customs duty that the US plans to impose on imported goods from the island. Taiwan aims to balance its bilateral trade with the US and enhance its economic security by purchasing more energy, industrial, and agricultural products, as well as military equipment. Lai emphasized that Taiwan wants to purchase more energy, industrial, and agricultural products, as well as military equipment from the US to balance its bilateral trade and contribute to Taiwan's economic security. He also stressed that Taiwan wants to increase its investments in the US and support the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize the US manufacturing sector. Lai noted that Taiwan and the US should develop industrial cooperation to create a 'red-free' supply chain. This statement drew attention as it suggests that Taiwan is proposing the formation of a supply chain outside of China's manufacturing networks, with which Taiwan has a sovereignty dispute. US President Donald Trump had previously announced that he would impose a 32% additional customs duty on Taiwan as part of the 'reciprocal tariffs' framework. However, the US administration has temporarily suspended the tariff increases for 90 days and only implemented a 10% base tariff. Taiwan, with a population of 23 million, is the US's 7th largest trading partner. The bilateral trade volume between the US and Taiwan reached $158.6 billion in 2024, with the US exporting $42.3 billion to Taiwan and Taiwan exporting $116.3 billion to the US. The US has a trade deficit of $73.9 billion with Taiwan. Taiwan has also seen an increase in its investments in the US in recent years. The world's largest chip producer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), has announced that it will invest $165 billion to build production facilities in Arizona, US.

**NTD Appreciation: A Good Time to Buy US Assets?**
The recent appreciation of the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) has led to two different interpretations: 1) the depreciation of US assets, making NTD assets more valuable, or 2) the NTD's purchasing power has reached its strongest level in three years, making US assets relatively cheap. The author of the article suggests that the latter interpretation is more likely, as the NTD's appreciation is unlikely to be a one-time event. The author recommends buying US assets, such as ETFs 00924, 00971, and 009800, which track the Nasdaq index, when the NTD is strong, as this will increase the chances of a 'stock-yuan dual rise' scenario, similar to 2024. However, this strategy may not be suitable for those who hold long-term US bonds.

**Taiwanese Medical Organizations Urge WHO to Recognize Taiwan's Contributions to Global Health**
The 21 major medical organizations in Taiwan have jointly urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to recognize Taiwan's contributions to global health and allow it to participate in the upcoming World Health Assembly as an observer. Taiwan has been excluded from the assembly for the past 8 years, and this year would mark its 9th consecutive absence. The Minister of Health and Welfare, Chiu Tai-san, will lead a delegation to Geneva next week to engage in substantive exchanges with at least 40 countries. The President of the Taiwan Medical Association, Chou Ching-ming, stated that the WHO should acknowledge Taiwan's participation in the World Health Assembly, citing the country's excellent healthcare performance and high health insurance coverage. Chou also emphasized that Taiwan's exclusion from the global public health system contradicts the WHO's value of 'health as a fundamental human right.' The Director of the International Cooperation Division of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Shi Jin-shui, noted that the delegation will engage in interactions with other international organizations and will interact with at least 40 countries. The US has announced its withdrawal from the WHO, which will take effect on January 22, 2026. Shi stated that the US' departure will have a significant impact on the WHO's finances and personnel, but the organization will continue to operate and discuss issues. The focus of this meeting is the 'Pandemic Prevention Agreement,' which has been negotiated for several years, and Taiwan will actively monitor the situation. Representative Wang Cheng-xu stated that Taiwan may not be a member of the WHO, but it shares the universal values of preventing the spread of diseases and protecting human health.

**US Considers Providing Taiwan with Advanced Drones**
The US is considering providing the Taiwanese military with JUMP 20 drones to enhance their reconnaissance capabilities on medium and long distances and support the development of a new generation of reconnaissance drones, according to the Taipei Times. The drones will have more advanced features than those provided to the island's coast guard in 2022. 'JUMP 20 is part of the first wave of drones developed under the US Future Tactical Uncrewed Aircraft System Program, and it has been supplied to the US military, Ukraine, and Taiwan,' said a source. The US has allegedly provided Taiwan with 'free military aid' under the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, including 80,000 sets of personal equipment and 1,000 M240B machine guns, but the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense has not commented on these claims. In 2023, the Central News Agency of Taiwan reported that the US had provided Taiwan with JUMP 20 drones and training on their use to improve security capabilities in the Taiwan Strait. The JUMP 20 is a vertical takeoff and landing drone with a fixed wing, developed by AeroVironment. A former deputy commander of the Taiwanese Air Force, Zhang Yan-ting, told the Central News Agency that the JUMP 20 can conduct reconnaissance, observation, and reconnaissance using multiple sensors, and can stay in the air for over 14 hours and reach speeds of up to 92 kilometers per hour. The situation around Taiwan has escalated since US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in August 2022. China, which considers the island part of its territory, condemned the visit as support for Taiwanese separatism and conducted large-scale military exercises. Official relations between the Chinese central government and its island province have been severed since 1949, after the defeat of the Kuomintang forces led by Chiang Kai-shek in the Chinese Civil War. Business and informal contacts between the island and the mainland have been resumed since the late 1980s. Since the early 1990s, the sides have been in contact through non-governmental organizations - the Beijing Association for the Development of Relations across the Taiwan Strait and the Taipei Foundation for Exchanges across the Strait.

**Chen Chong: China Will Not Attack Taiwan Before 2028, Unless Provoked**
Former Taiwanese Premier Chen Chong said in an interview that the Chinese mainland will not attack Taiwan before 2028, unless it is provoked by a face-saving issue. Chen also expressed concerns about Taiwan's participation in the first batch of trade talks with the US, saying that it is a high-risk move. He pointed out that the US government's debt has reached 36 trillion dollars, and that the US Federal Reserve has already bought a large amount of US government bonds. Chen warned that the US may follow the debt forgiveness plan used by some third-world countries. He also emphasized the importance of diversifying Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, which are currently heavily invested in US Treasury bonds. Chen suggested that Taiwan should consider buying gold as a way to diversify its reserves and reduce its reliance on the US dollar. He also analyzed the current trade war between the US and China, comparing it to the ancient Chinese strategy of '合縱連橫' (alliance and encirclement). Chen pointed out that the US has underestimated the EU's ability to retaliate with 25% tariffs, and that the EU's move has forced the US to propose a 90-day exemption. Chen also discussed the concept of '金融武器化' (financial weaponization), which he believes is not limited to finance, but also includes the use of food and other resources as weapons. He suggested that Taiwan should diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on the US market. Chen also emphasized that the idea of '脫中入北' (ditching China and joining the North) is not a solution to Taiwan's economic problems, and that Taiwan should focus on developing its own economy and reducing its reliance on the US.

**Will China Follow Russia's Example in Ukraine and Invade Taiwan in 2025?**
Taiwan's fate may be decided in Ukraine, as President Tsai Ing-Wen said in 2023. Despite China's military maneuvers around the island, she urged the US to focus more on Ukraine to prevent Russia from winning. Analysts believe that if a similar scenario were to occur in Taiwan, China would 'take action' to 'recover' the island. In 2022, President Joe Biden stated that the US would defend Taiwan if China were to invade. This firm response was 'taken into account' by the Chinese regime. China has more legitimacy to invade Taiwan than Russia did in Ukraine. Taiwan was part of China before the nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek established a republic on the island in 1949. Until 1970, the two Chinas coexisted at the UN, with Taiwan recognized by most nations, including African countries, as the 'official' China. However, in 1971, the People's Republic of China (PRC) won the battle to be recognized as the sole representative of the Chinese people, leading to Taiwan's isolation. Today, the PRC's economic and demographic weight is so great that few countries dare to defy it and maintain official relations with Taiwan, including European countries. Only 12 countries recognize Taiwan, with most being small, unimportant countries or islands. Taiwan has a cutting-edge industry, being one of the world's top producers of semi-conductors and microprocessors. As a member of the WTO and the largest foreign investor in China, Taiwan is a key player in the region.

**Taiwan's Manufacturing Industry Sentiment Index Turns Negative Amid US Trade Policies**
The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) released the January manufacturing industry sentiment index, which decreased by 3.11 points to 10.57, from 13.68 in December 2024. The index turned from a green light, indicating a stable economy, to a yellow-blue light, indicating a low economy. According to TIER, the decrease in the index was due to the Lunar New Year holiday, which reduced working days, and the uncertainty caused by US President Trump's trade policies. The index also showed that export orders and import growth rates turned negative, affecting the demand and production indicators. TIER also mentioned that the February economic indicators may be affected by the low base in 2024, and it is recommended to analyze the two-month average results to avoid the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday. The institute also pointed out that the US trade policies may lead to a rise in global protectionism, increasing economic uncertainty. In terms of the Mainland China, TIER analyzed that the country has taken retaliatory measures against the US, but the scale of the affected products is relatively small, accounting for about 20% of the total imports from the US. However, the US has raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% since March 4, which will affect China's export momentum. The institute also pointed out that the Chinese government may increase the domestic circulation force to boost the economy, especially in the export-constrained situation. Additionally, the institute mentioned that the Chinese government will also focus on promoting the new quality production force, which is expected to drive the industry upgrade and new demand.

**US Inflation and Interest Rates: Implications for Taiwan's Stock Market**
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.0% year-over-year in January, exceeding market expectations of 2.9%. The Producer Price Index (PPI) also rose 3.5% year-over-year, a new high since February 2023. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has announced that personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data will show a gentle or downward trend, which has increased market expectations for a rate cut. However, the dollar and US Treasury yields have risen, and gold prices have fallen, indicating that the market expects the Fed to maintain a hawkish stance on interest rates in the coming months. In this context, investors have turned to financial sector stocks, which have performed well in the past year, as a way to diversify risk. Taiwan's stock market is expected to maintain double-digit growth in 2025, and investors can take advantage of low prices to build a portfolio. The Everbright High Yield Stock ETF (00907) tracks the Taiwan High Yield Stock Index, which selects companies with a positive three-year earnings record and a history of paying dividends. The top 10 constituents of the index include more than half from the financial sector, as well as companies from the aviation and shipping industries, making 00907 the only ETF in the market that combines financial and industrial stocks.

**US Congress Passes Bipartisan Resolution Criticizing China's Use of UN Resolution 2758**
A bipartisan resolution was passed in the US Congress on February 21, criticizing China for weaponizing the 1971 UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 to confuse the US's Taiwan policy. The resolution, signed by eight lawmakers, including Senators Jim Risch and Jeanne Shaheen, and Representatives John R. Moolenaar and Chris Coons, states that the US does not recognize China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. Risch said, 'We see China's malicious tactics and support Taiwan's friends.' Shaheen added, 'Beijing is trying to prevent Taiwan from meaningfully participating in the UN, further weakening international support for Taiwan. This bipartisan resolution clearly shows that the US will not stand idly by.' The resolution emphasizes that the US will ensure that China cannot distort history and that Taiwan's sovereignty is respected in the international community.

**Trump Expects Xi Jinping's Visit to the US, Possible New Trade Agreement**
US President Donald Trump stated that he expects a visit from Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Trump mentioned that 'it's quite possible' for both countries to sign a new trade agreement. However, the exact date of Xi's visit to the US is unknown, according to Reuters. Trump noted that 'we will have President Xi, everyone will come' to the US, hinting at the leaders of other countries. The contacts between Trump and Xi may be crucial for a potential easing or postponement of trade tariffs. Xi's last visit to the US was in November 2023, where he met with President Biden and reached agreements on restoring military communication and limiting fentanyl production. Trump and Xi previously spoke before his inauguration on January 20, discussing TikTok, trade, and Taiwan. Reuters noted that 'Washington and Beijing have had strained relations for years due to disagreements on trade tariffs, cybersecurity, TikTok, Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights, and the origin of COVID-19.'

**2027: A Critical Year for the Taiwan Strait, Chen Kuan-tien Urges Unity and Increased Defense Spending**
Taiwanese politician Chen Kuan-tien believes that 2027 is a crucial year for the Taiwan Strait, and President Lai Ching-te's decision to convene a meeting with the leaders of the five branches of government will help to ease tensions. Chen said, 'In the face of the critical moment in 2027, Taiwan should unite internally and strengthen its own defense capabilities, and the ruling and opposition parties should put aside their differences.' He hopes that the meeting will help to resolve the current impasse and that the five branches of government will be able to work together to address the challenges ahead. Chen pointed out that various countries and think tanks have emphasized that 2027 is a critical year for the Taiwan Strait, citing the Chinese military's increasing military strength, the upcoming 21st National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and the 100th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army. He also mentioned that former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has publicly acknowledged that the Chinese military will have the capability to attack Taiwan in 2027, as assessed by intelligence agencies. Chen emphasized that 2027 is Taiwan's biggest challenge, and time is of the essence. He reiterated that Taiwan's defense budget has not increased but rather decreased, and that the country needs to increase its defense spending to enhance its self-defense capabilities. Chen hopes that the meeting will be successful and that the five branches of government will be able to work together to address the challenges ahead.
