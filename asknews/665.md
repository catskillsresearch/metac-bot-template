**Researchers Discover Early Signs of Keratoconus in Tears**
A team of researchers from the Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Santiago de Compostela (IDIS) has discovered that tears can contain early signs of a degenerative eye disease, known as keratoconus, before symptoms appear. Led by Dr. Isabel Lema Gesto, the study found that 15 proteins related to oxidative stress, cellular adhesion, and corneal structure are altered in individuals with a higher risk of developing the disease. These proteins can be detected in tears using high-precision proteomic analysis, allowing for early detection and prevention of the disease. According to Dr. Lema, 'These alterations appear before even the clinical changes are detectable by current methods.' The study has identified three panels of biomarkers in tears that can accurately detect the biomechanical alteration of the cornea and the hereditary load, allowing for early intervention and prevention of the disease. 'Detecting people at risk in time will allow us to intervene before irreversible damage occurs,' said the authors. 'Tears not only protect our eyes, but also tell a story about our future. And we have learned to listen to it.'

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Israel's Genocide and the Risk of Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Dominance**
Israel is facing its toughest times since its establishment in 1948. Once known as the country of people who were victims of genocide, it is now known as the country of genociders. Germany, which has always unconditionally supported Israel due to its guilt and historical shame, has also remained silent in this situation. The only step Israel can take is to remove Prime Minister Netanyahu and hold him responsible for the genocide. According to the schedule, Netanyahu's trial will be concluded within the next 7 months, and he will likely be sent to prison. However, if this scenario is not enough to make Israel wash its hands, a plot to assassinate Netanyahu or a fatal accident could occur. Regardless of the scenario, Israel's future will be marked by difficult times. The ultra-Orthodox Jewish population is growing rapidly, and they will become the dominant force in Israel by 2050, making them a significant risk to the region and the world. Meanwhile, CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu's insistence on returning to the party leadership despite his losses and the taban's dissatisfaction with him will be his greatest defeat. The situation is similar to the Greek General Staff's gift of a historical map of Helen to the Fener Rum Patriarch, which showed Istanbul and Thrace outside of Turkey's borders. This move is seen as a provocation by some, and it is believed that the Greek government is trying to create tension between the two countries. However, the Turkish government is taking a cautious approach, and the Turkish ambassador in Athens is trying to maintain good relations with Greece. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of avoiding provocations and promoting peace and understanding between the two countries.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**1. FC Köln Signs Isak Johannesson from Fortuna Düsseldorf**
1. FC Köln has signed Isak Johannesson from Fortuna Düsseldorf for 5.5 million euros. The 22-year-old midfielder has signed a contract until 2030. Johannesson expressed his happiness about joining the club, saying, 'I am very happy to sign for a club like 1. FC Köln and play in the Bundesliga next season. I am looking forward to the great atmosphere at the RheinEnergieStadion and to helping the team with my qualities.' The transfer is a shock for Fortuna fans, who had been hoping for Johannesson to stay. However, Köln activated the buyout clause, which expired on May 31. The club's new sports director, Thomas Kessler, is driving the transfer plans forward and has invested around 10 million euros in Johannesson and Ragnar Ache. Kessler said, 'Isak has developed positively in recent years and is ready for the step up to the Bundesliga. He is strong in terms of endurance and play, and can be used in various positions in the central midfield. We are very happy that he has chosen the FC.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Kexim and K-Sure sued over planned US$1.9bn financing for Mozambique LNG project**
Climate activists have filed a lawsuit against the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Kexim) and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-Sure) to block their involvement in a US$7.2bn LNG project in Mozambique. The plaintiffs, including Mozambican civil society group Justiça Ambiental and three South Korean youth activists, argue that Kexim and K-Sure's financing would support a dramatic expansion in Mozambique's fossil fuel sector, undermining efforts to slow global warming. According to the plaintiffs, the Korean agencies are considering loans and guarantees worth US$1.9bn. 'The financial agreements are expected to be finalised within the first half of 2025, raising concerns that public funds will once again be used to support fossil fuel expansion abroad,' says a May 29 statement from Solutions for Our Climate. The plaintiffs claim that Kexim and K-Sure's backing would violate Korea's constitutional and legal obligations, and would 'significantly accelerate global climate breakdown and risk triggering irreversible tipping points, such as the collapse of polar ice sheets and rising sea levels'. Daniella Cha, a consultant at Solutions for Our Climate, says Korea cannot 'credibly uphold its Paris Agreement commitments, or 2050 net-zero target while Kexim and K-Sure continue pouring billions in public funds into fossil fuel projects'. The project is forecast to produce 3.55 million metric tons of LNG annually until the 2050s, and the plaintiffs argue that this would be a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. 'The projected greenhouse gas emissions of 489 million tons of CO2-equivalent during the lifecycle of the project can be compared to the total annual emissions of 10 cities the size of New York City,' Solutions for Our Climate says.

**The Kessler Syndrome: A Threat to Global Connectivity**
The Kessler Syndrome, a real threat that is advancing silently, could make the internet inaccessible in the future. According to NASA, it is already in its early stages. Formulated in 1978 by NASA researchers Donald J. Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais, it describes a scenario where the accumulation of space debris triggers a chain reaction of collisions. Each impact generates new fragments, which in turn collide with other objects, creating a growing cloud of debris that could make the low Earth orbit inaccessible. If left unchecked, it could directly affect access to the internet, GPS navigation, cloud services, and even the functioning of banking or streaming platforms. NASA experts warn that the process towards an unusable orbit due to the Kessler Syndrome can be divided into three phases. The first phase involves operational failures due to minor impacts, the second phase involves high-impact collisions, and the third phase is an unstoppable cascade of collisions that releases millions of fragments, making any activity in the low Earth orbit impracticable. If urgent measures are not taken, humanity could face an era where space missions are impossible or extremely dangerous due to the Kessler Syndrome, as said by NASA experts, 'the process towards an unusable orbit due to the Kessler Syndrome can be divided into three phases.'

**The Kessler Syndrome: A Threat to the Earth's Orbit and the Universe**
The 'Kessler Syndrome' is a phenomenon where the Earth's orbit is filled with debris, making it difficult to launch new satellites. According to 'Starlink', a network of 55,000 satellites will be launched in the near future, which will lead to a significant increase in debris. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) treats orbits as radio frequencies, ignoring the physical nature of satellites. This has led to a lack of regulation and a significant increase in debris. The 'Kessler Syndrome' is not only a threat to the Earth's orbit but also to the visibility of the universe. A single 'Starlink' satellite can reflect as much light as a visible star in a dark sky. The Vera Rubin Observatory, a $500 million project, is designed to map billions of galaxies, but 30% of its images will be affected by satellite debris by 2030. The 'filter for debris' is used to remove the effects of satellites from cosmic images. The 'Guang' network's radio frequencies may interfere with the study of primordial hydrogen, the oldest light in the universe. 'Starlink' has taken steps to minimize its impact on astronomy, but its newer satellites are more prone to radio interference. The 'Kessler Syndrome' is a real test of humanity's ability to manage space debris. However, companies like 'Starlink' are more focused on their business interests than on solving the problem. The cost of removing debris from orbit is enormous, and the current solutions are not effective. The 'Kessler Syndrome' is a warning sign that humanity needs to take seriously and find a solution to the problem before it's too late.

**Humanity Enters First Stage of Kessler Syndrome, Threatening Global Space Operations**
Scientists warn that the world is entering the first stage of the Kessler syndrome, which could cause humanity to regress 100 years. The syndrome occurs when the number of satellites and space debris increases, leading to a chain reaction of collisions that could last for centuries. This would make it impossible to place satellites in orbit, threatening the viability of space stations and the launch of private rockets. According to Darren McKnight, Senior Technical Fellow at LeoLabs, the first stage of the syndrome is marked by the appearance of malfunctions and anomalies in satellite, space station, and rocket systems caused by small collisions of space debris. 'In 50-100 years, if we continue at this rate, the Kessler syndrome will become a reality. We will have so much space debris that launching a satellite will no longer be viable. The low Earth orbit will be unusable,' said John. C. Crassidis, a NASA collaborator and researcher at the University of Buffalo's Department of Aerospace Engineering.

**Too much trash in space: concerns about Kessler Syndrome rise as over 1,200 objects fell to Earth in 2024**
The European Space Agency (ESA) has reported that Earth's space orbits are becoming increasingly congested, with over 1,200 objects falling to Earth in 2024. The agency warns that the increasing threat of space debris, including rocket parts and decommissioned satellites, poses a significant risk to operational satellites and the International Space Station. The Kessler Syndrome, a theory formulated by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler, suggests that collisions between pieces of debris could lead to an unstoppable chain reaction, making orbits perilous and worthless to future missions. The ESA estimates that there are over 1.2 million objects in orbit, each of which can cause damage and is over a centimeter in diameter. The agency emphasizes the need to actively clear out debris to prevent disasters and the emergence of Kessler Syndrome, which could shut down future communications and operations.

**The Kessler Syndrome: A Growing Threat to Space Exploration and Global Infrastructure**
The world has seen an exponential increase in space activity, especially in low Earth orbit, which has become a crowded field with thousands of satellites, space stations, and millions of pieces of space debris orbiting at high speeds. This technological revolution has brought great benefits, but also a silent but real threat: the so-called Kessler syndrome. Proposed by NASA astrophysicist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, this phenomenon suggests that the accumulation of objects in orbit could trigger a chain reaction of collisions, resulting in a growing cloud of debris that would put not only space missions, but also the technological infrastructure that supports essential services on Earth, at risk. According to several experts, we are already in the first stage of this process, and if urgent measures are not taken, access to space could become impossible for centuries. The first signs of this situation date back to incidents such as the one that occurred in November 2024, when a piece of space debris forced the International Space Station to perform an emergency maneuver. Although the piece of debris passed only four kilometers from the station's orbit, the risk was so great that the astronauts prepared for evacuation. This type of event is not isolated: the ISS has had to avoid space debris on numerous occasions since 2000. The problem is not just the size of the objects. In fact, many of the most dangerous fragments are too small to be detected with current systems, but fast enough to cause catastrophic damage. Even a particle the size of a paint drop can penetrate metal structures at orbital speeds, which exceed 27,000 kilometers per hour. Since the beginning of the space era in 1957, more than 650 incidents have generated fragmentation: collisions, explosions, and armament tests in space. One of the most well-known examples occurred in 2009, when the Russian military satellite Kosmos 2251 collided with the US communications satellite Iridium 33, producing almost 2,000 large fragments and millions of smaller ones, all with the potential to generate new collisions. Since then, space traffic has accelerated impressively. In the last four years, the number of objects launched into space has doubled. With companies like SpaceX deploying massive constellations of satellites to offer global internet, orbital saturation is already a reality. Currently, it is estimated that there are over 47,000 trackable objects orbiting the Earth, not counting the millions of smaller fragments. The difficulty in tracking all these elements has raised alarms among experts. Many satellite operators receive daily dozens of alerts for potential collisions, forcing them to constantly modify trajectories. However, this is not always possible or effective, due to the limitations in the precision of the available data. Urgent measures are needed to prevent the Kessler syndrome, which also implies a huge economic risk. Many of the satellites in geostationary orbit, located over 35,000 kilometers high, have a value of over $250 million. This region is especially vulnerable, as objects there can remain for centuries before falling to Earth, making any attempt at cleaning or mitigation almost impossible. In response to this scenario, various organizations and institutions are working on solutions. One of them is the development of technologies to remove space debris. The European Space Agency, for example, has successfully tested a system of drag sails that accelerates the fall of satellites out of service, making them disintegrate in the atmosphere. However, these solutions are expensive and still far from being applicable on a large scale. Another path is international regulation. Although there are some guidelines, such as the recommendations of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, they lack real enforcement mechanisms. Some experts believe that the solution could be through stricter national laws that regulate the space activities of companies and governments. However, some scientists are skeptical about the usefulness of the term 'Kessler syndrome', as it may give the impression of a single, dramatic event, when in reality it is a gradual process. The accumulation of space debris does not have a clearly defined point of no return, but its progression is evident and worrying. Ultimately, what seems like a distant concern today could become an insurmountable barrier to space exploration and the functioning of many terrestrial technologies. The time to prevent orbital collapse is running out with each new launch and each new fragment left floating without control in Earth's orbit.

**Over 1,200 Objects Crashed Into Earth In 2024, Raising Kessler Syndrome Concerns: Report**
According to a recent report, over 1,200 intact objects have crashed into Earth in 2024, raising concerns about the Kessler Syndrome. The report highlights that the accelerated accumulation of space debris in Low Earth Orbit is a major concern, with more than 1.2 million objects larger than 1 cm in size capable of causing damage to satellites and the International Space Station. The report states that even if spaceflight operations were to cease completely, the amount of space debris would only increase due to fragmentation events. The Kessler Syndrome, proposed by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, predicts that a chain reaction of collisions could render the orbit unfit for human use and halt the space age. To prevent this, active debris removal is required, as stated in the report. Recent incidents, such as the crash of rocket fragments in Kenya and a portion of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in Poland, demonstrate the growing concern about space debris. 'Combined with increasing launch traffic and high levels of solar activity, the number and size of re-entering objects is also increasing,' the report noted. 'To prevent this runaway chain reaction, known as Kessler syndrome, from escalating and making certain orbits unusable, active debris removal is required,' the report added.

**Atmospheric Shrinking Threatens Satellite Capacity Due to Climate Change**
The atmosphere is shrinking due to climate change, which is a problem for the 60,000 satellites planned by SpaceX and other companies. Currently, over 10,000 satellites are in orbit, with two-thirds belonging to the Starlink constellation. The atmosphere's thinning makes it harder for space debris to burn up, allowing it to accumulate in orbit. A study published in Nature Sustainability found that if emissions continue unchecked, the atmosphere will be so thin by 2050 that the capacity to host satellites in low Earth orbit will be reduced by 27%. By the end of the century, the reduction will be between 50 and 66%. Jared Isaacman, a nominee for NASA administrator, emphasized the gravity of the problem, saying, 'even a millimeter-sized aluminum fragment traveling at orbital speed can cause significant damage.' He advocates for stopping the creation of new space debris and avoiding conflicts in orbit, which could trigger the feared Kessler syndrome.
