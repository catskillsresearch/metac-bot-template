**The Trump administration wants to shut down the agency that investigates chemical explosions**
The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) is likely to shut down before completing its investigations into the Dow chemical plant explosion and other chemical accidents. The Trump administration has proposed shutting down the agency, citing 'fiscal responsibility' and a need to 'redefine the proper role of the federal government.' The CSB's $14 million annual budget would be zeroed out for the 2026 fiscal year, and its emergency fund would be used for closure-related costs. According to CSB documents, the process of shutting down the agency is set to begin this year. 'Moving the nation toward fiscal responsibility' is the stated goal of the Trump administration's proposal, as stated in a 1,224-page budget document released on May 30.

**Taichung Lawmakers Urge Government to Complete Coal-Free Goal by 2028**
Six lawmakers from Taichung, including Jiang Qiemin, Yang Qiongye, Yan Kuanheng, Luo Tingwei, Liao Weixiang, and Huang Jianhao, held a press conference in the morning to address the issue of air pollution in Taichung. They emphasized that reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to non-coal energy is an international trend. They pointed out that the Taichung Power Plant, the world's largest and oldest sub-critical coal-fired power plant, is a major source of air pollution. With the complete shutdown of the No. 3 nuclear power plant on May 17, Taiwan's power supply has become 'all-coal', posing a threat to the health of people in Taichung, Nantou, Changhua, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. They urged the government to follow the resolution of the Legislative Yuan and quickly install gas turbine generators and decommission coal-fired generators to achieve a coal-free Taichung by 2028, as stated by Jiang Qiemin, 'It is our duty to protect the health of our citizens.'

**LGBTQ+ youth suicide and crisis hotline to end next month**
The Trump administration has announced that 'option 3' of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, specifically designed for LGBTQ+ youth, will be shut down on July 17th due to expired federal funding. 13-year-old Anya Jones, who is transgender, expresses her concerns about the loss of this service, stating, 'Having those resources there as sort of like a backbone made me feel safe and I had something to fall back on, and without it, I just feel scared and worried about everything.' Anya's mother, Steph Jones, is also worried that the remaining service will not be equipped to handle her daughter's specific needs, saying, 'I would imagine that those people aren't equipped with dealing or experience dealing with kids with gender dysphoria, who are genuinely afraid to let themselves out of the closet.' Option 3 remains available for queer youth to use until July 17th.

**Fibbing Jena, donors don’t want to get shot either | CALDARA**
Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold temporarily shut down the TRACER database, which discloses campaign contributions and expenditures, to redact the home addresses of elected officials. This decision was made after several state legislators in Minnesota were shot, but Griswold did not inform the public of the reason for the shutdown, instead claiming it was 'down for maintenance.' According to Jon Caldara, president of the Independence Institute, this action 'adds to the reasons trust in government is at an all-time low.' Caldara argues that government should be committed to recording the truth, and that redacting records can lead to a lack of trust in government. He also questions why Griswold protected the privacy of elected officials but not their donors, and notes that donors often want to remain anonymous to protect their lives and livelihoods.

**Government Effectively Shuts Down Congress Amid Tensions with Peronism**
The government has effectively shut down Congress, with the recent corruption conviction of Cristina Kirchner and a Peronist mobilization in Plaza de Mayo reducing activity to a minimum. Libertarians have resigned themselves to taking a purely defensive position, as the relationship with Peronism is at a breaking point. The PRO and UCR parties, along with governors, are advancing the electoral armament, while the fiscal presumption of innocence remains in the 'colchón' (a colloquialism for 'in the air'). Not even an informative committee meeting has been convened, and there is reticence from some dialogist blocs in the Budget Commission. The Encuentro Federal, Democracia para Siempre, and Coalición Cívica parties are among those affected.

**'Make Asbestos Great Again?': Trump Slammed for Move to End Ban on Russia-Tied Carcinogen**
President Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency is moving to reconsider the ban on asbestos, a carcinogenic substance that has caused thousands of American deaths. Critics are blasting the decision, with one saying, 'Feckless or Complicit': Hegseth Blasted in Heated Hearing Over Social Media Influencer Image via Reuters. Meanwhile, Trump is also facing criticism for his comments on Juneteenth, a federal holiday, and for shutting down the LGBTQ youth-specific branch of the national 988 suicide hotline. Trump said, 'Too many non-working holidays in America,' and 'It is costing our Country $BILLIONS OF DOLLARS to keep all of these businesses closed.' Critics berated President Trump, with one writing, 'People Will Die': Shock Over Trump Shutting Down LGBTQ Youth Suicide Hotline Is Growing. The LGBTQ crisis line has supported 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people since its launch in 2022. The Trevor Project will continue to operate independently, but it is being removed from the federal government's 988 system. 'Transgender people can never, and will never, be erased,' wrote a critic. 'Make Asbestos Great Again?' is a phrase that has been used to criticize Trump's decision to end the ban on asbestos. The substance is originally from Russia and also enters the U.S. indirectly through other sources.

**Taiwan's DPP Government Criticized for Restarting Old Coal-Fired Power Plants**
Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government has been criticized for restarting old coal-fired power plants to compensate for a shortage in electricity supply after the shutdown of nuclear power plants. According to lawmakers, the Taiwan Power Company (TPC) has repeatedly activated coal-fired power plants with expired permits, using the wrong energy policy and deceiving the public. 'If the government cannot achieve 'no coal in 2028', it's unlikely to meet the 2030 'zero-carbon home' and 2032 'carbon reduction' targets,' said Jiang Qi Chen, vice speaker of the Legislative Yuan. 'This is not just an energy issue, but also a national security issue, as 25% of Taiwan's natural gas is imported from Qatar.' The lawmakers also criticized the TPC for not dismantling the old coal-fired power plants, but instead 'retiring' them, which is different from dismantling. 'This is a scam,' said Yang Qiongye, a lawmaker. 'The world's largest and oldest sub-critical coal-fired power plant, the Taichung Power Plant, is a major source of air pollution and a nightmare for people in central Taiwan.' The lawmakers urged the government to phase out coal-fired power plants and protect the health of the people in central Taiwan. 'The government should not use the excuse of 'technical difficulties' to delay the phase-out of coal-fired power plants,' said Luo Tingwei, a lawmaker. 'This is a betrayal of the public's health and a scam.'

**Romanian lawmakers vote in favor of pro-EU coalition, aiming to end...**
Romanian lawmakers voted 301-9 in favor of a new pro-European coalition government led by center-right Prime Minister designate Ilie Bolojan. The coalition, made up of the Social Democratic Party, National Liberal Party, Save Romania Union, and ethnic Hungarian UDMR party, aims to end Romania's worst political crisis in its post-communist history. Bolojan, 56, said, 'Despite the challenges we face... Romania deserves a realistic and fair country project.' The new government will face the challenge of reducing the large budget deficit and reforming state institutions. With a growing shift toward populist parties, the government may struggle to implement unpopular fiscal measures ahead of the 2028 general election. The coalition is viewed as a tactical partnership to shut out right-wing nationalists.

**Collapse of higher education**
The quiet shutdown of postgraduate programmes at Karachi University is a concern for public education in Pakistan. More than 10 departments will not accept MPhil or PhD students in 2025 due to a lack of faculty. This is not an isolated incident, as universities have been underfunded for years, and hiring processes are politicised. Promising scholars often find no jobs or institutional support upon return, leading to a brain drain. Policymakers have treated higher education as a numbers game, but this approach has led to a collapse of institutions. To address this, the federal and provincial governments must prioritise faculty recruitment and retention through structural reform, including competitive salaries, transparent hiring processes, and clear tenure and promotion pathways. Without scholars, there can be no universities, and without universities, there can be no innovation, critical thinking, or meaningful progress.

**💸 Shutdown Showdown: Arizona Democrats Face the Ultimate Sophie's Choice Over Immigration...**
Arizona's government is on the brink of a shutdown due to a budget dispute between the House, Senate, and Governor. The main issue is funding for GIITEM, a multi-agency task force that enforces immigration laws. The Senate has passed a $17.6 billion budget that includes $24.7 million for GIITEM, while the House wants a leaner $17.3 billion budget with less funding for the task force. Democrats are facing an impossible choice: vote for the budget that funds GIITEM or risk a government shutdown that would hurt vulnerable populations. Senator Sally Ann Gonzales has called out her fellow Democrats for being complicit in the criminalization of immigrant communities by voting for the budget. Community groups are organizing to resist the GIITEM funding and are calling for a shutdown of the task force. The budget crisis is a symptom of a deeper issue: the militarization of the border and the targeting of immigrant communities. The article argues that Democrats should not cave to the pressure and should instead stand with the communities under attack. The author suggests that resistance in the borderlands can take many forms, including community defense, economic pressure, educational resistance, and environmental justice. The article concludes by calling on readers to take action and support organizations that are working to resist the GIITEM funding and the militarization of the border.

**Analysis | 2028 POV on 2025 Dems**
Potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidates are weighing in on the party's handling of the recent government shutdown. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have all made statements criticizing Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer's decision to help pass the GOP-led bill to keep the government open. Pritzker said Trump has 'handed over the reins of power to Elon Musk and his fellow DOGE-bags,' while Walz argued that Democrats ceded leverage in the shutdown fight and took attention away from holding Republicans accountable for their actions. Newsom agreed with Walz, saying Senate Democrats need to stand up and do the right thing. Meanwhile, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear lamented that Democrats suffered a 'loss of the messaging war' in this instance. Researchers at the Yale Budget Lab found that combining tax cuts with cuts to safety net programs would actively transfer money from low-income people to high-income earners.

**Schumer's vote to avoid shutdown divides Democrats**
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's decision to vote for the Republican spending bill to avoid a government shutdown has divided Democrats. Schumer argued that a shutdown would empower President Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, but his critics argue that he wasted the party's leverage to shape policy. Prominent Democrats, including Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, urged senators to block the bill, but Schumer's supporters argue that sending the government into a shutdown is never good policy or politics. The decision has sparked debate about whether Schumer should continue to lead the party, with some calling for new leadership and others questioning whether another candidate should challenge him in a primary election in 2028. 'A shutdown would allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,' Schumer said on the Senate floor. 'Let's be clear: neither is a good option for the American people. But this false choice that some are buying instead of fighting is unacceptable,' Pelosi said in a statement. 'While I totally understand my colleagues who didn't want to catapult us into a shutdown, I actually think that the American people would've understood that Republicans have an obligation to negotiate with Democrats,' Sen. Chris Murphy said. 'It's a reflection of the Democrats' frustration about not being able to slow down all of what Trump is doing,' said David McLennan, a political science professor. 'Schumer is sort of the target, but I think it's more a reflection of just the general frustration.'

**US Government Shutdown Averted as Senate Passes Funding Bill**
The US federal government was on the verge of a shutdown, but a stunning reversal by the Democratic Party in the Senate has averted the crisis. The Senate passed a bill to extend government funding, which will allow the government to operate until September 30. This is a significant victory for President Trump, and it also shows that the Democratic Party is still unable to stop him. The bill was passed with a vote of 54-46, and it will now go to President Trump for signature. The Democratic Party's leader, Chuck Schumer, had initially vowed to block the bill, but he eventually relented, citing concerns about the impact of a government shutdown on federal employees. However, some analysts believe that Schumer's decision was motivated by a desire to avoid being blamed for a government shutdown in the 2026 midterm elections. The bill will extend government funding until September 30, and it will also make some changes to the 2026 budget. If passed, it will be a major victory for President Trump and the Republican Party, and it will likely have significant implications for the 2026 midterm elections.

**US Government on the Brink of Shutdown as Senate Prepares to Vote on Budget Bill**
The US Senate will vote on a budget bill on Friday that, if rejected, would paralyze the federal administration. However, the possibility of a partial government shutdown has decreased since Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced he would support the bill. Schumer said, 'A paralysis would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk a blank check to destroy essential government services at a much faster rate than the current one.' He added that, in this situation, the White House would have full authority to consider entire agencies, programs, and personnel as non-essential, putting employees on reduced hours without any promise of being rehired. The proposed budget, already approved by the Republican-majority House of Representatives, would extend federal funding until September, giving time to agree on a full-year budget, including funds for some of Trump's campaign promises, such as his migrant deportation program. If no text is adopted before midnight on Friday, a shutdown would be declared, leaving hundreds of thousands of officials in technical unemployment, disrupting air traffic, and causing delays in certain types of food assistance. Schumer's position has caused a stir in the Democratic Party, with a hundred people protesting outside his New York residence on Friday morning. Nancy Pelosi, former Democratic Speaker of the House, summarized the dilemma of her party, saying, 'It's a false choice between a government shutdown or a blank check that constitutes a devastating attack on the well-being of American families.' Senator John Fetterman announced he would vote reluctantly in favor of the bill, saying, 'Voting to paralyze the government would punish millions of people.' Donald Trump praised Schumer's decision, saying it was 'a very wise and intelligent decision' that could lead to 'something great for the United States.'

**All eyes on Democrats as US barrels toward shutdown deadline**
The US government is on the brink of a shutdown as Democrats grapple with the option of opposing President Trump's federal funding plans. With a Friday night deadline to fund the government or allow it to start winding down its operations, the Senate is set for a crunch vote. Trump has warned that a shutdown will be the Democrats' fault, while Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has urged them to 'put partisan politics aside and do the right thing.' Democrats are under pressure from their own grassroots to defy Trump and reject a bill they say is full of harmful spending cuts. However, several top Democrats have warned that a shutdown could play into the hands of Trump and his advisor Elon Musk, who are pushing for dramatic cuts to the government. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has announced he will vote to keep the government open, saying 'it's not really a decision, it's a Hobson's choice: Either proceed with the bill before us, or risk Donald Trump throwing America into the chaos of a shutdown.'

**US Government Shutdown Looms as Republicans and Democrats Blame Each Other**
The US House of Representatives is set to vote on a temporary budget for 2025 on Tuesday, which would allow the Trump administration to avoid a government shutdown before the deadline of Friday evening. The vote is expected to be close, with Republicans aware that they are on a tightrope. Their leader, Mike Johnson, is working behind the scenes to convince some of his party's holdouts, and can count on the support of Donald Trump. Trump has called on Republican lawmakers to vote in favor of the bill, saying 'NO DISSENT'. With stock market indices plummeting and growing fears of recession, Trump is facing his first economic challenges of his second term. He knows that a government shutdown would not help the situation. If the budget is not passed by midnight on Friday, hundreds of thousands of government employees will be furloughed without pay, air traffic will be disrupted, and some food assistance programs for low-income families will be affected. Trump is keen to avoid a repeat of the 35-day partial government shutdown he experienced during his first term, which was caused by a dispute with Democrats over funding for his border wall. Both Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for the potential shutdown. 'Democrats have criticized government shutdowns, but now they're supporting one,' said Mike Johnson. 'What's changed? They're willing to do anything to stop Donald Trump from implementing his program,' he added. Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro has denounced the bill, saying it 'will hurt working-class Americans', particularly on the issue of housing. 'This blank check to billionaire non-elected Elon Musk fails to lower housing costs and instead cuts $700 million in subsidies for low-income Americans and workers,' she said in a statement. The risk of a government shutdown comes as the US is cutting public spending under the guidance of Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of Tesla and SpaceX. Musk has become a key ally and financial supporter of Trump during the 2024 campaign. As head of the Government Efficiency Commission (Doge), Musk has launched a campaign to dismantle several government agencies, accusing them of fraud and wasteful spending, and has fired tens of thousands of government employees. Before the vote, Democrats presented their own version of the budget bill, which would maintain the same level of public spending and push back the deadline for a full budget for 2025 to April. In contrast, the Republican proposal would extend this deadline to September, giving them time to work on funding some of Trump's key initiatives, such as his migrant expulsion program.

**US Congress to Vote on Temporary Budget to Avoid Government Shutdown**
The US Congress is set to vote on a temporary budget for 2025, which would allow the Trump administration to avoid a government shutdown before the deadline of Friday evening. The vote is expected to take place in the afternoon in Washington, and a favorable outcome would pave the way for the Senate to adopt the text in the coming days. However, the Republicans in the House of Representatives are aware that they are walking a tightrope, given the opposition from Democrats and their narrow majority. Their leader, Mike Johnson, is working behind the scenes to convince the few recalcitrant members of his party, and can count on the support of Donald Trump. The President has called on Republican lawmakers to vote in favor of the text presented to Congress, and has warned them: 'NO DISSENT.' With stock market indices plummeting and growing fears of recession, Donald Trump is facing his first economic headwinds of his second term. He knows that a government shutdown would not help. The Congress has until midnight on Friday to Saturday to adopt a temporary budget. Without one, hundreds of thousands of government employees will be placed on unpaid leave, air traffic will be disrupted, and certain food aid payments to low-income families will be affected. A situation that Donald Trump wants to avoid, just over a month and a half after his return to the White House. 'Millionaire non-elected' - Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for the prospect of a new shutdown. 'Democrats have criticized government shutdowns, but now they support one,' said Mike Johnson. 'What's changed? They're willing to do anything to stop Donald Trump from implementing his program,' added the Republican leader on his X account. Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro denounced the text, saying it 'will hurt hardworking Americans,' particularly on the issue of housing. 'This blank check to billionaire non-elected Elon Musk fails to lower housing costs and instead cuts $700 million in subsidies for low-income Americans and workers,' she said in a statement. The risk of a budget paralysis comes on the backdrop of clear cuts in US public spending, led by Elon Musk. The world's richest man, who is also the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has become a key ally and financial supporter of Donald Trump during the 2024 campaign. At the head of a government efficiency commission (Doge), Elon Musk has launched a dismantling of several government agencies, which he accuses of fraud and wasteful management, and the dismissal of tens of thousands of government employees.

**US Faces Possibility of Government Shutdown as Trump Urges Congress to Act**
The United States is facing the possibility of a government shutdown, three months after their last budgetary drama. President Donald Trump is urging Congress to pass a bill by Friday evening to avoid this unpopular situation. 'We'll see, but it could happen', Trump said on Sunday aboard Air Force One, referring to the possibility of a government shutdown. A shutdown would cause hundreds of thousands of government employees to be placed on technical leave, without pay, until the situation is resolved. Air traffic would be disrupted, and certain food aid payments to low-income families would be affected. The last time a shutdown occurred was in December, just before Christmas, when Congress avoided it at the last minute and pushed the deadline to March 14. Trump wants to avoid another shutdown due to its unpopularity. He recalls the 35-day partial government shutdown during his first term, caused by a dispute with Democrats over funding for his border wall with Mexico. The Republicans have proposed a temporary budget measure to fund the government until September, giving them more flexibility to pass a more comprehensive budget in the coming months. However, the fine majority held by Republicans in the House of Representatives could complicate the process. Some conservative lawmakers oppose these temporary budget measures, arguing that they only worsen the US debt. Trump has called on all Republican lawmakers to vote in favor of the measure, saying 'We must remain UNITED - NO DISSENT'. The Democratic opposition has already stated that they will oppose the measure, citing clear cuts in public services under the leadership of Elon Musk. Musk, the world's richest man, has become a key ally and financial supporter of Trump during the 2024 campaign. Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro has denounced the proposed measure as 'a blank check for Elon Musk', saying it 'closes the door to negotiations' between the two parties. If the measure passes the House of Representatives, it will still need to be adopted by the Senate, where some Democratic votes will be necessary. Each side is blaming the other for the situation. 'Democrats will do everything they can to paralyze our government', Trump accused on Saturday. The leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, has responded that Republicans are 'determined to paralyze the government and cause the economy to collapse'.

**GOP, Democrats try to assign blame for government shutdown ahead of vote**
The US government is set to shut down on Friday at midnight without congressional intervention, as Republicans try to implement a sweeping tax cuts bill through the budget reconciliation process. Democrats have had to provide votes to keep the government open since Republicans took the House in the 2022 midterms, but this time they may not be able to count on Democratic support. President Donald Trump has pushed congressional Republicans to vote for a temporary stopgap measure, saying 'Great things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country's ‘financial house’ in order.' Democrats are trying to place blame on the Republicans for the looming threat of a shutdown, while the GOP is telling voters that Democrats are trying to shut down the government. 'People who don't follow this stuff are like, ‘wait, we voted for you. You're in charge. This can't be Biden's fault anymore, and egg prices are $512 apiece, and now you're shutting the government down,’” said Alison Dagnes, a political science professor at Shippensburg University.
