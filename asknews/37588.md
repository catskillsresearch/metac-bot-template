**Canada doesn't invite India for G7 summit amid row over Nijjar killing - The Tribune**
India has not received an invitation to the upcoming G7 summit in Canada, scheduled to take place between June 15 and June 17. According to official sources, no advance preparations have been made for a high-level dignitary visit, indicating that India will not participate in this year's summit. This is the first time India will be absent from the event, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has attended the summit for the past six consecutive years. The decision is likely due to the deteriorating relations between India and Canada following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had previously stated that there was 'no information' regarding PM Modi's visit to Canada for the G7 summit. 'No advance preparations have been made ahead of a high-level dignitary visit such as that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, making it clear that India will not participate in this year's G7 summit in Canada,' the sources said.

**Canada yet to invite PM Modi to G7 Summit on June 15-17**
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unlikely to attend the G7 Summit in Canada on June 15-17 as the Canadian government has yet to extend an invitation. People familiar with the matter said that the ground has not been prepared for a reset of India-Canada relations, which hit an all-time low after former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations against Indian government agents. While positive messages have been exchanged in private between New Delhi and Ottawa, the people said that more work needs to be done for a reset of the relationship. India and Canada could make a start towards improving relations by appointing high commissioners in each other's capitals, but the Indian side has concerns about the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada. Anita Anand, Canada's foreign minister, indicated that the renewal of bilateral relations will happen 'one step at a time'.

**Narendra Modi May Miss G7 Summit Due to Diplomatic Crisis with Canada**
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not attend the G7 summit in Canada for the first time in six years due to a diplomatic crisis with Canada. The main reason for the cooling of bilateral relations remains the diplomatic crisis that began in September 2023. Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused the Indian government of involvement in the murder of Hardip Singh Nijjar, a leader of the Sikh community in Canada and a supporter of the Khalistan movement in the Indian state of Punjab. The incident led to a mutual expulsion of diplomats and exacerbated the crisis. Even if an invitation is sent, Modi's participation in the summit is unlikely due to the uncertainty in the position of the new Canadian government on issues that concern India, particularly the activities of Sikh separatists in the country. In June 2024, Modi and Trudeau met briefly on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy, expressing their willingness to work on resolving the issues. However, no specific steps have been taken to normalize relations over the past year, according to India Today, citing sources.

**PM Modi Likely To Skip G7 Summit In Canada Amid Strained Ties, First Miss In 6 Years: Reports**
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to skip the upcoming G7 summit in Canada due to strained ties between Ottawa and New Delhi. This would be the first time Modi misses the summit since 2019, when France hosted the event. According to reports, India has not received an official invitation to the summit, and the government is not inclined to attend until the relationship between the two nations improves. The G7 summit, hosted by Canada from June 15-17, will feature leaders from Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil, but India's participation is uncertain. Shama Mohamed, a Congress leader, commented on the situation, saying, 'Another masterstroke by @narendramodi! India hasn't even been invited to the G7 meeting in Canada -- a direct result of Modi and S. Jaishankar's failed diplomacy (or should we say, hug-plomacy).'

**First time in six years, India's Modi 'unlikely' to attend G7 summit in Canada**
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unlikely to attend the G7 summit in Canada due to tense relations between Ottawa and New Delhi, according to Indian media sources. This would be the first time in six years that Modi will not be attending the summit, which is being hosted by Canada from June 15 to 17. The sources cited security issues and the need for improved diplomatic ties, which have been strained since the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil two years ago. The Canadian government expelled six Indian diplomats last year over allegations they were involved in a plot against Sikh separatists. While uncertainty surrounds Modi's participation, reports suggest that South Africa, Ukraine, and Australia have accepted invitations to the summit.

**'Not Inclined To Attend': PM Modi Unlikely To Attend G7 Summit In Canada, First Miss In 6 Years: Sources**
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unlikely to attend the upcoming G7 Summit in Canada, marking the first time in six years that he would miss this high-profile gathering. According to sources, India has not received an official invitation from Canada, and even if one were extended, New Delhi is not inclined to accept it due to logistical constraints and ongoing security concerns. The security worries are particularly pronounced due to the risk of disruptions by Sikh separatist groups in Canada, who have previously urged the Canadian government not to invite Modi unless India cooperates with investigations into the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The diplomatic tensions between Ottawa and New Delhi are rooted in the unresolved diplomatic fallout from the 2023 killing of Nijjar on Canadian soil, and significant improvement in bilateral relations is essential before any high-profile visits can be considered. As one source noted, 'The relationship must improve before any such high-profile visit takes place.'

**Jaishankar speaks to Canadian counterpart Anita Anand as New Delhi & Ottawa seek to normalise ties**
India and Canada are seeking to normalize their ties after the Canadian general election, with India likely to appoint a High Commissioner to Canada within the next few weeks. According to Canadian Minister of National Defence Anita Anand, 'Thank you Minister @DrSJaishankar for the productive discussion today on strengthening Canada-India ties, deepening our economic cooperation, and advancing shared priorities.' However, it is unclear whether the staffing strength for the respective High Commissions, which was reduced in 2023, would be increased. The normalization of ties comes after a period of tension, which began when former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau linked Indian officials to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, an Indian-designated terrorist, in June 2023. Trudeau resigned in January this year, paving the way for new Prime Minister Justin Carney to become the leader of the Liberal Party. Carney has been focused on dealing with US President Donald J. Trump, who has taken aim at Canada's exports to the US. India is not a member of the G7, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi was invited to the last three summits. It is unclear whether Ottawa has invited Modi for this year's summit, which will be hosted by Carney from 15 June to 17 June.

**As Canada's Mark Carney wins, PM Modi's quick message signals a new chapter in ties**
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has congratulated Mark Carney on his victory in Canada's elections and expressed his desire to strengthen bilateral ties. The two countries' relations have been strained since Justin Trudeau's government made allegations against Indian government agents in the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Modi said, 'India and Canada are bound by shared democratic values, a steadfast commitment to the rule of law, and vibrant people-to-people ties. I look forward to working with you to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people.' Carney has signaled his willingness to reset the relationship with India and has spoken about rebuilding ties. The Indian side is drawing comfort from the electoral losses of New Democratic Party (NDP) chief Jagmeet Singh, a critic of the Indian government. A possible opportunity for the reset would be an invitation for Modi to attend the outreach sessions of the G7 Summit to be hosted by Canada in June.

**When Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Pope Francis**
Pope Francis, the first Latin American to lead the Roman Catholic Church, met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Apulia, Italy in June 2024. Modi posted on X, 'Met Pope Francis on the sidelines of the @G7 Summit. I admire his commitment to serving people and making our planet better. Also invited him to visit India. @Pontifex.' This was their second meeting, following their first meeting in 2021 at the Vatican. Pope Francis recently addressed a session on the ethical challenges and potential risks of artificial intelligence at the G7 summit. However, it was announced on Monday that Pope Francis has passed away at the age of 88 after recovering from a serious episode of double pneumonia. Cardinal Kevin Farrell said, 'Dear brothers and sisters, it is with profound sadness I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis. At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the house of the Father.'
