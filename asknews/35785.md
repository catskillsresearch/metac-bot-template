**Uncivil War: Upstart Leftists Seek To 'Clean-Up Shop' By Ousting 'Corporate' Members Of Their Own Party | CDN**
Some Democrats are seeking to revamp their party's image and reconnect with young and working-class voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The Justice Democrats, a left-wing PAC, is aiming to 'clean-up shop' in the party by ousting 'corporate' members and electing real working-class champions. Usamah Andrabi, a spokesperson for the Justice Democrats, said, 'The people of this country, particularly Democratic voters, are ready to clean-up shop in this party and unseat this large majority of corporate, do-nothing Democrats.' Longtime congressional Democrats are facing young primary challengers, and some Democrats have said that their party needs to do more to regain working-class voters and moderates. Democratic Reps. Becca Balint and Maxwell Frost believe that the party needs to talk more about working-class Americans and economic populism to win elections. 'We should set more on economic populism, talking more about the working class, the working poor, to win elections,' Frost said. 'But then when we get in office, we should do stuff on behalf of those communities.'

**GOP Representative Bill Huizenga Says He's Being 'Encouraged to Run' for Michigan Senate Seat in 2026 | National Review**
Representative Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.) has confirmed that he will attend a regional GOP fundraising dinner in June, sparking speculation that he may run for the Michigan Senate seat in 2026. Huizenga stated, 'I continue to be encouraged to run and am flattered,' but has not made a final decision. If he runs, he will face a tough primary against declared candidate Mike Rogers, who has secured endorsements from Tim Scott and John Thune. Flipping the seat back to Republican control in 2026 will be challenging, as Michigan's midterm elections typically favor the opposing party.

**US Midterm Elections: A New and Challenging Landscape**
The United States is heading towards a midterm election in the fall of 2026, which will be the second for President Donald Trump and the third for the billionaire Republican. Despite his declining popularity and 'achievements' that have not pleased voters, President Joe Biden is still considered a strong contender. Biden managed to prevent a 'tsunami' of Republican votes in the 2022 midterm elections, and limited the Democratic Party's losses. Trump, who lost the 2020 presidential election, has become a key player in the subsequent midterm elections. This time, the election will include the contest for all 453 seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the 100 seats in the Senate. Observers believe that Trump, with his return to the presidency this year, has created a new and challenging electoral landscape. Trump's supporters are optimistic about his chances, citing his ability to expand the Republican Party's base and attract new voters, including minorities and moderate-income individuals. However, the Democratic Party is also making gains, particularly among young voters and those who are dissatisfied with the current administration. The election is expected to be highly competitive, with both parties facing significant challenges. The Republican Party is trying to maintain its control of the House of Representatives, while the Democratic Party is seeking to regain its majority. The election will also be influenced by the ongoing controversy surrounding Trump's presidency, including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his relationship with foreign leaders. The outcome of the election will have significant implications for the country's politics and policies.

**How Both Parties are Messaging on Medicaid as 2026 Midterms Heat Up | National Review**
As the 2026 midterms heat up, both parties are messaging on Medicaid. Democrats are attacking Republicans for cutting Medicaid to fund tax cuts for billionaires, while Republicans are countering that they are 'protecting Medicaid' with common-sense reforms. According to a National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) strategy memo, Republicans should focus on immigration and entitlements, and argue that Democrats 'want Medicaid for illegal immigrants and no work requirements.' Democrats, on the other hand, believe that Republicans are starting off with a disadvantage on the Medicaid issue, given their traditional stance on gutting entitlements. They plan to humanize the entitlement attack line by attaching names and faces of GOP lawmakers' constituents who will lose Medicaid coverage. As Senate Republicans make their own tweaks to the bill, Democrats also plan to tie the uncertainty surrounding tariffs to Republicans. 'The one thing about the Republicans' reconciliation bill is that Democrats are united like never before,' said ranking House Rules Committee Democrat Jim McGovern. 'From the left to the right within our party, everybody understands that this is a crappy bill.'

**Trump to spend big on midterms to hold GOP majorities in Congress**
Former President Trump has amassed over $600 million in donations since November, with the potential to reach $1 billion before the midterm elections next November. Trump's fundraising prowess has not always benefited down-ballot Republicans, but multiple veteran Republican campaign operatives believe he is prepared to spend big to maintain both congressional majorities. Trump is particularly interested in blocking a majority flip in the House to preempt investigations from Democrats. As one Trump team veteran said, 'The president has a real simple choice here. Spend the money and hold the House or face two years of bulls*** from the two brain cells crowd.' Trump has also made discreet moves to boost Republicans heading into 2026, including launching a $10 million national ad campaign and releasing a stream of recent midterm endorsements of sitting, swing-district Republican lawmakers.

**Murphy: If GOP Passes Trump's Big Beautiful Bill They'll 'Get Smoked' in Midterms**
Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) warned that if Republicans pass President Donald Trump's spending bill with Medicaid cuts, they will 'get smoked' in the 2026 midterm elections. Murphy stated that the Republican Party still operates like a cult, with Trump having significant power to dictate votes. He added that if Trump forces senators to vote for $15 billion in Medicaid cuts, the party will face consequences in the midterms, as Trump does not need to stand for reelection. Murphy questioned whether the Senate will exercise independence, as it did in the past.

**Democrats target Orange County's Asian voters in first paid 2026 election ads**
The Democratic Party has launched its first paid ads for the 2026 election, targeting Asian voters in Orange County. The multilingual ads focus on economic concerns, blaming Republicans for rising prices and stock market instability. One Chinese-language ad specifically mentions Kim, the only House Republican representing Orange County, following Michelle Steel's 2024 loss. The three districts are considered crucial battlegrounds for determining House control in 2026, as Republicans defend their narrow majority.

**Trump's Team Takes Precautions to Avoid Third Impeachment**
Donald Trump's team has taken early and aggressive steps to maintain a weak grip on the Republican Party's control over the House of Representatives in 2026 - and avoid a third impeachment for Trump. According to Axios, allies of Trump believe that the Democratic-controlled House will start an investigation against the president and attempt to impeach him, similar to what happened during Trump's first term. The mid-term Senate elections are historically challenging for the party in the White House. An investigation into Trump is already on the table for the leader of the minority in the US House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries. Some Democrats have already hinted that they want to investigate how Trump reorganized the US government, whether he manipulated markets, and whether he contributed to insider trading with his tariff statements, as well as whether he helped Elon Musk with Starlink deals.

**Leaderless Democrats in search of an anti-Trump strategy that sticks**
More than six months after Trump's presidential election victory, Democrats are still searching for a message that resonates with the public regarding the party and Trump. Democratic strategist Stefan Hankin said, 'I don't think we know' what the party's message should be, while others are confident that Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' will backfire politically. The Democratic National Committee is attempting to oust vice chairman David Hogg from his leadership position due to his advocacy of primary challenges and criticisms of it. The party is also reportedly poised to spend $20 million on a project called 'Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan' to 'study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces.' Despite being out of power in all branches of government, Democrats think they have a real shot at winning back the House in the 2026 midterm elections, but Trump's approval rating has recovered since the fallout from his 'Liberation Day' duties. Trump's approval rating is net negative 2 points, but his approval is 48%.

**Both sides launch ad campaigns over budget vote as bill moves to Senate - Roll Call**
Both parties have launched ad campaigns over the budget vote as the bill moves to the Senate. The National Republican Congressional Committee announced a digital ad campaign targeting 25 vulnerable House Democrats for 'voting for the largest U.S. tax hike in generations.' On the Democratic side, House Majority Forward is planning paid campaigns to hold Republicans accountable for their votes to cut Medicaid and raise prices. A recent poll found that the measure's tax provisions were popular, with 63% in favor of 'ending the federal income tax on tips' and 61% in favor of extending the 2017 tax cuts. The bill now moves to the Senate, where several Republican senators facing competitive reelection battles in 2026 will come under intense pressure to support the measure. As one Republican senator put it, 'It will be a fistfight next week, starting Monday, with all the Republicans looking at this bill, combining it with the House.'

**Prominent Election Expert Flags Largely 'Ignored' Metric Suggesting 2026 Could Be Good Year For House GOP | CDN**
University of Virginia Center for Politics Director Larry Sabato pointed to a largely overlooked indicator that suggests Republicans could maintain control of the House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. According to a poll published by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) in April, 58% of respondents forecast that the GOP will keep the House. Sabato highlighted this analysis in his Crystal Ball newsletter, saying, 'What are we predicting so far? It would be nearly impossible to predict that Republicans would hold the House, although we've just published an analysis in the Crystal Ball from some distinguished political scientists who have used another measure -- a measure that has been ignored for the most part: what does the public think will happen?' However, Sabato personally disagrees with the prediction, saying, 'I don't buy it. Some of my colleagues do. I think the odds are substantial that Democrats will carry the House.' The NRCC has also deemed 26 House Democrats as 'vulnerable' in the 2026 midterms, giving Republicans the chance to grow their slim majority.

**Fact Check Team: Parties gear up for 2026 midterms as control of Congress up for grabs**
Both parties are gearing up for the 2026 midterm elections, with control of Congress up for grabs. According to the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, Republicans hold 220 of the 435 House seats, and Democrats need to win just three seats to reclaim the majority. In the Senate, Republicans have a 53-47 edge, but 35 seats are up for grabs, including two special elections in Florida and Ohio. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to flip the Senate. Key races are shaping up in districts like New York's 17th, Maine's 2nd, and Colorado's 8th, which are considered swing seats. Strategists are eyeing these districts as crucial to determining the balance of power in Washington. As one analyst noted, 'every seat counts' in the 2026 midterms, and the groundwork being laid today could decide who governs after November 2026.

**Democrats Unveil Ambitious List for 2026 Midterm Elections**
The Democrats have announced a list of 30 seats in the US House of Representatives that they aim to win in the 2026 midterm elections, according to Politico. The list includes 10 seats that were won by Donald Trump with a margin of 10 percentage points or more in 2024. Democrats expect a favorable environment to push them forward, even in Republican-majority areas. They are focusing on members like Andy Ogles from Tennessee, Andy Barr from Kentucky, and Monica De La Cruz from South Texas, to compete in areas where Trump won by a margin of 15-18 points last year. According to Susan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, 'Republicans in the House are feeling fear, and that's what it should be.' She added, 'They are destroying the economy, undermining healthcare, abandoning veterans, and increasing costs... In short, they have lost the trust of their voters, and that will cost them.'

**Here Are 26 House Democrats On GOP's 2026 Midterms 'Target List'**
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has released a list of 26 House Democrats who are considered 'targets' for the 2026 midterm elections. The list includes Reps. Josh Harder (D-CA), Adam Gray (D-CA), and others, who represent 'prime pick-up' opportunities for Republicans to grow their slim majority in the House. NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson said, 'House Republicans are in the majority and on offense... Republicans are taking the fight straight to these House Democrats in their districts, and we will unseat them next fall.' The list follows polls that show the American public souring on the Democratic Party, with just 27% of respondents having a positive view of the Democrats. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has shrugged off the NRCC's 'target list,' saying, 'House Democrats overperformed across the country in 2024, powered by our battle-tested candidates who won despite the NRCC's false bravado and these Frontliners will win again in the midterms.'

**Wings of Democratic Party want it to move in opposite directions**
A growing number of Democratic voters are pushing for the party to become more moderate after the 2024 election losses, with a plurality of 45% now supporting a more moderate approach, up 11 percentage points since 2021. This shift reflects a divide within the party, with liberal Democrats wanting to move further left and moderate Democrats wanting to moderate its positions. The party's leadership is trying to discern what went wrong in the election and how to counter the Trump administration's agenda, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announcing a 'Rapid Response Task Force and Litigation Working Group' to focus on countering the administration. However, the party faces challenges in countering Trump's popular policies, such as his crackdown on illegal immigration, and figuring out how to position themselves for the 2026 midterms. 'Everyone has to kind of keep their powder dry a little bit right now because it's only been three weeks,' said Alison Dagnes, a political science professor at Shippensburg University. 'Things haven't really hit the fan yet. When it does, that is when they will be able to coordinate a response.'

**House members running for governor could complicate fight for majority**
Several House members are considering runs for governor, which could impact the fight for majority control in Congress after the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats and Republicans alike are weighing their options, with some leaving behind competitive seats that could be difficult for their party to hold. For example, Maine Rep. Jared Golden's decision to run for governor or Senate could make it hard for Democrats to hold his seat, while New York Rep. Mike Lawler's potential run against Gov. Kathy Hochul could leave behind a competitive district for Republicans. Other House members, such as Reps. Andy Biggs, Byron Donalds, and Russ Fulcher, are running for governor but are likely to leave behind solidly Republican districts. On the Democratic side, Reps. Joe Neguse and Lucy McBath are considering gubernatorial runs, but their seats are likely to remain safe for Democrats. The impact of these potential gubernatorial bids on the 2026 midterm elections remains to be seen.

**Democrats on defense: 2026 projections show GOP at advantage with competitive House seats - Washington Examiner**
The 2026 midterm elections are shaping up to be a competitive battle for control of the House of Representatives. Democrats are facing a tough road to defend their front-liners and flip enough seats to break up the Republican trifecta. However, they have a small edge: Republicans hold a razor-thin majority. Democrats only need to pick up three seats to secure a majority, and their campaign arm is already preparing to go on offense. Republicans, on the other hand, are facing challenges in getting voters to the polls in midterm elections and will not have the benefit of having Donald Trump's name on the ballot. Rep. Richard Hudson, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that Republicans need to deliver on Trump's agenda, but this is a 'tall order' given the current battles over budget reconciliation and the looming government shutdown deadline. 'The math is in our favor, and it's clear House Republicans are on offense for 2026,' said NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella. 'House Democrats are in shambles -- they don't have a clear message and they're incapable of selling voters on their failed agenda.' Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Director Courtney Rice countered, 'Voters will hold House Republicans accountable for failing to lower costs while fostering a culture of corruption that benefits their billionaire backers.'
