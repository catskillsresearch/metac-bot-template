**Buying Clothes on Installments: The Key to Not Giving Up on the Latest Fashion Trends**
The trend of buying clothes on installments has become increasingly popular, with platforms such as Scalapay, Klarna, seQura, and Aplazame offering flexible payment options for fashion purchases. According to Pepa Bueno, Director of the Association of Fashion Creators of Spain, financing fashion purchases is becoming more common, especially among young people who prefer payment plans with no interest. Scalapay, which has 8,000 associated brands and over 8 million users, offers up to three and four flexible installments. Simone Mancini, CEO of Scalapay, states that the 'buy now, pay later' model has evolved beyond a simple financial solution, becoming a bridge that brings consumers closer to fashion purchases, where having access to products, whether luxury or more accessible, can completely transform the shopping experience. The report 'The State of Shopping 2025' estimates that alternative payment methods, such as BNPL and digital wallets, will represent 82% of e-commerce transactions worldwide by 2030, surpassing credit and debit cards.

**Does the free version of ESXi offer anything more than Proxmox?**
The author compares the free version of ESXi to Proxmox, a popular alternative for home lab virtualization. While ESXi has a more polished UI and is more popular in the corporate world, it has several drawbacks, including driver incompatibility issues, restricted features, and a free license that depends on Broadcom's whims. In contrast, Proxmox has a wide range of features, including clustering, high-availability, and native support for ZFS, making it a more suitable option for home labbers. The author concludes that ESXi is far from the best home server OS in 2025 and recommends Proxmox or other FOSS alternatives over ESXi.

**Aldi employee warns food prices will ‘skyrocket’ after noticing ‘bare shelves’**
Aldi customers are reporting rising food prices and increasingly empty shelves at their local stores. According to a Reddit user, 'the shelves were pretty bare' at their local Aldi store. Price hikes have been noticed, with some Aldi-brand products increasing by as much as $3.00. An Aldi employee warned that prices will 'skyrocket' due to supply chain issues and tariffs.

As the situation at Aldi reflects broader challenges facing the grocery industry, shoppers are advised to monitor prices closely and consider alternative retailers when necessary.

**AugmentCode New Pricing: It's Ridiculous**
The author of the article expresses disappointment and loss of confidence in AugmentCode due to a significant price increase and removal of features. The new pricing plan is compared to other tools, and the author suggests that AugmentCode is no longer the best value. The author notes that the price increase is particularly concerning for independent developers or those in areas where $50 is a large portion of income. The author recommends considering alternative tools, such as Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Code, which offer similar features at a lower price point. The author's main concern is the 'bait and switch' approach of AugmentCode, which has removed unlimited agent requests, a feature that was a major selling point. As one developer on Reddit posted, 'If my money making production code was on the line, I would use Augment and then write off the monthly expenses.' The author concludes that the AI coding space is competitive and evolving, and that AugmentCode's pricing change may be a sign of things to come.

**Overcoming Decision Paralysis in React 2025**
React in 2025 can be overwhelming due to the numerous options and configurations available. A recent discussion on Reddit highlighted the 'decision paralysis' that developers face when choosing the right combination of tools. React is a flexible library rather than a complete framework, and while this flexibility encourages innovation, it also means that developers must assemble their own 'kit' from a constantly expanding set of tools. The article provides a brief overview of the current landscape, highlighting five popular options: Astro, Next.js, Remix, Vite + TanStack Router, and Tailwind CSS + Shadcn. Each option has its strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on the project's requirements, the team's experience, and the timeline. The article concludes that React remains a vibrant field for innovation, but it's essential to choose tools that can be maintained in the long term. The community is large and supportive, and developers can find resources and help regardless of the path they choose.

**Alternatives to Tesla: Four Electric Cars That Are Gaining Popularity**
Tesla is struggling with declining sales, partly due to Elon Musk's statements and actions that have deterred many buyers. However, there are good alternatives to Tesla's electric cars. The Tesla Model Y was the best-selling car in the world in 2023, but other models like the Skoda Enyaq, Kia EV6, Hyundai Ioniq 6, and BMW i4 are gaining popularity. The Skoda Enyaq impressed in a test by EFAHRER.com with its range and family-friendly features. The Kia EV6 has also been upgraded and is now more comfortable and quiet. The Hyundai Ioniq 6 is a great option for those who prefer a sedan, with its 800-Volt charging technology and advanced assist systems. The BMW i4 has been a strong competitor to the Tesla Model 3 since its release and has received a significant upgrade in the past year. 'It's time to say goodbye to Musk,' says the article, implying that Tesla's brand is no longer desirable due to Musk's behavior. 'These four E-cars are a real alternative to Tesla,' the article concludes.

**Reddit Driven Hype Leads to Rigetti Computing’s 555% Stock Surge, But Volatility Looms**
Reddit's massive user base has driven Rigetti Computing's stock to a 555% increase in one month, but the hype was short-lived, with a 55% drop in the final week. This highlights the unpredictable nature of Reddit-driven trading, where market sentiment can change rapidly. According to AltIndex, eight out of ten top-discussed Reddit stocks in 2024 saw an average year-over-year return of 59%, doubling the S&P 500's growth. However, investing solely on Reddit-driven trends without real-time insights can be risky, as seen in Rigetti Computing's rollercoaster month. By using alternative data and analyzing trends in real-time, investors can better recognize potential opportunities and risks.
