**Taiwanese Tech Industry Faces Uncertainty in May Amid US Tariffs and Currency Appreciation**
The Taiwanese technology industry is facing significant uncertainty in May due to the US's 'equal tariff' policy and the New Taiwan Dollar's appreciation. Despite the 90-day grace period for US tariffs on China, the industry is expected to face increased pressure. However, some analysts believe that traditional IT companies will accelerate their shipments to the US, reducing pressure, while the memory market is expected to see a price increase due to Chinese subsidies and US demand. AI servers continue to be a bright spot for the industry, but design changes to the GB300 may delay production, leading to increased sales of the GB200, which will positively impact component sales such as assembly, cabinets, and heat dissipation. However, the easing of tensions between the US and China has reduced systemic risk and decreased stock market volatility, but individual stock recommendations have decreased, and investors should focus on companies such as Yitai (3289), Xinjin (1582), TSMC (2308), and Kinching (8210) for future performance. Analysts note that while downstream companies may see short-term revenue growth due to pre-shipment, upstream companies are affected by production cycles and exchange rates, limiting growth. In addition, the short-term recovery of PC/NB/phone/TV demand in China is expected to be offset by supply chain chaos and US tariffs on Europe, leading to instability. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to see a positive impact from the US's 'America First' policy, which is driving the production of pharmaceuticals back to the US, affecting Taiwan's CDMO industry. Specifically, companies such as Evergreen (1565) are expected to see low single-digit growth, while Mei Shi (1795) may see a decline in May revenue due to a high base in April, and Baoli (6472) is expected to see stable orders in May, with increased demand in the US in the second half of the year, while Visun's silicon water gel products are expected to see increased exports to Japan and Europe in the second half of the year.

**China's Industrial Activity Contracts for Second Straight Month**
China's industrial activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, despite a temporary ceasefire in its trade war with the US. Official data showed that factory production declined, with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling to 49.5 points. This is higher than the 49 points recorded in April, but still below the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the country's GDP continued to expand in May, with some 'US-related companies' reporting a surge in foreign trade orders and improved import and export conditions. However, the non-manufacturing PMI, which measures service sector activity, fell to 50.3 points from 50.4 points in April. Chinese leaders aim to achieve 5% economic growth this year, a target considered ambitious by many economists, given the weakness in domestic consumption.

**China's Manufacturing PMI Edges Up In May, Slight Improvement Amidst Contraction**
China's manufacturing sector showed a slight improvement in May, with the purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 49.5, a 0.5 percentage point increase from April's reading of 49.0. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the production sub-index rose above the threshold to 50.7%, indicating an acceleration in production activities. The new orders sub-index also saw an improvement, climbing to 49.8%, suggesting a rebound in market demand. However, other key sub-indices remained below the 50-point mark, including the raw material inventory index at 47.4% and the employment index at 48.1%. Analysts will be closely scrutinizing the underlying components of the PMI to gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving this marginal improvement. The slight improvement in May provides a nuanced picture, suggesting that while the sector is not yet in a growth phase, the rate of decline may be easing. 'The slight increase suggests a potential stabilisation or a slowing pace of decline in the sector,' said analysts. The interplay of domestic demand, global economic conditions, and trade relations will be crucial determinants of the manufacturing sector's performance in the latter half of 2025.

**China's Industrial Activity Shows Signs of Recovery in May**
China's industrial activity continued to show signs of recovery in May, driven by an acceleration in industrial production and an improvement in market expectations. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector reached 49.5 points in May, up 0.5 points from April. Although still below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction, the increase indicates a gradual recovery trajectory. 'The improvement reflects an acceleration of production and more positive business expectations', said Zhao Qinghe, a statistician at the NBS. The sub-index of production rose to 50.7 points, representing an increase of 0.9 points from the previous month, while the sub-index of new orders reached 49.8, signaling greater dynamism in domestic demand. Large industrial enterprises led the recovery, with their PMI reaching 50.7, returning to the expansion zone after a 1.5-point increase. Strategic sectors, such as high-tech, recorded continuous growth for the fourth consecutive month, reaching 50.9. The equipment and consumer goods manufacturing segments also advanced, with PMIs of 51.2 and 50.2, respectively. Expectations of production and commercial activity for the next months also improved, with the sub-index measuring this perception rising to 52.5, indicating optimism among entrepreneurs about growth in the short term. According to Zhao Qinghe, this result reinforces that recent efforts to boost the economy - with a focus on more intense macroeconomic policies - are starting to bear fruit. Analysts consulted by Xinhua observed that this positive movement in the indicators may signal the beginning of a more sustained recovery of the manufacturing sector, a traditional driver of the Chinese economy.

**China's Industrial Production Contracts for Second Straight Month Amid Trade Tensions**
China's industrial production contracted for the second consecutive month in May, according to an official survey released on Saturday. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 49.5 from 49.0 in April, but remained below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The PMI for the service sector, which includes construction, fell to 50.3 from 50.4. However, the sub-index for new orders improved to 49.8 from 49.2 in April, and the sub-index for new export orders rose to 47.5 from 44.7. The data suggests that further economic stimulus measures may be needed to support the economy amid the ongoing trade tensions with the US. US President Donald Trump has accused China of violating a bilateral agreement to reduce tariffs, and has threatened to double global steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. 'The recent developments between China and the US indicate that bilateral relations are not improving,' said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 'Companies in China and the US that are active in international trade must conduct their business under persistently high uncertainty, which will weigh on growth prospects in both countries.'

**Tatarstan's Industrial Production Index Rises by 6.6% in Q1 2025**
Tatarstan's industrial production index rose by 6.6% in the first quarter of 2025, driven by a 13.7% increase in manufacturing. The production of motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers grew by 10.2%, while the production of chemicals and chemical products increased by 9.5%. The fastest-growing sectors in Tatarstan were rubber and plastic products (+35.1%), metallurgical production (+21.3%), and furniture manufacturing (+20.5%). In contrast, the production of clothing (-28.4%), textiles (-15%), and pharmaceuticals and materials (-14.2%) declined. Tatarstan has surpassed Moscow in growth, with an industrial production index of 106.6% compared to Moscow's 105%. Vladislav Bukharsky, junior director for sovereign and regional ratings at Expert RA, comments, 'The industrial production dynamics of Tatarstan in the first quarter of 2025 look more positive compared to the national average (+6.6% versus 1.1%).' Olga Belenkaya, the head of macroeconomic analysis at Finam Group, notes, 'A strong increase in Tatarstan’s manufacturing sector in the first quarter of 2025 was driven by several industries, including chemical production (+9.5%), the production of rubber and plastic products (+35.1%), and the production of motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers (+10.2%).' However, maintaining such growth rates may prove challenging, as the decline in mineral extraction (-4.5%) is only slightly above the national figure (-3.7%), and the production of coke and petroleum products declined by 0.8%.

**Trump Vows to Revive US Steel Industry, But Experts Remain Skeptical**
US President Donald Trump has promised to revive the golden age of the US steel industry, which is currently on the brink of bankruptcy. The industry has been declining for decades, with production decreasing by 40% over the past 50 years. The US is now surpassed by China in steel production, with the latter producing 12 times more steel than the US. US Steel, once a global giant, is now on the verge of collapse, but has been saved by a $14 billion investment from Nippon Steel. Commentators have expressed skepticism about Trump's promise, saying that it is unlikely to increase steel production in the US in the near future. However, the decline in imports due to the April trade wars has led to a 20% drop in imports, which may help to stabilize the industry. According to some estimates, the US GDP growth rate may reach 3.8% in the second quarter of 2025, which could help to avoid a technical recession. Japan has also called for a 'swift review of tariffs' in order to reach an agreement, with Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa stating that it will be difficult to reach a deal without it.

**Tech upcycle to support growth of domestic manufacturing sector**
Despite ongoing global trade uncertainty, the local manufacturing sector in Malaysia is expected to hold steady, supported by the tech upcycle and domestic demand. The Industrial Production Index (IPI) rose by 3.2% year-on-year in March, a three-month high, driven by a rebound in the mining sector. However, manufacturing growth remained moderate due to mixed global demand conditions. Kenanga Research maintains its 2025 manufacturing growth forecast at 4.7% and 2025 GDP growth forecast at 4.8%, pending clarity on US tariffs and trade negotiations. TA Research expects a 'moderate GDP growth rate' in the first quarter of 2025, with the manufacturing sector likely to offset the drag from the mining segment. The potential imposition of a 24% tariff on certain export goods remains a concern, but a sensitivity analysis suggests that the economic impact would be contained if the tariff is capped at 10%.

**US Industrial Production Surges 0.7% in February, Exceeding Expectations**
According to the Federal Reserve data, US industrial production increased by 0.7% in February 2025, exceeding market expectations of 0.2%. This marks the third consecutive month of growth. Manufacturing, which accounts for 78% of industrial production, increased by 0.9%, the highest in a year, far exceeding market expectations of 0.3%. This was driven by a 8.5% surge in the automotive and parts index. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing production increased by 0.4%. Mining production also rebounded, increasing by 2.8% after a 3.2% decline in January. However, utility production decreased by 2.5%, with electricity and gas utility production decreasing by 1.2% and 11.1%, respectively. The production capacity utilization rate rose to 78.2%, 1.4 percentage points below the long-term average.

**Industrial Development Slows in 2025, Manufacturing Expected to Grow**
Industrial development in the U.S. is off to a slow start in 2025, with 346.2 million square feet of industrial space under construction, down from 349.6 million square feet the previous month. However, manufacturing expansion is expected to boost numbers soon, with over 100 million square feet of manufacturing space delivered since 2022 and another 100 million square feet in the pipeline. According to Peter Kolaczynski, director of CommercialEdge, 'It's not only the initial boost in activity that we see by these semiconductor, EV and battery super projects, but the supportive projects downstream that have helped buoy the construction pipeline and economic impact of the primary development.' Despite challenges such as limited location selection and access to power and water, manufacturing is expected to grow, with industrial transactions increasing from $52 billion in 2023 to $69.2 billion nationwide last year.

**Industrial Production Rises 6.5% Year-Over-Year in January 2025**
Industrial production rose 6.5% year-over-year in January 2025, according to the IPI-OJF index by consultant Orlando Ferreres. However, the seasonally adjusted measure contracted by 0.6% compared to December. The report attributed the 6.5% growth to 'the low base of comparison left by the start of 2024.' Key sectors: Machinery and Equipment saw significant growth, 'driven by automotive terminal production,' with a 25% annual increase. Automotive production itself rose 32.7% annually, reaching 30,058 units. Food production grew 9.9% annually, supported by the oilseed complex, with oil production expanding 31.1%. However, cattle slaughter fell 2.0%, while poultry slaughter rose 0.8%. Refineries also showed growth, with a 6.5% increase. Sectors with negative performance: Basic metals continued to decline, falling 8.2% year-over-year, accumulating 16 months of negative figures. However, cold-rolled laminates showed a 54.8% annual expansion. Raw steel fell 26.5%, and hot-rolled laminates fell 5.8%. Other sectors: Non-metallic minerals registered a 6.3% growth, with a 8.7% increase in Portland cement production. The report warned that 'both January and February data are exposed to high volatility due to alternating plant shutdowns in various manufacturing sectors, so it is preferable to take the February cumulative as a solid first point of the evolution of industrial activity.' 'We will see high year-over-year growth figures this year, particularly in the first half of the year due to the low base of comparison,' added the report. It is expected that the industry will show expansion driven by 'higher demand due to wage recomposition, increased credit utilization, and a stable macroeconomic context.'

**US Industrial Production Surpasses Expectations in January 2025**
In January 2025, the industrial production in the United States grew by 0.5%, exceeding the analysts' expectations of a 0.3% increase. Although lower than the 1% growth in December, this data shows a resilience of the American industrial sector. On an annual basis, the growth is 2%, marking an improvement from the previous 0.55%. The manufacturing sector, however, experienced a slight contraction of 0.1%, below the consensus of a 0.1% increase. Despite this, the overall capacity utilization of the industrial sectors rose to 77.8%, surpassing the estimate of 77.7% and improving from the 77.5% of the previous month. As the US Commerce Department reported, 'the industrial production in January 2025 was a positive sign for the US economy.'

**German Industrial Production Hits Lowest Level Since May 2020**
Germany's industrial production has fallen to its lowest level since May 2020, according to the latest data. The decline in production is also reflected in the export sector, which has seen a decrease. The economic situation in Germany is not looking good, especially with the upcoming elections and the threat of US tariffs on European goods. The country's GDP growth predictions for 2025 are already showing a negative trend, following the contractions in 2023 and 2024. In December, industrial production fell by 2.4% compared to the previous month, worse than expected by economists (-0.6%). The German Federal Statistical Office, Destatis, also revised down the growth of November. The production remains around 10% below pre-pandemic levels, the lowest since May 2020. Carsten Brzeski, analyst at ING, commented, 'The data once again highlights that industry will be a brake on German growth.' In the machinery and equipment sector, the decline in 2024 was 5.6% year-on-year, with a significant drop in the automotive sector (-7.2%) and in the production of machinery and equipment (-8.1%). However, there were positive signs from the data on industrial orders, which increased by 6.9% in December, mainly due to large orders for aircraft, ships, trains, and military vehicles. Excluding these large orders, the increase was around 2%.

**Russia's Industrial Production Grows by 4.6% in 2024**
According to Rosstat, industrial production in Russia grew by 4.6% in 2024. In December 2024, industrial production increased by 8.2% year-over-year, following a 3.5% increase in November, 5.2% in October, 2.9% in September, 2.6% in August, 3.3% in July, 2.5% in June, 5.7% in May, 4.4% in April, 3.9% in March, 8.1% in February, and 4.3% in January 2024. Vladimir Salnikov, head of the analysis and forecasting department of the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-term Forecasting (CMAS), said, 'There are many productions that close orders in December, partly such a jump is explained by seasonality. But in recent years, this seasonality has changed, as a rule, the jump in December becomes more due to the increasing weight of such closing orders in December productions.' He also noted that it's not worth expecting such rates to be maintained in the future, and his forecast for industrial production growth in Russia in 2025 is 1-2%.

**US Industrial Activity Expands in January for First Time in Over Two Years**
The US industrial activity grew for the first time in over two years in January, due to strong order numbers, but a measure of the prices paid by factories for raw materials increased, and higher ones are likely after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products over the weekend. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that its manufacturing PMI rose to 50.9 last month, the highest reading since September 2022, from 49.2 in December. This was the first time since October 2022 that the PMI rose above the 50 mark, indicating growth in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 10.3% of the economy. Economists consulted by Reuters had predicted a PMI of 49.8. The recovery, likely driven in part by hopes of tax cuts, may be short-lived, as tariffs are expected to increase raw material costs and disrupt supply chains. Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, which are set to take effect on Tuesday. Manufacturing was hurt by the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to control inflation. The US central bank began its cycle of monetary easing in September, reducing rates by 100 basis points before pausing in January due to uncertainty over the economic impact of government policies. The ISM's new orders subindex jumped from 52.1 in December to 55.1 last month. Factory production also increased. The price measure paid by manufacturers reached an eight-month high of 54.9, from 52.5 in December. Imports grew, suggesting that manufacturers were stocking up on materials before the tariffs. Factory employment expanded for the first time since May, with the employment index in the sector recovering to 50.3, compared to 45.4 in December, according to ISM's Tom Moeller, who said, 'The employment index is a good indicator of the overall health of the manufacturing sector.'
