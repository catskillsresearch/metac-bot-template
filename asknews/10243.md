**Human Evolution Continues in Real-Time at High Altitudes in Nepal**
A study by anthropologist Cynthia Beall from Case Western Reserve University, published in PNAS, has found that people living at high altitudes in Nepal are evolving in real-time. At an altitude of over 3,500 meters, where most newcomers suffer from altitude sickness, local communities have adapted and built a full life despite harsh conditions. Beall and her team analyzed the physiological characteristics of 417 women born and living their entire lives in the mountainous regions of Nepal. They found that women with average hemoglobin levels and efficient oxygen delivery to their bodies had the most children. These women had wider heart chambers and better lung circulation, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery to their tissues, which is critical at high altitudes. This is not just about survival, but about evolutionary selection, where the traits that provide fitness in the high-altitude environment are being passed on to their offspring. While social and cultural factors also influence family size, the physical advantages are clear. This is not a coincidence, but a clear sign of natural selection. Human evolution has not stopped in the distant past; it is happening right now in the lungs, blood, and hearts of people living high in the Himalayas. By studying this process, scientists hope to better understand not only the origin of humanity but also its future path. Additionally, researchers found that every blue-eyed person on Earth shares a common ancestor who lived between 6,000 to 10,000 years ago. This discovery shows how a small genetic mutation was passed down through generations, affecting millions of people worldwide.

**Delaying Artificial Intelligence The Real Existential Risk Says Joscha Bach, Scientist Says He's More Afraid That 'We Don't Build AI' - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)**
German cognitive scientist Joscha Bach believes that humanity's biggest existential threat is not building artificial intelligence too quickly, but rather not building it at all. Speaking at the California Institute for Machine Consciousness, Bach argued that climate change, super-volcanoes, and humanity's 'inability to stay aligned with survival' pose a higher risk than a runaway algorithm. He stated, 'Over a long enough time span, it's certain something will lead to our extinction... I'm much more afraid that we don't build AI than that we build it.' Bach emphasized the importance of building 'beautiful' AI, safe and aligned systems that can help steer civilization through the next evolutionary bottleneck. Without AI, Bach believes that civilization's respite from predators and famine is a temporary 'bubble' that will burst. He argues that scaling intelligent machines is the only credible way to invent planetary-scale defenses.

**The Earth's Atmosphere Will Become Oxygen-Poor in 1 Billion Years**
According to a joint study by researchers from Toho University in Japan and the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, the Earth's atmosphere is expected to undergo a significant change in the next 1 billion years, resulting in a dramatic decrease in oxygen levels. This process will lead to an atmosphere similar to that of the Earth 2.4 billion years ago, before the 'Great Oxidation Event' (GOE). The researchers, led by Kazumi Ozaki, found that the Earth's oxygen levels are not stable and that focusing solely on oxygen when searching for life on other planets may be misleading. The study suggests that the loss of oxygen will occur before the effects of increased solar radiation and the loss of oceans, making it a critical issue for human civilization and many other species. As Chris Reinhard from the Georgia Institute of Technology puts it, 'We're talking about an atmosphere that's about a million times less oxygen-rich than today.' After the loss of oxygen, plants and photosynthetic organisms will become extinct, but anaerobic microorganisms will continue to thrive. The atmosphere will eventually become a high-methane, low-carbon dioxide, and ozone-depleted environment, making the Earth a planet dominated by anaerobic life forms.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Professor Subhash Kak, a computer science expert, warns that AI could lead to a devastating impact on the human population, potentially shrinking it to 100 million by 2300. He attributes this to AI replacing jobs, making it difficult for people to have children who will grow up with employment opportunities. Kak points to AI as the culprit, saying it will replace 'everything', including decision-making in offices. He notes that demographers suggest the world population could collapse, and he agrees, stating that the world will be devastated. Kak also mentions that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who may be unemployed in the future. He refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential for humanity to go extinct.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, including decision-making in offices, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that demographers are predicting a population collapse due to AI, and that the great cities of the world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to 100 million. He also notes that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, and suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing space may be a viable option to ensure humanity's survival.

**We're The First 0.5% in Human Species  --  What We Owe The Future by William MacAskill**
William MacAskill's book 'What We Owe The Future' suggests that humans have only lived for 0.5% of their potential lifespan, which is one million years. This means that the next 99.5% of human civilization depends on how we act today. MacAskill argues that we have a duty to consider the interests and needs of future people, even if they may not exist or may be far in the future. He also discusses the importance of living in a 'high plasticity period', where our actions can have a significant impact on the far-distant future. MacAskill identifies three possible scenarios for the future: extinction, collapse, and stagnation. He argues that we need to take action to avoid these scenarios and ensure a bright future for all humans. One of the key insights from the book is that a larger population can lead to more opportunities for innovation and progress. MacAskill recommends effective altruism, which involves taking action to benefit future people, not just by being vegan or reducing plastic, but also by doing elections and donating.

**Menace on the Y chromosome: a new gene could shape the future of humanity**
The Y chromosome, responsible for male development through the SRY gene, is shrinking over generations. In 166 million years of evolution, it has lost nearly 850 genes. At this rate, the remaining 55 genes could disappear in 11 million years. This prospect raises crucial questions about the future of our species. Unlike reptiles, which can reproduce through parthenogenesis, mammals require paternal genes to reproduce. Without sperm and therefore without men, the human species would be doomed to disappear. However, nature has more tricks up its sleeve. Researchers from the University of Hokkaido have made a fascinating discovery in Japanese spiny rats, which have lost their Y chromosome and SRY gene but continue to reproduce. They identified a small DNA duplication near the SOX9 gene, present only in males, which plays a crucial role in sex determination. This discovery suggests that human evolution can develop alternatives to the Y chromosome for sex determination, offering hope for the future of humanity. The emergence of a new sex gene in rats illustrates the adaptability of species, but this process is not without risk. The emergence of different sex determination systems could lead to the separation of new species. Imagine the future of humanity in 11 million years: This hypothetical scenario, although speculative, is reminiscent of the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens, Homo neanderthalensis, and other extinct human species. Beyond biological implications, this research invites us to rethink our concept of sexual identity. If the Y chromosome is no longer the sole determinant of masculinity, how do we define masculinity? This question, long confined to the realm of biology, may soon join societal debates on gender and identity. Evolution reminds us that nature is more complex and fascinating than our categories often suggest. The future of humanity may no longer depend on a chromosome, but on our ability to adapt and evolve, both biologically and conceptually.

**Elon Musk Warns of Earth's Demise: A Billion Years to Go**
Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, has stated that life on Earth will eventually be destroyed due to the increasing energy of the sun. Scientists have now calculated the exact timing of this event. Researchers from NASA and the University of Tokyo used advanced computers and simulations to predict the long-term evolution of the sun. The results show that life on Earth will become impossible after more than a billion years, specifically by the year 1,000,002,021. The sun's increasing energy will lead to a rise in global temperatures, causing a decrease in oxygen levels in the Earth's atmosphere. As the temperature rises, life on Earth will face increasing threats, eventually leading to the loss of most oxygen-producing organisms. Only microorganisms that can survive without oxygen (anaerobic) will remain. Scientists also predict that in about five billion years, the sun will enter the red giant phase, where it will exhaust its hydrogen fuel and expand greatly. This process may cause the sun to engulf the inner planets in our solar system, including Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth. Although this event is still far in the future, scientists and Elon Musk believe that we should start thinking about the future of humanity. Musk argues that Mars could be a 'life insurance' for humanity if Earth becomes uninhabitable. In a recent interview, Musk stated, 'Mars is a life insurance for humanity. The sun is continuous in its growth, and we must become a multi-planetary civilization because Earth will eventually burn out.' Musk believes that one of the main goals of SpaceX is to make Mars a self-sustaining civilization capable of surviving without Earth's resources. He emphasizes that if Mars relies on Earth's resources, it is not a 'true life insurance.' NASA also has big ambitions for Mars, with the Mars Sample Return mission aiming to bring samples from Mars to Earth for analysis. Despite budget cuts, the US government remains committed to funding Mars missions, and SpaceX is a key player in this effort. Musk hopes that Mars will become a self-sufficient place that can support life, even if Earth's resources are depleted, before we reach a critical point. To achieve this, Musk and scientists believe that it is essential to work together to overcome the major challenges in colonizing Mars, including developing the necessary technology to make it habitable.

**Elon Musk Predicts the Sun's Expansion Will Destroy Life on Earth**
Elon Musk believes that the Sun's expansion will eventually destroy life on Earth. He stated, 'So, eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the Sun. The Sun is gradually expanding, so at some point, we will need to be a multi-planetary civilization because the Earth will be incinerated.' Musk suggests that Mars is an ideal destination for human habitation and that his company SpaceX is working on projects to make it habitable and self-sufficient before it's too late. He emphasized that it's not just about reaching Mars as a historical achievement, but about ensuring that life can continue on the planet even after Earth is no longer habitable. Musk also mentioned that another possible cause of extinction could be the impact of a large asteroid, and that the only way to survive is to look towards space. He believes that humanity has two clear options for the future: to evolve as a species and colonize other planets, or to disappear when the natural disaster occurs.

**Scientists Against the Idea of Transplanting Earth's Life into Space**
In the face of an inevitable extinction of the human species, directed panspermia - the intentional spread of microorganisms from Earth to other celestial bodies - appears as one of the last possible actions of our civilization. A recent study in the Acta Astronautica journal explores the ethical and philosophical aspects of such a decision, questioning the feasibility of transplanting Earth's life into space. Directed panspermia involves launching special spacecraft carrying simple forms of Earth's life - bacteria, archaea, fungi, and other microorganisms - to spread them to potentially habitable planets. This idea has been discussed since the 1970s, particularly by Carl Sagan and other renowned scientists. In a scenario of a catastrophic planetary-scale disaster (supernova, asteroid impact, black hole absorption), directed panspermia offers a last chance for the continuation of Earth's genetic heritage, even if it's not human civilization, but only microscopic forms of life. The philosophical justification of directed panspermia comes from biocentrism - the belief that a world with life has higher value than a world without life. From this perspective, spreading life in space becomes almost a moral imperative - the more planets contain life, the 'better' the universe is. The 'more is better' principle suggests that increasing the number of living organisms in the universe is a positive outcome, regardless of their nature. According to this logic, even if humanity does not survive, continuing the existence of Earth's life in any form on other planets is worth the effort. Another philosophical position prioritizes not just the simple presence of life, but its diversity. From this perspective, there is concern that Earth's microorganisms may contaminate potential ecosystems on other planets or hinder the emergence of unique forms of life on these worlds. In this view, directed panspermia can be justified only as an extreme measure to save Earth's biodiversity, not as a project of colonizing the universe with Earth's species. Welfareism focuses on potential suffering that may arise from our actions. If Earth's life, spread to other planets, eventually evolves into intelligent species, these beings may experience the same suffering as humanity - wars, hunger, injustice. Do we have the right to create conditions for the emergence of new intelligent beings if we cannot guarantee them the absence of suffering? Should we focus on improving living conditions on Earth rather than spreading potential suffering into space? The authors of the study conclude that the potential negative consequences of directed panspermia outweigh its potential benefits. Contamination of other planetary systems, destruction of potentially unique forms of extraterrestrial life, and creation of conditions for future suffering of intelligent beings are considered serious ethical problems. However, this study reflects the depth of the ethical questions that humanity will face as it develops space technologies. What was once science fiction centuries ago is now a subject of serious scientific and ethical discussions, and in a century may become a real choice for humanity. Regardless of our technological capabilities, their development should be accompanied by appropriate ethical analysis and responsible decision-making regarding the future not only of our species but also of life in the universe as a whole.

**Octopuses as Potential Successors of Humanity: A Post-Human World**
Professor Tim Coulson from the University of Oxford suggests that octopuses, with their advanced intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and adaptability, could become the successors of humanity in a post-human world. Their ability to manipulate objects, camouflage, and learn individually positions them as potential 'civilization builders' in changing environments. Although their short lifespan represents a challenge, their evolution could lead to the development of more complex forms of organization and communication. Coulson argues that the extinction of humans could open the way for new species to occupy the ecological roles we would leave vacant. He notes that evolution, driven by genetic mutations, will continue its course and guide the adaptation of organisms to the changing environment. Coulson says, 'Extinction is the destiny of all species, including ours, although we hope that outcome is far away.' He believes that octopuses, rather than primates, could be the natural successors, as their dependence on social networks and specific behaviors limits their adaptation to a world without humans. 'With time, they could develop ways to breathe outside the water and explore new habitats, and even hunt terrestrial prey,' Coulson theorizes. He acknowledges that predicting the future of evolution is almost impossible due to the numerous variables involved, but his analysis highlights how unexpected events, such as genetic mutations or mass extinctions, have guided the history of life on Earth. 'Is it probable that octopuses will replace humans as the dominant species? It's an intriguing possibility, but also unlikely in the short term. However, imagining it allows us to appreciate the adaptability of life.'

**Octopuses as Potential Successors to Humans: A Theoretical Perspective**
Professor Tim Coulson from the University of Oxford has theorized that if humans were to become extinct, a new species could potentially replace us as the creators of civilizations. According to Coulson, the extinction of humans could lead to new species occupying the ecological roles we leave behind. He suggests that the octopus, known for its intelligence and adaptability, could be the new 'constructors of civilizations'. Coulson argues that the octopus's ability to solve problems, communicate through color changes, and manipulate objects could lead to more complex forms if conditions allow. He theorizes that over time, octopuses could develop ways to breathe outside of water and explore new habitats, even hunting terrestrial prey. Coulson acknowledges that predicting the future of evolution is almost impossible due to the numerous variables involved, but his analysis highlights how unexpected events, such as genetic mutations or mass extinctions, have shaped the history of life on Earth. 'It is a possibility that is intriguing, but also unlikely in the short term,' Coulson says. 'However, imagining it allows us to appreciate the adaptability of life.'

**Chapter 5: A Blueprint for Humanity's Survival**
The article discusses the potential catastrophic events that could lead to the end of the world and the extinction of humanity. It highlights the importance of preparing for these scenarios and provides a multifaceted strategy to ensure the long-term survival of humanity. The strategy includes advanced technology, off-world colonization, artificial intelligence, and biological evolution. The article identifies four key strategies: colonization beyond Earth, evolving beyond biological limitations, leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, and ultimately transcending the limitations of our current universe. It also proposes a structured timeline for implementation, with Phase 2 (2050-2100) focusing on becoming an interplanetary civilization and Phase 5 (beyond 3000) focusing on transcendence. The article concludes that the end of the world is not an unsolvable problem and that humanity has the potential to evolve into a civilization that outlasts planets, stars, and even the cosmos itself.

**Countdown to extinction: When Earth's oxygen will run out? A supercomputer predicts the date for humanity's end**
A new simulation by the University of Bristol predicts that in 250 million years, Earth will become uninhabitable due to extreme heat, volcanic activity, and a superheated supercontinent, potentially pushing mammals, including humans, to extinction. The simulation, which was published in Nature, suggests that the landmasses will merge to form a new supercontinent, Pangaea Ultima, which will experience extreme heat, with temperatures reaching 50°C (122°F) in many areas. Dr. Alexander Farnsworth calls this a 'triple whammy' for mammals, and Dr. Hannah Davies believes that life will adapt, even in extreme conditions. However, the study predicts that 92% of the land will become uninhabitable, and only the polar and coastal areas may remain habitable. The survival of humanity may depend on adaptation, technology, or even colonizing other planets.

**'It's Just a Matter of Time': Researchers Challenge the Idea of Human Exceptionalism**
A team of international and multidisciplinary researchers suggests that human existence may not be as extraordinary as we think. They propose that our humanity is the result of natural evolution on our planet and the life it supports. This evolution may have occurred on other planets as well, giving rise to intelligent extraterrestrial life. According to the researchers, the emergence of complex life is not a matter of chance, but rather the interaction between life and its environment. They argue that the development of humanity was not early or late, but rather 'at the right time', when the conditions were favorable. As Dan Mills, lead author of the study, explains, 'We support the idea that intelligent life may not need a series of lucky breaks to exist. Humans did not evolve 'early' or 'late' in Earth's history, but 'on time', when the conditions were met. It's just a matter of time, and maybe other planets can reach these conditions faster or slower than Earth.' The researchers propose that, over the course of a planet's history, 'windows of habitability' may open sequentially due to changes in nutrient availability, surface water temperature, ocean salinity, or atmospheric oxygen levels. If our Earth has recently become hospitable, it would be a natural result of the evolution of the environment.
