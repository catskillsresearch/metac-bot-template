**US Fed FOMC Meeting Minutes: Check date, time of the release and what to expect**
The US Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting minutes for May 6-7, 2025, will be released on Wednesday at 2 pm ET, providing insight into the Fed's assessment of economic conditions and interest rate policy. The Fed has kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5% and believes the economy is expanding at a moderate rate, but with inflation just above their 2% objective. The Fed is concerned about the risks of higher inflation and unemployment due to trade policy, particularly the Trump tariffs. Markets expect the Fed to lower interest rates in the second half of the year, but uncertainty remains elevated. The US Fed also faces a trade-off between keeping rates high and causing a more severe slump in the economy, or lowering rates and increasing inflation. Fresh economic forecasts will be released on June 17-18, and the May 2025 CPI data will be released on June 11.

**Dollar Rides Optimism Wave; RBNZ Lifts Kiwi, Aussie Ignores CPI Surprise - Action Forex**
The US dollar has rebounded in the Asian session, driven by a shift in risk appetite following US President Donald Trump's decision to postpone the implementation of a 50% tariff on EU goods until July 9. The Kiwi has also seen a jump following the RBNZ's 25bps rate cut to 3.25%. However, the Aussie has shown a muted response to stronger-than-expected monthly CPI data, with core inflation edging higher but remaining within the RBA's 2-3% target band. The RBNZ emphasized that inflation is now within the target band and is 'well placed' to respond to both domestic and international developments. The OCR is now expected to fall to 3.12% by September 2025 and to 2.87% by June 2026. BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda highlighted the focus on short- and medium-term rates, noting that corporate and household debt is more concentrated in those shorter maturities. New York Fed President John Williams emphasized the importance of acting decisively to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched, warning that delayed responses risk making price pressures permanent.

**US Stocks Rally, Treasury Yields Slip on Trump's EU Tariff Delay**
US stocks rallied and Treasury yields slipped after President Donald Trump delayed 50 percent tariffs on the European Union. The decision was made after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Traders are optimistic about potential trade agreements, with National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett hinting that 'a few more' agreements could be announced this week. Long-term interest rates surged in May, but recent headline numbers indicate that the inflation flame has yet to be rekindled. According to Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok, consensus inflation expectations have been steadily rising, driven by tariffs and upward pressure on housing inflation. 'Inflation has for several years been moving down toward the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. But the consensus now expects inflation to rise over the coming quarters, driven by tariffs and by upward pressure on housing inflation,' Slok said. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will hold its next two-day policy meeting on June 17-18, and the second estimate for the first-quarter GDP growth rate will be released on May 29. 'There will not likely be a significant change to the 1Q25 result coming in this second release,' Lauren Saidel-Baker, an economist at ITR Economics, said.

**Trump's approval ratings, down in April, bounced back in May**
President Trump's approval ratings have been improving after a low point in April. According to recent polls from the Daily Mail, Rasmussen, and Morning Consult, Trump's approval rating is currently at 48-50%, with 49-50% disapproving. This is a significant improvement from the end of April, when his approval rating was at a net negative 7 points. The improvement is attributed to Trump's recent foreign trip and progress in trade talks with China, as well as the passing of the 'big, beautiful bill' with associated tax cuts. However, Trump remains deeply underwater on issues such as inflation, with 66% of Americans disapproving of his handling of the issue. Despite this, Trump's approval on the economy has improved to a net negative 11 points, with 42% approving and 53% disapproving. As Douglas E. Schoen and Carly Cooperman note, Trump's approval is largely due to his own efforts, particularly when he is seen as an effective dealmaker.

**Trump Postpones Decision on 50% Tariff on European Imports Until July 9**
US President Donald Trump has postponed his decision on imposing a 50% tariff on European imports until July 9, as requested by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. This decision comes after Trump threatened to impose the tariff on June 1. The new deadline coincides with the end of the 90-day truce between Brussels and Washington, during which the US has suspended a 20% tariff on EU imports, but continues to apply a 25% tariff on cars, steel, and aluminum, as well as a 10% universal tariff. The EU has also frozen tariffs on $21 billion worth of US products in response to Trump's metal tariffs. Judith Arnal, a researcher at the Real Instituto Elcano, believes that Trump's decision is motivated by a desire to 'demonstrate politically that he sets agendas for other leaders and forces diplomatic movements by other leaders.' She also notes that the EU's firm stance has hindered negotiations, and that Trump may be trying to 'call attention to the EU to accelerate negotiations.' Bloomberg Economics estimates that a 50% tariff would reduce the US GDP by 0.06% and inflation by 0.03%, and would cut European exports to the US by half. Analysts agree that neither side wants to break off negotiations, and that a deal, although not ideal, is better than no deal. Germany has urged calm ahead of the deadline, while José Manuel Marín Cebrián, an economist and founder of Fortuna SFP, describes the situation as a 'tragicomedy of finance.'

**Dollar rises as Trump delays EU tariffs, Brazil's Haddad seeks compensation for IOF reversal**
The dollar closed in the positive on Monday (26/5), opening the last week of business in the month, marked by the release of inflation and employment data in Brazil, as well as indicators in the United States. The markets welcomed the news that US President Donald Trump delayed the imposition of 50% tariffs on products purchased from the European Union (EU) until July 9. The measure was taken after Trump spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he received a call from von der Leyen, requesting an extension of the deadline from June 1 to July 9. Trump agreed to the extension, saying it was a 'privilege' to do so. Von der Leyen stated on social media X that she had a 'good conversation' with Trump, but needed more time to 'reach a good agreement.' The EU and US share the closest and most consequential commercial relationship in the world, and the EU is ready to advance negotiations quickly and decisively. However, Trump has been adopting protectionist measures to protect the US economy, which has been met with opposition from affected countries. In the domestic scenario, investors' attention turned to Brasília, where a meeting took place between President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad. The meeting was the first between the two since the government's announcement of new fiscal measures last week. Haddad stated that the government still needs to decide on measures to compensate for the receding of the IOF increase, which was initially announced but later withdrawn. 'We have until the end of this week to decide how to compensate,' Haddad said. The last week of May will be marked by the release of economic data in Brazil and the US.

**Donald Trump's approval rating is negative across the board, except for this one key issue**
According to the latest Economist/YouGov survey, Donald Trump's approval rating has fallen across the board, except for one key issue: crime. Trump's approval rating on jobs and the economy has dropped from +12 to -9, a 21-point swing. On inflation and prices, Trump's approval rating has fallen from +6 to -18, a 24-point drop. However, Trump's approval rating on crime remains positive, dropping from +12 to +6. The president's overall approval rating has also declined across the political spectrum, with a sharp decline among independents.

**Trump's tariffs will boost inflation; here's how to protect your investments**
President Trump's tariffs will boost inflation, slow growth, and increase volatility for stocks. However, investors should not panic, but rather assess the policy landscape and long-term prospects for the U.S. and global economy. International diversification and staggered bond maturities are essential to portfolios. Labor markets are weakening, and inflation for services remains stubborn at 3.7%. The reconciliation package moving through Congress will add significantly to the budget deficit, keeping it close to 7% of GDP for 2026-2028. Investors should plan for a combination of elevated inflation and interest rates. It's prudent to invest in a broad index such as the S&P 500 and internationally diversify with a broad non-U.S. index fund. Depending on age, one-fifth to half of the nest egg should be in fixed income assets with staggered maturities ranging to 10 or 20 years.

**US Dollar Faces Challenges as Trump's Tax Cut Plan and Federal Reserve's Decision Loom**
US President Trump's extended tax cut plan has passed the House of Representatives and is currently awaiting Senate approval. According to Reuters, the Senate is unlikely to accept the plan in its entirety and may make some modifications. Trump hopes to submit the plan to him for signature on July 4, US Independence Day. However, the plan is expected to severely increase US debt. The US government's debt is expected to increase by $372 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Even if the tax cut plan is not passed, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that interest payments will increase to 1 dollar out of every 6 dollars spent by the government over the next 10 years. This has led to a decrease in market demand for long-term US debt, resulting in high interest rates. If the tax cut plan is passed, the situation will be even more severe. The Federal Reserve is also facing a difficult decision: if it does not lower interest rates soon, the government's debt will worsen; however, if it lowers interest rates immediately, it may lead to inflation and a further decline in the US dollar. As a result, the market has become pessimistic about the US dollar, with the US dollar index falling to 98.82 points in Asian markets today. Meanwhile, China's gold imports from Hong Kong increased significantly in April, with 58.61 tons imported, up from 21.071 tons in March. Despite the high average price of gold in April, China's demand for gold remains strong. The current gold price in Asian markets is $3342.5 per ounce. According to 'Economic Insight' by 'Wen Zhu Pei', a chief market strategist at Hang Seng Bank, the market's pessimism about the US dollar is due to the country's inability to escape its economic difficulties.

**Trump is now receiving disapproving marks on nearly every key issue: poll**
A new national poll conducted by Marquette Law School shows President Donald Trump's approval ratings are below 50 percent on nearly every major issue, except border security, where he has a +12 net approval rating. Trump sees net disapproval on key topics such as foreign policy (-14), the economy (-16), and the Russia-Ukraine conflict (-20). He fares even worse on economic issues that hit voters' wallets, with a net disapproval of -26 on tariffs and -32 on inflation and the cost of living. The poll finds that 36 percent of Americans identify inflation and the cost of living as the most pressing issue facing the country, and 61 percent believe Trump's policies will increase inflation. Trump's approval on economic issues declined further after announcing new tariffs, which disrupted markets and fueled inflation fears.

**Polls: Trump Job Approval Stabilizing, But Still Underwater**
Donald Trump's job-approval ratings have stabilized in May after a decline in April, but he remains more unpopular than popular. According to the Silver Bulletin polling averages, Trump's net job approval improved from minus 9 percent on April 30 to minus 6.2 percent on May 15. However, some of the improvement is attributed to Trump-friendly polls, while other polls, such as Economist-YouGov and Reuters-Ipsos, show little change in their trend lines. Silver Bulletin's averages on the intensity of approval and disapproval are also stable, with 27-28% strongly approving and 41-42% strongly disapproving. Trump's job-approval ratings on handling particular issues, such as the economy and trade, have also shown little change. The generic congressional ballot also shows recent stability, with Democrats leading by a two-point margin (45.5% to 43.5%). As the 2026 midterm elections approach, this metric will become increasingly important.

**At 100 Days, Trump Approval Rating Is As Low As First Term**
Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped to its lowest point in his second term, mirroring his first term's performance at the 100-day mark. According to the Silver Bulletin, Trump's net approval rating has fallen to -9.1%, with 53.2% of Americans disapproving of him. The trend lines are concerning, with Trump's approval rating dropping into the 30s in the latest AP-NORC poll. Trump has been attacking pollsters, claiming they are 'Negative Criminals' suffering from 'Trump Derangement Syndrome.' However, the reality is that polling outlets like Times-Siena and Fox News accurately predicted the 2024 results. Trump's approval rating is deteriorating across issue areas, including immigration, the economy, and tariffs. Independents are souring on Trump, with 56% disapproving of his job performance on immigration and 70% on tariffs. Trump's unraveling of his party's coalition could be a significant challenge for his second term.

**Stagwell Inc (STGW) Releases April Harvard CAPS / Harris Poll Re**
The April Harvard CAPS / Harris poll, conducted by Stagwell Inc, reveals that President Donald Trump's approval rating remains steady at 48%. The poll highlights public opinion on various issues, including the economy, government efficiency, and international relations. The results indicate a mixed economic sentiment among voters, with inflation and personal financial concerns taking center stage. The poll also shows that voters are split on Trump's tariff policies, with 47% opposing and 45% supporting. However, 78% of voters support free trade, viewing it as beneficial to the U.S. economy. According to the poll, 'inflation and the economy are the top issues for voters.' The data suggests that while there is support for Trump's policies, there is also a demand for more effective economic strategies.

**Massive polling shift: Trump is tanking on the issue voters care about most**
President Donald Trump has hit a record-low approval rating for his handling of the economy, with a net approval rating of minus 14 points in March, according to CNN data guru Harry Enten. This is a sharp drop from the plus 6 points Trump had on the economy in January. Enten noted that the economy and inflation remain the top issues for Trump, but only 36% of Americans believe he is prioritizing the economy and 29% believe he is prioritizing inflation. Enten stated, 'They, simply put, do not believe his mind is in the right place. He is not prioritizing the problem that they think is greatest right now to the American people.' Trump's economic policies have upended global trade and the U.S. markets, with costly tariffs targeting Mexico, China, Canada, and the European Union, which experts warn will drive up prices for consumers in the U.S.

**White House mum on price relief measures as inflation stings Trump's ratings**
President Donald Trump has yet to provide formal relief measures to address rising inflation, despite his executive order on the issue 44 days ago. A White House official stated, 'The president knows his plans,' but declined to provide further details. Trump has instead focused on tariffs, which economists warn will push prices higher. Consumer prices rose 3 percent in January, the highest rate since June 2024, with energy costs increasing 1 percent and eggs reaching a record $4.95 per dozen. Most Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of inflation, with 51 percent disapproving and 39 percent approving. The White House pointed to various agency announcements related to restraining prices, including the Agriculture Department's offer of $400 million to farmers and the Treasury Department's decision to stop enforcing penalties against companies for failing to report their ultimate owners. However, economists expect tariffs to contribute to higher prices, with the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimating that the average household will face an additional $1,200 per year.

**Donald Trump's Popularity in a Mixed State as He Begins Second Term**
Donald Trump's popularity is in a mixed state as he begins his second term as President of the United States. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on March 4, 2025, only one-third of Americans approve of his handling of the cost of living, a central issue for many citizens. On the other hand, 54% of respondents disapprove of his economic policy, illustrating a growing sense of concern about inflation and rising prices. Despite these criticisms, Trump maintains a global approval rating of 44%, a relatively stable figure and higher than that of his predecessor Joe Biden at the end of his term. This situation highlights the persistence of a solid electoral base, despite growing challenges to his management of economic and social affairs. Trump began his second term with the lowest net approval rating ever recorded for a newly elected president since 1953, according to The Times. The Gallup institute indicates that his net approval rating is -1%, compared to 0% during his first term in 2017. 47% of Americans currently support his presidency, while 48% disapprove, reflecting a persistent polarization between his supporters and detractors. The economy appears to be one of the main challenges facing the president. While Trump relies on economic growth through massive tax reforms and increased tariffs, analysts remain skeptical about the real impact of these measures. Previous tariff increases have already weighed on household purchasing power and fueled inflation, a problem that his administration must urgently address to regain the confidence of voters. As the mid-term elections approach, Trump's popularity will be a key issue for Republicans, who must convince Americans of the effectiveness of ongoing reforms. If economic results do not meet expectations, his approval rating could continue to erode, opening the way for a new political battle within his own party.

**Donald Trump Could Become the First Living Leader on US Currency with New $250 Bill**
A Republican congressman, Joe Wilson, has proposed a bill to introduce a new $250 bill featuring the image of former President Donald Trump. If approved, it would be a unprecedented case, as Trump would be the only living leader to appear on US currency. Wilson's proposal cites the 'Bidenflation', which he claims has 'destroyed the economy' and forced Americans to carry more cash. He wrote on X, 'The most valuable bill for the most valuable president!' The inflation rate under Biden's presidency peaked at 9.1% in mid-2022, the highest level since the 80s. Critics have pointed to Biden's policies, such as increased public spending, energy regulations, and economic stimulus packages, as contributing to the inflation. Although inflation has decreased since 2022, reaching 3% in 2025, Trump has continued to focus on the issue, promising to eliminate it if he returns to the White House. However, a recent report by the Department of Labor found the largest increase in consumer prices in 18 months, and some analyses suggest that Americans' inflation expectations have risen after Trump's announcement of new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. According to Goldman Sachs, these tariffs could increase inflation by 1%, reduce US companies' profit margins, and provoke hostile trade reactions from other countries.

**Trump's tariff moves upend inflation expectations in financial markets**
President Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China is causing a shock in financial markets, leading traders to expect an annual headline inflation rate of around 3% for much of 2025. The delay in tariffs on Mexico for a month does not change the overall dynamic, as American businesses and consumers are preparing for higher prices, nearly three years after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains and pushed inflation to 9.1% in June 2022. According to MarketWatch, the tariffs are translating into a significant shift in market-based inflation expectations.

**Trump Criticizes Fed and Powell, Vows to Address Inflation through Energy Policy**
US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate target range at 4.25% to 4.5%, citing stable economic growth and high inflation. However, US President Donald Trump expressed strong dissatisfaction with this decision, criticizing the Fed and Powell for failing to control inflation and accusing them of poor banking regulation. Trump vowed to address inflation through energy policy, reducing unnecessary regulations, rebalancing international trade, and revitalizing US manufacturing. Trump has a long-standing tense relationship with Powell, whom he appointed as Fed Chairman in 2018 but later criticized for lacking independence. Trump has not ruled out reappointing Powell in 2026, but has also threatened to fire him. The Fed is currently taking a wait-and-see approach, awaiting Trump's economic policies to evaluate their impact on inflation and labor markets. Economists predict that the Fed may lower interest rates in June 2025, but some argue that Trump's tariffs and immigration policies may push inflation higher, forcing the Fed to reconsider its rate-cutting plans. Nick Timiraos, a WSJ reporter known for his Fed-watching, noted that Trump's criticism of Powell focuses on the Fed's 'dereliction of duty' in regulating banks and addressing inflation, but does not directly call for rate cuts. This suggests that Trump's economic policies are still in flux, or that he is trying to pressure the Fed through other means rather than directly intervening in rate decisions.
