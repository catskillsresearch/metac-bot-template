**Editorial: Shifting the scales requires bold action**
The government's proposal to offer free weight-loss drugs for those with a body mass index of over 35 has been met with criticism, with Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela describing the drugs as a 'quick fix'. However, experts agree that a multifaceted approach is necessary to tackle the obesity epidemic, which has failed to make significant progress despite decades of initiatives. The World Health Organisation predicts that the number of people with obesity will double by 2035. Research has shown that obesity is a complex, costly, and chronic disease caused by factors beyond an individual's control, including the addictive effects of ultra-processed food. Abela has proposed a 'multifaceted approach' that includes policy decisions to shape the food environment, addressing social and economic factors, and increasing collaboration with the private sector and professionals on the ground. He has also floated the introduction of a sugar tax and announced a research programme on food labelling, supply, and promotion. Abela's efforts are seen as a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to make obesity a national priority and safeguard future generations from the long-term health and economic consequences of the disease.

**80% of People with Obesity are Women, Says Nutritionist**
According to Daisy Rivas, a nutritionist at the Teófilo Dávila hospital, there is a high percentage of obesity in the country, with at least 10-13 out of 15 patients she sees per week suffering from obesity, and the majority of them are women. Rivas emphasizes that this problem affects people of all ages, from children to adults and the elderly, with around 80-90% of patients presenting with obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1 billion people (1 in 8) worldwide suffer from obesity, a figure that was expected to reach 2030 but has already become a reality in 2024. Rivas highlights the importance of education in preventing obesity, suggesting that parents, especially mothers, learn and teach their children how to eat a balanced diet. She also warns against the dangers of processed and ultra-processed foods, as well as fast food, which can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Rivas recommends consulting a nutritionist for a personalized treatment plan, rather than following 'miracle diets' that can cause imbalances and harm. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) promotes strategic lines of action through public policies and intersectoral interventions to address obesity as a national problem.

**Filatova: Excess weight has a negative impact on the Russian economy**
Deputy of the State Duma Irina Filatova stated that people with excess weight have a very negative impact on the Russian economy. According to her, obesity is directly linked to the growth of diabetes cases, which have doubled in the last 15 years. Filatova noted that over 60% of Russians have excess weight, which leads to increased blood sugar levels, loss of productivity, and increased healthcare costs. Filatova's statement was unexpected, but experts warn that the global problem of obesity may reduce the world's GDP by 2.9% by 2035, equivalent to $4 trillion.

**Turkey sees sharp rise in obesity**
Turkey is experiencing a sharp rise in obesity, with 66.8% of its population affected, according to a 2022 WHO report. By 2030, it's estimated that 27 million people in Turkey will be obese, or one in three. Experts attribute this trend to insufficient nutrition, social inequality, unhealthy food supplies, and a lack of coherent policy strategies. Hacer Foggo, a Turkish poverty researcher, said the growing number of obese children can be linked to extreme poverty, while Bulent Sik, a food researcher, sees a direct link between the rise in child obesity and the widespread consumption of highly processed foods with low nutritional value and a high sugar content. Sik also warned of the use of toxic chemicals in food production, such as pesticides and certain additives that are related to hormonal imbalances and weight gain. Turkey's Health Ministry has launched a national public health campaign to combat obesity, but experts say the effort has drawn criticism for stigmatizing overweight individuals and overlooking the country's broader economic struggles. 'Political decision-makers are responsible for creating solutions,' said Sik. Both Sik and Foggo support a nationwide free school meal program, citing the need for adequate guidelines for healthy eating and restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods.

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**2025's Most Overweight and Obese Cities in the U.S.**
According to a study by WalletHub, nearly 42 percent of U.S. adults are classified as obese, with some areas of the country struggling more than others. The study compared 100 of the most populated U.S. metro areas across 19 key indicators tied to weight problems, including physically inactive adults, projected obesity rates by 2030, and access to healthy foods. The findings highlight the need for collective action to address the obesity epidemic, which is costing an estimated $190.2 billion annually in medical treatments and $4.3 billion in productivity losses due to work absenteeism. As one expert notes, 'change must happen not just individually but collectively.'

**60% of adults will be overweight by 2050; experts reveal 4 ways to reverse this trend**
A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) analyzed data from 204 countries and found that the number of overweight and obese people has increased from 929 million in 1990 to 2.6 billion in 2021. If current trends continue, by 2050, 3.8 billion adults (around 60% of the world's adult population) will be carrying excess weight. The study highlights several factors contributing to this trend, including a predicted 121% increase in obesity among children and adolescents. However, co-author Jessica Kerr emphasizes that 'Much stronger political commitment is needed to transform diets within sustainable global food systems.' Key strategies include policy shifts and individual commitment to pave the way for a healthier future.

**More than half of adults will be obese or overweight by 2050, study finds**
A new study published in The Lancet warns that more than half of adults and almost a third of children and young people will be obese or overweight by 2050, representing over 3.8 billion adults and 746 million children and adolescents. The researchers attribute this to a 'monumental societal failure' to tackle the problem, which has already more than doubled over the past three decades, affecting over 2.1 billion adults and 493 million young people. The study's lead author, Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, stated, 'The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental social failure.' The researchers emphasize the need for governments to focus on improving access to healthy diets, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where health systems are struggling to cope with the coming disease burden. According to the World Obesity Atlas, 79% of adults and 88% of children with obesity and overweight will be living in low- and middle-income countries by 2035, highlighting the urgent need for action.

**Most adults, a third of children will be overweight or obese by 2050: Study**
A new study published in The Lancet warns that nearly 60% of the global adult population and a third of all children will be overweight or obese by 2050 unless governments take action. The researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years, with the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Latin America and the Caribbean regions being particularly affected. The study's lead author, Emmanuela Gakidou, said, 'The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure.' Study co-author Jessica Kerr emphasized the need for 'much stronger political commitment' to transform diets and improve living environments. The study also highlighted that poor diet and sedentary lifestyles are clear drivers of the obesity epidemic, but there remains doubt about the underlying causes. A separate study, the World Obesity Atlas, also raised concerns about the impact of obesity on developing countries, with 79% of adults and 88% of children with obesity and overweight expected to live in low- and middle-income countries by 2035.

**Obesity: '60% of adults' will be affected 'by 2050', a study warns**
A study published in The Lancet warns that if governments do not take immediate action, 60% of adults, or 3.8 billion people, and nearly a third of children and adolescents, or 746 million, will be overweight or obese by 2050. The study, which includes data from 204 countries and territories, is based on the Global Burden of Disease, a large program funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to compile health data from most countries. The authors estimate that the inaction of governments in the face of the growing crisis of obesity and overweight over the past 30 years has led to an alarming explosion in the number of people affected. Between 1990 and 2021, this number almost tripled among adults over 25 years old, from 731 million to 2.11 billion, and more than doubled among children and adolescents aged 5-24, from 198 million to 493 million. 'Without urgent policy reform and concrete actions, 60% of adults, or 3.8 billion people, and nearly a third (31%) of children and adolescents, or 746 million, will be overweight or obese by 2050,' according to the study. To face 'one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century,' it is necessary to adopt five-year action plans (2025-2030) with key measures: 'regulate the advertising of ultra-processed foods, integrate sports infrastructure and playgrounds into schools, encourage breastfeeding and balanced diets from pregnancy, and develop nutrition policies adapted to each country,' say its authors. 'In 2050, one in three young people suffering from obesity, or 130 million, will live in two regions: North Africa and the Middle East, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean, with serious health, economic, and social consequences,' they note. Obesity among young people is expected to jump by 121% worldwide, with a total of 360 million children and adolescents obese by 2050. The first affected, with a strong expected increase from 2022-2030 worldwide, are boys aged 5-14: in 2030, we should count in this category more obese (16.5%) than overweight young people (12.9%). This obesity epidemic will further strain already overburdened healthcare systems, particularly in low-resource countries, as nearly a quarter of obese adults worldwide will be 65 years or older in 2050. 'Preventing obesity must be a top priority in policies in low- and middle-income countries,' estimates Dr. Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia, one of the main co-authors of the study. She calls for 'much stronger political commitment' in favor of 'global strategies that improve nutrition, physical activity, and living environments for people,' judging the window of action to be short.

**12% Indians are overweight or live with obesity compared to 49% Americans: Lancet study**
According to a Lancet study, 12.41% of Indians (180 million out of 1.45 billion) are overweight or living with obesity, compared to 49.71% of Americans (172 million out of 346 million). The study found that the number of adults classified as overweight or obese has increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, with 2.11 billion adults and 493 million children and young people affected. The report warns that if current trends continue, more than half of adults and a third of children and young people worldwide will be overweight or obese by 2050, posing a significant threat to public health. As Dr. [no specific doctor is quoted in the article], said, 'substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.'

**1.13 Billion Adults to be Affected by Obesity by 2030, Warns World Obesity Federation**
According to a report by the World Obesity Federation, 1.13 billion adults worldwide will be affected by obesity by 2030, representing 50% of the total population. This is up from 2 billion (40%) in 2015 and 1.6 billion (36%) in 2010. The report also highlights that the Samoa American is the country with the highest percentage of adults with obesity (77%), while Vietnam has the lowest (2%). The president of the World Obesity Federation, Simón Barquera, stated, 'It is clear that obesity is on the rise and it is also clear that many countries are not prepared to face what is a growing problem for populations.' Barquera emphasized that obesity is a 'serious disease in its own right' and a 'driver' for non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke. He also noted that 'more people die from obesity than in traffic accidents each year.' The report recommends five key policies to combat obesity, including taxes on sugary drinks, taxes on high-fat, high-sugar, and high-salt foods, subsidies for healthier foods, restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods to children, and taxes and incentives to promote physical activity.

**Expert Warns: Over 60% of World Population May Be Obese by 2030**
According to Dr. Mehmet Alper Öztürk, the rate of obesity worldwide is increasing rapidly. He predicts that by 2030, more than 60% of the world's population will be obese. Additionally, he stated that one in four women and one in five men are overweight or obese. Dr. Öztürk emphasized that obesity shortens life expectancy and has negative effects on health. However, he clarified that surgery is not recommended for every obese patient, but rather for those who are 10-15 kilograms overweight. He also mentioned that after surgery, patients can lose an average of 20 kilograms in 3 months, and that the severity of skin sagging depends on the patient's age and physical activity level. Dr. Öztürk stated that patients start drinking water and soup 24 hours after the operation.
