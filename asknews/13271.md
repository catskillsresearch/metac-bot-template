**China and Russia Plan to Build Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2035**
China and Russia are planning to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2035 as part of a joint space program. The plant will provide energy to the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), a base that will serve as a scientific research center on the Moon. The initiative is part of a joint strategy between the two countries to expand their presence in space and counter the US-led Artemis program. The ILRS will be built with the support of several partner countries and will be located near the lunar south pole, one of the most promising regions for future explorations. The station will be able to operate autonomously for long periods and will also be capable of receiving short-term manned missions. The project was announced in 2017 and has already received support from countries such as Pakistan, Venezuela, Belarus, Azerbaijan, South Africa, Egypt, Nicaragua, Thailand, Serbia, Senegal, and Kazakhstan. China plans to expand the collaboration through the Project 555, inviting 50 countries, 500 research institutions, and up to 5,000 foreign scientists. The construction of the nuclear power plant on the Moon will be essential to ensure the operation of the ILRS, as energy generation is one of the main challenges of staying in space. Additionally, the Moon's natural resources, such as metallic oxides, regolith, rare earths, and helium-3, are considered highly valuable. The latter, in particular, may be a possible fuel for future nuclear fusion reactors. China has intensified its presence in space, with its leadership in lunar missions gaining attention. Since 2013, the country has sent uncrewed spacecraft to the Moon and has conducted detailed mappings of the lunar surface, including the hidden side of the satellite. In June 2024, China became the first country to collect samples of rocks from this hemisphere, a feat unprecedented in the history of space exploration. The Chang'e-8 mission, scheduled for 2028, will mark the beginning of the installation of the ILRS base and will also be China's first attempt to land an astronaut on the lunar surface.

**'Resilience': Japan Returns to the Moon with Ambitious New Goal**
The Japanese company ispace has released a stunning image of the lunar surface, taken by its Resilience spacecraft, currently in lunar orbit. The image shows the South Pole of the Moon, with an irregular landscape of craters, which has fascinated the public. ispace wrote, 'What do you see: craters or protuberances?' sparking curiosity among observers and enthusiasts. Resilience was launched on January 15 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, sharing the flight with another commercial spacecraft, Blue Ghost of Firefly Aerospace. The latter successfully landed on March 2, becoming the 2nd commercial vehicle to ever touch the lunar surface, after Odysseus of Intuitive Machines in February. Resilience chose a slower but more energy-efficient trajectory, arriving in lunar orbit on May 6. Its goal is to land in the Mare Frigoris region, a vast volcanic plain located in the northern hemisphere of the Moon. This attempt represents a crucial moment for ispace and Japan, which celebrated its first successful lunar landing in January 2024 with the SLIM lander operated by the national space agency JAXA. ispace's first mission in 2023 ended in failure just a few meters from the lunar surface. On board Resilience are 5 scientific and technological payloads, including the small rover Tenacious, designed by ispace's European division. The robot will attempt to collect lunar soil samples, part of a contract signed with NASA in 2020. Additionally, the front of Tenacious features an artwork, Moonhouse, by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg. If Resilience successfully lands on June 5, it will be a technical victory, but also a step towards increasing collaboration between public and private entities in space, and a demonstration of Japan's ability to innovate in the lunar landscape.

**SpaceX's Starship Prepares for 9th Flight: A Crucial Test for Reusable Rockets**
SpaceX is preparing to launch Starship, its 9th flight, on May 27th or 28th, with the goal of reusing the Super Heavy booster for the first time. This test is crucial for the development of reusable rockets. The Super Heavy booster was used in the 7th flight in January and will be used again in this flight, with only 4 of its 33 Raptor engines replaced. The test will also evaluate the durability and reliability of critical components in real conditions. After two failed tests earlier this year, SpaceX has revised its procedures and is taking maximum precautions for this mission. If conditions permit, the launch will take place within a 30-minute window between 23:30 and 00:00 GMT. The mission is expected to last around an hour, with numerous experimental tests conducted. The Super Heavy booster will not attempt to land on the Mechazilla platform, but will instead make a controlled landing in the Gulf of Mexico around 7 minutes after launch. This decision is intended to preserve the integrity of the Starbase infrastructure. The Starship upper stage will perform a series of experiments in suborbital orbit, including: The Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, with a total height of 123 meters. Its fully reusable architecture is designed to carry payloads and, in the future, humans to low Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars. NASA has already selected Starship as the vehicle for the Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the Moon in 2027. The launch will be streamed live and for free starting at 23:00 GMT on May 27th, on the SpaceX website, X profile, and X TV app. In case of a delay, alternative dates are May 28th and 29th.

**China and Russia Plan to Build Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2035**
China and Russia plan to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2035 to supply energy to the future International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), a lunar base where scientific research will be conducted. The cooperation memorandum for the project was signed this week between the Russian space agency Roscosmos and the National Space Administration of China (CNSA). The ILRS involves over a dozen international partners and is seen as a rival to NASA's Artemis lunar exploration program. The Artemis program aims to build a lunar orbital space station called Gateway starting from 2027. In addition to the United States, 55 other countries are involved in the project, including the European Space Agency (ESA). The ILRS project aims to establish a scientific research base on the Moon, located 100 kilometers from the lunar south pole, with autonomous long-term operations and short-term manned missions. 'The station will conduct fundamental space research and test technologies for long-term non-manned operations of the ILRS, with the prospect of human presence on the Moon,' said Roscosmos in a statement. The project was announced for the first time in 2017 and involves the participation of Pakistan, Venezuela, Belarus, Azerbaijan, South Africa, Egypt, Nicaragua, Thailand, Serbia, Senegal, and Kazakhstan. China plans to invite 50 countries, 500 international scientific research institutions, and 5,000 foreign researchers to join the ILRS as part of its Project 555, said Wu Weiren, chief designer of China's lunar exploration program, last year. Although the ILRS aims to be a scientific research center, the Moon's natural resources are also attractive to nations exploring space. The satellite has valuable metallic oxides, lunar regolith, rare earths, and possibly significant quantities of helium-3, a potential fuel for nuclear fusion energy. China will lead the future space exploration? The ILRS is part of China's strategy to become a leader in space exploration and scientific research. The first pieces of the lunar base will be installed by the Chinese mission Chang'e-8 in 2028, which will also mark China's first attempt to land an astronaut on the lunar surface. Beijing has sent unmanned vehicles to the Moon since 2013. Its scientists have led missions that mapped the lunar surface, including the 'dark side of the Moon,' the lunar hemisphere always facing the opposite side of the Earth. In June 2024, China became the first country to collect rocks from the dark side of the Moon. The mission was hailed by the Chinese, with the state news agency Xinhua describing it as 'a feat unprecedented in human lunar exploration history.'

The 'Blue Ghost' spacecraft, launched by Firefly Aerospace, is scheduled to land on the Moon on March 2, 2025, after orbiting the Moon for about a month. The landing is considered a challenging task, as demonstrated by previous missions. If successful, it would be the second commercial lunar landing, following Intuitive Machines' private lunar landing in February 2024. The 'Blue Ghost' spacecraft is equipped with 10 scientific instruments for the CLPS initiative of NASA, and is planned to land in the Mare Crisium region, where it will remain active for a lunar day (about 14 Earth days). The spacecraft will capture high-resolution images during the total lunar eclipse on March 14, but will actually experience a solar eclipse as the Earth blocks the Sun's light.

**50 years after Apollo, Nasa's private Moon fleet eyes two lunar landings in week**
Two private missions, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost Mission 1 and Intuitive Machines' IM-2, are set to land on the Moon within a week, marking a significant push by Nasa and its industry partners to make Moon landings routine. Blue Ghost, carrying ten instruments, is targeting touchdown near Mons Latreille on March 6, while IM-2, featuring a lander named Athena, will land on March 16 near Mons Mouton. Athena carries a unique hopping drone, a drill, and three rovers, and will demonstrate a Nokia cellular network connection to the lander and hopper. This comes as Nasa's $2.6 billion Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program aims to make private lunar missions routine, amid speculation that the agency may scale back or cancel its Artemis lunar program in favor of prioritizing Mars exploration.

**NASA to Launch Six Commercial Lunar Missions in 2025**
The NASA plans to launch six commercial lunar missions in 2025 as part of its Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Several private companies, including Firefly Aerospace, ispace, and Intuitive Machines, are involved in these missions, each with specific scientific objectives. The NASA is set to launch a lunar lander in February 2025 to study the Moon's surface, marking the third lunar mission of the year, following the launch of Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost on January 15 and ispace's Resilience lander. The NASA is collaborating with private companies to increase the number of missions compared to 2024, when the first commercial lunar landing was successfully achieved with Intuitive Machines' Odysseus spacecraft. As the article states, 'L'agence spatiale américaine n'a peut-être pas les moyens, mais elle a des ambitions.' (The American space agency may not have the means, but it has ambitions.)

**NASA moon missions in 2025: Five missions will help astronauts return to the moon**
NASA is planning five uncrewed missions to the moon in 2025 as part of its Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The missions will use landers, rovers, and orbiters to analyze lunar soil, bolster communications systems, and search for water ice. According to NASA, the missions will help humans return to the lunar surface by 2027. The CLPS missions include the Blue Ghost lander, Resilience, Intuitive Machines 2, Lunar Trailblazer, and Griffin Mission 1. These missions will carry scientific instruments to the lunar surface, including devices to analyze lunar rock samples, evaluate navigation systems, and test ways of keeping lunar dust from interfering with landers. 'The CLPS missions will take the Blue Ghost lander, which resembles a smaller version of the Apollo lunar descent module, to the lunar surface,' said a NASA spokesperson. 'The devices will be used to analyze lunar rock samples, evaluate navigation systems, and test ways of keeping lunar dust from interfering with landers.' The first crewed mission, Artemis II, is scheduled to launch in April 2026, and the first planned human landing on the moon, Artemis III, is set to launch in mid-2027.
