**Jefferies Downgrades Rivian Stock Rating Due to Weaker Demand Forecast**
Jefferies downgraded Rivian's stock rating to 'Hold' from 'Buy' due to a weaker demand forecast, despite improvements in cost control and software monetization. The company maintained its target price of $16. 'The first-quarter results were boosted by the recognition of $1.3 billion in licensing revenue from Volkswagen,' said Jefferies analysts, citing Rivian's recognition of a portion of the intellectual property licensing fee. While this accounting improvement lifted results, Jefferies also noted operational progress, stating that Rivian 'achieved further cost reduction per vehicle to ~$73,000, down 11,000 from the fourth quarter... and roughly 25,000 below Gen1 year ago.' Despite cost improvements, Jefferies expressed concern over vehicle sales volume and free cash flow. The firm reduced its forecast for units sold in 2025 by 12% to 43,000, within Rivian's forecast range of 40,000 to 46,000. As a result, free cash flow estimates worsened by $300 million to a projected negative $2.8 billion. 'We like the Rivian brand capital story and software achievements, but with a pessimistic demand forecast this year, we're left waiting for updates on R2 progress and hoping for third-party opportunities,' wrote analysts. Jefferies now expects a gross margin of 9% in 2025, considering a main automotive margin of negative 11%, ZEV credits of 6%, and software margin of 35%.

**Jeffries Downgrades Rivian to 'Hold' Citing Weak Demand Visibility**
Jeffries analysts downgraded Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) to 'hold' from 'buy' citing weak demand visibility. Despite improving cost management and software revenue, the analysts noted that the first-quarter earnings were boosted by the recognition of a portion of the $13 billion intellectual property license fee received from Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p). The analysts emphasized that Rivian has improved its cost per vehicle to around $73,000, which is lower than the fourth-quarter level by $11,000 and $25,000 lower than the first-generation model from a year ago. However, they expressed concerns about vehicle sales and free cash flow. Rivian reduced its 2025 sales forecast by 12% to 43,000 units, which is within its guidance range of 40,000 to 46,000 units. As a result, the free cash flow forecast is expected to worsen by $3 billion to a negative $28 billion. The analysts stated, 'We are evaluating Rivian's brand value and software results, but due to pessimistic demand visibility, we can only wait for the latest R2 progress information and expect third-party opportunities.' Jeffries currently assumes a 9% gross margin for 2025, which includes a negative 11% margin for the core automotive business, 6% for ZEV credits, and 35% for software profitability. The analysts noted that the software revenue growth and tax benefits have offset the weakness in sales, but the company still faces challenges. They stated, 'We expect Rivian to have sufficient capital until the mid-2026 release of R2, but additional equity capital may be needed thereafter.' The analysts downgraded Rivian due to the valuation being 2.2 times the 2025 revenue forecast, which they believe reflects the balance between risk and return.

**New Energy Vehicle Market to Maintain 30% Growth Rate in 2025, Report Predicts**
A report released by the China Electric Vehicle Association and Ris Strategy Consulting predicts that the new energy vehicle market will maintain a 30% growth rate in 2025, with a total sales volume of 16.5 million vehicles, including exports, and a domestic market penetration rate exceeding 55%. The report highlights that the new energy vehicle market demand has undergone a structural change, with replacement and upgrade demands becoming the core driving force. Consumers' automotive consumption demands will shift from 'whether to have' to 'how good it is'. The report also notes that the industry has entered the 'technology democratization' stage, with new energy vehicles accelerating their penetration into third- and fourth-tier cities, especially plug-in hybrid and extended-range vehicles, which have less dependence on charging infrastructure. According to the report, by 2024, the sales growth rate of new energy vehicles in third- and fourth-tier cities reached 63%, which is 1.6 times that of first- and second-tier cities. The report also highlights the importance of emerging technologies in the 'how good it is' demand layer, with AI cockpit and intelligent chassis becoming new hotspots. The report suggests that carmakers should focus on differentiated competition by creating new product categories, based on consumer segmentation logic and attention factors, and identifying and grasping cognitive gaps. Additionally, the report recommends that carmakers should accelerate their overseas expansion, leveraging their global brand's higher cognitive power to reverse the sales momentum in the Chinese market. According to the report, Chinese new energy vehicle brands have already mastered key new energy technologies, with three-electric and intelligent driving patents accounting for over 60% of the global share. In the 'cognitive competition' outside of the 'heart-mind struggle', the report also analyzes the 'market competition' and 'technical competition' faced by carmakers. From the perspective of regional market characteristics, the report notes that the northern and southern markets have different preferences for new energy vehicle technology routes. In the northern market, plug-in hybrid and extended-range vehicles have become the most popular choice due to their 'normal use of electricity, winter use of oil' advantage; while in the southern market, pure electric vehicles will become the mainstream energy form to drive the penetration of the southern market. To address the 'technical competition', the report emphasizes the importance of chip, algorithm, and data in intelligent vehicles, noting that technology leadership is not just about simple technology stacking, but rather about converting technology leadership into category leadership through super-intelligence and super-functionality, in order to achieve premium pricing.

**Jefferies downgrades this electric vehicle stock, calls demand outlook 'downbeat'**
Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois downgraded Rivian shares to 'hold' from 'buy', citing a 'downbeat' demand outlook and the need for the company to demonstrate sustainable positive gross margin and a more capital-efficient business model. Houchois noted that while Rivian beat analyst expectations in its first-quarter earnings report and reaffirmed its adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year, the company has cut its full-year delivery forecast. He hopes for more information on progress with the R2 line and third-party business opportunities. Houchois' $16 price target reflects 7.6% upside from Tuesday's close. Shares ticked 1.7% lower before the bell on Wednesday following the call, after rising more than 11% this year.

**Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe shares more detailed images of the R2's Maximus drive unit**
Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe shared more detailed images of the R2's Maximus drive unit, which will propel the upcoming R2 EVs. The drive unit uses a new continuous winding technique that reduces the total welds per stator and overall cost. In comparison, Rivian's current Enduro drive unit requires 264 stator welds, while Maximus only needs 24. Scaringe expressed excitement about the progress of the Rivian team's Maximus drive unit, highlighting its design efficiency, including a 41% reduction in inverter part count and a structural inverter lid that serves as the drive unit mount.

**Rivian Deliveries Tank, but It's Not Time to Panic | The Motley Fool**
Rivian Automotive delivered 8,640 vehicles in the first quarter, a 36% drop from the prior year's 13,588 deliveries. Although this result was ahead of analysts' estimates, it still caused a 5% drop in the stock price. The company's management attributed the drop to soft demand, but also mentioned that consumers have opted for cheaper hybrid and gasoline-powered models, and that the California fires negatively impacted demand in a key EV market. Despite this, Rivian's CEO RJ Scaringe remains confident that the company will hit its guidance of 46,000 to 51,000 deliveries for full-year 2025. The company is expanding its Illinois factory to produce the highly anticipated R2 model, which is priced well under its R1 vehicles and should open the door to a new and more price-sensitive consumer. However, investors should temper growth expectations for 2025, as one quarter's results do not make a trend.

**Rivian Q1 Deliveries Decline Y/Y Amid Weaker Demand for EV**
Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN) manufactured 14,611 vehicles in Q1 2025, up from 13,980 units in the same period last year. However, deliveries dropped to 8,640 vehicles from 13,588 in the same period last year. According to CFO Claire McDonough, the decline in deliveries is due to weaker demand, partly influenced by fires in Los Angeles and economic uncertainty. Rivian reaffirmed its 2025 delivery target of 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles, suggesting flat or declining deliveries for a second consecutive year. However, the launch of the R2 compact crossover in 2026, priced around $45,000, could mark a turning point. Industry-wide EV sales in the US are expected to decline quarter over quarter but show year-over-year growth, according to Cox Automotive.

**Rivian projects decline in electric vehicle deliveries for 2025**
Rivian has projected a decline in electric vehicle deliveries for 2025, expecting to deliver between 46,000 and 51,000 vehicles, down from 51,579 in 2024. The company is facing challenges due to softening demand, rising costs, and potential loss of tax credits. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe acknowledged the risk of rising costs due to proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which could impact its supply chain. The company is targeting an annual capital expenditure of $1.6 billion - $1.7 billion in 2025 and is planning a month-long production halt in the second half of 2025 to launch its new R2 model, which will compete directly with Tesla's Model Y. Rivian has reported its first-ever gross profit of $170 million in the fourth quarter, a significant improvement from the $606 million loss recorded a year earlier.

However, the company's 2025 guidance of 46,000 to 51,000 electric vehicle deliveries is below analyst expectations of 55,000. This lower range has sparked concern among investors, despite Rivian's progress in the electric vehicle market and its collaborative partnership with Volkswagen.
