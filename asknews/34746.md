According to a recent poll by the Observatorio Español de Estudios Demoscópicos de la UCAM (OBEDE), the PP would win 5 seats in the Region of Murcia in a hypothetical general election, up from the 4 seats they currently hold. The PSOE would maintain their 3 seats, while Vox would also maintain their 2 seats. SUMAR would lose their single seat. The poll also found that the PP's support increases with age, with 36% of voters over 65 supporting the party. In contrast, SUMAR and Podemos would see their support decrease with age, with 5.7% and 6.6% of voters aged 18-30 supporting them respectively. The poll also found that the PP's leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, is the most popular politician in the region, with a 4.2 out of 10 rating. The PSOE's leader, Pedro Sánchez, is the second most popular, with a 3.7 rating. The poll also found that the majority of voters (39.6%) prefer the PP to continue governing in the region, while 28.8% want to advance the elections and 15.6% want a pact between the PP and Vox.

**PP Gains Ground, PSOE Barely Affected by Blackout, According to Latest Polibarómetro Survey**
The latest Polibarómetro survey by DYM for the Grupo Joly newspapers shows that the People's Party (PP) has gained ground, with Alberto Núñez Feijóo's party now at 35.9% in estimated vote share, which would give them a majority in the Congress between 153 and 157 seats. The PP has regained the level they had before the blackout. The majority would be guaranteed in case of an alliance with Vox, which has recovered slightly with 12.3% of the vote, equivalent to 30-33 seats. The sum of the right-wing parties would offer a panorama in the Lower House between 183 and 190 deputies. Pedro Sánchez's PSOE has barely been affected by the April blackout, with a 28.7% estimated vote share, which would give them between 117 and 121 seats. Sumar has finally slowed down its downward trend in the polls, with a 6.2% vote share, equivalent to 9-11 seats. Podemos could gain one more deputy (4-5) compared to the previous DYM barometer. A possible alliance of the three left-wing parties would not reach 140 seats. Alberto Núñez Feijóo remains at the top of the leader's ranking with a 3.8 average score, followed by Yolanda Díaz with 3.5 points, Pedro Sánchez with 3.4 points, and Santiago Abascal with 2.7 points.

**PP Continues to Gain Ground, While PSOE Struggles and Left Divided**
The latest poll by DYM for 20minutos shows that the PP is maintaining its upward trend, with a 35.9% of the votes, a 0.5% increase from two months ago and a 2.9% increase from six months ago. The PSOE, on the other hand, is stuck at 28.7% of the votes, a 0.4% decrease from March, but with a stable trend since November 2023. The PP's leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, is the favorite to become the next Prime Minister, surpassing Pedro Sánchez. The Vox party is recovering from its recent dip, with a 12.3% of the votes, a 0.3% increase from the previous poll. The Sumar coalition, led by Yolanda Díaz, is struggling, with a 6.2% of the votes, a significant decrease from its 12.3% in the 2023 elections. The Podemos party is also doing poorly, with a 5.1% of the votes, a slight increase from its recent dip. The PSOE is losing three points of vote estimation compared to the last general elections, but still maintains 74% of its 2023 voters. However, the main problem for the left is the division between Sumar and Podemos, which would lead to a catastrophic result if they were to run separately in the elections.

**PP's Lead Over PSOE Widens Amid Wear and Tear**
The PP continues to increase its advantage over the PSOE, which is not gaining momentum and is experiencing wear and tear after the massive blackout. This is reflected in the May barometer, prepared by DYM for HENNEO, which shows that the popular party maintains the upward trend that began after the sharp decline they suffered after the scandal. According to the barometer, if elections were held tomorrow, the PP would obtain 35.9% of the votes, half a point more than two months ago and almost three points above six months ago. In contrast, the socialists would be left with 28.7% of the votes, four tenths less than in March, but with a stable trend since November 2023.

**Feijóo's Electoral Advance: A New Debate on Electoral Lists**
Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the PP, is pushing for an electoral advance, more than two years before the current legislature expires. He aims to create an alternative to Pedro Sánchez and has reopened old parliamentary debates. The PP will approve a law to prohibit etarras from entering electoral lists, as happened in the 2023 municipal elections. Feijóo said, 'We don't want to repeat what happened then.' The goal is to prevent Bildu from forming lists with people convicted of belonging or collaborating with ETA, as occurred in Navarra and the Basque Country in May 2023. The PSOE, along with other parties, voted against the PP's proposal in October, which the PP considers 'infamous' because it 'supports those with 'tainted blood' in power.' The PP sees this as a way to rebrand itself and prepare for the next election, with Feijóo promising to 'rescue Spain from Sánchez.'

**PSOE Denounces 'Low' Budget Execution by PP Government in Granada**
The PSOE in the Diputación de Granada has denounced the 'low' execution of the budget by the PP government, after it was revealed that 40% of the 2024 budget, equivalent to 140 million euros, was left unspent. The socialist group has called on the government to 'get to work' and prioritize the needs of the municipalities over the purchase of large buildings in the capital. The PSOE's Fátima Gómez stated, 'This figure shows the lack of management and disinterest of Francisco Rodríguez in responding to the needs of many municipalities.' Ismael Padilla added, 'The Diputación's budget is essential for transforming municipalities and addressing citizen demands. Leaving such a large amount unspent can only be understood as a sign of inefficiency or negligence by the PP government.' He also criticized the government's 'sectarian' approach and lack of investment in areas such as housing, water management, and culture.

**PSOE and PP Advance, but Tired of Themselves: The Road to 2027**
The Spanish government, led by Pedro Sánchez, and the opposition party, PP, are both advancing, but tired of themselves. Sánchez is relying on the economy to withstand the wear and tear of ongoing judicial cases against him and his family members, while Feijóo is counting on his strategy of wear and tear, but Aznar warns that this will not be enough. According to Sánchez's entourage, some minor issues, such as the WhatsApp messages between Sánchez and his former minister, Ábalos, are actually contributing to cohesion among their voters, rather than causing them to desert. However, the president needs the economy and good governance to stay afloat. Sánchez is taking center stage in international politics, advocating for a European position against Netanyahu in Gaza, despite the inconsistencies in his discourse due to some Interior Ministry contracts with Israeli companies. The PP is struggling to articulate a compelling message, and both parties are showing signs of exhaustion, advancing tired of their own strategies, and waiting for a final sprint to the 2027 goal.

The PP will attempt to capitalize on these cases in today's control session in the Congress of Deputies. Ricardo Rodríguez stated, 'The image of the government's disintegration is...'

**Economic Duel Between PP and PSOE: Sánchez and Feijóo Reinterpret Data to Their Advantage**
Pedro Sánchez and Alberto Núñez Feijóo engaged in a heated debate over the Spanish economy in the Congress of Deputies. Feijóo criticized Sánchez for the slower growth of Spaniards' income compared to Europeans. However, Sánchez pointed out that Spanish families' real income increased the most in 2024 with a 1.8% growth. Ángel Talavera, Head of European Economy at Oxford Economics, explained that Spanish families' real income has grown significantly above the European average over the past three years, but the initial impact of the pandemic was greater. The debate also centered around the PIB, with Sánchez boasting that the European Commission raised the growth forecast for Spain to 2.6% in 2025, while Feijóo countered that the PIB 'doesn't eat'. However, Ángel Talavera noted that a growing PIB is always positive. Feijóo also criticized Sánchez for the 37% increase in food prices since he became president, which contrasts with the 31% increase reported by the INE, caused by external factors. Ángel Talavera clarified that the inflation was a global phenomenon, not specific to Spain or Europe, and that experts say neither Sánchez nor other governments had the margin to stop it.

**SocioMétrica Poll: PP Would Win 150 Seats, PSOE 117**
According to a recent SocioMétrica poll, the People's Party (PP) led by Alberto Núñez Feijóo would win 150 seats in the next election, its best result in a SocioMétrica poll this year. Meanwhile, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) would receive 117 seats. The poll, published by El Español, also breaks down the seat distribution by autonomous community, allowing readers to track the voting trends in each region. The poll was conducted through 1,000 interviews with Spanish citizens aged 17 and above, using the CAWI-Panel system between April 21 and 25, 2025. The sample was balanced in the first phase by quotas of sex, age, and autonomous community, and then adjusted to project the vote based on discrepancies with the 2023 general election results. The poll's convergence rate is 97%, with a real margin of error of less than 3% and a 95% confidence interval. The study was conducted by SocioMétrica, a company led by Gonzalo Adán, a doctor in Social Psychology, and certified by the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

**Fracasa la 'operación María Jesús Montero': el PSOE no podrá recuperar la Junta de Andalucía en 2026**
The 'Operation María Jesús Montero' to recover the Junta de Andalucía for the PSOE has failed. According to a recent poll by the Centra, the PSOE has not gained any ground and is still far behind the PP, led by Juanma Moreno. The poll, which surveyed 3,600 people, gives the PP between 57 and 59 seats in the Andalusian parliament, with 42.2% of the vote, while the PSOE is expected to get between 25 and 28 seats with 23% of the vote. María Jesús Montero, the PSOE's leader in Andalusia, has not been able to revive the party's fortunes, despite her efforts to calm internal divisions and regain electoral ground. The poll suggests that the PSOE will not be able to recover the Junta de Andalucía in 2026, and that the PP will maintain its majority. Vox, the far-right party, is expected to be the third most voted party, with 14.3% of the vote.

**PSOE maintains lead in CIS opinion poll, with 5.3-point advantage over PP**
The Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) is set to publish its April opinion poll, the first since the US-China trade war began. The poll, conducted during a time of controversy over the increase in defense spending in Europe and the difficulties of accessing housing in Spain, shows the PSOE with a 5.3-point lead over the PP, with 34.5% and 29.2% of the vote respectively. Vox remains in third place, with 11.7% of the vote, while Sumar and Podemos trail behind with 7.6% and 3.8% respectively. The vice president, María Jesús Montero, sparked controversy with her comments on the Dani Alves case, saying 'the presumption of innocence is ahead of the testimony of women who decide to denounce the powerful', which was met with criticism from associations of judges and prosecutors. She later apologized and recognized that the presumption of innocence is a 'pillar of the rule of law'. Meanwhile, Podemos launched the candidacy of its eurodeputy Irene Montero for the upcoming general elections, aiming to incorporate other left-wing and civil society sectors.

**PSOE Gains Two-Point Lead Over PP in Latest CIS Poll**
The latest poll from the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) shows that the PSOE has gained a two-point lead over the PP, while maintaining its advantage over the PP, which has fallen further. According to the poll, one in five voters has already decided to vote for the PSOE, with 23.5% already supporting socialist leader Pedro Sánchez, compared to 18.5% who have decided to vote for the PP and 11.1% for Vox. José Félix Tezanos, a CIS expert, noted that Sánchez is the most popular politician, with a mean score of 4.10 points, ahead of Yolanda Díaz (Sumar) and Alberto Núñez Feijóo. However, the poll also shows that seven in ten Spaniards distrust Sánchez, with only 27.8% trusting him, compared to 17.7% who trust Feijóo. The poll reflects that more voters support the PSOE than the PP, and that more people remember voting for Sánchez in the 2023 general elections, despite Feijóo being the winner.

**Poll Suggests Stable Gap Between Parties Ahead of General Elections**
According to a recent poll, Vox, Sumar, and Unidas Podemos are gaining support, while the PP and PSOE are losing ground. However, the gap between the parties remains relatively stable, with Alberto Núñez Feijóo still expected to win the general elections with a significant margin over Pedro Sánchez, but without a majority to govern alone. Vox is expected to regain half of the seats lost in July 2023, reaching 43 seats in Congress. Sumar continues to decline, while Unidas Podemos has not recovered its previous political space. The poll also suggests that a coalition between socialists and left-wing parties is unlikely, although nationalist parties may still form a coalition under the banner of 'progressivism'. The poll shows that Vox's support has increased by nearly 2 percentage points, to 14.3%, due to the addition of new voters, mostly young people, but this is not at the expense of the PP. According to the poll, there are more voters who plan to switch from the PSOE to the PP than from the PSOE to Sumar or Unidas Podemos. However, this shift is not enough for the PP to achieve a majority without Vox's support.

**PP Leads in Voting Intention, PSOE at Worst Level Since 2023 Election**
The latest poll from Instituto 40dB shows that the PP (People's Party) is still leading in voting intention, but is declining for the third consecutive month. The PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) has reached its worst voting intention since the 2023 general election, with 28.4% of the vote, 3.3 points below its result in the election. Vox, the far-right party, has gained 1.8 points and reached its highest voting intention since the election, with 14.2% of the vote.
