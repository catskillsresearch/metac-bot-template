**Air could become thinner for German stocks**
Many experts are becoming cautious about the DAX, Germany's benchmark index, which has gained 22% this year. Analyst Soren Hettler from DZ Bank wrote, 'The DAX has been running wild for several months,' and believes it is now in the 'expensive' range, carrying increasing risks of a setback. Bank of America's Sebastian Raedler remains negative on European equities and recommends underweighting German stocks, citing the cyclical German economy's vulnerability to a slowdown in global growth. Market expert Christian Apelt from Helaba fears that Donald Trump's antics will continue to shake the financial markets, and that complacency has increased the risk of negative surprises and setbacks. The ECB has announced the end of the interest rate cut cycle, and the next exciting moment will be on June 18, when the US Fed makes its move. Robert Greil of Merck Finck does not see inflation as the 'crucial factor' for the Fed's monetary policy, and expects a wait-and-see stance until the open tariff situation is resolved.

**Economist Predicts Ruble's Fate Amid External Trade Balance Shift**
Economist Alexander Shepelov from 'BKS Mir Invest' predicts that the value of the Moscow Stock Exchange index on June 9 will be between 2775 and 2900 points. He notes that the Central Bank's decision to lower the key interest rate to 20% is seen as a positive signal for the stock market. However, the impact of the change in the balance of external trade may have a more significant effect on the ruble. As spring approaches, imports are increasing and there is a growing demand for currency from tourists, while export revenues may decline due to falling oil prices in April-May. Currently, oil prices are trying to stay above $65 per barrel, and the ruble has not shown significant weakening - foreign currency exchange rates remain close to multi-month lows. 'The forecast for the Moscow Stock Exchange index on June 9 is 2775-2900 points,' Shepelov said in an interview with Finances Mail. He added that the decision to lower the key interest rate is seen as a positive signal for the stock market.

**Jardine Cycle & Carriage: Index Exit Creates Selling Pressure**
Jardine Cycle & Carriage, an Asian conglomerate, is facing a financial stress test due to a technical phenomenon on the stock exchange, not due to operational problems. The company will be removed from the Straits Times Index (STI) on June 20, 2025, and replaced by Keppel DC REIT. This routine index adjustment has concrete consequences: passive funds that track the STI must sell their shares in Jardine Cycle & Carriage to reflect the new index composition. As a result, there will be increased selling pressure on the stock in the days leading up to the adjustment. Investors are wondering if the current price already reflects the expected sales or if there is still room for a decline. Although the company is currently facing challenges, including disappointing quarterly results and a weak automotive sector, index exclusions are often temporary phenomena. In the long term, fundamental data will prevail, and Jardine Cycle & Carriage remains a diversified player with strong market positions. The question for investors is when the company's fundamentals will again outweigh the technical selling pressure. The countdown to June 20 is underway.

**Sun's Activity to Return to Calm State on June 10, 2025**
Scientists have reassured people sensitive to weather that the sun's activity on June 10, 2025, will return to a calm state. The predicted level of activity will not exceed 5 points on the Kp-index. According to experts from the Laboratory of Solar Astronomy of the Institute of Cosmic Research and the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, there will be no strong geomagnetic disturbances in the next 24 hours. The probability of a magnetic storm on June 10, 2025, is 17%, indicating a return to a calm state of the sun. In 40% of cases, moderate geomagnetic fluctuations are possible, while a completely calm situation is predicted with a probability of 43%. This confirms that people sensitive to weather on June 10 have nothing to worry about. The predicted Kp-index, which reflects the level of geomagnetic activity, will not exceed 4 points. Additional indicators also confirm the current situation: the Ap-index is expected to be at 15 points, and the level of solar radio emission on the F10.7 scale will remain at 155 units. To alleviate the negative impact of magnetic storms, doctors recommend following several simple rules: 1. Drink enough water. Water helps regulate blood pressure and improve circulation. Try to drink about 30-40 ml of water per kilogram of body weight per day. Mineral water with magnesium, for example, 'Donat Mg', may be particularly useful. 2. Follow your diet. Caffeine and alcohol can worsen your condition, so it's better to limit their consumption. Instead of coffee, try chicory or drinks with ginger, and instead of alcohol, try herbal teas with a calming effect (melissa, passionflower, hops). 3. Don't overexert yourself. Magnetic storms can affect sleep and stress levels. In such periods, it's better to avoid intense physical exertion and stressful situations. Instead, try yoga, breathing exercises, or walks in the fresh air. 4. Observe your sleep schedule. Good sleep is essential for health. Try to sleep 7-8 hours and go to bed by 23:00. Two hours before bedtime, limit your time spent on gadgets, and create comfortable conditions in your bedroom (temperature 18-20 °C). 5. Take beneficial supplements (after consulting a doctor). Some substances can help your body cope with stress: 6. Use a contrast shower. Alternating hot and cold water helps improve circulation and make blood vessels more resistant to changes in pressure.

**US Dollar Index Continues to Consolidate at Low Level**
The US dollar index has continued to consolidate at a low level of 98-102, despite the release of non-farm payroll data on Friday. The data showed that the private sector ADP employment was lower than expected, but was offset by the better-than-expected non-farm payroll data. However, the impact on the June FOMC meeting was minimal, and the overall market movement was not significant. The dollar index has been influenced by various factors such as tariffs, economic data, and geopolitics, but has continued to consolidate at the low level. On the other hand, the data showed that funds are still flowing out of the US stock market, while European and Asian funds are flowing in, limiting the euro's adjustment range. The dollar-yen pair has continued to consolidate at the 140-148 level, with a slight rebound in the past two weeks, and a closing price of 144.8. In the short term, the market seems to be stabilizing, but in the medium term, the dollar-yen pair can still be sold and bought at the 148 level. If the medium-term line breaks below 139.5, which has been tested three times in the past two years, it is expected that the dollar-yen pair will fall to 137 by the fourth quarter of this year or in 2025. If the trend continues, it may test the 130 level next year. In terms of market news, President Trump and Elon Musk have been engaged in a war of words, and Trump has also been putting pressure on the Federal Reserve, saying that the Fed must cut interest rates by 1%. Trump has also expressed his dissatisfaction with Fed Chairman Powell, saying that he has no expectations for Powell's reappointment next year. Trump has hinted that the next Fed Chairman will be appointed soon, and that he has a clear understanding of the candidate. He also said that a good Fed Chairman will lower interest rates, implying that the next Fed Chairman will listen to him. Looking ahead to the next week, the Fed will enter a quiet period, and the market expects that the CPI data to be released next week will have a significant impact on the Fed's decision to cut interest rates in the summer. The probability of keeping interest rates unchanged is as high as 95%, and the market expects the Fed to cut interest rates in September.

**S&P 500: Jobs Data Dampens Markets**
The S&P 500 closed the Friday session slightly in the red, giving up earlier gains after a surprisingly strong US jobs report. The robust numbers caused a sharp increase in US Treasury yields and dampened expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year. The index lost 5.97 points or 0.1% and closed at 5,346.99 points. The trading volume was 10.4 billion shares, below the 20-day average of 12.7 billion. The VIX volatility index stood at 12.58 points. The strong jobs data reduced expectations for imminent Fed rate cuts, and markets are now looking forward to upcoming inflation data and the Fed meeting next week.

**Argentina's External Financial Conditions Enter Stress Zone for First Time Since 2022**
The external financial conditions tracker, Vizion, reported a 64% drop in US imports in the first week of April, the worst since the pandemic. The Federal Reserve's nowcast of GDP growth for the second quarter is 2.2% annualized, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in the last policy meeting that the risks of inflation and unemployment have increased. The two worst variables in the external sub-index in April were the volatility of US stocks (VIX) and emerging markets, which entered the severe stress zone for the first time since June 2020. Other relevant factors were the decline in commodity prices, particularly oil, which fell below $60 a barrel, and the LIBOR-OIS spread due to the fluctuations in interest rates. The local sub-index of financial conditions remained almost stable in April, at 19.6 units (compared to 19.8 in March). The entities that build the indicator stated in their report that the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cleared up some doubts, but not all. Regarding the exchange rate, they highlighted as a success that the devaluation generated after the flexibility of the ceiling has been less than expected, although they emphasized the concern about the accumulation of reserves. 'As the ICF measures monthly averages, April was a particular month, as it intercalated two weeks of high volatility before the agreement with the IMF and two weeks of strong recovery', they clarified. Among the improvements at the domestic level, they highlighted the improvement in stocks and the reduction in the exchange rate gap. On the other hand, the main deteriorations were seen in bank confidence (due to the decline in dollar deposits) and interest rates. 'For Argentina, the agreement with the IMF cleared the most urgent fears, but the variables to be monitored did not change. The program sets a goal of accumulating reserves for the second quarter of $4,400 million and $8,900 million in 2025, and the Government has already indicated that it will not meet it. Since they also do not want to take on new debt this year (nor is it possible with a risk country rating between 600 and 700 points), the question is how they will face the maturities of 2025 and 2026, which amount to almost $26,000 million between the IMF, multilaterals and private', warned Econviews and the IAEF.

**The Winners and Losers in 21st Century America**
According to the St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED Database, the top 1% and top 10% of Americans gained ground in the 21st century, while the bottom 90%, especially the bottom 50%, lost ground. Wage earners lost ground, while corporate insiders, financiers, and speculators using leverage gained ground. The NASDAQ index rose 9.3 times, corporate profits rose 6.2 times, and the Case-Shiller Housing Index rose 3 times since 2001, indicating significant asset bubbles. If the NASDAQ index had risen at the same rate as inflation, it would be 3,340, not 17,166. Similarly, corporate profits would be $1.26 trillion annually, rather than $4.3 trillion, and the Case-Shiller Housing Index would be up from 110 to 200, rather than 323.

**The state of the short leading indicators: why there’s no “recession watch” - yet - Angry Bear**
New Deal democrat, in their 'Weekly Indicators' post, reported that several short leading indicators have turned negative, raising concerns about a potential recession. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that only the financial and interest rate sensitive indicators have reacted, while the 'hard' indicators and some 'soft' ones have not moved yet. The indicators that have turned negative include stock prices, jobless claims, industrial commodities, credit spreads, and the St. Louis Financial Stress index. However, the Chicago Fed indexes show no sign of stress, and manufacturers' new orders for durable and consumer goods have made new peaks in March. Additionally, bankruptcy statistics have not shown any acceleration in the trend. New Deal democrat concludes that a 'recession watch' is not warranted yet, as they would want to see some spreading out of weakness from the financial and interest rate data into the 'hard' economic data.

**Entergy Corporation (ETR) Stock Forecasts**
This week, the market will be focused on earnings reports from major companies, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and UnitedHealth Group. The earnings calendar kicks into high gear, with companies holding back their guidance for 2025 due to tariff uncertainty. According to Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, Retail Sales for March are expected to rise more than 3% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a 'turbo-charged boost' from car buyers making purchases in advance of tariff implementation. Graja also noted that growth in the non-store retail category, dominated by e-commerce, has slowed to 5.5% over the last three months, and that food services and drinking places will be important in the data mix. Additionally, the St. Louis Fed's Financial Stress Index (FSI) ticked above zero for the first time in more than a year, signaling above-average financial stress. Graja stated, 'We will keep watching the St. Louis Fed's Financial Stress Index (FSI). Last Thursday's release, covering the week which ended on April 4, showed that the FSI ticked above zero (0.0944) for the first time in more than a year.' The recent index level is still below other 'stressful' events, such as the failure of Silicon Valley bank in 2023 and the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2008. On the economic calendar, Retail Sales for March are due out on Wednesday, and the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts a decline of 2.4% for 1Q, signaling contraction. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.4% rate for CPI for April, in-line with the March rate.

**Turkish Lira Declines Against US Dollar Amid Market Sentiment**
The Turkish lira (TRY) has started the week with a decline against the US dollar (USD), trading at 38.0260, a 0.1% decrease from the previous close. Market sentiment is influenced by the possibility of the US imposing tariffs on some technology products and the expectations of Federal Reserve officials regarding inflation. Economists predict that the current account deficit will reach $21.97 billion in 2025. On Friday, the dollar/TRY pair closed at 38.0580, a 0.4% increase from the previous close. As of 09:30 today, the dollar/TRY is trading at 38.0260, a 0.1% decrease from the previous close. The euro/TRY is trading at 43.3990, a 0.4% increase, and the sterling/TRY is trading at 50.0020, a 0.5% increase. The dollar index is trading at 99.5, a 0.6% decrease. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem stated, 'There is a risk that inflation will rise in the short term, while the labor market may weaken.' New York Fed President John Williams said, 'The current trade policies of the Trump administration will accelerate inflation this year, and it is essential for the Fed to maintain its long-term inflation expectations.' Economists predict that the current account deficit will reach $21.97 billion in 2025.

**US Dollar Falls Against Turkish Lira**
The US dollar is trading at 38.0260 against the Turkish lira, down 0.1% from the previous close. The dollar/TL pair rose on Friday, closing at 38.0580, up 0.4% from the previous close. The euro/TL pair is trading at 43.3990, up 0.4% from the previous close, while the sterling/TL pair is trading at 50.0020, up 0.5% from the previous close. The dollar index is down 0.6% at 99.5. The Turkish lira is being affected by expectations of a more moderate period in tariff tensions following announcements that some technology products imported from the US will be evaluated under current tariffs. The comments of US Federal Reserve officials are also influencing the direction of the markets. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said that there is a risk that inflation will rise in the short term while the labor market may weaken, and that the long-term inflation expectations should be kept stable. The market is expecting the Fed to cut interest rates in June, and economists are forecasting a current account deficit of 4.325 billion dollars in February and 21.97 billion dollars in 2025.

**Wall St trips as tariff concerns resurface; Fed boost short-lived**
U.S. stock indexes dropped on Thursday, as concerns about the repercussions of the ongoing global trade war resurfaced. The Federal Reserve maintained current interest rates on Wednesday, but warned of an uncertain economic backdrop. The central bank projected slightly reduced growth and increased inflation for the year, alongside a modest uptick in the unemployment rate by 2025. Lilian Chovin, head of asset allocation at Coutts, said, 'This is not the best environment for investors to take a lot of risk. We should expect markets to remain choppy until things quiet down and we have more clarity on Trump's policies.' Market participants are currently factoring in 63 basis points of easing from the Fed this year, with odds of a 25 bps rate cut in June at 60%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 142.20 points, or 0.35%, to 41,816.93, while the S&P 500 lost 16.45 points, or 0.29%, to 5,658.84.

**The Economy Is Cracking--Consumers Are Panicking, and the Fed Mi**
The Consumer Confidence Index dropped 7 points to 98.3 in February, with the Expectations Index slipping below 80, a threshold that usually signals a recession. Inflation expectations are up, while future income prospects are down. Consumers are cutting back on non-essentials, with 46.8% expecting stock prices to rise this year, the lowest level since April 2024. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee says 'Relax, it's just one month of data,' but St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem hinted at a policy shift if inflation refuses to behave. A Wells Fargo survey found that nearly three-quarters of Americans plan to tighten their belts, with younger generations leading the retreat, slashing spending on dining out, gas, and entertainment.

**Fed releases hypothetical scenarios for 2025 stress test**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has released hypothetical scenarios for its 2025 annual stress test, aiming to ensure that large banks can continue lending during severe economic downturns. The test will assess 22 banks against a scenario of a severe global recession, featuring a 10% U.S. unemployment rate, severe market volatility, and declines in house and commercial real estate prices. Additionally, banks with significant trading operations must incorporate scenarios involving counterparty defaults and global market shocks. The Fed has also introduced an exploratory analysis with two hypothetical elements to evaluate the banking system's resilience to broader risks, such as credit and liquidity shocks in the nonbank financial sector and the failure of large hedge funds. The Fed plans to publish the results of both the stress test and exploratory analysis in June and will work on reducing the volatility of stress test results and improving model transparency.
