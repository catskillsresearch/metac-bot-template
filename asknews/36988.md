**Claudia Sheinbaum Breaks Presidential Approval Record in Mexico**
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved historic levels of approval, with 76% of citizens rating her performance as 'good or very good', making her the best-evaluated president since Ernesto Zedillo's term (1994-2000). Sheinbaum has received high praise in areas such as poverty reduction, where 63.4% of respondents positively evaluated her management. However, in the area of transparency and anti-corruption, 42.6% of respondents rated her performance as 'very good or good', while 57.4% had a negative perception, indicating an area of opportunity for her administration. According to FactoMétrica and Reporte Índigo, Sheinbaum's strategy to combat violence has led to a 24.9% reduction in homicides during her term. She has also announced a $298 billion investment plan, equivalent to 16% of Mexico's GDP, to strengthen the domestic market, generate employment, and advance towards food sovereignty. The president has been praised for her direct contact with citizens, supervising infrastructure and housing projects during her work trips. However, she has faced criticism and challenges related to the disappearance of autonomous bodies such as CONEVAL and INAI, which had evaluated public policies for decades. Sheinbaum has taken significant decisions, such as canceling a megapurchase of medicines due to irregularities, demonstrating her commitment to transparency. Internationally, she has maintained an active diplomatic agenda, visiting countries such as Brazil, Panama, and Honduras, and engaging in dialogue with the US to protect Mexico's interests.

**Argentina's Government Faces Wear and Tear, Divided Society Ahead of Elections**
A recent online survey by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein for El Cronista found that the Argentine government is facing a scenario marked by the wear and tear of its management, with a divided society regarding its perception of the current economic situation, its projection for the next few months, and the evaluation of the government. The survey, conducted among 1,000 adults across the country between April 28 and 30, showed a positive evaluation of the current economic situation, which decreased by five points since the beginning of the year, to 51%. However, this positive view is shared by only 21% of voters who chose Javier Milei as President. The survey also found that 52% of respondents believe that the situation is worse than the previous year, with 11 points more than the record obtained at the beginning of 2025. Among them, one in three voters of the libertarian leader also share this view. Looking to the future, there is a slight and progressive decline in positive perspectives, although a majority of 50% still believes that the situation will improve in 12 months. The situation is also reflected in the evaluation of the government, which is divided between 50% of good notes and 48% that rate the management as bad. The image of the main political leaders has also declined in the last month. Patricia Bullrich, Minister of Security, remains the leader with the highest positive image (47%), mainly because insecurity is the main social concern for 72% of respondents, followed by uncertainty about the economic situation (57%) and the lack of realistic proposals for growth (47%). Inflation, which used to be the main fear of society for many years, now ranks fourth with 46%. Javier Milei's image has been severely impacted, with a positive image decreasing to 44% and a negative image increasing to 52%, resulting in a -8% differential. Despite this, the President remains second in the ranking and far ahead of opposition leaders such as Mauricio Macri (35%), Axel Kicillof (31%), and Cristina Kirchner (27%). Sergio Berensztein noted, 'There is a wear and tear. I think it's inevitable. It's not a serious situation, but today the President's image, his approval, is the same as Macri's at the same stage of his management. He came with a positive difference that has narrowed.' Berensztein concluded, 'There is a segment of society that wants changes, that will positively value what has been done despite the fact that the results in the pocket or economic activity are not yet as positive as we all expect.' Eduardo D'Alessio added, 'The government, in terms of the President's image and management, is in a plateau, waiting for inflation to improve, which is the only thing that seems to be interesting to the majority of the population, along with the improvement of insecurity.' D'Alessio also noted, 'The election next Sunday will be fundamental to know if it will continue to manifest the trend of voting more 'against' than 'in favor'. The level of polarization will give the result.'

**Lessons from the Provincial Elections for Pampas Politics**
The recent provincial elections in Chaco, San Luis, Jujuy, and Salta do not provide a general analysis of what will happen in October or 2027, but they do offer some valuable lessons for Pampas politics. According to Norberto G. Asquini, the provincial elections are not a reflection of national politics, but rather a reflection of provincial agendas, leadership, and consequences. The government celebrated two victories, while the Peronism suffered a significant setback. One of the lessons learned is that the provincial officialisms won in all four provinces. In the October legislative elections, La Libertad Avanza may have a strong performance, driven by the figure of Javier Milei and partially controlled inflation, but it still lacks structure in the provinces. In La Pampa, the governor Sergio Ziliotto has a positive image, with a 60% approval rating, and the PJ maintains a solid base, with a historical floor of over 35% in voting intention. However, the fragmentation, lack of national leadership, and organizational weakness are taking their toll. In La Pampa, the UCR is able to maintain itself as the main opposition force, but it needs alliances to compete. As Ernesto Tenembaum notes, 'the growth of La Libertad Avanza is mainly at the expense of the anti-Peronist electorate.' A key fact is that the abstention rate grew in all provinces compared to similar elections.

**Zedillo's Lack of Credibility: A Majority of Mexicans Do Not Trust Him**
According to a recent poll, more than 60% of Mexicans do not trust former President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León. Presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating is significantly higher, with 57% of respondents supporting her. The poll also showed that Zedillo's approval rating is lower than Sheinbaum's in various key issues, such as the Fobaproa scandal, the Acteal massacre, and the Aguas Blancas massacre. Zedillo's association with the PAN party and his presidency during the Vicente Fox administration also contributed to his low approval rating. As Ulises Rodríguez López, the author of the article, notes, Zedillo's lack of credibility is a significant issue in the country.

**Javier Milei Ranks Third in International Survey of Most Popular Leaders**
According to a recent international survey by Morning Consult, Argentine President Javier Milei has ranked as the third most popular leader in the world, with a 65% approval rating. He is only behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who leads with a 75% approval rating, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has a 66% approval rating. The survey, which analyzed the popularity of leaders in 24 countries, found that Milei is above figures such as US President Donald Trump, who has a 52% approval rating and ranks fifth. This position solidifies Milei's image on the global stage and reinforces the positive perception of his management locally. Morning Consult's methodology, based on a seven-day moving average, provides a more stable panorama and minimizes momentary fluctuations. As Morning Consult's survey shows, Milei has consistently appeared in the top rankings, having surpassed Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador in November 2024 in terms of popularity. In contrast, the report also reveals the leaders with the highest levels of disapproval, with French President Emmanuel Macron leading the list with a 75% disapproval rating, affected by his decision to advance elections in 2024. Other notable cases include Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, who faces a significant decline in support due to the economic crisis and failure to fulfill fiscal promises, and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing a critical situation after his suspension and detention on charges of insurrection and abuse of power.

**Javier Milei's Rise to Global Prominence: A New Era for the Right?**
Argentine President Javier Milei has reached a milestone in international politics, according to a global survey conducted by Morning Consult between January 21 and 27. He is the third leader with the highest approval rating in the world, with 65% of support, behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (75%) and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum (66%). Milei's popularity is due to his commitment to reducing the size of the state and promoting a free market, which has generated strong support among sectors seeking an alternative to decades of state intervention. His policies have also led to a decrease in inflation, with projections indicating that it will continue to fall. Additionally, labor conflict has reached its lowest level in 20 years in the second half of 2024, attributed to the implementation of labor flexibility policies and the reduction of regulations imposed by the national government. According to a recent survey by DC Consultores, 8 out of 10 Argentines believe that the opposition uses protests for their own benefit, weakening the impact of these protests. Milei's image has reached a record high of 59% in January 2025, reflecting a sustained growth since September last year. His government also receives the same level of approval, indicating strong popular support for his policies. In the electoral scenario, a study by Isasi/Burdman shows that La Libertad Avanza leads the intention to vote with 36% of support, far ahead of the Peronism (12%), PRO (10%), and Kirchnerism (9%). This suggests that, if legislative elections were held today, the ruling party would consolidate its power in Congress. Donald Trump, one of Milei's main allies, also appears in the top 5 of leaders with the highest approval rating, with a recovered popularity in recent years after a decline following his departure from the White House in 2021. His strong discourse on economic recovery and his fight against the establishment have been key to his resurgence in the polls. His influence in the Republican Party and his return to the presidency of the US have revitalized his image and consolidated his leadership among conservative sectors. This reinforces the hypothesis that we are witnessing a change of era, where figures of the new right, who promote a healthy trade and conservative values, are gaining prominence.

**Global Survey Reveals Leaders with Highest and Lowest Approval Ratings**
According to a global survey by Visual Capitalist, the current leaders with the highest approval ratings are Narendra Modi of India (75% approval) and Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico (66% approval). Modi was re-elected for a third term as Prime Minister of India in May, while Sheinbaum became the first female President of Mexico in October. Cristian Rojas, head of the Department of Political Science at the U. of the Sabana, said, 'Modi is a very powerful man, he threatens the balance of power, since India had not had a president like him in a long time.' Rojas also noted that Sheinbaum's new presidency and her handling of Trump's tariffs have contributed to her high approval rating. The survey also found that Javier Milei, the libertarian president of Argentina, is the third most popular leader in the world with a 64% approval rating. Rojas said, 'He is a very popular president due to his provocative statements. He has called attention to himself as a libertarian president who will recover Argentina's economy.' The survey also ranked Karin Keller-Sutter of Switzerland and Donald Trump of the United States, who has a 52% approval rating. On the other hand, the leaders with the lowest approval ratings are Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea, who is currently detained on charges of insurrection and abuse of power, and Emmanuel Macron of France, with three-quarters of the population disapproving of his leadership.
