**Market Shifts Bet on Fed Rate Cuts for 2025**
The financial market has shifted its bet on the Federal Reserve's (Fed) cumulative reduction for 2025, following the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) - which decelerated at an annual rate - and statements from Fed officials. According to the CME Group's monitoring tool, the probability of a 50 basis point (pb) cut in interest rates by December was the majority, at 37.0%. The market sees September as the most likely month for the start of the rate-cut cycle this year, with a 78.1% chance of a rate cut by the Fed in some level. In July, the chances of maintaining interest rates were 61.4%, and 38.6% for a relaxation of monetary policy in any level. The market's main bet is now on a 50 pb cut, followed by a more aggressive 75 pb cut, and a more modest 25 pb cut.

**Market Shifts Bet to Fed Rate Cuts in 2025**
According to the CME Group's monitoring tool, the probability of a 50-point-base (pb) interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) by December was 37.0%. The market has shifted its bet to a cumulative reduction in Fed rates for 2025, following the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed a slowdown in the annual rate, and statements from US central bank officials. The tool showed that the probability of a 50-point-base (pb) interest rate cut by the Fed by December was 37.0%. The chance was followed by a more aggressive Fed bet, of 75 pb, at 30.1% - a decrease compared to the number recorded before the data, of 30.7% - while the probability of a milder reduction, of 25 pb for 2025, gained strength and was the third largest, at 18.8% to 19.4%. The market sees September as the most likely month for the start of the rate-cut cycle this year, following the easing of commercial tensions between the US and China. The tool showed a 78.1% chance of an interest rate cut by the US central bank in September at any level. In July, the chances of maintaining interest rates were 61.4%, and 38.6% for a relaxation of monetary policy at any level.

**US-China Trade Tensions Ease, Fed Rate Cut Expectations Pushed Back**
Following the US and China's agreement to lower tariffs, investors have pushed back their expectations for the Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate cut. The Fed's decision to lower interest rates is less urgent due to the reduced risk of economic downturn. The Bank of Korea (BOK) is also expected to lower its benchmark interest rate on May 29, but may be cautious about further cuts. According to Adriana Kugel, a Fed governor, 'We still expect inflation and economic slowdown, but to a lesser extent than before. Therefore, the need for monetary easing policies has decreased.' The probability of a 0.25% interest rate cut in June has decreased to 11% on the FedWatch, a tool that shows the probability of interest rate changes based on market expectations. The probability of keeping the interest rate unchanged in July has increased to 60.1%. Analysts expect the BOK to lower its benchmark interest rate to 2.75% on May 29, but may be cautious about further cuts.

**Goldman Sachs Adjusts Economic Forecast: Delayed Rate Cut and Improved Growth Prospects**
Goldman Sachs has adjusted its economic forecast, with economists Jan Hatzius and others now believing that the Federal Reserve's reason for cutting interest rates has shifted from 'providing insurance' to 'normalization'. This change reflects the new reality of a relatively stable US economy, a slightly reduced increase in unemployment, and a decrease in policy support urgency. According to Goldman Sachs' updated baseline scenario, the Fed will delay its interest rate cut, with the first cut potentially happening in December 2025, rather than July, and implemented through a series of sporadic meetings rather than consecutive ones. Additionally, Goldman Sachs has raised its economic growth forecast for 2025, increasing its fourth-quarter growth rate by 0.5 percentage points to 1% compared to the same period last year. The report also lowered the probability of the US economy entering a recession within the next 12 months to 35%, indicating a more optimistic outlook for the future economic situation.

**Goldman Sachs Delays US Federal Reserve Interest Rate Cut Expectations to December 2024**
Goldman Sachs has significantly delayed its expectations for a US Federal Reserve interest rate cut, pushing it back to December 2024. Previously, Goldman Sachs had predicted that the Fed would take its first interest rate cut of the year in July 2024. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the recent high-level trade talks between China and the US have made significant progress, with both sides significantly reducing tariffs. Goldman Sachs stated that, given these developments and the significant easing of financial conditions over the past month, it has raised its forecast for US fourth-quarter GDP growth in 2025 by 0.5 percentage points to 1%, and lowered the probability of an economic recession over the next 12 months to 35%. The bank has also lowered its forecast for the peak core PCE inflation rate from 3.8% to 3.6%. Nick Timiraos, a well-known financial journalist, quoted Goldman Sachs as saying, 'The significant reduction in US tariffs on China will have a limited impact on the overall effective tariff rate, and will only lead to a small decrease in the current effective tariff rate, of less than 2 percentage points.' Goldman Sachs' pessimistic forecast for the Fed is not unusual on Wall Street. Currently, option traders are building large positions to hedge against the risk that the Fed may not ease monetary policy this year, with one increasingly popular position predicting that the Fed will not cut interest rates at all in 2025. On Monday, traders in New York predicted that the Fed would only cut interest rates twice this year, with short-term US Treasury yields rising by over 10 basis points: The two-year Treasury yield rose 10.47 basis points to 3.9956%, with an intraday trading range of 3.9077% to 4.0166%. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 8.45 basis points to 4.4630%, with a trading range of 4.3981% to 3.4669%.

**US-China Trade Agreement May Reduce Interest Rate Cuts, Says Federal Reserve Governor**
Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler believes that the US-China trade agreement to reduce tariffs may reduce the impact of the trade war between the two major global economies and lower the likelihood of the US central bank needing to respond with interest rate cuts. According to Kugler, the 90-day suspension of tariffs on imports 'represents an improvement' compared to a scenario that could have led to 'higher prices and a slowdown in the economy'. As a result, the perception of what the central bank will do in the coming months will change. Before the agreement, market operators expected a 25-point interest rate cut in the summer, likely in July, but now an intervention is not expected before September. The FedWatch futures at the CME indicate a stable interest rate level for June (probability of 91.9%) and July (59.6%), while now a cut is expected in September with a probability of 51.8%. Kugler noted that 'even with this suspension, tariffs are much higher than before' and that prospects still predict an inflation increase above 2% in the short term. She also stated that the trade conflict could have profound implications for the US, including reputational damage that could drive investors elsewhere.

**Donald Trump Calls On Fed To Slash Rates After Inflation Eases In April**
Despite April's lower-than-expected inflation numbers, President Donald Trump has renewed his calls for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates. Trump argued that the Fed's current approach is holding the economy back and that a rate cut is necessary to allow the economy to 'blossom.' However, analysts caution that tariff-induced cost increases may take more time to appear in official data. Trump has minimized concerns that his administration's tariff policies could worsen inflation or hurt consumers, but some economists believe that the full effects of the tariffs have yet to materialise. 'Our forecast anticipates a spike in prices by June and July from the tariffs,' noted Michael Hanson, economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Grocery prices posted their biggest drop since 2020, offering financial relief to households, but investors currently expect the Fed to hold interest rates steady during its upcoming meetings in June and July.

**Trump Calls for Fed to Lower Interest Rates Amid Weaker Inflation Report**
US President Donald Trump has called for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, citing a weaker-than-expected inflation report. Trump wrote on social media, 'Without inflation, and gas, energy, food, and almost everything else is CRASHING!!! The FED needs to lower the RATE, like Europe and China have done. What's wrong with Powell, Always Late?' Trump added that the Fed's strategy is 'not fair to the United States, which is ready to flourish.' He also said, 'Let it happen, it will be beautiful!' The latest appeal from Trump for lower interest rates comes after a report showed that the consumer price index rose 0.2% in April, below estimates for the third consecutive month. Analysts expect the impact of tariffs to become more evident in the coming months, which may keep the central bank hesitant to cut interest rates. Investors currently expect the Fed to keep rates unchanged at the next two policy meetings in June and July, before making cuts in September and December, according to market futures.

**Goldman Sachs Predicts Fed Interest Rate Cut from July to December**
Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, has made a prediction about when the Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower interest rates. The US economy is closely watched by global markets, and the bank's prediction is based on various factors, including inflation uncertainty, trade tensions, and US President Donald Trump's criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Goldman Sachs has revised its prediction for the Fed's interest rate cut from July to December. The bank has also reduced its recession probability to 35%.

**Fed Interest Rate Cut May Be Delayed to December, Says Goldman Sachs**
The recent 90-day ceasefire in the US-China trade war has reduced the likelihood of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting interest rates. Fed officials, including member Adriana Kugler, stated that the impact of the trade war on the economy may be lessened, but the tariffs are still high and will leave a lasting impact on the economy. Kugler said, 'Clearly...it's an improvement for the two countries' trade relationship.' However, she emphasized that the 30% tariffs on US imports from China are still 'quite high' and will lead to price increases and economic slowdown, albeit with a milder impact. Kugler added, 'From a certain perspective, my basic outlook, or perhaps the degree and scope of the tools we need to use, has changed.' Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee also stated that the weekend's US-China agreement will temporarily reduce the impact of tariffs on the economy. Goolsbee said, 'Compared to the previous path, the agreement can reduce the impact of stop-and-go inflation.' However, he noted that the temporary tariffs are still 'three to five times higher than before' and will still have a stop-and-go inflation effect on the economy. Goldman Sachs, led by Jan Hatzius, has revised its forecast to expect the Fed to cut interest rates in December, rather than July. The report states, 'We now expect the Fed to cut interest rates later than we previously expected, to December, and to cut rates three times, starting at the next meeting, rather than consecutively.' Goldman Sachs also raised its forecast for US economic growth to 1% and reduced the probability of a recession to 35%.

**Powell's Comments Dampen Bond Traders' Hopes for Rate Cuts**
Bond investors are receiving a message from Fed Chairman Powell that the Federal Reserve is not in a hurry to cut interest rates. After Powell reiterated the Fed's cautious stance on monetary policy last week, market participants have significantly increased their expectations that the benchmark loan rate will only be cut by less than 0.75 percentage points by 2025, and expect the first move to be in July. However, the success of this bet will depend on the trajectory of the US economy and inflation over the next few weeks. 'The Fed is not in a hurry to cut interest rates,' said Powell. 'We will wait and see how the economy and inflation develop in the coming weeks.'

**Bond Investors Start to Accept Powell's Message on Interest Rates**
Bonds investors are starting to accept the message from Jerome Powell that the Federal Reserve is not in a hurry to cut interest rates. After Powell reiterated the central bank's wait-and-see approach to monetary policy last week, investors are expecting the Fed to cut interest rates by less than a quarter point by 2025 and the first step to be taken as early as July. The realization of this expectation will depend on the direction of the US economy and inflation in the coming weeks. The details of the trade talks between the US and China this weekend and the consumer price index data to be released on Tuesday may also cause a change in investor expectations. According to Greg Peters, the director of fixed income at PGIM, 'The bond market is accepting that inflation will be higher than initially expected, and this is making it harder for investors to believe that the Fed will cut interest rates.'

**Fed to Wait for Uncertainty to Dissipate Before Cutting Rates**
The Federal Reserve's first meeting since Donald Trump's trade war has concluded with the confirmation of interest rates between 4.25%-4.50% and a statement from Jerome Powell that there will be no 'preemptive' rate cuts in a more complex economic scenario and with inflation that could rise again. Trump has attacked Powell on social media, calling him 'too late' and 'stupid'. However, analysts such as Ashish Shah, CIO of Public Investing at Goldman Sachs, and Richard Flax, Chief Investment Officer at Moneyfarm, believe that the Fed will remain in a 'wait-and-see' phase, waiting for uncertainty to dissipate. They expect the Fed to maintain interest rates for the time being, possibly until July 8, 2025, when the 90-day suspension of new tariffs imposed by Trump will expire. The risk of stagflation, or a combination of slow growth and high inflation, is a major concern for investors. According to Tiffany Wilding and Allison Boxer, economists at PIMCO, the Fed will likely wait for concrete evidence of a slowdown in labor market data before cutting rates, possibly not until the end of summer or fall. Once such evidence emerges, they expect the Fed to cut rates quickly to support the economy.

**Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Predict Fed Rate Cut in July**
Bank of America and Goldman Sachs predict that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in July, following a better-than-expected jobs report. The banks had previously expected a rate cut in June, but the latest data shows a higher-than-expected increase in non-agricultural employment in April, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%. The Fed has kept the interest rate range between 4.25% and 4.5% in its last meeting, in line with expectations. However, the tariffs have adjusted the expectations for US economic indicators. Until September 2024, interest rates were at their highest levels in over 20 years, ranging from 5.25% to 5.5%, in an attempt to curb inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 before declining to 2.8% in February. US President Donald Trump had previously called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, saying it was 'the right time' to do so, and tweeted 'Lower interest rates, Jerome, and stop the politics!'

**Fed Increases Inflation Estimate and Projects Two Interest Rate Cuts in 2025**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has increased its inflation estimate for the US and projects two interest rate cuts in 2025. According to the Fed, the interest rate will be reduced by 0.5 percentage points by the end of this year, in a scenario of economic deceleration and potential inflation decline. The interest rate cuts will occur in two meetings, with a reduction of 0.25 percentage points in each. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US was 2.8% in February, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from January. The inflation target in the US is 2% per year, and although it is not at this level, the index has been below 3% since July 2024. For 2025, the Fed estimates inflation in the US to be 2.7%, a slight increase from the previous estimate of 2.5%. The Fed has also reduced its projections for GDP growth, from 2.1% to 1.7%.

**US Inflation Seen Higher, Fed Cuts Later in Economist Survey**
According to a recent survey of 91 economists by Bloomberg, forecasters now project that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will not cut interest rates until July, up from May in the previous survey. The economists also expect higher near-term growth estimates, with gross domestic product advancing at a 2.3% annualized rate in 2025. However, the odds of a recession in the next 12 months have increased to 25%, up from 20% in January. Comerica Bank economists Bill Adams and Waran Bhahirethan stated, 'Longer-term interest rates will average around current levels in 2025 as financial markets anticipate inflation from tariffs, a hotter job market, and fiscal stimulus from Congress extending tax cuts.'

**Fed rate cuts on hold until US inflation improves, minutes show**
The Federal Reserve has decided to hold off on interest rate cuts until US inflation improves. According to the minutes from its January meeting, officials are concerned about the potential economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs and other policies. They believe that the current interest rate settings are holding back economic activity and continuing to weigh on inflation, which came in hotter than expected in January. Financial markets were little changed after the release of the minutes, with interest rate futures indicating the Fed's likely first rate cut of 2025 would occur in July. As Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said, 'It's clear from the minutes that rate cuts are not happening anytime soon, and the Fed will likely wait for some of the dust to settle on tariffs before providing better forward guidance.'

**Market Maintains Expectation of July Interest Rate Cut by Fed**
The financial market has maintained its expectation of a July interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) after the institution released the minutes of the January monetary policy meeting, which reaffirmed the 'solid' pace of the US economy and highlighted the risks of high inflation as a reason for caution. According to the FedWatch tool of the CME Group, the estimated probability of a rate cut in July is 58.7%, the first month in which the probability exceeds 50%. The most likely scenario for July remains a 0.25 percentage point cut (44.2%), while bets on a 0.50 percentage point reduction have slightly increased, from 12.3% to 13.3% after the minutes were released. The chance of maintaining the current interest rate is 41.3%. The market has also reinforced the expectation of only one interest rate cut, of 0.25 percentage points, in 2025 (36.1%). The chance of the Fed keeping interest rates unchanged in 2025 is 17.2%, down from 18.7% yesterday, according to the CME.

**Federal Reserve Chairman Powell to Testify Before Congress: Economists Skeptical of Further Interest Rate Cuts**
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to testify before Congress, and economists are skeptical about the possibility of further interest rate cuts this year. While Fed officials had penciled in two rate cuts this year at their December meeting, economists and Wall Street investors are increasingly skeptical, with some predicting no reductions at all this year. Morgan Stanley economists now expect just one rate cut in 2025, and investors also expect just one - in July - according to pricing in futures markets. The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates has had a significant impact on the economy, and many are waiting to see how the new policies from the White House will affect the economy before making any further decisions.

Federal Reserve officials are less likely to cut interest rates this year, despite unemployment falling and new policies from the White House. Economists and investors are increasingly skeptical, with some predicting no rate cuts at all this year. Morgan Stanley economists now expect just one rate cut in 2025, and investors also expect just one, in July, according to pricing in futures markets. Fed officials had previously penciled in two rate cuts this year at their December meeting. The shift in expectations comes as the economy shows signs of improvement, with unemployment falling and new policies from the White House potentially boosting growth.
