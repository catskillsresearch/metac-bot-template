**How Poland’s new president will halt the march of liberal reforms**
Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, has won the election with 10.6 million votes, the highest number since 1990. Nawrocki, a right-wing populist, has vowed to block liberal reforms and scupper the premiership of Tusk, a nemesis of the outgoing President Duda. This will lead to two-and-a-half years of 'pandemonium' and 'cohabitation' between the premier and the head of state from rival blocs. Tusk's government will struggle to pass meaningful reforms, including the liberalisation of the abortion ban, as Nawrocki's veto will require 60% of votes in parliament to overcome. This will increase centrifugal forces within Tusk's coalition and may lead to an early election. Poland's European partners are concerned about the prospect of facing two years of volatility and discord, followed by a possible lapse back into adversarial relations with Brussels and Berlin.

**Polish Presidential Election: Both Candidates Declare Victory Amid Tight Margin**
Both candidates in the Polish presidential election have declared victory, with a margin of just 0.6 percentage points between them. According to an Ipsos poll, Rafal Trzaskowski, the pro-European candidate, received 50.3% of the votes, while his opponent, historian Karol Nawrocki, received 49.7%. Trzaskowski said, 'We won', while Nawrocki promised his supporters, 'Tonight we will win. We will win and save Poland.' The election was closely watched in Ukraine, where Nawrocki's anti-NATO stance and calls to limit benefits for Ukrainian refugees have raised concerns. Trzaskowski's victory could lead to significant social changes, including the legalization of same-sex unions and a relaxation of Poland's strict abortion laws. The president of Poland has the power of veto over laws and is the country's supreme commander. Nawrocki's victory would strengthen the position of the populist 'Law and Justice' party, which ruled Poland from 2015 to 2023, and could lead to new parliamentary elections. Many of Nawrocki's supporters advocate for stricter immigration controls and greater Polish sovereignty within the EU. Political analyst Anna Materka-Sosnowska called the election 'a true civilizational divide' due to the fundamental differences in the candidates' policies.

**Abortion becomes a major issue in Poland's presidential election**
Poland is holding a presidential election today, where abortion has become a major issue. Protests have been taking place outside an abortion clinic in Warsaw, with some demonstrators calling for the clinic to be shut down. The clinic, which opened in March, provides guidance on how to obtain abortion pills and allows women to use the pills on site. However, the clinic is facing opposition from anti-abortion groups and the local community. The current abortion law in Poland is one of the most restrictive in Europe, allowing for abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or if the mother's life is at risk. The two presidential candidates, Rafał Trzaskowski and Karol Nawrocki, have differing views on abortion. Trzaskowski has promised to support a bill that would liberalize the abortion law, while Nawrocki has stated that he would not sign any bill that would allow for abortion, even in cases of fetal abnormalities. 'It's a shameful private matter,' said DR's correspondent in Europe, Anna Gaarslev, referring to the fact that Poland has one of the lowest numbers of hospital abortions in Europe, despite an estimated 120,000 abortions taking place annually. The outcome of the election is uncertain, with the two candidates being very close in the polls.

**Poland's Presidential Election: A Closely Contested Vote**
The upcoming presidential election in Poland is expected to be closely contested between centrist Rafal Trzaskowski and nationalist Karol Nawrocki. Poland has been a strong ally of Ukraine, providing political, logistical, and military support. However, the country has also faced criticism for suspending asylum rights for migrants crossing the border from Belarus. Poland accuses Belarus and Russia of organizing a migrant influx as part of a hybrid attack to destabilize the region and the EU. The country has increased its defense spending, exceeding the NATO target of 2% of GDP, with 4.7% of GDP allocated to military expenses. Poland plans to increase this level to 5% of GDP next year, a goal also supported by US President Donald Trump. The country has modernized its army, signing contracts with the US and South Korea, and has also signed a new treaty with France for mutual assistance in case of aggression. A large-scale military training program has been announced to ensure that every adult in Poland can be mobilized in case of war. The program, which is also open to women, will be based on voluntary participation and aims to train 100,000 civilians per year from 2027. Poland remains a coal-dependent country, with 63% of its energy production relying on this fuel. The country has signed an agreement to build its first nuclear power plant, with the first reactor expected to enter service in 2033. The Poles are also less and less Catholic, with only 71.3% of the population identifying as Catholic in the 2021 census, compared to 87.6% a decade earlier. Abortion is almost completely banned in Poland, with women only allowed to have an abortion in hospital if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or if it poses a direct threat to the mother's life or health. Assistance with abortion is punishable by up to three years in prison. In 2024, only 896 abortions were performed in the country of 38 million people, but a network called 'Abortion without Borders' reported supporting 47,000 people in accessing abortion that same year.

**Poland Holds Second-Round Presidential Election Between Pro-European and Nationalist Candidates**
Poland is holding a second-round presidential election between a pro-European and a nationalist candidate. Rafal Trzaskowski, a 53-year-old pro-European and ally of the centrist government, is facing off against Karol Nawrocki, a 42-year-old nationalist historian. According to opinion polls, the result is too close to call, with Nawrocki leading by 0.2 percentage points. The outcome of the election could have significant consequences for Poland's role in the European Union and the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community. A victory for Trzaskowski would be a boost for the progressive agenda of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, potentially leading to changes such as the introduction of civil unions for same-sex couples and a relaxation of Poland's near-total ban on abortion. On the other hand, a win for Nawrocki would strengthen the populist Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, and could lead to new parliamentary elections. Many of Nawrocki's supporters want stricter migration controls and defend conservative values and greater sovereignty over the EU. 'We should not give in to European pressure,' said housewife Agnieszka Prokopiuk, 40, before voting. However, many of Trzaskowski's supporters advocate for greater European integration and faster social reforms. 'Unfortunately, Polish women do not have the same rights as our European friends,' said tourist guide Malgorzata Wojciechowska. 'I hope that Rafal Trzaskowski will revive the debate on abortion so that we can finally live in a free country where we can have our own opinion,' she added.

**Poland's Presidential Election: A Crucial Vote for the Country's Future in the EU**
Poland is holding a presidential election on Sunday, with a tight race between pro-EU candidate Rafal Trzaskowski and nationalist Karol Nawrocki. The outcome of the election could have significant implications for women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and Poland's relationship with the EU. According to polls, Nawrocki has a slight lead with 50.1% of the vote, while Trzaskowski has 49.9%. A victory for Trzaskowski would give a boost to the progressive agenda of the government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and could lead to significant social changes, such as the introduction of same-sex partnerships and a relaxation of abortion laws. On the other hand, a victory for Nawrocki would strengthen the populist party Law and Justice, which has been in power in Poland since 2015, and could lead to new parliamentary elections. Many of Nawrocki's supporters want stricter immigration controls and a greater sovereignty for Poland within the EU. 'We should not give in to European pressures,' Nawrocki said. 'We must follow our own path... and not succumb to Western trends.' The election is also being closely watched in Ukraine, which is seeking to strengthen its diplomatic support for its difficult negotiations with Russia. 'It was a genocide against the Polish people,' Nawrocki said, referring to the massacre of Polish civilians by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II. 'I hope that Rafal Trzaskowski will relaunch the debate on abortion so that we can finally live in a free country where we can have our own opinion,' said one supporter of Trzaskowski. 'Unfortunately, Polish women do not have the same rights as their European friends.'

**Poland's Presidential Election: A Choice Between Abortion Laws and EU Relations**
Poland has effectively banned abortion, with only exceptions for cases where the woman's life is in danger or the pregnancy is a result of incest or rape. The liberal candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, has promised to make abortion legal, but many women and young people are disappointed that nothing has changed since the liberal coalition won the parliamentary election in 2023. The conservative candidate, Karol Nawrocki, has vowed to maintain the current abortion laws. The outcome of the presidential election could impact Poland's relationship with the EU and Ukraine. Over 100,000 Poles in Norway are closely following the election. As Trzaskowski said, 'ukrainerne slåss for vår frihet' (Ukrainians are fighting for our freedom). Trzaskowski is also in favor of free abortion up to 12 weeks. Nawrocki, on the other hand, has expressed criticism towards Russia and called it 'neo-imperialistisk', but also believes that Ukraine's president Zelenskyj does not show sufficient gratitude for Poland's support.

**Poland's Presidential Election: A Clash of Cultures**
Poles are voting in a presidential election that will have significant implications for the country's future in Europe and on social issues such as abortion. According to polls, there is a close competition between Rafał Trzaskowski, a 53-year-old pro-European Union mayor of Warsaw, and Kaczyński's ally, the 42-year-old historian and conservative politician, Karol Napierski. Napierski has 50.1% of the voters' intentions, while Trzaskowski has 49.9%, with a narrow margin between them. The results will not be known until Monday. If Trzaskowski wins, it will give a significant boost to the progressive program adopted by the government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, the former president of the European Council. This could lead to significant social changes, such as recognizing same-sex civil partnerships and softening abortion laws, which are currently almost prohibited. On the other hand, a victory for Napierski would strengthen the position of the Law and Justice party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, and could lead to new parliamentary elections. Many of Napierski's supporters advocate for stricter immigration laws and a greater sovereignty for Poland within the European Union. As one of Napierski's supporters, Agnieszka Brokopucka, a 44-year-old housewife, said, 'We must not give in to European pressure.' Another supporter, Tomasz Chobliom, a 48-year-old mechanic, said, 'The European Union is important, but our sovereignty is more important.' According to Anna Materka-Sosnowska, a political expert, the election is a 'clash of cultures' due to the significant differences in policies between the candidates. Many of Trzaskowski's supporters advocate for a greater integration within the European Union and faster social reforms in the country, which has a large economic growth. The election has been closely followed in Ukraine, which is seeking to strengthen its diplomatic support in its difficult negotiations with Russia. Napierski, who is a fan of former US President Donald Trump, opposes Ukraine's accession to NATO and calls for restrictions on the privileges granted to around one million Ukrainian refugees in Poland.

**Polish Presidential Election: A Clash of Cultures**
Polish voters are casting their ballots in a presidential election that will have significant implications for the country's role in the European Union and social issues such as abortion.

**'We are done waiting': Inside Poland's first abortion center**
In Poland, where abortion rules are among the strictest in Europe, activists have opened the first abortion center in Warsaw, called AboTak. The center aims to help women and fill the vacuum left by the state, which has made it difficult for women to access safe and legal abortions. Despite the strict laws, an estimated 120,000 women in Poland terminate their pregnancies annually, with 95.4% using abortion pills, 2.9% traveling abroad, and 1.7% in Polish hospitals. The center provides a space for women to perform the procedure themselves, although it cannot provide assistance. Activists, including Natalia Broniarczyk and Justyna Wydrzynska, have been working to create a space where women can have abortions using pills on their own or with others. Broniarczyk said, 'We are done waiting.' The center has faced protests and vandalism from anti-abortion groups, but it remains open, providing a safe space for women to make their own decisions about their bodies.

**'We are done waiting': Inside Poland's first abortion centre**

The centre was opened in March and has already helped several women, including Joanna Sagier, who was diagnosed with Edwards Syndrome and was able to have an abortion in the Netherlands with the help of the Abortion Without Borders hotline. The centre's founders, Natalia Broniarczyk and Justyna Wydrzynska, said they are 'done waiting' for the government to liberalize the law and are taking matters into their own hands. The centre has faced protests and vandalism from anti-abortion groups, but the activists remain determined to provide a safe and supportive space for women.

**LFI Brings Abortion Pills to Poland in Support of Reproductive Rights**
The French left-wing party LFI has shown support for abortion rights in Poland by bringing abortion pills to the country. LFI President Mathilde Panot and MEP Manon Aubry handed out around 300 pills to activists in Warsaw and promised to send more in the future. 'We're turning the solidarity around', said Aubry, referencing the past when French women would travel to Poland for abortions before it was legal in France. Panot added, 'We're bringing direct help to women who want to end a pregnancy, because a woman's body belongs to her and her alone, not the state or the church.' The visit was to the first abortion clinic in Poland, opened by the Abortion Dream Team association last month to pressure lawmakers and provide a safe space for women seeking abortions. The Polish government has strict laws on abortion, with aid for abortion punishable by prison, but no law penalizing women who self-induce with online-purchased pills. According to official numbers, less than 900 hospital abortions were performed last year in the country of 38 million people, but tens of thousands of women end their pregnancies at home or abroad each year, using pills or other methods.

**French Lawmakers Bring Abortion Pills to Poland in Support of Women's Rights**
French lawmakers Mathilde Panot and Manon Aubry from the La France Insoumise party brought abortion pills to Poland to support women in the country where abortion is almost entirely banned. The pills were handed over to activists in Warsaw, and the lawmakers promised to send more in the future. 'We bring something to help women who want to interrupt their pregnancy because, whatever the situation, women's bodies belong to women and no one else,' said Panot. The association Abortion Dream Team created a center in Poland to pressure lawmakers and provide a space for women to get help with abortion. The visit from the French lawmakers is seen as a 'support that we don't get from Polish politicians,' said activist Justyna Wydrzynska. According to official numbers, less than 900 abortions were performed in hospitals last year in the country of 38 million people. However, tens of thousands of women end their pregnancies every year at home or abroad using pills, according to women's rights associations. 'When abortion was not legal in France, French women came to Poland to have an abortion,' recalled Aubry. 'Today, we bring our solidarity in the other direction.'

**IVG en danger: What role for the European Union?**
Abortion barriers are multiplying in the EU. In June 2023, Malta became the last EU country to recognize the right to abortion, with varying levels of restrictions. In Poland, abortion is only allowed in cases of rape or danger to the mother's life, following a legislative regression in January 2021. In contrast, 92% of women in Molise, a region in southern Italy, have access to abortion since its legalization in January 2019. In Hungary, a decree since September 2022 requires women to listen to the heartbeat of the fetus before undergoing an abortion, sparking criticism from feminist and human rights associations. The EU has limited powers in the field of health, and can only provide support to member states. Despite numerous resolutions adopted by the European Parliament since 2002, calling for member states to allow women to access abortion without conditions, these resolutions are not binding. To circumvent the EU's lack of competence in health, some MEPs have proposed amending the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU to include the right to abortion. However, this proposal has little chance of success, as it requires a unanimous vote from member states. To overcome these conflicts of competence, a European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) has been launched by the collective 'My voice, my choice', proposing that the EU finance abortions for women who do not have access to them within the EU. The ECI has collected over 1 million signatures in 15 countries, exceeding the required thresholds. The European Commission will now verify the signatures and decide on a legislative proposal, which may or may not be adopted.

**Poland's First Abortion Clinic Opens as a Symbol of Resistance**
A group of activists in Poland has opened the country's first abortion clinic, located in front of the Parliament building, to provide a safe space for women to access abortion without fear or bureaucracy. The clinic, opened on International Women's Day, is a symbolic act of resistance against the country's restrictive abortion laws. According to the UN, one in four countries has rolled back women's rights in 2024. Natalia Broniarczyk, from the Abortion Dream Team, said, 'Women can come here with their own pills, and for those who can't, we'll decide what happens here: between us and the woman.' The clinic is designed to look like a home, not a clinic, with a bathroom, sofa, and a place to rest and have a cup of tea or coffee before undergoing an abortion. The right to abortion has been a contentious issue in Poland for decades, with the country's conservative government blocking attempts to reform the law. The UN reports that up to 150,000 abortions are performed annually in Poland, but only 896 were done in hospitals in 2024. The organization warns that one in four countries has rolled back women's rights, with 612 million women and girls living under the shadow of conflict, where their rights are often considered dispensable. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said, 'Every 10 minutes, a woman is killed by her partner or family member. 612 million women and girls live under the shadow of conflict, where their rights are often considered dispensable. Less than two-thirds of women in the world participate in the labor market, and those who do earn much less than men. At this rate, eradicating extreme poverty for women and girls will take 130 years.'

**Poland: New Counseling Center for Abortion Support Opens in Warsaw**
The 'Abortion Dream Team' (ADT) has opened a new counseling center, 'AboTAK', in Warsaw, Poland, to support women seeking abortions. The center, which is the first of its kind in Poland, will provide information on abortion pills and help women obtain them. Natalia Broniarczyk, a member of the ADT, said, 'We will be there for them, they will not be left alone.' The center will also help women finance abortions abroad, particularly in cases where the fetus has severe defects. Broniarczyk explained, 'We have built a network of contacts in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands, which allows us to cooperate with doctors and hospitals in these countries.' The ADT has supported 47,000 women in obtaining abortions in 2024. Poland has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, allowing abortion only in cases of rape, danger to the woman's life or health, or severe fetal defects. The laws were tightened in 2020, and doctors have been reluctant to perform abortions, even in life-threatening situations, leading to several deaths. Broniarczyk said, 'If a person comes to us who cannot obtain pills and needs an abortion, we will take the risk and help her.' The center's goal is to remind politicians of the need for a change in the law, which has been stagnant for over 30 years.

**Justyna Wydrzyńska: A Polish Activist's Fight for Abortion Rights**
Justyna Wydrzyńska, a Polish pro-choice activist, has been fighting for better access to abortion in Poland for nearly twenty years. She has been involved in a high-profile case, where she helped a woman obtain an abortion pill, which is considered a crime in Poland since the near-total ban on abortion in 2021. Wydrzyńska, who has experienced domestic violence and knows the difficulties of accessing abortion information in Poland, believes that sharing her own experience and showing that she is a woman who has had an abortion has given a face to the fight. She has been involved in organizing trips to neighboring countries for women to access abortion, and in 2024, 47,000 women were able to have an abortion. Wydrzyńska remains critical of the Polish government's policies, saying that they are just promises and that the situation in hospitals remains the same. She is confident that she has the support of the public, with 63% of Poles being in favor of legalizing abortion, according to a 2023 Ipsos survey. Wydrzyńska's case has been sent back to the Praga district court in Warsaw, and she remains hopeful despite the challenges she faces.

**Poland's Abortion Center Defies Government, Opens Near Parliament**
A new abortion center in Warsaw, Poland is set to open near the parliament building, despite strict abortion laws in the country. Natalia Broniarczyk, from the organization ADT, said, 'We want this place to be on TripAdvisor, so people know they have to visit it in Warsaw.' The center aims to provide a 'safe space' for women to discuss abortion options and, in some cases, take abortion pills. However, under current laws, this is illegal, as a near-total abortion ban is in place. The center's opening comes as the government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, has failed to loosen the strict abortion laws, despite promising to do so before his election win in 2023. Tusk himself said in August 2024 that there is no prospect of liberalizing the abortion law until the end of the current parliamentary term. ADT activist Justyna Wydrzynska said, 'What we're doing could be seen as illegal.' She knows the risks, having been sentenced to eight months of community service for providing a pregnant woman with abortion pills in 2023. The case is currently being retried. Wydrzynska remains determined to open the center, saying, 'We're not going to let the government ignore the needs of women. And that's a risk to health and life. So we have to react, and there's no other solution than to help people.'

**Ultra-Right Erodes Women's Rights in the US, Europe, and Latin America**
The ultra-right is eroding women's rights in the US, Europe, and Latin America. In the US, the Supreme Court's 'Roe versus Wade' decision in 2022 limited the constitutional protection of abortion, leading to its prohibition in 12 states and restrictions in another 20. The Biden administration has also rolled back support for transgender healthcare. 'We are in a stage of confusion, chaos, and a public health crisis in reproductive health and sexuality,' says Alejandra Soto, director of communications and Latino media at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In Latin America, four countries - El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic - have the harshest penalties for abortion, affecting the lives of women, adolescents, and girls. In Honduras, 76% of victims of sexual violence in 2024 were girls, mostly abused by a family member or acquaintance. In Nicaragua, 41% of medical-legal reports on sexual violence were for girls under 12 years old, and 40% for adolescents between 13 and 17 years old. The violence has been normalized, making it difficult to perceive or justify. Argentina, which legalized abortion in 2020, is now experiencing a regressive context that puts these gains at risk. The government has dismantled institutions, cut assistance and public policies for preventing and eradicating gender-based violence, and announced plans to eliminate the crime of femicide from the Penal Code. 'We are in a total crisis situation in medication for abortion and contraception because the last medications were delivered last year and there is no planning for 2025,' says Dr. Julia Bazán, a public hospital doctor in Buenos Aires. In Europe, the access to safe, free, and legal abortion is also under threat. Over 20 million women in Europe do not have guaranteed access to this right, and some countries, like Andorra or Malta, have completely penalized it, while Poland has one of the most restrictive abortion laws, only allowing it in cases of rape, incest, or risk to the mother's health. The promise of the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, to advance towards a free, legal, and risk-free abortion has not been fulfilled. 'Abortion is incredibly penalized in Poland, especially in terms of help. Initially, after the government change, pregnant women were not penalized for aborting, but everything around it was,' explains Mónica Costa Riba. In Italy, the erosion of the right to abortion has accelerated since 2022, with 63.4% of gynecologists declaring themselves conscientious objectors, forcing women to listen to the fetal heartbeat or face hostility and offensive language from healthcare staff. 'Thinking that this doesn't affect you is a mistake; it affects us all because the weakening of rights is not something that stays in a distant field, it touches us as a society,' says Costa, highlighting the importance of solidarity with the most vulnerable people.
