**GIEWS Country Brief Mali 28-May-2025**
According to the latest Cadre Harmonisé (CH) analysis, about 1.52 million people (7 percent of the analyzed population) in Mali are projected to face acute food insecurity during the June to August 2025 lean season period, including over 64,000 people in CH Phase 4 (Emergency) and about 2,600 people in CH Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Conflict remains the primary driver of acute food insecurity, particularly in central and northern regions. The planting of 2025 cereal crops is underway in southern areas, but conflict is expected to continue to affect agricultural activities in central and northern areas, likely leading to localized production shortfalls. Average to above-average rainfall amounts are expected between June and September 2025, but also heighten the risk of flooding. The 2024 aggregate cereal production is officially estimated at 10.4 million tonnes, about 5 percent above the average of the previous five years, but flooding and civil insecurity disrupted agricultural activities, resulting in localized production shortfalls. Wholesale prices of locally produced sorghum and rice remained stable or increased between January and April 2025, mainly reflecting shortfalls of the 2024 production in several regions and conflict-related market disruptions.

**Unusually active weather pattern to close out the month**
The Bay Area is expected to experience an unusually active weather pattern over the next week, with a temperature rollercoaster and potentially unsettled weather. A hot weather event is forecasted for later this week, with temperatures up to 25°F above average, and a large part of the Bay Area could see temperatures in the mid 90s. The heat will be followed by a sharp cooldown, and there's also the possibility of isolated thunderstorms. A tropical storm, Alvin, is expected to form in the Eastern Pacific and track northwestwards towards California, potentially interacting with a cutoff low pressure system and bringing more widespread storm activity and rainfall. The heat this weekend won't last long, and temperatures will come crashing down from their near-record levels. A significant trough of low pressure will drop down from Canada, resulting in well below average temperatures and widespread showers. The weather pattern is expected to continue into June, but the full extent of it is still uncertain.

**US Braces for Unbearable Heatwave This Summer**
The United States is expected to experience an unbearable heatwave this summer, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The summer of 2025 is predicted to be warmer and more humid than usual in most parts of the country. By June 1st, the start of the meteorological summer, temperatures will begin to rise steadily. The NOAA's seasonal outlook indicates a high probability of above-average heat in much of the country, particularly in the west, northeast, and south. This forecast aligns with a global trend: the disappearance of cooler summers. Last summer was the fourth warmest on record in the US, and the warmest globally. The east coast is preparing for high humidity levels, caused by a recent heat dome that will increase the temperature of the western Atlantic. This phenomenon will lead to increased 'heat index' and air conditioning usage. The southerly winds, carrying moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, will also contribute to a more humid environment, especially in the eastern and southeastern states. The excessive humidity will bring more chances of tropical precipitation. According to climate models, the rains could be more frequent and intense in the east and southeast, without canceling the summer at the beach. The high water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic could facilitate the formation or intensification of tropical systems, increasing the risk of storms in coastal areas. While the east prepares for rain, the western United States may face the extreme side of the summer. Persistent drought conditions increase the likelihood of an active and dangerous wildfire season, especially in California, Arizona, and Nevada. In contrast, the northern states may enjoy a sunnier summer than usual. A lower cloud cover is expected from the northwest to the northeast, resulting in more clear days for outdoor activities. Sunglasses, sunscreen, and water will be essential for residents and visitors in these regions. Although the seasonal outlooks do not offer the precision of short-term weather forecasts, they do allow for general trends to be anticipated. Institutions like the NOAA, along with other international meteorological agencies, use climate models that consider global factors like El Niño and La Niña to generate these projections.

**World Hunger Day 2025: Nigerians are hungry**
Nigeria is facing a severe food crisis, with nearly 31 million people expected to face acute food and nutrition insecurity by June-August. The country is experiencing severe desertification, coastal erosion, and irregular rainfall patterns, which are disrupting planting seasons and leading to hunger. The climate crisis is compounded by insecurity, banditry, and farmer-herder conflicts, which have displaced millions and deterred agricultural investment. Economic reforms have also added strain to vulnerable households, with inflation pushing basic food items out of reach. The government is urged to take urgent action, prioritizing smallholder farmers, improving access to credit and inputs, and implementing climate-resilient strategies. Without comprehensive investments in resilient food systems, Nigeria risks a catastrophe by 2050.

**Will California have a mild summer or hotter-than-usual weather? See the forecast**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center is forecasting higher-than-usual temperatures across much of California this summer, including a 50% to 60% chance of above-normal temperatures in the northern and eastern parts of the state. According to the agency, 'summer temperatures are likely to be above normal for much of the state' in 2025. The National Weather Service's latest three-month outlook shows temperatures in June, July, and August will be above normal, with a 53% chance of above-average heat in Sacramento. The ongoing drought is likely to persist through the end of August, and wildfire season is expected to be worse than usual, with an 'above-normal' risk for significant wildfires across much of California from June through August. 'Outlooks for Northern and Southern California both paint a picture of a significant increase -- (a) pretty widespread, elevated risk of large fires come August,' said John Abatzoglou, a climatologist at the University of California, Merced. The summer solstice begins on June 20 in California, marking the official start of summer in the Northern Hemisphere. 'Normal' is based on the average of all temperatures from 1991 to 2020, according to the National Weather Service. For more specific forecasts, the agency recommends checking its interactive maps for localized details.

**Nicaragua Prepares Institutions for the 2025 Rainy Season with Invierno Seguro Plan**
As the rainy season approaches, the Nicaraguan government has presented the National Interinstitutional Plan Invierno Seguro 2025, which brings together over 20 institutions to act before, during, and after climate-related emergencies. The plan, led by the Presidency of the Republic, proposes measures to prevent and respond to rain, floods, landslides, hurricanes, and other phenomena that could severely affect vulnerable communities nationwide. According to the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (INETER), the winter will begin with isolated rains in May, intensifying in June. Although normal precipitation ranges are expected, the Caribbean could receive accumulations exceeding 1,000 mm. A cyclone season above the usual is also anticipated. The plan identifies vulnerability scenarios based on past events and geographical characteristics: Over 2.4 million people live in areas at risk of hurricanes, and 1.5 million in areas at risk of floods, distributed in 2,047 critical points between neighborhoods and communities. Some concrete actions include: strengthening risk communication through radio alerts, WhatsApp, and SMS messages; and periodically evaluating the condition of schools, hospitals, markets, and access roads. Public schools in Nicaragua will have trained school brigades, simulations, and infrastructure reviews. The Ministry of Health has 76 hospitals, 142 health centers, and mobile clinics to address health emergencies. ENACAL and ENATREL will execute maintenance plans for water and electricity networks. Temporary shelters with psychological accompaniment, protection of vulnerable groups, and food, water, and medicine supplies are also planned. The Nicaraguan Army will be actively involved with specialized units for search and rescue, humanitarian aid transport, and preventive evacuations. The National Police will implement road safety measures and protection in high-risk areas. Local governments will also take preventive actions: cleaning drains, pruning trees, eliminating mosquito breeding sites, and visiting homes in critical areas. The Nicaraguan authorities urge families to update their emergency plans, reinforce their homes, and stay informed.

**WFP Lebanon Situation Report - April 2025 - Lebanon**
As of the end of April, nearly 970,500 internally displaced people (IDPs) have returned home in Lebanon, while 90,000 remain displaced. Meanwhile, 35,500 Syrians have fled to North Lebanon, with many sheltering in mosques, community halls, or with vulnerable families. The sixth IPC Acute Food Insecurity Analysis in Lebanon shows a decline in food insecurity, with 1.17 million people (21 percent of the population) projected to face acute food insecurity between April and June 2025, down from 1.65 million (30 percent) in March 2025. Despite this slight improvement, conflict aftershocks, economic stagnation, inflation, and funding gaps still threaten Lebanon's fragile food security, according to the report. 'The situation remains fragile,' said the report, 'underscoring the need for continued support to address the root causes of food insecurity.'

**As Oakland awaits employees’ return to office, businesses feel downtown drought**
Oakland's downtown area is experiencing a drought of busy workplaces, with office vacancies climbing to 26.5% in the first quarter of 2025, compared to 20.5% in the same period last year. The city's shift to a minimum requirement of four in-person workdays a week has been postponed to June 2, due to 'productive dialogue' between the city and its public-employee labor unions. Business owners, such as Elaine Taing of CravLings, are feeling the impact of the lack of foot traffic and customers, with some lamenting the loss of a steady customer base. City departments, such as police and fire, are fully in person or nearly there, but swaths of municipal employees continue to work remotely more than one day a week. The city's permitting process is also being bottlenecked, with a lack of support among management for streamlining the process. 'We should be there,' said Lonell Butler, the city's chief building official, in a resignation letter. 'I mean, we’re public servants.'

**Somalia: Number of People Facing High Levels of ‘Acute Food Insecurity’ Projected to Rise to 4.4 Millions**
The World Food Programme (WFP) warns that 4.4 million people in Somalia, or 23% of the population, could face high levels of 'acute food insecurity' between April and June 2025 due to recurrent droughts, floods, conflict, and high food prices. This is a significant increase from the current 3.4 million people experiencing crisis levels of hunger. WFP's Director notes, 'A massive scale-up of humanitarian assistance averted famine then. Now hunger is rising again as another drought looms.' The WFP is facing a critical funding gap of US$297 million, which may force it to reduce assistance and prioritize operations. Without additional funding, WFP operations in Somalia may face pipeline breaks by mid-year.

**14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know**
As of April 28, over 14 million Florida residents are living in areas of drought, an increase of 18.3% since last week, according to the Drought Monitor. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Integrated Drought Information System reports that 51.8% of Florida is under drought conditions, with some areas experiencing extreme drought. The National Weather Service has issued drought information statements for several areas, warning of the effects of dry conditions and what's to come. NOAA's National Integrated Drought Information System predicts that nearly half of the US will experience abnormally hot and dry conditions in summer 2025. The mean statewide drought index has jumped to 469, with 21 counties issuing burn bans due to 97 wildfires burning across Florida, charring over 3,600 acres.

**Drought, conflict may push 1M more Somalians into critical food insecurity, warns WFP**
The World Food Program (WFP) warns that drought, conflict, and high food prices may push an additional one million Somalians into crisis levels of food insecurity in the coming months. According to the latest analysis, 3.4 million people are already experiencing crisis-level hunger or worse, and this number is projected to rise to 4.4 million by April to June 2025. WFP's director of food security and nutrition analysis, Jean-Martin Bauer, stated, 'Now hunger is rising again as another drought looms.' The analysis also found that food production in 2024 was 45% below the long-term average, and around 1.7 million children under the age of five are expected to face acute malnutrition through December 2025. The WFP will support 820,000 vulnerable people per month with food and cash assistance starting in April, down from a peak of 2.2 million per month in 2024.

**4.4 million Somalis threatened by hunger until June due to drought and food scarcity**
Approximately 4.4 million people in Somalia are threatened by hunger until June due to drought and increasing food scarcity, according to a report supported by the UN, published on Wednesday. This is 1 million more people than in the first quarter of the year. The Integrated Food Security Classification System (CIP) report estimates that in the first quarter of 2025, around 3.4 million inhabitants or 17% of the country's population will face acute food insecurity, following a decrease in agricultural production at the end of 2024 due to rainfall scarcity. Stéphane Dujarric, the UN Secretary-General's spokesperson, warned on Wednesday about 'the deterioration of food security in the country.' The CIP analysis predicts that between April and June, 4.4 million men, women, and children (23% of the population) will suffer from acute food insecurity, among other things due to below-average monsoon rains, ongoing conflicts, high prices, and localized flooding. The report also estimates that 1.7 million children under the age of five (4% more than in 2024) will suffer from acute malnutrition and require treatment, including 466,000 in the category of severe acute malnutrition. 'The worsening drought, unpredictable rains, and ongoing conflict are eroding livelihoods, plunging families deeper into crisis,' said Etienne Peterschmitt, FAO Representative in Somalia, in a statement. According to the UN, nearly six million Somalis will need humanitarian aid in 2025. However, in a context of chronic underfunding, the humanitarian plan launched at the end of January requests $1.43 billion to help 4.6 million people as a priority.

**UN Report: Over 4 Million Somalis Face Hunger Risk by June**
A report by the United Nations warns that more than 4.4 million Somalis will face the risk of hunger by June, an increase of about 1 million people from the current number. The report, published on Wednesday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system used by UN agencies, estimates that in the first quarter of 2025, around 3.4 million people, or 17% of Somalia's population, will experience a severe food insecurity, following a decline in agricultural production at the end of 2024 due to a lack of rainfall. 'The food security situation is deteriorating in Somalia,' said UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric on Wednesday. According to the IPC analysis, from April to June, 4.4 million men, women, and children (23% of the population) will suffer from severe food insecurity, particularly due to expected below-average rainfall, ongoing conflicts, rising prices, and local flooding. The report also estimates that in 2025, 1.7 million children under the age of five will suffer from severe malnutrition and will need treatment, including 466,000 children who will suffer from severe acute malnutrition. 'The worsening drought, unpredictable rainfall, and ongoing conflict are undermining livelihoods and pushing families deeper into crisis,' said FAO representative in Somalia, Etienne Peterschmitt. The FAO is responding to this situation 'by supporting increased agricultural production, promoting climate-resilient solutions, and strengthening the resilience of agricultural food systems.' According to the UN, around 6 million Somalis will need humanitarian assistance in 2025. However, due to ongoing funding shortages, the humanitarian plan launched in late January calls for $1.43 billion in funding to assist 4.6 million people as a priority.

According to the UN, nearly six million Somalis will need humanitarian aid in 2025. However, in a context of chronic underfunding, the humanitarian plan launched at the end of January requests $1.43 billion to help 4.6 million people as a priority.

**Somalia: 4.4 million people at risk of famine by June**
According to a report by the Integrated Food Security Classification System (IPC), supported by the UN, 4.4 million people in Somalia will be at risk of famine by June, an increase of 1 million from the current number. The report estimates that 3.4 million people, or 17% of the population, will face acute food insecurity in the first quarter of 2025. Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, warned of 'the deterioration of food security in the country.' The IPC analysis predicts that between April and June, 4.4 million people (23% of the population) will be in a state of acute food insecurity, mainly due to below-average monsoon rains, ongoing conflicts, high prices, and localized flooding. 1.7 million children under the age of five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition in 2025, with 466,000 in severe acute malnutrition. Etienne Peterschmitt, FAO representative in Somalia, commented, 'Drought, unpredictable rains, and ongoing conflict are eroding livelihoods, plunging families deeper into crisis.' The FAO is responding to this situation by supporting increased agricultural production, encouraging climate change adaptation solutions, and strengthening agro-food systems resilience. The UN estimates that nearly 6 million Somalis will need humanitarian aid in 2025, but in a context of chronic underfunding, the humanitarian plan launched in January requires $1.43 billion in funding to assist 4.6 million people.

**Fires and floods are eviscerating US communities, intensifying the housing crisis**
The recent wildfires in California have exacerbated the state's housing crisis, with thousands of homes destroyed and a shortage of 1.2 million affordable homes. The fires have left many people displaced, with 3.2 million U.S. adults displaced or evacuated due to natural disasters in 2022, and over 500,000 still unable to return home by the end of the year. The recovery process is filled with hurdles, especially for low-income and marginalized communities, who are disproportionately vulnerable to climate disasters. Experts warn that climate change is the world's fastest-growing driver of homelessness, displacing millions of people annually. The consequences of natural disasters are already playing out, with homelessness in Hawaii rising by 87% after the 2023 Maui wildfires, and experts predicting that California's homeless population will surge dramatically in 2025. 'Natural disasters cause a massive spike in homelessness,' said Jeremy Ney, a macroeconomics policy strategist. 'The primary goal of relief organizations like the Red Cross is to prevent people from becoming permanently unhoused — but for many, it can take a decade or more to recover.'

According to a recent report, 2024 is the hottest year on record, with devastating floods and droughts causing widespread destruction. Within the next 20 years, parts of New York and New Jersey will become uninhabitable due to destroyed infrastructure, while Florida may see the impacts of flooding much sooner. Miami is predicted to be 60% submerged within the next 25 years, with the city being three feet underwater as soon as 2050. Louisiana is losing 8 football field lengths per month to rising seas, and New Orleans is expected to be underwater within 60 years. Water-related disasters have caused over 8,700 fatalities, displaced 40 million people, and resulted in economic losses exceeding $550 billion. The report also highlights the urgent need for replacement of old water pipes and the loss of fresh water aquifers due to salt water intrusion. Additionally, fires consumed 77,000 square kilometers in 2024, with Southern California experiencing a devastating fire that destroyed 12,000-14,000 structures and caused 39 fatalities. The initial monetary damage is estimated to exceed $80 billion, and the long-term health effects of breathing smoke containing chemicals and particulates will affect millions of people.
