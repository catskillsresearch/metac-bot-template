**Ukraine's Operation 'Паутина' Destroys 34% of Russia's Strategic Aviation**
On June 1, 2024, Ukraine conducted a unique operation, codenamed 'Паутина' (Spider), which resulted in the destruction or disablement of 34% of Russia's strategic aviation. Ukrainian drones attacked four Russian strategic aviation airfields: Olenya, Belaya, Dzyagilevo, and Ivanovo. The geography of the strikes is impressive, covering the Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ryazan, and Ivanovo regions of Russia. The operation resulted in the destruction of 41 Russian strategic aircraft, including 3 Tu-95MS, 4 Tu-22M3, and potentially 1 Tu-160. The cost of the operation to Russia is estimated at 7 billion dollars, but the most significant consequence is the inability to restore its potential and the loss of part of the so-called nuclear triad. This operation shatters the myth of Russia's invincibility, which supposedly can wage war indefinitely. The article provides detailed information on the characteristics, cost, and capabilities of the Russian strategic aircraft, including the Tu-95MS, Tu-22M3, and Tu-160.

**Foods for Survival: Scientists Identify the Most Suitable Crops for a Global Catastrophe**
A study by a team of scientists from the University of Otago in New Zealand has identified the most suitable foods for surviving a global catastrophe. The researchers focused on finding crops that, due to their properties, could guarantee human survival in extreme climate conditions. The study, published in the journal PlosOne, examined the crops that could be most effective for feeding the population in case of global disasters, and it did so by conducting a meta-analysis of previous research on urban agriculture. The scientists found that, in normal scenarios, beans and legumes in general stand out as the most efficient crops, while in a nuclear winter, spinach and beets are the best candidates. The study reveals that the most effective crops are not necessarily those that require large areas of land or have a pleasant taste. According to the researchers, spinach and beets are the best options for facing a nuclear winter, as they are resistant plants that can withstand colder temperatures and, in most cases, do not depend on direct sunlight to grow. In a nuclear winter, the sky would be covered with a layer of smoke and ash, blocking sunlight and making photosynthesis difficult. This would have a devastating impact on conventional crops, but spinach and beets have a higher tolerance for adverse conditions. Additionally, they are plants that provide a good amount of nutrients and are relatively easy to cultivate. Their ability to grow in less fertile soils makes them a viable option in scenarios where resources are limited. The study also highlights the efficiency of crops in terms of space required. In a scenario of global disaster, such as a nuclear war or the impact of a large meteorite, the available space for cultivating food could be extremely limited. For this reason, the University of Otago team focused on finding crops that not only provide nutrients but also can grow in reduced areas. For example, beans turned out to be one of the most efficient crops in an urban environment in normal conditions. This crop only requires 292 square meters of land to feed a person for a year, making it an ideal option for areas where space is limited. However, as beans are not resistant to cold and their viability decreases in a nuclear winter. In a nuclear winter, a combination of wheat and carrots is more effective, as these plants have a higher tolerance to cold temperatures. Specifically, a mixture of 97% wheat and 3% carrots is the most efficient for this type of scenario. Wheat, being a cereal crop, provides a large amount of carbohydrates, while carrots provide essential vitamins and minerals. This type of combination is crucial because, in an apocalypse, the variety of available foods can be very limited. People may have to resort to a more monotonous diet, making nutritious options even more valuable. Additionally, both wheat and carrots have the advantage of not requiring large areas of land to cultivate them, making them a viable option even in reduced spaces. The study led by Matt Boyd not only offers an answer to the question of what foods could save us in a scenario of global catastrophe, but also opens the debate on how societies can prepare to face these challenges. Resilience, security, and the well-being of the population must be considered when making decisions about land use and food production.

**WHO Reopens Debate on Health Consequences of Nuclear War**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to resume a topic that had been left untouched for almost four decades: the analysis of the effects that a nuclear war would have on human health and healthcare systems. The last time it did so was in 1987. The decision, approved on Monday in the World Health Assembly, was promoted by 86 member states, although not without controversy. The resolution had to be put to a vote, something unusual in this forum, which usually operates by consensus, due to the strong opposition of some countries. Russia, supported explicitly by North Korea, requested the vote, in which 14 countries voted against and 28 abstained, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Pakistan, and India. The promoters of the report argue that scientific and technological knowledge has advanced enough to allow for a new and more complete analysis of the impacts of a nuclear conflict. Between them are island nations such as the Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu, some of the most affected historically by nuclear tests in the 20th century. The WHO had stopped elaborating reports on these risks since the nuclear threat of the Cold War faded in the 1990s. However, the deterioration of the geopolitical landscape - with direct threats, modernization of arsenals, and new nuclear-armed powers - has reactivated global concern. The critics of the countries opposed to the resolution argue that this task exceeds the WHO's health functions and represents an excessive financial burden, just at a time of crisis for the organization. But civil organizations such as the International Association of Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War - awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 - have celebrated the decision as a necessary and urgent step. 'We are pleased that the vast majority of nations recognize the importance of updating these fundamental studies,' said Charles Johnson, director of policies for the association. For him, recent events highlight the need for the WHO to provide 'authorized and updated evidence on the risk that a nuclear war poses to human survival and the stability of terrestrial systems.' The message is clear: while the world redoubles its tensions, the international community begins to recognize that looking the other way is not an option. Reopening the debate on the health consequences of a nuclear war is not alarmism, it's prevention. A nuclear war would have devastating consequences for human health in the short, medium, and long term. People exposed directly to the explosions would suffer severe thermal burns, eye injuries from intense light, hearing and lung damage from shock waves, and a lethal exposure to ionizing radiation. Those who survive the initial impact would face a chaotic situation: collapsed healthcare systems, destroyed hospitals, lack of essential medicines, and affected or disappeared healthcare professionals. The risk of massive infections, respiratory diseases from inhaling radioactive particles, and the impossibility of receiving adequate medical attention would turn any wound or common pathology into potentially lethal. At a long-term, the population would suffer an exponential increase in cancer cases - especially leukemias, thyroid, lung, and breast cancer - as well as cardiovascular and neurological disorders induced by radiation. Pregnant women exposed would have high rates of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformations in newborns. It is estimated that food insecurity caused by water, soil, and crop contamination would give rise to prolonged famines, severe malnutrition, and massive migrations. The psychological sequelae, such as post-traumatic stress, chronic anxiety, and depression, would mark entire generations, especially children who would grow up in an environment without resources, without basic services, and with a collective trauma of destruction and loss.

**Go nuclear?**
Ireland is facing a critical moment in its climate action journey, with the Environmental Protection Agency warning that the country will only achieve a 29% reduction in emissions by 2030, falling short of the 51% target set by the Climate Act. The author suggests that incorporating a proportion of nuclear energy, possibly through small modular reactors, could greatly improve Ireland's situation. 'I wonder if, or hopefully how many, of Ireland's population will consider how a proportion of nuclear energy... could greatly improve our situation?' the author asks.

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, including decision-making in offices, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that demographers are predicting a population collapse due to AI, and that the great cities of the world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to 100 million. He also notes that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, and suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing space may be a viable option to ensure humanity's survival.

**Global Crises Hinder Efforts to Convince Millions to Quit Smoking**
According to a report presented to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the global crises have hindered efforts to convince millions to quit smoking. The report states that the delay has affected approximately 95 million additional tobacco consumers, who were supposed to stop smoking by 2025. Despite the success of governments in reducing the number of smokers, the failure to reduce the number by 30% means that 1.207 billion and 800,000 people are still smoking worldwide, instead of the target of 1.112 billion and 400,000, according to a Reuters report using smoking rates and population numbers from the report. As the report notes, 'this delay... has affected approximately 95 million additional tobacco consumers, who were supposed to stop smoking by 2025'.

**Explosion in Russian Electronics Factory Raises Questions About Nuclear Facilities**
A large explosion occurred at an electronics factory in St. Petersburg, which was a subcontractor to the Russian military. Ukraine conducted a major special forces operation earlier this spring, which included infiltration of operators using Blackhawk helicopters. Danish and German media have revealed that Russian nuclear facilities are deteriorating, raising further questions about the functionality of Russia's intercontinental missiles. The Ukrainian military's helicopter unit 16 Blackhawk is seen in the background in October 2023. Organizations and projects to support Ukraine can be found here.

A Russian electronics factory in St. Petersburg was hit by an explosion and fire last night. Film on the fire can be seen here here here. Helicopter 16 Blackhawk or sometimes called Svarthök. Not necessarily just filming as you see, but rather focusing on the chaos. Ukraine conducted a major special forces operation in the spring to stop the Russian offensive over the Oskil river, which included infiltration of operators using Blackhawk helicopters. According to United24 Media, special forces operations should be characterized by the unexpected and unpredictable, which is a foundation for successful operations. Russia probably did not expect air landings over the Oskil river and, based on the losses, appears to have been taken by surprise, which has contributed to the difficult Russian losses. The date of the operation is not specified, but based on the footage, it was early in the spring or late in the winter. Russian nuclear facilities The Russian nuclear system is deteriorating, revealed Danish Danwatch and German Der Spiegel in a large investigation based on leaked documents. Kyiv Insider summarizes in an article: “For the international community, the takeaway is clear: Russia’s nuclear posture may appear formidable on paper, but behind the curtain lies a state increasingly unable to manage the vast arsenal it inherited. In the age of cyberwarfare and digital espionage, incompetence is a liability no superpower can afford—and Russia, it seems, is learning that too late.” Even United24 Media has an article, and the facilities are being rebuilt from the ground up as they have deteriorated. Modernization attempts will be made with imported material from the West, as Russia cannot produce it itself and the German company Knauf is pointed out. The leak now means that Russia will likely need to rebuild further as the weaknesses in the constructions are now revealed and can be used to disable the nuclear weapons. COMMENTARY One can reasonably question whether Russian nuclear weapons even work. Considering that they constantly threaten to use them and even said they would cancel the nuclear test ban treaty, but never manage to conduct a successful test, their functionality is highly questionable. It costs huge amounts of money to maintain nuclear weapons and their facilities, and as an oligarch and responsible for the industry that does this, it should be easier to just send the money to their Swiss or Cypriot bank accounts and pretend to do the work. As long as it does not become a nuclear war, they will not be discovered. The US conducted a successful test shot just last week and thus proves that their missiles work. The article is updated.

**The Real Apocalypse: WSJ Suggests Nuclear War Could End Human Civilization**
The world is on the brink of a climate apocalypse caused by nuclear war, not gradual greenhouse gas emissions. The possibility of such an outcome has become more apparent due to the conflict between India and Pakistan. According to Ted Nordhaus, author of environmental materials for The Wall Street Journal, 'Although the long-term consequences of emissions are uncertain, we know that a nuclear war would lead to an immediate nuclear winter. When we think of a nuclear apocalypse, we usually think of the immediate consequences: thermonuclear explosions that burn cities and vaporize populations. But the worst consequences unfold long after the weapon explodes. A massive thermonuclear exchange would envelop the atmosphere in soot, plunging the world into darkness and starting a winter that would last for decades.' Nordhaus notes that even if hundreds of millions of people would likely die in the initial fires, the majority of the planet's population, including those in warring countries, would probably die from subsequent winter starvation. 'The comforting thought is that an exchange of nuclear warheads in a regional conflict, such as between India and Pakistan, might be more limited. The number of deaths from detonating a few dozen warheads could be counted in only a few million, and that would have little impact on the planet's temperature,' Nordhaus suggests. However, if India bombs Islamabad and Pakistan retaliates by bombing Mumbai, it would be difficult to prevent further escalation. Moreover, if intercontinental ballistic missiles are in the air, other nuclear states would essentially be unable to determine where they are headed, Nordhaus emphasized. 'Leaders in Washington, Moscow, and Beijing will have to make a decision within minutes to launch their own weapons. Scenarios of medium level, including a few hundred warheads, would lead to a cooling of the climate, sufficient to destroy global food production and trade, and would likely kill hundreds of millions of people,' Nordhaus predicts. In the worst-case scenario, droughts and crop failures would quickly spread around the world, resulting in hundreds of millions of refugees moving to other continents in search of food, security, and shelter. However, some would still die from diseases and others from starvation. Therefore, as Nordhaus writes, in such a scenario, human civilization would come to an end. 'The regime of arms control, which world leaders have carefully built over the past stages of the Cold War, is crumbling into pieces. In February next year, the term of the new Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed in 2010, will expire, which limits the number of deployed warheads in Russia and the United States to 1550 units - this is still enough to destroy civilization. Russia and the United States have over 5,000 warheads in reserve. China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal,' Nordhaus reminded. He notes that conflicts between nuclear opponents remind humanity that there is no greater risk to society than nuclear war. 'Zero nuclear weapons may be as unattainable a dream as a zero carbon footprint, but for politicians, philanthropists, and leaders of civil society, regardless of their political views, there should be no higher priority than de-escalating this threat,' Nordhaus concluded. Earlier, Axios reported that the United States plans to spend $1 trillion on nuclear weapons over the next 10 years. This amount is greater than the budget of many federal agencies. According to experts, the US Department of Defense will have to make a 'difficult choice' about which programs to continue. At the same time, analysts also say that 'rapidly rising' prices divert resources from 'other more pressing human needs and national security priorities.' General Nikolai Filatov responded to whether the Ukrainian military would shoot down enemy missiles with nuclear warheads. According to him, Ukrainian troops should shoot down these enemy targets without immediately determining whether they are nuclear or not. He also explained whether there would be a detonation in the event of shooting down a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead, using the example of short- and medium-range missiles. 'When they shoot down short- and medium-range missiles, theoretically, the warhead should not detonate. Depending on where they hit. If they hit the engine and it's damaged - one situation, i.e., the missile will fall and there will be no explosion. Regarding the warhead, we need to explain the principle of operation. The warhead consists of several segments, located so that there is no uncontrolled chain reaction. When applied, these parts of the charge come close to each other, a critical mass forms - a nuclear explosion occurs,' Filatov noted.

**Crops That Will Keep Cities Standing on Doomsday**
Scientists have researched which foods would be most suitable for human survival in the event of a global catastrophe such as a nuclear war, massive volcanic eruption, or asteroid impact. According to their findings, a 'nuclear winter' scenario could occur, where the lack of sunlight would lead to a significant drop in temperatures, damage to agriculture, and a rapid depletion of food resources. The researchers, led by Matt Boyd, aimed to identify the crops that could provide the most nutrition with the least amount of land. Initially, the list included products such as beans, spinach, sugar beets, wheat, and carrots. However, beans were eliminated due to their inability to grow without sunlight. The remaining four products - spinach, sugar beets, wheat, and carrots - are notable for their ability to withstand cold temperatures and provide essential nutrients. Spinach and sugar beets are particularly recommended for small-population cities, as they can be grown in limited spaces and meet basic nutritional needs. However, in large cities, the production capacity of these crops would not be sufficient to feed the entire population. Therefore, the researchers suggest increasing the production of wheat and carrots in the surrounding areas.

**Nuclear war expert reveals how 60% of humans could die in first 72 minutes of attack if WW3 broke out**
Annie Jacobsen, a nuclear war expert and investigative journalist, predicts that in the event of a global nuclear war, 60% of the world's population, or around 5 billion people, would die within the first 72 minutes. According to Jacobsen, the initial blast would be followed by a 'conflagration of fire' that would engulf the entire country, making it impossible for survivors to survive for long. She also notes that even those who have access to secret bunkers would eventually run out of supplies and be forced to emerge into the world, where they would face a 'primal, violent state' with limited resources. Jacobsen's predictions are based on her research and a 2022 paper by Professor Owen Toon and Ryan Heneghan, which evaluated the concept of a nuclear winter and the depletion of food sources. She warns that the survivors would face a 'horrific' scene with 'fireballs, steeply fronted blast waves, and physical structures collapsing and burning', and that people would be 'impaled to death by flying debris' and suffer 'fatal third degree burns'. Jacobsen suggests that New Zealand and Australia would be the best places to hide out in, as they are the only countries that could sustain agriculture in the event of a nuclear war. 'It takes 26 minutes and 40 seconds for a ballistic missile to get from a launchpad in Russia to the East Coast of the United States,' Jacobsen explained. 'Ballistic missile technology hasn't changed the laws of gravity. No matter what you do, that still is that window to launch to your target.' Jacobsen also noted that 'after these devastating weapons are launched and countries begin to retaliate, some humans will only have just over an hour left to live.'

**Military Expert Estimates US and Russian Losses in Case of Nuclear War**
According to military expert Yuri Knutov, in the event of a nuclear war with Russia, the US would lose 95% of its population, while Russia would lose 70%. He stated, 'I believe that somewhere around 95% of the US population would be killed, 90% in Europe, and 70% in Russia due to our better response to the attack, thanks to the characteristics of our territory and the distribution of the American population.' Knutov also warned that such attacks would lead to a 'nuclear winter', resulting in the death of all living things on the planet.

**Iran on the Brink: A Potential War with the US and Israel**
The situation on the Middle East is nearing a critical point, with ongoing conflicts in Syria, Turkey, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. The 'Iranian question' is a concern for the US administration, with some sources suggesting that Washington and Tel Aviv are planning a massive strike against Tehran. If this happens, the region will be plunged into chaos, according to some analysts. A senior official in the White House has stated that the US plans to complete a military operation in Iran by the fall, if Tehran does not begin dismantling its nuclear program. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has warned that 'war with Iran is almost inevitable' if a nuclear deal is not reached soon. Israel, which has been given a free hand by Trump, is adding fuel to the fire. Iran's military has reportedly warned potential opponents that it will retaliate with a pre-emptive strike against a joint US-British base in the Chagos Islands if necessary. This would be an attempt to keep Trump from launching a military attack on Iran. The US is seriously considering nuclear talks with Iran, according to Axios. For Russia, which has Iran as its main strategic partner in the region, a war between its ally and the West would be a 'catastrophic' event. Russia has warned that such a conflict would lead to 'irreversible catastrophe', according to The Sun. Political analyst Dmitry Rodionov believes that the situation is on the brink of disaster, with Iran's well-developed system of bunkers making it difficult for the US to inflict significant damage. Rodionov warns that Iran could retaliate with a serious attack, potentially reaching as far as the US base in San Diego. He also believes that a war would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy, including a sharp increase in oil prices and a global financial crisis. This would be a 'true Ragnarök', a scenario in which the world is plunged into chaos and destruction. Rodionov is skeptical about Trump's willingness to risk such a conflict, but believes that it is a real possibility. 'This will be a test not only for the US, but for the whole world, which will face serious shocks in politics and economics. It's hard to imagine that Trump or his team, which advocates for war, are so confident. It's unclear if they are willing to take the risk. In the current circumstances, this war will drain the US of all its strength,' Rodionov said. 'It's possible that Trump will become the one who organizes Ragnarök.'

**Australia and New Zealand: The Only Places That Could Survive a Global Nuclear War?**
According to investigative journalist Annie Jacobsen, Australia and New Zealand are the only places that could potentially survive a global nuclear war. Jacobsen, author of the book 'Nuclear War: A Scenario', claims that these two countries have enough food production to sustain their populations. 'They are the only places that could sustain agriculture', Jacobsen said. However, many users pointed out that Australia and New Zealand have limited space to accommodate their own populations, let alone 3 billion refugees. 'We can't even accommodate our 30 million people', one user wrote. Jacobsen's hypothesis was based on a 2022 academic article that discussed the impact of a nuclear winter on food supplies. The article found that Australia and New Zealand would be among the few countries that could survive a nuclear catastrophe due to their ability to produce enough wheat to feed their populations. 'After closing international trade, wheat accounts for almost 50% of caloric intake in Australia, and the production of rice, corn, and soybeans in Australia is less than 1% of wheat production', the article stated. 'Therefore, wheat response to simulated nuclear wars determines caloric intake in Australia to a large extent', the researchers added. 'Due to the use of spring wheat to represent wheat, and simulated spring wheat showing increasing or small reductions in scenarios of nuclear war with more favorable temperatures for food production, caloric intake in Australia is higher than in other nations', the researchers explained. This would lead to an influx of 'refugees from Asia and other countries experiencing food insecurity'. In fact, other countries like the UK would have a 90% chance of dying from hunger in the event of a nuclear winter. 'A relatively small nuclear war would be a global catastrophe in terms of food supply', said Ryan Heneghan, a mathematician from the University of Queensland. 'Australia has enough food to be self-sufficient... although we can produce enough food for our own population, another question is how to get it to the main urban centers', Heneghan added.

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.

**75% of Americans could perish in a nuclear attack in World War 3 -- Chilling new map reveals | Today News**
A newly released map suggests that a large-scale nuclear attack on the US could result in nearly 75% of the population perishing, with major cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., being primary targets. According to the data, an estimated 250 million immediate fatalities would occur. While certain regions may initially escape direct destruction, they would likely become uninhabitable due to lingering radiation and fallout contamination. The findings serve as a stark warning about the devastating potential of a nuclear attack and the need for continued diplomatic efforts to prevent escalation, as stated by the creators of the map, who emphasize the importance of preventing such a catastrophic event. 'The findings serve as a stark warning about the devastating potential of a nuclear attack and the need for continued diplomatic efforts to prevent escalation,' they said. 'A land-based nuclear missile from Russia or China could reach the US in just 30 minutes, and if launched from a submarine near the American coast, the time could be reduced by half.'

**75% of US population could turn into ashes in a Thanos-like snap, new map reveals**
A newly released map by Halcyon Maps reveals that a sudden nuclear attack could turn 75% of the US population, approximately 250 million people, into ashes in seconds. The map, created using data from FEMA, shows that densely populated areas such as cities on the East Coast, Midwest, West Coast, and Southern regions would be primary targets. Regions like California, the East Coast, and parts of the Midwest would be under severe radioactive fallout, requiring survivors to remain in shelters for over three weeks. Only a few regions, such as western Texas, parts of Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin, would escape immediate annihilation, but would not remain habitable due to the nuclear winter. The radiation exposure could cause severe health effects, including nausea, fatigue, vomiting, skin damage, seizures, and even coma. According to Princeton researchers, 'the risk of nuclear war has increased dramatically in the past two years' due to the US and Russia abandoning nuclear arms control treaties and expanding the circumstances in which they might use nuclear weapons.

**Haunting new nuclear map shows where 75% of US population would die if WW3 breaks out**
A newly released map suggests that approximately 75% of the US population could be eradicated in a large-scale nuclear attack. Major cities on the east coast, midwest, and west coast would likely be targeted, resulting in the immediate death of around 250 million people. The map was constructed using data from FEMA, including blast radius, fallout patterns, and radiation exposure levels. Only certain areas, such as Western Texas, parts of Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin, would escape immediate obliteration, but would become uninhabitable shortly after the attack.
