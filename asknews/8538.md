**Special Depreciation for Electric Company Cars to Boost E-Auto Sales**
Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil has proposed a special depreciation for electric company cars to boost the sale of E-Autos. This would be a good news for private buyers as well. According to the draft law, companies that purchase new, purely electric vehicles between July 1, 2025, and December 31, 2027, will be able to claim particularly generous depreciation rules. In the year of purchase, 75% of the acquisition costs can be claimed as a tax deduction. In the following year, a further 10% can be deducted. In the subsequent years, the rate decreases: 5% in the second and third year after purchase, 3% in the fourth year, and 2% in the fifth year. This special depreciation also applies to electrically powered commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses. Klingbeil himself describes the measure as an 'Investitions-Booster.' The draft law also includes other investment incentives, such as a special depreciation of up to 30% on other movable assets, such as machines or office equipment, in the period 2025-2027. From 2028, a gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate is planned, from the current 15% to 10% by 2032. The financial consequences for the state budget would be significant, with estimated tax revenue losses of around 48 billion euros by 2029, with the special depreciation for electric vehicles accounting for a significant portion of this amount.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Surge in May, Representing 19.4% of Total Market**
Electric and hybrid vehicles have seen a significant increase in sales in May, with a 138% growth compared to the same month last year. They now represent 19.4% of the total market, the highest historical figure in a single month. In contrast, gasoline and diesel vehicle sales have decreased. The 65% market share of hybrid and electric vehicles is 20 points higher than last year. The sales of electric vehicles have doubled compared to the same month last year, with 9,051 units sold, while hybrid plug-in vehicles have grown by 168%, with 12,810 deliveries. Félix García, director of communication and marketing of Anfac, stated, 'It's a positive news that sales are maintaining this pace. On the one hand, it's due to the renewal of the fleet, which is no longer driven by diesel and gasoline, but by conventional hybrids and electrified vehicles. And, on the other hand, by the increase in sales of electric vehicles that allow us to continue advancing in the objective of reducing emissions.' Raúl Morales, director of communication of Faconauto, added, 'The most notable thing about the month is that electric vehicles already represent 20% of the total. The offer is connecting with demand and brands and dealers are getting it right. Now it's the turn of the administrations: activating the Plan MOVES 2025 as soon as possible will be key to not slowing down this evolution.' Tania Puche, director of communication of GANVAM, highlighted that 'last month closed above 100,000 units registered; something we hadn't seen in a May month since 2019. In this way, the market continues to rise and accumulates nine consecutive months in positive. In this context, forecasts point to surpassing the million units at the end of 2025, slightly above the 2024 exercise.'

**The Future of the European Automobile Industry is Now**
The future of the European automobile industry is now, especially considering the ongoing trade war, Chinese brand invasions, stagnant sales, unbalanced accounts, and bleak forecasts. It would be wise for Brussels to take note of this reality, but instead, it seems to be pushing forward with its electric vehicle strategy at all costs, even as the world around it changes. The US president, Donald Trump, has reached agreements on tariffs with the UK and China, but the EU has yet to negotiate concretely with the US, leaving European automakers uncertain and at risk of losing market share in the world's largest market. Meanwhile, Brussels continues to ignore market reality and insists on pursuing electric vehicles. However, for Europe, the automotive sector accounts for 7-8% of the total GDP and around 13 million jobs. Is it possible that the 'electric vehicle religion' continues to prevail over reality? So far, the EU has only suspended fines for three years for manufacturers who fail to meet the new targets set by Brussels. This move certainly helps companies that would otherwise have to pay around €15 billion in sanctions this year. However, it is not a solution and confirms a disconnect from reality by European regulators, as the quota of electric vehicle sales would need to suddenly rise from 5% to over 20% to respect the targets, which is impossible. The only solution, requested by Stellantis' CEO John Elkann and Renault's CEO Luca de Meo, is to suspend the ban on thermal vehicle sales in 2035 and adopt a neutral technology approach to reduce emissions. This path is already being taken by the same companies, which have relaunched hybrid models to compensate for the slowdown in electric vehicles. However, Brussels must act quickly, as the future of the European automobile industry is now.

**Electric Cars Lose Half Their Value in Two Years**
A new report from 'Cox Automotive' reveals that electric cars have lost more than half of their value in just two years. According to the report, an electric car that is 24 months old in April retained only 47% of its original value, compared to 83% two years ago. The rapid decline is attributed to significant discounts offered by manufacturers to meet the UK government's mandatory sales quotas for electric cars, making new cars more attractive than used ones, and leading to a collapse in the secondary market. According to the 'ZEV' regulation, which has been in effect in the UK since January, companies must increase their annual sales of electric cars until 2035, with quotas starting at 22% in 2024 and reaching 80% by 2030. Failure to comply with these quotas exposes companies to fines of up to £12,000 per car. To achieve these goals, companies have lost £4 billion due to discounts. Mike Hawes, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, described this as unsustainable. The introduction of a car tax on electric car owners for the first time in April led to a decline in demand, prompting companies like Ford and Volkswagen to lower the prices of their models to avoid the luxury car tax that will be applied to electric cars over £40,000 from next year. The increase in new car supply, especially from China, and the development of battery technology have also affected the value of old cars. In contrast, used electric cars with an age of 3 to 5 years have performed better, with a decline in value of only 15%, as they target a different segment of drivers. Philip Nuthall, research director at Cox Automotive Europe, warned that large discounts on new cars reduce the attractiveness of used cars, requiring greater support for the used electric car market to mitigate the decline in value. In response to market pressure, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced changes to the ZEV mandate to support manufacturers, and a leaked message from Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood revealed a study to abolish the 'Tesla tax' to boost demand for electric cars.

**2 in 5 Cars Sold Worldwide Will Be EVs by 2030. US Drivers, You've Got Some Catching Up to Do**
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), more than 40% of all cars sold worldwide will be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030, nearly double the market share from last year. However, the growth rate of EV sales in the US is slower, with a 10% increase in the past year, partly due to the higher average price of EVs in the US, which is 30% more than conventional vehicles. Antuan Goodwin, EV writer at CNET, believes that the average price of EVs in the US will drop as more EVs are manufactured and cheaper models enter the market. Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at CarGurus, said that EV charging infrastructure has slowed EV sales in the US, citing a lack of fast and reliable charging options, especially in rural and suburban regions. Despite the challenges, EVs are cheaper to operate than conventional gas-powered vehicles, with EV drivers spending 60% less to power their cars, according to Consumer Reports.

**Electric Vehicles to Reach 40% of Global Car Sales by 2030, Says IEA**
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the share of electric vehicles in global car sales will reach 25% by 2025 and 40% by 2030. The demand for electric vehicles is driven by their increasing accessibility. Sales of electric vehicles are growing rapidly, with a 35% increase in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year. By the end of 2025, global sales are expected to exceed 20 million. China remains the leader in the market, with electric vehicles accounting for nearly half of all sales in 2024. The number of electric vehicles sold in China last year (over 11 million) is equivalent to the total number of electric vehicles sold worldwide in 2022. Developing markets in Asia and Latin America are also becoming new centers of growth, with a 60% increase in sales in 2024. In the US, sales of electric vehicles have grown by around 10% year-on-year, with their share exceeding 10%. In Europe, sales have stagnated due to the reduction of subsidies and other support measures, although the share of electric vehicles in the market remains around 20%. On a global level, prices are falling due to increasing competition and decreasing battery costs. In China, two-thirds of all electric vehicles sold last year were cheaper than their conventional counterparts, even without considering purchase incentives. However, the price gap remains on many other markets. For example, the average price of an electric vehicle in Germany is still 20% higher than that of a conventional vehicle. In the US, electric vehicles with batteries are still 30% more expensive.
