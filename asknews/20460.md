**Nvidia developing China-specific AI computer chip that can form...**
Nvidia is reportedly developing a new China-specific computer chip, the B30, which can be connected into high-powered 'clusters' needed to power artificial intelligence models. The chip is already drawing interest from China-based tech giants like ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent. According to The Information, Nvidia plans to produce over 1 million B30 chips this year, which are compliant with the White House's stricter export controls. This move marks Nvidia's latest bid to preserve access to the lucrative China market, despite US officials' concerns that China will surpass the US in the development of advanced AI. As Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, 'The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market.'

**Two Wall Street Firms Remain Cautious on Nvidia Stock: Here's Why**
Not everyone on Wall Street is optimistic about Nvidia's stock. Analysts at HSBC and DA Davidson still only give the AI leader a 'hold' recommendation. DA Davidson's senior analyst, Gil Luria, sees the American export rules for chips as the biggest obstacle for Nvidia's stock. 'We believe the market underestimates the Chinese contribution to Nvidia's revenue,' he told clients in a research report, adding that the stricter export rules under the Trump administration will continue to harm NVDA until a 'solution in one direction or the other' is found. According to DA Davidson, the mentioned restrictions mean that 'the entire Chinese opportunity (which Jensen Huang estimates to be worth $50 billion) is being transferred to domestic manufacturers such as Huawei.' Furthermore, as Huawei continues to develop in the field of artificial intelligence, Nvidia may eventually have to compete for AI customers, even outside of China. HSBC analyst Frank Lee is similarly pessimistic about Nvidia's stock, especially because China is 'directly behind' the US in the artificial intelligence front, according to Huang's recent comments. Lee expects NVDA to make a comeback in AI chips in the second-largest economy in the world, despite the restrictions in the second half of 2020, but notes that problems with the supply chain could continue to be a headwind for the semiconductor stock.

**Nvidia to Launch Low-Cost AI Chips in China, Possibly as Early as June**
According to sources, Nvidia is planning to launch a new line of AI chips in China at a lower price point than the T20, which has been restricted from export to the country. The new chips are expected to be produced in large quantities, possibly as early as June. The sources stated that the new chips will be part of Nvidia's latest generation of AI processors with the Blackwell architecture, and will be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, significantly lower than the T20's price range of $10,000 to $12,000. The lower price reflects the weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements of the new chips. The sources added that the new chip will rely on Nvidia's RTX 6000D GPU, a server-grade GPU, and will use traditional GDDR7 memory instead of faster, more advanced HBM memory. Nvidia will not use TSMC's advanced manufacturing technology in Taiwan, which allows for multiple layers of chips on a single wafer. The details mentioned above were not previously reported. The sources, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, declined to comment further. An Nvidia spokesperson said that the company is still evaluating its limited options... until we settle on a new product design and receive US government approval, we are effectively excluded from the Chinese data center market, which is worth $50 billion. TSMC, a Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer, declined to comment on the Reuters report.

**China's AI Chip Race: A Challenge Against Time**
Chinese tech companies are racing against time to develop artificial intelligence (AI) using local chips, as the US restricts the export of 'Intel' chips. Companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu are testing local alternatives to replace 'Intel' chips, to meet the growing domestic demand for AI applications. The US restrictions on the export of 'Intel' chips have forced Chinese tech companies to take drastic measures, as the remaining stock of 'Intel' chips will only last until early next year. The companies are looking for alternative solutions, as the new chips from 'Intel' may not be available until July next year. Huawei's 'Ascend' chips are seen as a potential alternative, and the company is working to increase its production capacity. However, the transition to local chips is not without challenges, as it requires significant investment and time. Some companies are considering a hybrid approach, using both 'Intel' and local chips. Huawei is working to launch its own chip factory, but the current supply does not meet the current demand. Other Chinese chip manufacturers, such as 'Cambrix' and 'Higon', are being tested by tech companies, while Baidu and Alibaba are developing their own chips to meet the growing demand.

**Chinese Tech Companies Find Ways to Overcome US Chip Export Ban**
Chinese technology companies are finding ways to overcome the US chip export ban, which has hindered their access to advanced chips. According to reports, Tencent, Baidu, and other tech companies have developed various solutions, including stockpiling large quantities of US-made chips before the ban, developing more efficient AI models, and using locally produced chips from domestic semiconductor companies. Tencent, the company behind WeChat, stated that they had a 'very strong chip stockpile' from previous purchases before the sanctions were imposed. China is also making significant strides in developing its own chip production, with Huawei leading the way in developing local AI chips. This could be a positive development for the world, as it may lead to Chinese GPUs that can compete with Nvidia and AMD in the future, freeing computer users and gamers from the tyranny of having to spend thousands of dollars on a single graphics card. However, there are also concerns that some Chinese companies may be purchasing used or refurbished Nvidia chips from third-party sellers, although this has not been proven. The US chip export ban to China began during the Trump administration (2016-2020), when Huawei was placed under sanctions due to its suspected ties with the Chinese government. Huawei executives were even arrested in Canada during a meeting and spent years in detention. The ban has continued under the Biden administration and has been tightened since Trump's return to the White House, with even lower-performance chips like Nvidia's H20 being banned for sale to Chinese customers.

**China's Rapid Technological Advancements: A Threat to US Supremacy**
The US is struggling to keep up with China's rapid technological advancements, particularly in AI, which may be the next area to be surpassed. This has sparked intense debate between the government and industry. The White House has largely supported banning the export of high-tech chips and components to prevent China's progress, but Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and others argue that such policies will only accelerate China's development of its own tech ecosystem. China's electric cars are priced lower and outperform many American-made models, with self-driving cars already appearing on the streets of Wuhan and Beijing. China dominates the global market in consumer drones, solar panels, and batteries. The US currently maintains a narrow lead in advanced chips and AI, but the gap is rapidly closing. China is shifting towards developing and manufacturing its own chips, including those from Huawei, Hwawei, Longxin Storage, and SMIC. Since the US banned ZTE and Huawei in 2018, China's tech companies and government have invested heavily, and the US has tried to slow China's progress by banning the export of chip-making equipment and materials. Patrick Moorhead, a semiconductor industry analyst who spent 11 years as a high-ranking executive at AMD, believes that China's lagging behind or being forever behind is a misconception. He says, 'I've been in the tech industry for 30 years, and I've heard people say China can't do this. Now I think the only question is how fast they can do it.' Experts point out that China's unique advantages, such as its well-trained workforce and massive domestic market, are unprecedented in US trade history. Huang has repeatedly stated that 'half of the world's AI engineers are in China.' China's domestic market allows companies to test and refine their products before going global. Huang has recently strongly criticized the US's current export control ban, saying that it will only strengthen China's competitiveness and weaken the US's position. He predicts that by 2026, China's spending on AI chips and servers will reach $50 billion, and the new AI chip export ban will cost Nvidia a significant market share.

**SoftBank and Intel Partner to Develop New AI Memory Chip**
SoftBank, a Japanese company, has partnered with Intel to develop a new type of memory chip for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The new chip, called 'Caimemory,' aims to reduce power consumption by half compared to the current high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI devices. Tokyo University and other research institutions, including the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (Riken), are involved in the project. SoftBank has established a new company, Caimemory, to develop the new chip, which will utilize Intel's technology and patents held by Tokyo University and other institutions. The company plans to produce a prototype within two years and assess its mass production feasibility. Caimemory aims to reduce power consumption by changing the structure of the chip, such as the wiring between memory cells. SoftBank has invested 30 billion yen (approximately 290 billion KRW) in Caimemory and plans to request government funding. The new chip is expected to be used in data centers for AI learning and will have a competitive price advantage over HBM. HBM has limitations in terms of cost and power consumption, and its supply has been unstable due to increasing demand. According to BCG, a US consulting firm, AI-related server shipments are expected to increase sixfold from 2023 to 2027, and DRAM shipments will increase by 21% annually. As a result, the demand for HBM is expected to continue to rise. Japan's SoftBank and other companies are actively developing new memory chips due to the country's challenging semiconductor environment. Japan was once a dominant player in the DRAM market, but it has since lost market share to South Korea and Taiwan. As a result, Japan has no domestic DRAM manufacturers, and Toshiba's spin-off, Kioxia, only produces NAND flash memory. To address this issue, the Japanese government plans to invest over 10 trillion yen in the semiconductor and AI industries by 2030.

**ChatGPT, China, and the Global Battle for AI Dominance**
China's AI development has been rapidly advancing, with the country surpassing the United States in the sheer volume of AI research publications. Chinese researchers published over 155,000 AI papers in 2022, far more than the U.S. (81,000) or all EU countries combined (101,000). China now accounts for nearly 40% of global AI research publications. However, China's AI sector remains critically dependent on foreign technology in key domains, such as advanced semiconductor chips and equipment required to train and run cutting-edge AI models. The U.S. has increasingly turned to technological sanctions to slow China's progress by cutting off its access to the highest-end AI hardware. The U.S. has progressively tightened export controls to restrict China's access to semiconductors, AI software, and the equipment used to manufacture them. China's leaders view AI as vital to the nation's future and are investing heavily to become a global leader in the field. Grand national strategies back China's ambitions in AI, with the goal of becoming the world leader in AI by 2030. However, the social impacts of AI depend heavily on its application, and authoritarian implementations of AI, such as invasive mass surveillance, raise significant international concerns. The U.S. and other leading tech powers must work closely to develop standard rules and norms that restrict the hostile or dangerous use of advanced technologies, pushing for a governance regime that enshrines principles of human oversight, transparency, and accountability in the cyberspace.

**Chinese Tech Giants Place $16B in Nvidia AI Chip Orders Ahead of U.S. Curbs**
Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance, have placed over $16 billion in orders for Nvidia's H20 AI server chips in the first quarter of 2025, according to The Information. The surge in demand is due to concerns over a potential U.S. ban on exports of the chip to China. Nvidia's ability to fulfill these orders before new export restrictions take effect will be crucial for its financial benefits, as the company generated $17.11 billion in sales from China in its last fiscal year. However, Nvidia lacks sufficient production capacity at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to meet demand in the short term, and manufacturing the chips could take up to six months, pushing deliveries into the fourth quarter. If U.S. restrictions tighten before deliveries are made, Nvidia may be forced to offer discounts or find alternative buyers for the chips, which could lead to customer refund requests or excess inventory. Huawei's growing role in AI chip development also poses competitive pressure, as its domestic presence continues to expand despite earlier U.S. sanctions. As Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, said, 'We are working closely with our customers to ensure a smooth delivery of our H20 chips.'
