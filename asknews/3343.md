**A one-million-qubit machine could crack 2048-bit RSA in seven days, study finds**
A recent study from Google Quantum AI suggests that a one-million-qubit machine could crack 2048-bit RSA encryption in seven days, reducing earlier estimates by twentyfold. The study demonstrates that using approximation rather than exact modular exponentiation and denser error-correction schemes can cut physical-qubit requirements by a factor of twenty. However, current hardware still lags behind the study's hypothetical machine, with leading processors like IBM's 1,121-qubit Condor and Google's 53-qubit Sycamore remaining orders of magnitude smaller. The study offers a concrete threat model for both hardware designers and policy makers, highlighting the need for migration to post-quantum cryptography algorithms, which NIST urges to be implemented by 2030 and deprecated by 2035.
