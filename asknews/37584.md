**Rent Increases in June 2025: What You Need to Know**
In June 2025, rent contracts signed in June 2023 will experience their second and final annual increase of 80.65%, 15 percentage points less than the 95.24% increase in May, according to the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA). Additionally, contracts signed between October 17 and December 29, 2023, will be adjusted semi-annually based on the Casa Propia coefficient, which is expected to be around 48.44% in June. For example, a two-bedroom apartment in Buenos Aires rented for $334,888 in December 2023 would increase to $1,298,908 by June 2025. Meanwhile, contracts signed after December 29, 2023, with quarterly or bi-quarterly adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index (IPC), will see an increase of 9.58% in June 2025, calculated with the last IPC index published by INDEC in April 2025. This means that if the initial rent was $500,000, the new rent in June would be approximately $547,889, and if the initial rent was $800,000, the new rent would be $876,622.

**High-Priced Rentals on the Rise in Seoul Metropolitan Area**
The Seoul metropolitan area is experiencing a rapid increase in high-priced rentals, with the proportion of rent transactions exceeding 60% of the total housing transactions. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's 'April Housing Statistics', the proportion of rent transactions in the country reached 60.4% this year. In particular, the Seoul metropolitan area showed a high proportion of rent transactions, with 63.6% in Seoul and 59.3% in the metropolitan area. The proportion of apartment rent transactions also increased from 43.4% last year to 44.5% this year. High-priced rent transactions of over 500 million KRW are also on the rise, with 366 transactions in Seoul from January to May this year. For example, a 84㎡ apartment in the '래미안 원베일리' complex in Seocho-gu, Seoul, was rented for 600 million KRW per month with a deposit of 8 billion KRW in May. Additionally, a 84㎡ apartment in the '서울숲트리마제' complex in Jongno-gu, Seoul, was rented for 1.1 billion KRW per month with a deposit of 1 billion KRW in May. Industry insiders predict that if interest rates are lowered rapidly after the election, the trend of renting out apartments for high prices will continue to worsen. As a result, people may increasingly turn to renting out apartments as a form of investment, rather than saving in bank deposits.

**Home prices take 1st drop in 26 months, by this math**
The Case-Shiller national price index, a key indicator of US housing prices, has seen its first monthly decline in 26 months, dropping 0.3% between February and March. This is a significant development, as it marks the end of a winning streak for prices that made housing unaffordable across the nation. According to Attom data, US home sales in the first three months of 2025 were the lowest in 10 years. The decline is attributed to real estate anxieties, non-traditional economic policies, high mortgage rates, and a wobbly job market. The index remains up 3.4% in a year and 59% since pre-pandemic March 2019. The 20-city composite index also showed a one-month dip, but just 0.1%. California cities, such as San Francisco and San Diego, saw significant declines, while Los Angeles and Orange counties saw a modest increase. The longer view shows significant gains in California, with San Francisco up 1.6% for the year and 36% since 2019, and San Diego rose 1.6% in 12 months and 72% in six years.

**Mexico's Rental Market Faces Desacceleration Due to High Prices and Limited Offer**
The rental market in Mexico is expected to slow down in 2025 due to high prices, limited availability of new properties, and inflation. According to Juan David Vargas, general manager of Propiedades.com, the number of properties available for rent has decreased, despite increased demand. Vargas stated, 'The first quarter has shown a progressive decrease in inventory, which is associated with the pressure on the low inventory of properties for sale and the high costs, where the rental inventory is moving as a great opportunity.' However, he noted that the prices at which properties are being sold are also discouraging the relationship between supply and demand. 'While in 2024 we saw an increase of around 10 or 15 percent in the first quarter compared to 2023, in 2025 that growth is between 5 and 10 percent, even what we estimate is that by the end of the year, the growth in the available rental inventory will be the same as the previous year, and there we could be seeing how the impact of high prices consolidates on the availability of supply,' he said. Experts agree that the average rental prices in the country have increased by 5-6 percent in the first months of the year, but in CDMX, Guadalajara, and Monterrey, as well as tourist areas, they have grown up to double digits.

**Home Prices Rebound After Brief Pullback -- but There's Good News for Homebuyers**
The national median listing price of homes increased by 0.2% last week compared to the same time a year ago, according to the Realtor.com Weekly Housing Trends Report. Economist Jiayi Xu says, 'This marks a faster pace of growth than in the prior two weeks and suggests that the underlying value of homes continues to increase.' However, affordability remains a challenge due to elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices. Despite this, the spring season is drawing to a close with signs of a more favorable market for homebuyers, offering more listings, less intense competition, and relatively steady prices. New listings saw an increase of 8.2% last week compared to the same period in May 2024, suggesting a robust late spring selling market. The overall number of for-sale homes nationwide surged 29.7% year over year, with more than 1 million homes listed for sale last week, the highest number since December 2019.

**Case-Shiller: San Diego home prices up 1% in March amid three-month trend**
San Diego home prices rose 1.05% in March, marking the third consecutive positive month after a six-month decline, according to the Case-Shiller Index. Nationwide prices increased 0.76% in March, with Seattle and Los Angeles showing the strongest growth on the West Coast at 1.78% and 1.48%, respectively. Nicholas Godec of S&P Dow Jones Indices noted that high mortgage rates are deterring buyers, but limited inventory is preventing prices from declining. He stated, 'This spring's price resurgence illustrated that seasonal demand and tight supply could reignite price growth, but it also underscored the housing market's continued sensitivity to mortgage rates and affordability constraints.' Godec added, 'Even as year-over-year gains slowed, U.S. home prices remained at record highs, ensuring long-term homeowners retained substantial equity.' Zillow expects a 'modest recovery in sales over the coming year,' especially if prices fall slightly.

**Are price cuts coming? San Diego home price gains slow in national rankings**
San Diego home prices have slowed down significantly, with a 1.67% annual increase in March, according to the S&P Case-Shiller Indices report. This is the smallest increase since summer 2023, and the San Diego metropolitan area ranked 15th in the 20-city index. Economist Orphe Divounguy from Zillow said that the share of nationwide listings with a price cut in March hit a six-year high, resulting in some sellers slashing prices. He expects a 'price correction' and a modest recovery in sales over the coming year. San Diego County's median home price for single-family homes in March was $1 million, but homes in San Diego are still much more expensive than other areas that topped the index. Redfin reported that 31% of listed homes in San Diego County had a price drop in March, compared to 24% in Cleveland and 14% in Chicago.

**Zillow forecasts San Diego home values to drop for the first time in years**
Zillow has forecasted a 1.1% decrease in San Diego County home values by March 2026, making it the first time in years that home values are expected to drop. This is in contrast to other major forecasters, who have predicted rising home prices. Zillow's forecast is based on the average middle third of home values, eliminating statistical anomalies at the high and low end. The average home value in San Diego County is currently $953,831, up 2.3% in a year. Skylar Olsen, Zillow chief economist, noted that home price growth paused and inventory swelled in March, reducing competition and avoiding bidding wars. Olsen also stated that affordability is still a significant issue, with a mortgage payment on a typical home requiring about 35.3% of median household income nationwide. This is a slight improvement over last year, but is still unaffordable.

**San Diego Hotels to Increase Taxes Starting May 1st**
The Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) in San Diego, California, will increase starting May 1st to generate additional income for road repairs, addressing homelessness, and improving the San Diego Convention Center. The tax was approved by voters in 2020 under Measure C and is expected to generate approximately $82 million in extra revenue for the 2026 fiscal year. Over the first 10 years, the TOT is expected to generate around $1.04 billion in extra revenue, according to the City of San Diego authorities. The tax increase was initially delayed until May 1, 2025, due to legal challenges, but the city won the court case and the increase will proceed. The current TOT rate is 10.5% for hotel guests, RV visitors, and short-term rental properties. Measure C establishes three tax zones with corresponding rates of 11.75%, 12.75%, and 13.75%, depending on the proximity to the San Diego Convention Center. The city plans to allocate 59% of the TOT revenue for the first five years to improve the convention center and support its operations, and 41% for municipal initiatives to address homelessness, including housing programs and support services. From the sixth to the tenth year, the allocation will be 59% for the convention center, 31% for homelessness initiatives, and 10% for road repairs and infrastructure improvements.

**RentSpree CEO on The Soaring Demand for Single-Family Rentals**
The demand for single-family rentals is soaring, driven by factors such as limited supply, high mortgage rates, and demographic shifts. According to a Zillow report, rents for single-family homes are 41 percent above pre-pandemic levels, while multifamily rental units have seen a 26 percent increase over the same period. In cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, median monthly rents for single-family homes have risen to $3,600 and $4,200 respectively, with vacancy rates falling below 4 percent in cities like San Diego and Sacramento. The economic implications of these rising costs are vast, affecting household savings, consumer spending, and access to affordable living options. As demand for single-family rentals continues to rise, addressing housing supply challenges will be key to ensuring renters have access to affordable and sustainable living options. 'The disparity between single-family and multifamily rental prices underscores the need for supply growth and affordability,' said a recent report. 'With more income being funneled into rent, fewer dollars are available for other essential expenses like health care, education and retirement savings.'

**Homes Sell for More When Listed in Late May, Zillow Group Inc (Z**
Zillow's latest research reveals that homes listed in the second half of May in 2024 sold for an average of 1.6% more, resulting in a $5,600 increase on a typical U.S. home. The optimal listing time varies across cities, with San Diego and Austin seeing the best results in March and Phoenix peaking in November. To maximize sale prices, sellers can list their homes on the MLS, highlight in-demand features, and invest in high-quality online media packages. According to Zillow, 'the importance of timing, exposure, and highlighting desirable home features to maximize sale prices' is crucial in the real estate market. 'The 1.6% increase in sale price during the optimal listing period can significantly impact the financial outcome for sellers,' Zillow notes. However, market conditions such as inventory levels and mortgage rate fluctuations must be closely monitored to adapt strategies accordingly.

**Case-Shiller: Home Prices in San Diego Rise Again After 5 Months of Decline**
San Diego home prices rose 0.06% in December, marking the end of a 5-month decline. According to Brian Luke of S&P Dow Jones Indices, this increase came after a nationwide slowdown in home price appreciation, with the West experiencing the largest drops. San Diego home prices ended the year 5.5% higher, compared to the national average of 3.9%. Luke noted that the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index shows a national upward trend in home prices. However, Zillow's Chief Economist Kara Ng cautioned that home price increases are likely to be moderate in 2026, with buyers seeing 'cooler home price appreciation and a less competitive environment this spring,' as Ng said.
