**Translator’s Diary: How To Translate Time?**
Translator Anjana Basu shares her experience of working with the late filmmaker Rituparno Ghosh. Basu translated Ghosh's scripts, including 'Hirer Angti', 'Chokher Bali', and 'Dahan', from Bengali to English. She also worked on subtitles for his films, which were later adapted using AI and the Hoichoi app. Basu's translations of Ghosh's work, totaling 1.5 kilos, were published by Jadavpur University Press on his birthday in August last year. Basu notes that Ghosh's work was often rushed, and she had to translate scripts from scrawls, but she is proud to have preserved his legacy. 'Who writes subtitles?' someone asked, to which Basu replied, 'I did, minus articles, with Rituparno scolding me for my overly memsahib English.' Basu's work with Ghosh has been a valuable experience, and she is grateful to have had the opportunity to translate his scripts and subtitles.

**VoicyFES Best Talk Becomes Book: Embracing 'Insufficiency' in Education**
A new book, 'Education in the Importance of 'Insufficiency'', will be published on June 4, 2025, featuring a dialogue between authors Eto Takehiro and Watanabe Michiharu, who were ranked first in the Voicy FES'24 best talks. The book highlights the value of 'insufficiency' in education, particularly in today's schools where teachers are struggling with increasing absenteeism and a shortage of staff. The authors, who have been advocating for the importance of 'insufficiency' throughout their careers, share their personal experiences and stories of how they overcame their own 'insufficiencies' to achieve success. They argue that 'insufficiency' is not a weakness, but rather a strength that allows people to help and learn from each other. As Watanabe Michiharu said, 'Insufficiency is the whitespace that connects people. As a teacher, I have a imperfect part, and that's what allows me to help others. I wanted to express this miracle in words again.' Eto Takehiro added, 'I myself have lived with a 'handless' insufficiency. But it brought me encounters and kindness. This dialogue was a gift of life for me.'

**The Voynich Manuscript: A 621-Year-Old Enigma**
The Voynich Manuscript, named after the Polish book dealer Wilfrid Voynich who purchased it in 1912, has remained undecipherable for over 621 years. The medieval manuscript is a mystery, with its unique alphabet and lack of illustrations providing no clear clues to its meaning. Researchers have proposed various theories, including that it may be a coded language, a natural language that has since become extinct, or even a steganographic message. Some have suggested that the manuscript may be a forgery, with its statistical properties and lack of grammatical structure suggesting that it was created in a later era. Despite numerous attempts to decipher the text, the Voynich Manuscript remains one of the most enigmatic and intriguing mysteries in the world of cryptography. As noted by Atanasius Kircher, a 17th-century scholar who attempted to decipher the manuscript, 'it is a book that has been written in a language that is not known to us, and the alphabet is not like any other that we have seen.'

**Mike Johnson and Russ Vought Continue to Lie About Medicaid Cuts**
House Speaker Mike Johnson and Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought claim that the proposed House budget will not cut Medicaid coverage, with Johnson stating 'People will not lose their Medicaid unless they choose to do so' and Vought saying 'no one will lose coverage as a result' of the bill. However, experts and organizations have exposed this as a lie, citing the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that the bill would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $723 billion and lead to 7.6 million people losing Medicaid coverage by 2034. Additionally, research shows that work requirements, which are included in the bill, do not increase employment but rather lead to coverage loss, medical debt, and delayed medical care. Losing coverage can have serious consequences, including increased mortality among low-income adults.

**Rare 15th-Century Manuscript Reveals Early Arithmetic Education in Europe**
A rare manuscript, attributed to Johannes de Strasbourg, is one of the oldest and most important evidence of the teaching of practical arithmetic in late medieval and early Renaissance Europe, specifically in northern Italy. The manuscript, which dates back to the 15th century, is a detailed explanation of the basic principles of arithmetic using the Indian-Arabic numerals, reflecting a significant shift in teaching methods at the time. The manuscript covers topics such as addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, proportions and ratios, interest calculations, practical business problems, and the use of tables for multiplying large numbers, as well as geometric illustrations. A comparison with earlier texts, such as Johannes de Sacrobosco's work from around 1230, shows that the Strasbourg manuscript is more complex and detailed, with examples, annotations, and marginal notes, making it a valuable source for studying the development of mathematical education in pre-printing Europe. The manuscript, described by the Peter's Library as being in good condition, with some minor stains and cut corners, is written in a clear and elegant script with brown ink, with occasional use of red ink for emphasis. The marginal notes and added symbols in the 17th century indicate that the manuscript was later used by students or teachers, who added explanations and Italian characters, reflecting its continued use as a teaching resource. It is believed to have belonged to a school or a teacher in northern Italy, making it a valuable document for understanding the transmission of knowledge in the pre-printing era. As noted by researcher 'Van Egmond' in his book 'Practical Mathematics in Italian Renaissance', this manuscript is a rare and comprehensive example of mathematical textbooks from the 15th century.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Handle with Care: The Oldest Translations of the Bible in English**
The translation of the Bible into English began as early as the eighth century with the Venerable Bede's translation of the Gospel of John. By the ninth and tenth centuries, vernacular versions of the Gospels and the first seven books of the Old Testament were produced, making the Bible more accessible to readers outside of monasteries. However, Benedictine monks like Abbot Ælfric of Eynsham were concerned that lay readers might be confused by the Bible's complex elements, especially the Old Testament. This talk will explore the earliest translations of the Bible in English and their role in shaping English national identity during this transformative period. As Abbot Ælfric noted, 'the Bible was becoming increasingly available for the first time to readers outside of the walls of the monastery', but this also raised concerns about the potential for confusion and sin among lay readers.

**Voynich Manuscript Conforms to Zipf's Law, Adding to its Mystery**
The Voynich Manuscript, a mysterious book filled with unusual images and text in an unidentified language, has remained unsolved for centuries. Radiocarbon dating shows that the materials used to create the manuscript date back to 1404-1438. However, its well-known owner, a companion of Emperor Rudolf II, lived from 1552 to 1612, leaving a gap in the manuscript's history. Some illustrations suggest its origin is from southern Germany or northern Italy. Despite the availability of the text and numerous attempts to decipher it, its content remains a mystery. Interestingly, the analysis of word frequency in the manuscript follows the Zipf's law, which applies to all known languages. Research shows that the distribution of frequency ranks in the Voynich text differs from random texts, making it unlikely that the manuscript is a forgery. This confirms the manuscript's uniqueness and its connection to the human language, despite its remaining unintelligible.

**The Voynich Manuscript: Unlocking the Secrets of the World's Most Mysterious Book**
The Voynich Manuscript is considered the most mysterious book in the world and, to this day, its content remains indecipherable. The manuscript's pages, filled with texts written in an unknown language or code and accompanied by intriguing illustrations, have fascinated scholars and curious people for centuries. Despite numerous attempts to decipher its meaning, no one has been able to do so with certainty. The manuscript was acquired by Wilfrid Voynich in 1912, but its origins date back much further. It is believed to have been written between 1400 and 1500, based on the characteristics of the parchment and ink, as well as scientific analyses of its structure. The first historical mention is from 1665, when the physician Johannes Marcus Marci mentioned receiving it from the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher, famous for his studies on mysteries and codes. The manuscript's code is complex and appears to follow no logical pattern that can be applied to other languages or writing systems known today. While cryptography has been one of the most popular approaches to deciphering the book, other theories suggest that the manuscript may be a form of invented writing, a kind of 'artificial language' that never had a real meaning. This would lead to the hypothesis that the book could be a work of entertainment or a project of a creative and eccentric mind from the medieval period, intended to create a sense of mystery without a practical or scientific purpose.
