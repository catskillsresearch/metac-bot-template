**EU Prepares Countermeasures Against US Amid Trade Negotiations**
The European Union is preparing 'countermeasures' against the United States, according to Olof Gill, the European Commission's spokesperson. The measures would be triggered automatically on July 14 or earlier if negotiations between Brussels and Washington fail. The EU is pushing for a trade agreement to avoid a 50% tariff on imported goods, after US President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on steel imports. The EU Commission executive says they are under pressure to reach an agreement, as the 90-day pause to negotiate tariffs ends on July 14. If the negotiations fail, the EU will implement new trade measures, including a 50% tariff on imported goods. As Olof Gill said, 'If the negotiations fail, we will launch new measures, including tariffs.' The EU is concerned that the tariff on steel imports will lead to significant price increases for high-value purchases, such as cars, washing machines, and houses.

**EU's Scientific Climate Board Criticizes Sweden's Position: 'Very Risky'**
The European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) has released a report criticizing Sweden's position on climate change, calling it 'very risky'. The report emphasizes that climate change is a major threat to EU citizens and that climate work is not in opposition to other EU priorities, but rather complementary. Ottmar Edenhofer, chairman of ESABCC, stated, 'Climate change is not an isolated crisis, it strengthens other crises. Handling it is completely compatible with meeting EU's other pressing challenges, especially the security issue and the competition issue.' The report emphasizes that the EU must reduce emissions within the union by 90-95% by 2040 to avoid missing the overall goal of climate neutrality by 2050. Ottmar Edenhofer noted that it is actually underestimating the EU's share of the Paris Agreement. He stated, 'There is no doubt that we must reduce emissions very much, very quickly.' The EU countries seem to have agreed on a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, but sources within the negotiations warn that the goal contains several loopholes, particularly the possibility of paying poor countries to reduce emissions on behalf of EU countries, under article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Sweden's government has long advocated for this approach in negotiations with other countries. However, the ESABCC report criticizes this strategy, stating that it would be 'very risky' and damage the EU's credibility in climate work. 'EU should explore cooperation under article 6 to achieve our climate goals,' said climate minister Romina Pourmokhtari (L) in December last year. However, the report emphasizes that this should not come at the expense of reducing emissions within the EU. 'It would be very risky and would harm the EU's credibility in climate work,' said Ottmar Edenhofer on Monday. Even powerful EU countries like Germany and France have opened up to paying poor countries to compensate for EU emissions. However, Germany's position is that no more than 3% of the union's emissions can be compensated through emissions reductions in other countries. Sweden has not set any such limit in the negotiations.

**EU Countries Approve Plans for CO2 Border Taxes**
The 27 EU member states have agreed to the European Commission's plans to exempt most companies in Europe from the planned CO2 border taxes starting from 2026, according to the European Union's Council. The relevant ministers approved the proposed changes at a meeting in Brussels. The EU states still need to negotiate the final details with the European Parliament. The European Parliament had previously signaled its support for exempting more than 90% of companies from the taxes. The new EU system, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), will only cover companies that import more than 50 tons of goods per year. However, this would still account for 99% of the emissions generated by imported products, as previously stated in a draft. The CO2 border taxes aim to protect European companies from unfair competition from countries that do not charge climate protection fees. The EU requires companies in the EU to balance the CO2 emissions in imported goods through the tax. This should also prevent the relocation of production to non-European countries. The taxes will be paid through emissions certificates, which importers must purchase in Europe. It is expected that importers will demand price discounts from their suppliers in China, South America, or the US, or switch to European products, which are already burdened with the purchase of CO2 pollution rights. Initially, CO2-intensive goods such as cement or steel will be affected, but the scope is expected to be expanded to all industrial goods by 2030.

**EU Climate Advisors Warn of Weak Climate Goal for 2040**
The European Union's (EU) climate advisors are warning that a weak climate goal for 2040 will make it difficult for the EU to achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2050. The EU's climate goal for 2040 is currently being negotiated, and some powerful countries are pushing to lower the ambition level. Ottmar Edenhofer, chairman of the EU's climate council, says that a low goal will 'take the wind out of the transition' and make it difficult to reach the 2050 goal. The EU's climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, argues that flexibility is needed, including the possibility of buying climate credits from poor countries. However, this is seen as a watering down of the EU's climate goals. Jette Bredahl Jacobsen, a Danish economist and member of the EU's climate council, warns that buying climate credits will make the transition more expensive and inefficient. She also points out that the EU has a historical responsibility for climate pollution and should not lower its ambitions. The use of climate credits has also been criticized for being unreliable and even fraudulent. The EU has previously allowed companies to buy climate credits from other countries, but this has caused problems. The UN is currently working on a new set of rules to address these issues. Minister Lars Aagaard (M) wants the EU to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 90% in 2040, but will not comment on whether foreign credits should be included.

**European Climate Change Advisory Council Recommends 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Change Advisory Council recommends that the European Union set a new, ambitious intermediate goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 90-95% by 2040. This is the only value that keeps the EU on a 'solid', 'viable', and 'credible' path to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, as required by the Climate Law. 'We must reduce emissions significantly and quickly. It's the only way to stop and reduce global warming,' said Ottmar Edenhofer, president of the European Climate Change Advisory Council. The council's report, released on Monday, reiterates that the legally binding goal of zero emissions by 2050 can only be realistically achieved with a 90-95% reduction in internal CO2 emissions relative to 1990 levels. This conclusion was reached after analyzing 1,000 possible scenarios of climate impacts and risks caused by increasing greenhouse gas levels. Only five scenarios survived the exhaustive evaluation of compliance with European climate goals and the Paris Agreement targets by 2040, precisely those that predicted a cut above 90% in emissions. According to Edenhofer, the models 'highlight the urgent need for a deep and sustained reduction in emissions and a significant increase in CO2 removal.' The council recommends that the European Commission send a signal to member states to intensify their efforts and establish the 'national emissions reduction target of 90-95% by 2040.' 'The uneven progress between sectors and member states requires a renewed political commitment. What's at stake is the credibility of climate neutrality,' emphasized Edenhofer, when asked about the pressure from European Parliament lawmakers to lower the cut to 85% to avoid compromising the continent's reindustrialization strategy. The scientists consider that defining a more ambitious goal provides greater security and predictability for economic agents, to reduce fossil fuel use and accelerate investment in clean technologies, modernization, and expansion of infrastructure, and electrification. 'The good news is that the EU has made progress in reducing emissions over the past five years, driven by the energy sector transition and the rapid deployment of renewable energies, such as wind and solar. This means that the goal of reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 is within reach, and that the EU is largely aligned with the scenarios that support the recommended interval for 2040,' points out Edenhofer. The Advisory Council also opposes the suggestion from MEPs to include international carbon credits in the calculation of the EU's effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 'We discourage the use of international carbon credits to meet the 2040 target, as they risk diverting resources from national investments and may compromise environmental integrity,' says the report published on Monday. In addition to the new 2040 intermediate goal, the panel of experts recommends establishing three separate objectives for the reduction of raw emissions and for temporary and permanent CO2 removals. Two additional recommendations aim at the bet on cooperation and partnerships for promoting climate action beyond EU borders - not to replace but to complement national efforts -; and the reinforcement of the EU's adaptation policy to climate change, namely through the approval of new legal instruments and measurable objectives. 'The coordination and political action at the EU level are not commensurate with the growing scale of climate threats. Therefore, we recommend strengthening the EU's adaptation framework, not only through the Climate Law but also through future legislation aligned with global objectives for preparation, adaptation, and mitigation,' referred Ottmar Edenhofer, recalling that Europe is the continent that records the fastest warming on the planet. 'Climate change is already affecting Europe. Rising temperatures threaten public health and cause avoidable losses of life and economic damage. And all scientific literature consistently shows that limiting global warming produces global social and economic benefits far superior to the costs of mitigation,' observed.

**EU Experts Call for Ambitious Climate Goal of 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Advisory Council recommends reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 90-95% by 2040, which would also benefit the economy and energy security, according to the experts. The council has reiterated its call for an ambitious climate goal for 2040, which would keep the EU on a credible path to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. If the goal is set too low, it would undermine the EU's long-term competitiveness and energy security, especially in a time of geopolitical uncertainty, the experts warn. The EU currently aims to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990, and the Commission has concluded that this goal is achievable. The EU also aims to become climate-neutral by 2050, but a binding intermediate goal for 2040 is still missing. The Commission had recommended reducing net emissions by at least 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 in 2024, and a draft law is expected in early July. The EU member states and the European Parliament will then negotiate the proposal, which is expected to be contentious. Some in the European Parliament and among the EU member states consider 90% to be too ambitious, and the Commission is expected to introduce more flexibility to achieve the goal, such as recognizing carbon credits from non-EU countries. The Climate Advisory Council advises against international emissions credits, instead recommending that the reduction be achieved through domestic EU measures.

**Europe's Shift Away from Combustion Engine Cars: Norway Leads the Way**
Norway has become the first European country to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, with the ban taking effect in 2025. The country has seen a significant shift towards electric vehicles, with 88.9% of new car registrations in 2024 being electric. Other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and California, plan to follow suit in 2030, while the EU and Japan have set a target of 2035. China and South Korea have set later targets of 2040 and 2050, respectively. Meanwhile, cities such as Stockholm, Hamburg, and London are implementing restrictions on the use of combustion engine cars, with some charging fees for access to certain areas. In Spain, Madrid and Barcelona are trying to implement similar measures, but a court ruling has temporarily blocked the introduction of low-emission zones in Madrid. As the article notes, 'En este caso sí sería sancionable' (in this case, it would be punishable) for drivers to be caught driving in flip-flops, according to the Guardia Civil.

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**From Leader to Laggard? U.S. Faces Carbon Capture Slowdown as EU Surges Ahead | OilPrice.com**
The United States, once a leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, is facing a slowdown due to policy uncertainty, while Europe is surging ahead with a regulatory-driven approach. The EU's Net-Zero Industry Act requires oil and gas companies to collectively develop and reserve at least 50 million tonnes of annual CO2 storage capacity by 2030, creating a stable environment for investors and reducing risk. This shift in global momentum highlights a changing dynamic in CCS leadership, with Europe positioning itself as a growing center of gravity for CCS innovation. 'This regulatory certainty offers investors a stable environment in which to commit capital, reducing risk and providing a clear roadmap for the long-term development of CCS infrastructure,' according to the article. The U.S. market, on the other hand, faces a potential slowdown due to the lack of stability in the regulatory environment, making it difficult for projects to reach final investment decisions.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**EU Expansion: Costa Says Countries Can Join Before 2030 if They Implement Reforms**
According to European Council President Antonio Costa, the stability and prosperity of Europe depend directly on the expansion of the EU. He stated this before his diplomatic tour to six Balkan countries, which are candidates for EU membership. Costa emphasized that his mission in the Western Balkans is to ensure that Brussels maintains strategic control over the region. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the accession process for Ukraine and Moldova, but this is unfair to Western Balkan countries, which should therefore speed up their reforms, Costa explained. European institutions have previously mentioned 2030 as the target date for the accession of countries such as Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia. However, now in Brussels, they only mention Albania and Montenegro. 'I don't have a fixed date. Why 2030? And why not earlier? Accession is a merit-based process. If countries implement reforms, they can join even before 2030,' Costa concluded. Additionally, it was recently announced that the EU plans to provide Ukraine with an additional 900 million euros for the purchase of arms and ammunition. The funds will be allocated from the profits obtained from frozen Russian assets under EU jurisdiction, as per Costa.

**Sixteen EU countries to trigger clause to increase defence spending**
The European Union (EU) has announced that 16 member states plan to use an exemption to increase their defence spending without breaching budgetary limits. The exemption allows countries to spend up to 1.5% of their GDP on defence over the next four years. Germany and Poland are leading the group, with Hungary and Slovakia also included. The move comes after the Trump administration suggested that Europe should pay more to defend itself and amid security concerns over Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, 'We are in an era of rearmament. And Europe is ready to massively boost its defence spending.' Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz added, 'In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes'.' The clause could allow hundreds of billions of euros to be spent on rearming the continent by 2030.

**Rearming Europe Requires Time and Caution, Not Haste**
European Union President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that by 2030, the EU should have a 'credible' military deterrence. However, the author of the article argues that this goal should be approached with caution and not rushed. The author suggests that before creating a unified European defense, a federal union should be established, with a single country or federal basis, to provide a solid foundation for a European army. The author also questions the need to create a defense structure that is divided among states, saying 'we are buying furniture while the house is still under construction.' The author also notes that the threat of Russia is often exaggerated in the media, stating 'Russia will never attack Europe.'

**EU Warns of Possible Russian Attack on NATO Country Before 2030**
The European Commission's defense and space chief, Andrius Kubilius, has warned that Russia could attack a NATO country before 2030. Kubilius emphasized the need for Europe to develop its defense capabilities independently of the US. He presented the White Paper, a strategy that includes increasing military spending and production, and allocating resources to joint defense projects. Kubilius noted that intelligence reports suggest that Russia could test the 5th article, which states that a military attack on any NATO country would be considered an attack on all, before 2030. He stressed that Europe needs to take full responsibility for its own defense. Kubilius said, 'We must not forget that the presence of the US in European defense is decreasing over time. 450 million Europeans cannot rely on 340 million Americans, who have their own agendas and challenges, to defend us against a 140 million-strong Russia that cannot be defeated by Ukraine.' He called on member states to commit to spending 3-3.5% of their GDP on defense over the next four years, which would bring the total budget to 2.4 trillion euros. Kubilius emphasized the need for Europe to develop its own defense industry, as 80% of its defense equipment is currently imported from outside the EU. He said, 'We need to have a developed defense industry so that we can have all the necessary equipment and stockpiles in case of war.'

**EU Plans to Boost Defense Spending by 2030**
The European Union has announced plans to increase its defense spending by a significant amount, allocating 800 billion euros (868 billion dollars) over the next four years for this purpose, including 150 billion euros in the form of loans for weapons projects and exemptions from European debt rules for defense investments. The EU leaders agreed to take all necessary steps to enhance European defense readiness by 2030, according to several delegations participating in the summit. These efforts also aim to strengthen military support for Ukraine while continuing to counter the Russian invasion. The sharp increase in defense spending comes as the European Commission has become increasingly concerned about the need for the EU to be prepared quickly for the possibility of a large-scale conflict with Russia. The European Commission had warned, in a paper presented before the summit, that history will not forgive European leaders for their inaction. It argued that a Russian victory in Ukraine would likely make Moscow seek other regional ambitions, possibly by 2030. The situation is particularly alarming because US President Donald Trump has announced that his country, the world's nuclear power, will no longer be available without condition or reservation as a guarantor of peace in Europe. However, the summit declaration makes it clear that the EU still relies on the presence of NATO, according to the German 'Tageschau' website. On the other hand, a joint statement by EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday also emphasized the need for an 'immediate' return to the ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all hostages held by Hamas. The leaders also called during their summit in Brussels for 'unhindered access to deliver humanitarian aid and its sustainable distribution in Gaza.' The statement added, 'Humanitarian aid should be delivered and distributed immediately, as well as providing Gaza with electricity, including water desalination plants, immediately.' It is worth noting that Hamas is an Islamist Palestinian militant group, classified as a terrorist organization in Germany, the European Union, the United States, and other countries.

**EU Sets Military Independence Goal for 2030, but Fails to Agree on Funding**
The European Union (EU) has set a goal to achieve military independence by 2030, but leaders failed to agree on how to finance the rearmament. EU leaders rejected the bellicose rhetoric and asked for EU subsidies for defense. The EU also called for increased military aid to Ukraine, despite the Trump-Putin dialogue, with Ursula von der Leyen stating, 'It's not a real negotiation.' Emmanuel Macron warned that Russia will remain a significant threat in approximately three to five years, while Petteri Orpo added, 'If sanctions are lifted, this timeframe would be even shorter.' The EU has allocated 40 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine in 2025, based on each country's economic weight. However, some countries, such as Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, and Portugal, are hesitant to contribute due to their lower economic weight. The EU's new defense fund of 150 billion euros is insufficient, according to some leaders, as it is based on credit and excludes transfers. Giorgia Meloni stated, 'We oppose eurobonds. It's not new, it's what we always say.' The EU's leaders have ignored Hungary's veto, and the Eastern and Northern countries are increasingly frustrated with the Southern countries' slow pace in providing aid to Ukraine and increasing defense spending.

**EU Tries to Rearm Itself, with a Focus on Strategic Autonomy**
The European Union is trying to rearm itself, with the EU's High Representative, Kaja Kallas, saying 'We are ready for the worst.' The EU's spending on military expenses is a major topic of discussion, with Kallas warning of a large-scale Russian action. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a plan to produce military equipment in Europe and exclude US, British, and Turkish companies from 150 billion euros in loans. However, von der Leyen has softened her tone, focusing on financial instruments to provide to member states rather than the initial bellicose tone of her plan. The EU's Defense Commissioner, Kubilius, is pushing for a more aggressive stance against Russia, saying 'The Kremlin is preparing to test Article 5 of NATO before 2030, we must act on a large scale.' Von der Leyen has proposed the 'Readiness 2030' plan, which aims to rearm the EU's industry in five years. She has also promised to 'explore additional funding sources' if the 'Safe' instrument (150 billion euros) is not enough to strengthen the EU's industrial and technological base. The plan is not just about military force, but about the EU's strategic autonomy as a global actor, according to von der Leyen and the Portuguese Prime Minister Costa. However, the plan has been met with criticism, with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saying that the EU's plan is not in Italy's interest. Kallas has also pushed for a more aggressive stance against Russia, saying 'We will not stop Putin by reading this book.' The plan is set to be discussed at the EU Council, which is expected to be contentious.

**Russia's Ability to Withstand Attack: European Countries Unprepared, Says Ukrainian Commander**
According to Maxim Zhoryin, a deputy commander of the 3rd Separate Storm Brigade, no European country can withstand a Russian attack. Zhoryin stated, 'The truth is that Ukraine is the main 'guarantor of security' for Europe. It should be the other way around, but that's in the past. Today, I am 100% sure that no European country can withstand a Russian attack.' Zhoryin attributed this to the lack of experience in modern warfare, insufficient defense funding, and a lack of will among European populations to fight. He said, 'The main reason is the internal unpreparedness of the population of most European countries to fight. Years of demilitarization and tolerance policies have almost destroyed the spirit of resistance there. Whether they will be able to wake up or not is unknown. The world is changing right now, and the current EU is not ready to face the challenges. Only Ukraine, with our experience, can be a defender - and for defense, adequate support is needed. There have been no progress in this regard.' German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) head Bruno Kahl stated that Russia aims to test the unity of the West in the context of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which considers an attack on one member as an attack on all. Kahl noted that the timing of Russia's 'test' depends on the course of the war in Ukraine. If the war ends before 2029 or 2030, Russia will be able to use its resources to create a threat to Europe sooner than expected.

She made this comment during a meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and high-ranking foreign guests with representatives of the media. Von der Leyen noted that if a specific date for Ukraine's EU entry is set, other candidate countries may request the same. 'If Ukraine continues at the same pace, it will join the EU even before 2030. So let's keep working, maintain that pace,' she said.

**Macron and Merz: The New Leaders of a Reaffirmed European Sovereignty?**
Following the German elections, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz may lead the enormous task of reaffirming European sovereignty against the US and building a new European map. The European identity crisis is exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, Germany's economic recession, and the 'European balkanization process' imagined by the US. The US is trying to provoke the emergence of centrifugal forces that will accelerate the dismemberment of the current European Union. The Paris-Berlin axis could be the backbone of the new Europe, with Merz's victory in the German elections giving hope to Paris that the Franco-German tandem will experience a new breath under Merz's chancellery. Merz has promised to advance together with France, showing his support for Emmanuel Macron. The war between the EU and the US could trigger a late reaffirmation of European sovereignty, with the EU imposing tariffs on US goods and the US imposing tariffs on EU goods. This could lead to a disaffection of the EU towards the US and a late reaffirmation of European sovereignty by France and Germany, which would be the genesis of a new European project. According to the article, by 2030, the current European Union could be dismantled and replaced by a constellation of satellite countries in the orbit of the Franco-German alliance (the so-called Europe of Six), composed of France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Austria. The rest of the peripheral European countries (Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Malta, and Cyprus) would gravitate in the orbital rings of the Six. The embryo of the new Europe would be directed by Macron and Merz and would be marked by the ratification of the good neighbor policy with Russia, through the signature of preferential agreements with France and Germany to ensure Russian gas and oil supplies and increase commercial exchanges, as well as the creation of a European army outside of NATO.
