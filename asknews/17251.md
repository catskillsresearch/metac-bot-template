**LGBTQ+ Pride Month: 'Workplace Climate Has Never Been More Progressive'**
A positive trend is observed in the workplace climate regarding LGBTQ+ issues, with 75-90% of employees supporting access to parental rights for colleagues who have had a child through surrogacy, the use of neutral terms, and access to restrooms for transgender individuals. The visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals has also increased, with 60% of them feeling visible to their colleagues (up from 50% in 2018) and 50% to their superiors. However, despite this positive trend, there are still areas of concern, with 28% of LGBTQ+ employees reporting being victims of at least one homophobic aggression at work, and 53% having heard homophobic slurs such as 'enculé' (45%), 'gouine' (32%), or 'travelo' (29%). Transgender and non-binary individuals are disproportionately discriminated against and aggressed.

**LGBTQ Students Face High Levels of Harassment and Discrimination in Japanese Schools**
A recent survey conducted by the NPO organization ReBit found that 89.5% of middle and high school students experienced difficulties or harassment in the past year, with 64.1% of them citing teachers as the cause. The survey also found that 53.9% of 10-year-olds, 40.5% of 20-year-olds, and 30.3% of 30-year-olds considered suicide. The survey's findings suggest that schools need to improve their support systems for LGBTQ students. The survey was conducted online from February to March 2025 and received 4733 responses from individuals aged 12-34. The survey found that 59.2% of students learned about LGBTQ issues in class, but 30.1% of them experienced discriminatory or incorrect comments from teachers. The survey's results highlight the need for schools to provide a safe and supportive environment for LGBTQ students. 'Students need to be able to feel safe and comfortable discussing their sexuality with their teachers,' said Mikka, representative of ReBit. 'We hope that all schools will establish a system to support LGBTQ students and provide them with a safe and inclusive environment.'

**LGBTQ Youth in Japan Face Significant Challenges**
A recent survey of 4,925 LGBTQ youth in Japan found that 89.5% of middle and high school students experienced difficulties or harassment at school, with 63.8% of these incidents being caused by teachers. The survey also found that 57.8% of 10-year-olds experienced mental health issues, with 52.4% scoring 10 or higher on the K6 scale, indicating a high risk of mental health problems. Additionally, 40.8% of 10-year-olds, 25.2% of 20-year-olds, and 27.1% of 30-year-olds reported not having someone to talk to about their sexuality. The survey highlights the need for a safe and supportive environment for LGBTQ youth, including access to mental health services, education, and employment opportunities. The Japanese government's 'LGBT Understanding Promotion Law' has been in effect since 2023, but the survey suggests that more needs to be done to address the challenges faced by LGBTQ youth.

**LGBT Older Adults Face Severe Challenges in Accessing Pensions and Employment**
A recent study by human rights organizations found that only 4% of the LGBT community surveyed has access to a pension, and 93% relies on support groups for survival. The difficulty in completing education and finding formal employment has a direct impact. The expiration of the moratorium on pension payments and its non-renewal by the government of Javier Milei also affects this group, which in most cases will not be able to access the solidarity pension regime. 'Like bread, tortillas, some ham, and once a week, offal. I drink mate, but I dry the yerba and use it again.' This anonymous testimony belongs to a 64-year-old person and was published in a report on the situation of older LGBT people prepared by different human rights organizations. The result corresponds to a survey conducted during the first half of 2024 at Casa Caracol for LGBTIQ+ older adults in Tucumán. According to the study, only 6.7% of the surveyed people did not need external help to feed themselves, and the majority had to restrict the purchase of food and essential products. 'People over 65 expressed feelings of desolation in the face of the general situation and said they felt 'a burden' because their support groups, chosen families, or friends made great efforts to cope with this context of crisis.' The study also reports that 84% of the people have a complete meal once a day, usually at midday, when they can go to someone's house, their support groups, or some NGOs or groups like soup kitchens or food banks. However, 'they cook just enough, and many times they stay hungry.' Another important finding is that the consumption of ultra-processed products increased in this population. 'The LGBT people consulted had to reduce the purchase of dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and meat due to the excessive increase in prices and the depreciation of their purchasing power, which led to 'a diet based solely on flours.' The situation could worsen not only with the end of the moratorium but also with the growing difficulties in accessing employment for this group. From Contratá Trans, in a note on the subject, pointed out that, in addition to the reduction of state employment (where it is estimated that more than 150 trans and non-binary people were fired in 2024), there is also a disinvestment in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies within companies. 'In this way, formal employment opportunities for women, trans people, and other historically vulnerable groups are reduced. At the same time, the elimination of these programs limits the creation of safe spaces within these companies,' and also affects productivity: 'Diverse companies have a 39% higher chance of surpassing their competitors and achieving better results.' Excusing themselves in the climate of the time, the analysis notes that many companies label inclusion policies as a form of 'reverse discrimination.' Instead, they are a historical repair, a 'tool to correct accumulated inequalities.'

**Support for same-sex marriage stays strong as party divide widens, poll shows**
A recent Gallup poll shows that 68% of Americans still support same-sex marriage, a decade after the Supreme Court made it legal across the U.S. in Obergefell v. Hodges. While overall support has remained steady, party opinions have shifted, with Democrats' support reaching a record high of 88% and Republicans' support dropping to 41%, the lowest since 2016. The gap between Democrats and Republicans is now 47 points, the widest it's been since Gallup started tracking this issue 29 years ago. Democrats have always been more supportive than Republicans, with independents generally closer to Democrats. However, the growing political divide could put LGBTQ+ rights at risk, as some Republican lawmakers have pushed for the Supreme Court to overturn the decision on same-sex marriage.

**LGBTQ+ adults agree — Americans don't accept transgender people**
A recent survey found that most LGBTQ+ adults believe there is little to no acceptance for trans people in the US. According to the survey, 52% of respondents said there is currently not much to no acceptance at all for trans people, while 44% said the same for nonbinary people. The survey also found that trans adults are more likely to face harassment, fear for their personal safety, and experience poor treatment from healthcare professionals. However, the majority of LGBTQ+ adults expect there to be more acceptance in the next 10 years, with 61% believing that having more supportive religious leaders will increase acceptance a great deal or fair amount.

**The Experiences of LGBTQ Americans Today**
A recent Pew Research Center study surveyed 3,959 LGBTQ adults in the United States to understand their experiences 10 years after the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The study found that LGBTQ adults have mixed views on social acceptance, with 73% of gay or lesbian adults and 68% of transgender adults saying they have been subject to slurs or jokes because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Transgender adults are about twice as likely as gay or lesbian adults to say this has happened to them recently. The study also found that 70% of transgender adults say they have feared for their personal safety at some point, and 42% say they have been treated poorly by health care professionals. Many LGBTQ adults say they were first aware of their sexual orientation or gender identity at an early age but didn’t tell anyone until later. The study highlights the diversity of experiences across and within LGBTQ groups, and underscores the need for continued social progress and acceptance. 'In broad strokes, the survey finds some sense of social progress, as well as a feeling that acceptance will continue to grow,' said the study. However, it also highlights experiences with discrimination, especially among transgender adults. 'But it also highlights experiences with discrimination, especially among transgender adults,' the study noted. 'And it underscores the diversity of experiences across and within LGBTQ groups – from coming out, to navigating public spaces, to connecting with a broader LGBTQ community.'

**You Won't Believe How Many U.S. Adults Identify As LGBTQ+**
A Gallup poll released Thursday found that 9.3 percent of U.S. adults identify as LGBTQ+, a nearly doubling of the figure since 2020 and an increase from 3.5 percent in 2012. The figure is expected to reach 10% in the near future, according to Jeff Jones, senior editor at Gallup. The increase is largely driven by younger generations, with over one in five Gen Z adults identifying as LGBTQ+. The survey, which interviewed over 14,000 U.S. adults, found that 85.7% of respondents identified as straight, while 5.2% identified as bisexual, 2% as gay, 1.4% as lesbian, and 1.3% as transgender.

**LGBTQ Identification Reaches Record High in the US**
According to a new Gallup survey, 9.3% of American adults identify as LGBTQ, the highest percentage ever recorded. This represents a 1% increase from last year and nearly a doubling of the 2020 figure. The growth is primarily among younger generations, with 21% of Generation Z adults (ages 18-27) identifying as LGBTQ, compared to much lower percentages in older generations. The survey found that 85.7% of respondents identified as heterosexual, while 5% identified as bisexual, 2% as gay men, 1.4% as lesbians, and 1.3% as transgender individuals. The study also showed that LGBTQ identification is more common among Democrats and independents, women, and city and suburban residents. Analysts predict that the percentage of LGBTQ individuals in the US will continue to grow due to demographic changes. The survey was conducted among 14,162 adults and has a margin of error of 1 percentage point.

**More Americans Identify as LGBTQ+ Than Ever Before, Poll Finds**
A Gallup poll found that 9.3% of American adults identify as LGBTQ+, a 1 percentage point increase from 2023. The proportion of the population identifying as LGBTQ+ has nearly doubled since 2020 and has jumped from 3.5% since 2012. Young people, particularly Gen Z, are more likely to identify as LGBTQ+, with 22.7% of Gen Z adults identifying as such. The poll also found that LGBTQ+ identification differs by gender, location, and political affiliation, with women, city dwellers, and Democrats being more likely to identify as LGBTQ+. Experts say the findings are a positive trend, showing how society is changing around gender and sexuality, but also note that current anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric is taking a toll on the community.

The percentage of young people identifying as LGBTQ+ has increased from an average of 18.8% in 2020-2022 to 22.7% in 2024. Experts say that the increase in visibility and understanding of LGBTQ+ identities has allowed people to live more openly and share their identities with others. However, current anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric is taking a toll on the community, with 390 bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights in the United States. Experts hope that the poll results will remind lawmakers and leaders that LGBTQ+ people are friends, family members, colleagues, neighbors, teammates, and more, and deserve to be treated fairly, with dignity and respect.

**New data shows adults who identify as LGBTQ+ has TREBLED**
A new nationwide survey by Gallup has found that the number of American adults who identify as LGBTQ+ has trebled in the past decade, from 3.5 percent in 2012 to 9.3 percent in 2024. The increase is largely due to more young adults, particularly women, identifying as bisexual. Women were almost twice as likely as men to report being LGBTQ+, at 10 percent compared to 6 percent. Democrats and independents were more likely than Republicans to identify as LGBTQ+, with 14 percent and 11 percent respectively. Psychologists have debated whether the increase is due to social media or greater acceptance of sexual minorities. Patrick Brown, a research fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, suggested that social contagion may be a factor, but noted that many who identify as bisexual will end up in relationships with men. A separate survey by Ipsos found that the US had a slightly higher percentage of LGBTQ+ residents than other countries, with 10 percent of the population identifying as LGBTQ+. The country with the highest percentage was the Netherlands, with 14 percent.
