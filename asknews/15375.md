**Sport 2200: A New Initiative for Sports Clubs in Herentals**
The city of Herentals has dismantled the strategic ateliers, which replaced the classical advisory councils in the previous legislative period, and is giving engaged citizens the opportunity to create a new type of thematic advisory council. The sports clubs are doing this under the name Sport 2200. The new city council of Herentals has abolished the participatory form of the strategic ateliers and is introducing a system of thematic advisory councils. A significant difference is that the city is not setting up 'non-mandatory' advisory councils for sports or culture itself, but is leaving it to the initiative of the citizens. Peter Van Grieken, a member of Sport 2200, says, 'The working group aims to improve communication between sports clubs and municipal institutions, collect municipal guidelines and application procedures, bundle problems, and defend the interests of sports clubs in municipal decisions, such as permits and subsidies.' The new working group invites all interested parties to the start meeting on Thursday, June 5, at 8 pm in the De Meier hall on the Kunstencampus on the Molenvest.

**Internet Speed Record Broken: 10,000 Films Downloaded in One Second**
Japanese researchers have achieved an incredible internet speed by using a specially designed 19-core fiber optic cable. They were able to transmit 1 million GB of data in one second over a distance of 1,800 kilometers. This is equivalent to downloading 10,000 high-definition films in just one second. The team from the Photonics Network Laboratory in Japan has set a new world record for internet transmission speed. According to the researchers, their new optical fiber technology will enable us to prepare for a future where data traffic will increase rapidly due to artificial intelligence, 6G, the Internet of Things, and other innovative technologies. As they stated, 'In a 5G post-society, we expect a massive explosion of data traffic due to new communication services, and the establishment of advanced information and communication infrastructure is essential.' The system performed better in shorter distances, with a transmission speed of up to 1.7 petabits per second over a distance of 63.5 kilometers. The researchers compared their solution to a 19-lane highway, where each lane is an independent fiber core that can transmit data simultaneously, allowing for a large amount of information to move at the same time.

**What 5G Achieved, What It Failed to Do, and What 6G Promises**
The communication technology has undergone a silent but effective revolution over the past twenty years. This revolution is not limited to our phones' screens displaying clearer images, internet pages loading faster, or videos playing without buffering. It has also changed the way we access information, the relationships we build with each other, and even the language that devices use to communicate with each other. The 5G technology, which is still not fully established in many countries, has started to lay the groundwork for the future infrastructure with its low latency, high speed, and high capacity for device-to-device connections. However, this infrastructure is only sufficient to meet the needs of 'today.' For 'tomorrow,' planning needs to be done now. This is where the concept of 6G comes in. 5G has theoretically reached speeds of up to 10 Gbps, which is enough to download a film in a few seconds. However, 5G's real strength lies not only in its speed but also in its flexibility and ability to maintain seamless communication with millions of devices at the same time. This has made it possible for self-driving cars to change direction in real-time based on traffic information, for doctors to perform operations remotely using robotic arms, and for the creation of smart city infrastructure managed by sensors. However, 5G still has limitations, such as capacity bottlenecks in crowded areas and limited artificial intelligence integration in device-to-device communication. 6G is being developed to overcome these limitations. 6G is still not commercially available, but it is being shaped in research laboratories and vision documents. Some of the promises made so far include: * 1 Terabit/s data transfer rate (approximately 100 times faster than 5G) * Latency as low as 0.1 milliseconds * Wireless transmission: Global coverage using low-orbit satellites * Holographic communication: Real-time 3D image transmission * Artificial intelligence-assisted network management: Self-optimizing networks that require no human intervention * Tactical awareness: Integration of sensor data for military, medical, and disaster management purposes. 5G has started a connection era. 6G will start an interaction era. It will not only transmit data but also load meaning onto it, use data to make decisions, and apply these decisions in real-time. An example: Today, we collect data, analyze it, and then take action. With 6G, the device will be able to sense the situation in real-time, make decisions using artificial intelligence, and take action without asking permission. This will redefine the human-machine relationship. Currently, the countries investing the most in 6G are China, South Korea, Japan, the US, and European Union countries. The competition is not only technical but also economic and political. The country that creates the infrastructure for 6G will not only control communication but also data flow, digital economy, and cyber security balance. Turkey should create its own technology ecosystem, producing its own devices, network equipment, and software. We should not be just watching the communication revolution from the outside but be a part of it. Conclusion: The future will not only be faster but also more intelligent. The world we experienced with 5G, where everything is connected, will evolve into a world where everything is not only connected but also understands and responds. The issue is no longer just fast internet but devices that can make their own decisions, sometimes even taking the place of humans. This change is not only technological but also sociological. The future of communication tools is not only about what we say but also how we feel.

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Japanese Researchers Set New Record for Data Transfer Speed**
Japanese researchers have achieved an incredible data transfer speed of 1.02 petabytes per second over a 0.125mm thick optical fiber, similar to those used in modern networks. According to the study, a special optical fiber was used to transmit this volume of data over a distance of 1808 kilometers. The team created a combined amplifier system and used 19 channels, each with one fiber, and then ran the signal through these channels 21 times to achieve a total distance of 1808 kilometers. The 19-channel receiver then processed the signals, and a digital processor calculated the final transfer speed. The achieved speed of 1.02 petabytes per second over a distance of over 1800 km is a new world record for optical fiber communication using standard-sized fibers. Another impressive indicator is the product of 'speed × distance' (an important parameter in optical communication), which was 1.86 exabit-seconds per kilometer, also a world record. This is not the first test of the 19-core fiber. In previous experiments, researchers were able to achieve speeds of 1.7 petabytes per second, but only over a short distance of 63.5 km. For the first time, it was possible to combine high speed with data transfer over a distance approaching the scale of a real network. In the post-5G society, the volume of traffic will grow exponentially due to new communication services.

**Don’t short broadband today**
The current broadband benchmark of 100/20 Mbps is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of households, as the demand for higher-speed broadband continues to grow due to the emergence of latency-sensitive applications. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) raised the broadband bar to 100/20 Mbps in 2024, but this is still not enough to meet the needs of households with multiple family members, remote workers, and heavy interactive users. The need for more bandwidth is also driven by the continual march of new and improved applications, such as cloud services, multi-person video conferencing, and AI tools. In fact, research from Parks Associates indicates that the average U.S. household has 17 connected devices, while 23% of households have at least one connected appliance. Furthermore, the 50+ demographic is expected to spend over $120 billion on AgeTech technology by 2030, which requires high-speed, low-latency broadband to deliver health tech services of all types. The Fiber Broadband Association emphasizes that fiber is the connective bridge between the high-speed cellular networks needed to remotely operate farm equipment and the cloud services that are the heart of autonomous vehicles. Gary Bolton, CEO of Fiber Broadband Association, warns that going short on broadband by spending the least amount of money per location rather than installing fiber upfront only ensures that more money will have to be paid in the future when those households need more than what the least expensive solution provides.

**Say goodbye to slow Wi-Fi: infrared beams could power future 5G and 6G networks**
Researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) have successfully transmitted data over a 4.6km distance using infrared light at a rate of 5.7 terabits per second, equivalent to streaming 1.9 million Netflix shows in HD simultaneously. This achievement, made possible by advanced optical antennas from Aircision, demonstrates the potential for ultra-fast, interference-free data transmission. According to Vincent van Vliet, a TU/e PhD researcher, 'infrared wireless communication combines the high data speeds known from optical fibers with the flexibility of wireless communication systems.' The team used the Reid Photonloop testbed to achieve this breakthrough, which could lead to future applications in connecting 5G and 6G antennas where laying fiber is impractical. 'We are redefining how data is transmitted over the air,' said Luis Oliveira, co-founder of Aircision. 'This record-breaking achievement proves that our technology is ready to make high-speed internet accessible to millions of people faster than ever before.'

**Quantum Transmission Breakthrough: 250 km over Normal Fiber Optic Cable**
A team of researchers led by Mirko Pittaluga has achieved a record-breaking quantum transmission over a normal fiber optic cable, similar to those used for internet connections. The quantum message traveled 250 kilometers, marking an important step towards faster and more secure communications. The result, published in the Nature journal, was made possible by an experiment that used existing infrastructure and did not require specialized equipment. 'The experiment is very interesting and the result is important,' said Fabio Sciarrino, a researcher at the Quantum Lab of the University of Rome Sapienza. 'It's something that was always assumed at a theoretical level, but needed to be demonstrated in practice.' Quantum networks rely on the principle of entanglement, which allows for connections between particles, such as photons, even when separated by large distances. This makes it possible to improve both the security and speed of data transmission. Previous quantum communications have been limited to short distances due to the need for specialized equipment, such as cryogenic refrigerators. However, Pittaluga's team has found a way to facilitate the distribution of secure information over long distances, achieving the first known case of 'coherent' quantum communication. Coherence is the ability of light waves to interact in a predictable way, maintaining synchronization in both space and time. 'This is the most relevant novelty of the study,' said Sciarrino. 'Coherence requires a high level of stabilization, which was resolved here through a work that is halfway between physics and engineering, and opens up various scenarios: it allows for the extension of the maximum allowed distance for quantum communications, reduces the required performance, making it more accessible, and also opens up the use of new protocols for quantum networks - concludes Sciarrino - paving the way for the next steps.'

**The Limit of Everything**
The speed of light is the ultimate barrier for information transfer, and it's not just about communication. It affects everything, from how we explore space to how we understand the universe. The speed of light is the fastest anything can travel in the universe, and it's a fundamental limit that can't be broken. Even with advanced technology, we can't go faster than light, as it would require infinite energy and disrupt causality. The speed of light impacts online communication, with ping times increasing with distance. Messages from Earth to Mars take 3-20 minutes to arrive, and the farther apart locations are, the longer the delay. This is a fundamental limit we can't escape, and it's not just about technology, but about the nature of the universe itself.

**Section 230 faces bipartisan repeal effort. Experts say it's a risky bet**
A bipartisan group of senators, led by Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin, is pushing to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech platforms from legal liability for user-generated content. Critics argue that this provision enables Big Tech to avoid accountability, but experts warn that repealing it could have unintended consequences that harm the very causes lawmakers support. As one might say, 'dismantling the cornerstone of internet law is a risky bet'.

**Lawmakers are trying to repeal Section 230 again**
Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) are planning to reintroduce a bill to sunset Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in two years. This would remove protections that web services and users have enjoyed since the 1990s, which underpins much of the way the internet as we know it today works. Graham has been trying to advance this proposal since 2020, with his spokesperson, Taylor Reidy, confirming that a reintroduction is 'in the works.'

**NBTC preps public hearing for 6 bands**
The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) has ordered a public hearing within seven days to discuss the auction of six mobile spectrum bands. The hearing will cover the auction conditions, including the grouping of the six spectrum bands to ensure meaningful competition and a clear framework for each round of the auction. According to NBTC chairman Dr Sarana Boonbaichaiyapruck, the hearing will also include terms of licence payment. AM Thanapant Raicharoen, an NBTC commissioner, said that the planned auction should have all related conditions to ensure consumers benefit. The NBTC board also agreed to put the 3500MHz into the hearing, including the topic of whether to add the mobile spectrum range of 3300-3400 MHz or a part of the 3500MHz range to the auction plan. Somphop Purivigraipong, another NBTC commissioner, emphasized that the auction of the six mobile spectrum bands must be held before the August expiry date of the 850, 2100 and 2300MHz bands. 'The auction of the six mobile spectrum bands must be held before the August expiry date of the 850, 2100 and 2300MHz bands now being used under partnership agreements between state-owned National Telecom and private sector operators,' he said.

**Tech miracles: Seven impossible things to think about before breakfast**
Scientists have explored several seemingly impossible technologies that could shape the future, including faster-than-light travel, time travel, Dyson sphere, biological immortality, controlled wormholes, brain-to-brain communication, and harnessing dark matter and energy. While some of these ideas may seem like science fiction, researchers have made significant progress in understanding the underlying physics. For example, Nasa's Eagleworks Lab has explored Alcubierre's warp drive, which theoretically contracts space ahead of a craft and expands it behind. Additionally, quantum teleportation experiments have transferred information over 100km via entanglement. However, many of these technologies come with serious consequences, such as the grandfather paradox in time travel, and raise profound ethical and privacy concerns, like brain-to-brain communication. As we weigh the incredible opportunities against existential risks, we must consider which of these technologies we would most want to see realized and which gives us the most significant cause for pause. 'The coming decades will determine whether we become an interstellar species or a cautionary tale for others,' according to the article.

**Nobel Prize winner Maria Ressa delivers keynote address at Arnolt Center Symposium**
Nobel Prize winner Maria Ressa delivered a keynote address at the Arnolt Center Symposium, highlighting the challenges faced by journalists on social media. Ressa stated that social media platforms hinder journalists by spreading disinformation, citing a study that found false information travels six times faster than the truth. She also discussed the use of sock puppet networks by terrorist organizations to spread extreme views. Ressa emphasized the importance of fact-checking and called for social media platforms to be held responsible for the content they host. She also noted that section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shields platform owners from liability, but suggested that this could be reformed to incentivize platforms to address illicit content. Ressa concluded by urging young journalists to collaborate and work together to hold those in power accountable, stating that '2025 is the tipping point year'.

**Steven Brill’s new book, ‘The Death of Truth,’ Warns That Internet Goliaths Are Anything But ‘Good Samaritans’ - The Village Voice**
Steven Brill's new book, 'The Death of Truth,' warns that internet giants are not 'Good Samaritans' but rather manipulators who have exploited the internet to spread misinformation and polarize the world. Brill documents how the 1996 Telecommunications Act amendments, specifically Section 230, provided immunity to social media companies for user-generated content, leading to the spread of misinformation. He calls for the end of online anonymity, tougher enforcement of campaign finance laws, and the regulation of generative AI. Brill also recommends steps to restore truthfulness to the news cycle, including teaching online hygiene, requiring social media companies to audit their posts, and taming the programmatic advertising industry. He encourages citizen-driven ballot initiatives to attack the problem through state constitutions and envisions a system in which voting districts are determined by independent nonpartisan commissions. Brill concludes that by taking these steps, people will start to believe in truth again and will be less likely to believe in conspiracy theories.

**Russia Enters the Satellite Internet Race with 'Bureau 1440' Project**
Russia plans to create its own low-orbit satellite group to provide high-speed internet access. This ambitious task is part of the national project 'Economy of Data' and could lead to significant changes in the telecommunications market. The global race for satellite internet has been ongoing, with SpaceX leading the way with its Starlink project, which has over 4,750 operational satellites and serves over 2 million customers in 60 countries. However, Russia does not want to be left behind and has announced its own project, 'Sfera', which aims to launch a satellite group to provide connectivity across the country. The company 'IKS Holding' has already launched the first three low-orbit satellites as part of the 'Bureau 1440' project, with plans to launch 700 satellites by 2035. According to Mikhail Mishustin, the Prime Minister of Russia, the goal is to create a group that will meet the needs of fast internet not only in Russia but also in friendly countries. The project has already undergone several test launches, including a successful test of a laser communication system with a data transfer speed of up to 10 Gbps over a distance of 1,000 km. Experts note that creating a Russian analogue of Starlink is a complex and ambitious task that will require significant financial and technological resources. 'We have never had a low-orbit satellite group, which should appear by 2028... To solve this problem, which has not been solved for decades, using a low-orbit satellite group is possible,' said Denis Kuskov, general director of the analytical agency TelecomDaily. The project 'Bureau 1440' will compete with the 'Sfera' project from Roscosmos, which also aims to create a satellite group for internet access. According to Mikhail Mishustin, the goal is to increase the number of satellites in orbit by several times, which will significantly improve the quality of services for the state, citizens, and business. 'To implement the tasks set by the President, it is necessary to increase the composition of the orbital group of spacecraft by several times, which will allow significantly improving the quality of services for the state, citizens, and business,' said Mikhail Mishustin. The head of Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, announced that the production of satellites in Russia will start in 2026, which will require 60 billion rubles. It remains to be seen whether this ambitious task will be implemented.
