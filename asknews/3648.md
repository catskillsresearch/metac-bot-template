**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The AI Singularity: Are We on the Edge of a New Era?**
The concept of the 'Singularity,' where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, has long been a topic of debate. With recent breakthroughs in AI, such as large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, the timeline for the Singularity has moved from decades to possibly years or months. According to a study by AIMultiple, there has been a huge acceleration in anticipation, driven by innovation in AI models. Experts predict that the Singularity could be reached by 2026, with some estimating it could happen as soon as the next six months. Factors driving this faster pace include exponential growth in computing power and the availability of data. As AI systems become smarter, they may be able to solve complex problems and exhibit human-like abilities, but critics fear possible dangers, such as the loss of human control and unintended outcomes. As Dr. Kurzweil, a pioneer of the Singularity concept, said, 'The Singularity refers to the point at which AI systems start improving themselves and become smarter than human intelligence.'

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Integration of AI with Human Brain May Not Be Possible Before 2050-2060**
According to Yevgeny Kuznetsov, the CEO of Digital Evolution Ventures, the deep integration of artificial intelligence with brain interfaces will not be possible before 2050-2060. Kuznetsov stated that the model for developing and applying new technologies is more complex than the one proposed by Ray Kurzweil, as it takes into account the difficulties of social acceptance of new technologies and the cycles of delay and reaction. According to this model, during the next wave of technological revolution, we will significantly increase our interaction with artificial intelligence through traditional interfaces, i.e., through devices and digital screens. However, the deeper integration with the brain will not be possible before 2050-2060, when the next wave of technological revolution will begin, despite the initial signs of these technologies appearing as predicted by Kurzweil. Kurzweil had previously stated that by 2045, humans will be able to control robots the size of molecules inside their bodies, and they will be inserted into the human brain in an indirect way to connect the new cortex to the cloud, increasing human intelligence by a million times. Kuznetsov emphasized that 'more integration between humans and digital systems is inevitable and unavoidable.' He added that 'we are not yet able to live without smartphones and computers. But to what extent will this integration go? Although digital neural networks are designed partially like the brain, we are not technically compatible. The brain is a complex tissue, and simply filling it with electrodes represents a major and complex challenge. For critical cases and patients with serious diseases, this problem will be partially solved in the next decade, but it is unlikely that Neuralink chips or other interfaces will become common among the general public.'
