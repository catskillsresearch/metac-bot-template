**Shoppers to be blocked from buying 'unhealthy' sodas and energy drinks next year**
In 2026, American shoppers will no longer be able to purchase sugar-filled sodas and energy drinks using their SNAP benefits, thanks to a new regulation. The change was approved by the USDA, allowing Nebraska to restrict SNAP spending on these items starting January 1, 2026. Several other states, including Iowa, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, West Virginia, and Colorado, are also planning to restrict unhealthy purchases using food stamps. Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen said, 'There's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks.' The change aims to encourage healthier eating patterns, but some researchers argue that SNAP restrictions may not alter beneficiaries' eating patterns and will be difficult to implement.

**New Coca-Cola flavour spotted in UK stores as fans cry 'need to find this'**
A new Coca-Cola flavour, Orange Cream, has been spotted in UK stores. The flavour, which was launched in the US in February, combines the classic taste of Coca-Cola with a burst of orange and creamy vanilla flavours. Fans have taken to social media to express their excitement about the discovery, with one person saying, 'Need to find this and give it a try.' However, not everyone is convinced, with some labelling the new flavour 'revolting.' The new flavour is similar to Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla, which was discontinued in 2022 due to supply chain and marketing challenges caused by COVID-19.
