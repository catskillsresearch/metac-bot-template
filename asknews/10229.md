**Government Assistance for Young Families in Russia**
Young families in Russia are eligible for government assistance, including a program called 'Young Family' which provides financial support for housing. In 2025, young families can receive a subsidy of at least 30% of the cost of housing, up to 35% for families with children. The subsidy can be used to purchase or build a home, or to pay off existing mortgages. Additionally, young families can receive a one-time payment of 26,400 rubles upon the birth of a child. Young families who have participated in the Special Military Operation (SVO) have priority access to these benefits. The government also provides financial assistance to families with children, including a monthly allowance of 40% of the average salary, up to 68,995.48 rubles. The government has also introduced a unified child benefit, which is calculated based on a comprehensive assessment of the family's income and expenses. The benefit can range from 8,800 to 17,700 rubles per month for children under 17, and from 9,600 to 19,300 rubles per month for pregnant women.

**Maternal Capital in Russia: A Measure of Social Support for Families**
The Russian government has introduced a measure of social support for families with children, known as the 'maternal capital'. The program aims to increase birth rates in the country. The maternal capital is a one-time payment of 690,266 rubles for the first child, 912,162 rubles for the second child, and 912,162 rubles for the third child. The payment can be used for various purposes, including education, housing, and healthcare. The program has undergone changes over the years, with the most recent update in 2025 increasing the payment by 9.5%. The maternal capital can be used to pay for education, including private schools and universities, as well as to improve housing conditions. The payment can also be used to form a pension for the mother. Additionally, the program provides for monthly payments for children under the age of three, as well as compensation for the adaptation of children with disabilities. The program has undergone changes over the years, with the most recent update in 2025 increasing the payment by 7.3%. Regional programs also provide additional support for families, with some regions offering a regional maternal capital.

**Russia's Social Fund Supports Millions of Families with Children**
The Social Fund in Russia has provided support to millions of families with children, with nearly 300,000 certificates for maternal capital issued since January 2025. According to the fund, 'Since the beginning of 2025, the Social Fund has issued certificates for 289,000 families. Today, it is issued when the first child is born. In this case, parents receive the right to manage the sum of 690.2 thousand rubles.' Additionally, when a second child is born or adopted, the capital increases by almost 222 thousand rubles. If a family receives the maternal capital for the second child immediately, it is provided in an increased amount of 912.2 thousand rubles. The fund also allows for monthly payments equal to the child's living wage (17.2 thousand rubles in 2025), which can be received for each child under the age of three. Furthermore, the Social Fund appoints two lump-sum payments - for pregnancy and childbirth, and for the birth of a child. Since the beginning of 2025, these payments have been received by 321.8 thousand women. The fund also provides support for families with low income, expecting a child, with a lump sum payment of 9.7-19.3 thousand rubles. This support can be continued after the birth of the child and up to the child's 17th birthday, with a monthly financial support of 8.6-17.2 thousand rubles. 'In total, the Social Fund has already paid a lump sum to parents of over 10 million children, including 3.8 million children for whom the funds were allocated this year,' the fund noted. If a parent is on leave to care for a child under 1.5 years old, the family can also receive a payment (10.1-68.9 thousand rubles for working parents and 10.1 thousand rubles for unemployed parents). Unemployed parents have the right to choose between this payment and the lump sum. 'Children are our future, and the Social Fund of Russia is doing everything possible to make this future happy. This year, we have already supported Russian families with more than 11 million children. Every day, the Social Fund works to ensure that from the first days of a child's life, their parents can receive all the necessary support,' said Sergey Chirkov, Chairman of the Social Fund of Russia.

**Ministry of Health Reports Significant Decrease in Abortion Medication Circulation**
The Ministry of Health has reported a significant decrease in the circulation of medications used for abortion, from 1.39 million doses in 2022 to 0.64 million in 2024, a more than two-fold drop. According to the report, this positive trend is due to several measures, including pre-abortion psychological counseling, the introduction of 'quiet days' for making a final decision, and a system of material incentives for both pregnant women who decide to keep their child and healthcare professionals at women's consultation clinics. Additionally, nearly 700 private medical organizations across the country, approximately 25% of the total, have voluntarily stopped providing abortion services. Furthermore, 20 federal subjects have already implemented or are in the process of implementing legislative restrictions that prohibit inducing women to artificial termination of pregnancy, as reported by the 'Tsarigrad' TV channel. The Ministry of Health has previously called for making diabetes testing mandatory in Russia. Also, producers of alcoholic beverages have expressed concern over the decline in consumer demand for spirits.

**Supporting Families with Children: Russia's System of Social Support**
Russia has a system of social support for families with children, which covers nearly a third of all minors. The key priority of state policy is to support motherhood, childhood, and family, especially large and multi-child families. According to Vice-Premier Tatyana Golikova, the number of multi-child families has increased by 26% over the past few years, and the number of children raised in these families has increased by 30%. The government has introduced several measures to support families with children, including the maternity capital program, which has been in place since 2007. The program provides a one-time payment of up to 912,000 rubles for the birth of a second child. The government has also introduced a uniform allowance for children under 17, which is 50-100% of the regional minimum wage. Additionally, there is a payment for the birth of a child, which is 27,000 rubles in 2025. The government has also introduced a family mortgage program, which provides a 6% interest rate for families with children under the age of 6 or a disabled child. The maximum loan amount is 12 million rubles in Moscow and the surrounding regions, and 6 million rubles in other regions. According to Vice-Premier Golikova, the government will continue to develop measures to support families with children, with the goal of creating social stability and reducing poverty among families with children, and ensuring equal opportunities for their upbringing and education.

**Russia Celebrates International Children's Day with Progress in Child Protection and Support for Families**
Russia celebrates International Children's Day on June 1st. The country has made significant progress in protecting children's rights, with the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 and the establishment of the institution of the Ombudsman for Children's Rights in 2009. The government has also implemented various measures to support families with children, including the introduction of the Maternity Capital program in 2007 and the extension of the program until 2030. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed an order establishing the status of multi-child families and defining measures to support them. The number of children in Russia has been declining, with a total of 25.5 million children under the age of 15 as of January 2023. The birth rate in Russia has also decreased, with 1.222 million births in 2024, a 3.4% decrease from 2023. The government aims to increase the total fertility rate to 1.6 by 2030 and to 1.8 by 2036. The country has also seen a significant decrease in child mortality, with a rate of 4.0 per 1,000 live births as of December 2024. The number of children in foster care has also decreased, with 340,055 children as of 2024. The government has also launched a unique program for screening reproductive health for women and men aged 18-45 in the framework of dispensary examination. Russia has declared 2024 as the Year of the Family, with key objectives including creating conditions for the birth of the first children in young families, strengthening reproductive health, supporting multi-child and multi-generational families, and forming a healthy trend towards multi-child families.

**Russian Orthodox Church Calls for Urgent Measures to Increase Birth Rates**
Father Theodor Lukyanov, head of the Patriarchal Commission on Family, Maternity, and Childhood, has called for urgent systemic measures in demographic policy. He stated, 'If we want to preserve ourselves as a civilization, we must consistently pursue a policy based on traditional values and demographic priorities.' He noted that the ideologues of the Third Reich considered reducing Russian birth rates as a strategic goal and warned that modern forces exerting pressure on Russia have strayed far from these principles. He highlighted the scale of unreported abortions in the private medical sector, citing a 100% audit of private clinics licensed to provide obstetrics and gynecology services, which revealed numerous violations. He also pointed out the formation of a gray market for biological materials and the open disregard for the law, including the ban on advertising abortions. Statistics show that the number of licenses for abortions in the private sector is three times higher than for childbirth assistance, while the opposite is true in the public sector. Analysis by region has established a direct link between the number of clinics performing abortions and birth rates. Regions that have supported the initiatives of the Russian Orthodox Church and restricted the activities of private clinics in the abortion sector have shown positive dynamics in birth rates. For example, Crimea, where private medical institutions have refused to obtain the necessary licenses, has seen a 3.3% increase in birth rates. Father Theodor believes that it is now necessary to move to federal-level regulation. He proposes a ban on abortions in private clinics, stricter control over the procedure in public institutions, and the formation of a state policy to protect life before birth. According to him, this would help reduce abortions by 30% in the first year and increase the number of newborns by 300,000.

**Russia's Population of Reproductive Age to Decline Until 2046**
The number of Russian women of reproductive age is expected to decline until 2046, according to Vice-Premier Tatyana Golikova. The decline is attributed to the economic crisis in the 1990s, which affected the birth rate in Russia. Between 2010 and 2021, the number of women aged 20-29 in Russia decreased by 37.5%. Golikova noted that the average age of first-time mothers in Russia is 26, but it would be better if it were 24. She also stated that women are making decisions about having children at an older age, which contributes to the decline in births. Golikova emphasized that the government is taking measures to address the issue of low fertility rates. According to the Rosstat, the total fertility rate in Russia in 2024 was 1.41 children per woman. The number of first-time mothers has decreased by 19.9% and second-time mothers by 31% over the past six years, due to the aging population and the decline in the number of women of reproductive age, as explained by Olga Bataлина, the First Deputy Minister of Labor.

**The Consequences of Low Birth Rates: A Threat to Society and the Economy**
A recent report by VCIOM shows that in 2024, Russia had a birth rate of 1.22 million children, a 3.4% decrease from the previous year. This trend is consistent with global data from IHME. Forbes Young investigates the potential risks and consequences of this trend. According to Victor Kumar, a decrease in birth rate leads to a shortage of young people, which in turn affects the elderly. Pensioners will be in the majority and will require more care from society and the state. Kumar paints a dire picture: hospitals will be overwhelmed, playgrounds will be empty, schools will be converted into care facilities for the elderly, and the pension system will collapse. In contrast, independent researcher Alexei Raksha predicts that the medical sector will develop rapidly, leading to a decrease in violence and conflicts, and an improvement in the quality of life for the elderly. However, Raksha also notes that the growth of the average lifespan may not keep pace with the increase in pension age. Elena Churilova, a senior researcher at the International Laboratory of Population and Health Studies at HSE University, agrees that the key issue is the health and functional status of the elderly. If they are mostly healthy, it will be a positive scenario, but if not, it will exacerbate social and economic problems. Churilova also notes that the issue of loneliness among the elderly will become more pressing, and the infrastructure will need to be adapted to meet the needs of the elderly. 'The policy may become more conservative and focused on the needs of the elderly,' she says. Kumar also notes that the decrease in birth rate will have a negative impact on the economy and the state. 'The growth of the population stimulates economic growth. More people mean more workers, consumers, and innovations. When the population increases, it becomes possible to save on scale - efficiency increases, and wealth multiplies,' he says. However, Kumar also notes that the disappearance of the 'collective brain' is a more significant threat. Large societies can create new things, review old ones, and generally cope better with the task of creating and developing intellectual labor. We, on the other hand, will 'give up not only specific innovations, but also monitoring entire areas that affect everything - from fundamental research to technological progress in engineering and medicine,' he says. Kumar also notes that the decrease in birth rate will lead to a decrease in the number of young specialists, who are the driving force of change. 'Young people are not just doing work; they are rethinking how this work should be done. They are not just participating in the economy; they are changing it,' he says. In conclusion, Kumar notes that the decrease in birth rate is a serious problem, but not a catastrophic one. He calls for a balanced and comprehensive approach to addressing the issue. However, Churilova notes that the battle against low birth rates is largely ineffective, as it requires a fundamental change in the values and views of the population. 'We need to create conditions for the birth of the desired number of children,' she says. Raksha agrees that the decrease in birth rate needs to be addressed. 'With a low birth rate, we will have an aging population, a lack of economic growth, and the state will withdraw from the big world in many respects,' he says. In conclusion, Kumar notes that the decrease in birth rate may lead to a re-evaluation of government policies on human development. However, Churilova notes that the world with more old people than young is still far away. 'The UN's population forecast predicts that by 2100, 24% of the world's population will be over 65, 17% will be children under 15, and the remaining 59% will be the working-age population. Therefore, the situation where there are more old people than young is still a distant future, and it is possible that demographic trends will change and this situation will not occur in principle.' Kumar also notes that in the future, other factors may play a role that are impossible to predict today. Even a cultural revolution, such as the return of the idea of collective childrearing, where not only parents but also friends and neighbors care for the child, creating conditions for caring for children at work, etc. - cannot be ruled out. 'Although we are unable to accurately predict how such changes may unfold, we can try to encourage more sustainable and fair childrearing. At least, we should think more about it,' he concludes.

**Russia's Population to Change Significantly by 2036, Experts Predict**
According to a VCIOM project, 'Future Congress -- 2036. Demography', the Russian population is expected to change significantly by 2036. Analysts predict an increase in the number of women of reproductive age, advancements in fertility technologies, and a rise in the participation of migrants in the process. Experts also expect an influx of people moving to Russia for education, work, or shared values. The proportion of elderly people in the population is expected to increase, particularly among those born in the 1970s and 1980s. VCIOM analysts believe that with stable state support, fertility rates can increase by 15% compared to current levels, requiring an annual allocation of around 1% of the federal budget for demographic programs. The experts suggest that the best scenario would be to encourage early motherhood from 20 years old, support families with three or more children, and develop active longevity. This would allow maintaining a fertility rate of 250-280 children per 100 women for many years. A previous VCIOM study found that family remains the top value for Russians, with an increasing number of people considering a multi-child family ideal. According to the data, half of the respondents support families with three or more children, while 40% consider three children optimal, 8% prefer four to five children, and 2% even six or more children. Only 5% and 2% of respondents support families without children or with one child, respectively.

**The Fertility of Immigrants and Natives in the United States, 2023**
According to a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, the overall total fertility rate (TFR) in the United States in 2023 was 1.8 children, with immigrants having a TFR of 2.19 and U.S.-born having a TFR of 1.73. The presence of immigrants raised the nation's overall TFR by about 0.08 children or 4.5 percent. However, the report also found that immigration's ability to increase fertility is limited by the relatively low fertility of every major racial group among the U.S.-born. The report also notes that immigration does increase births per thousand for the entire U.S. population, but the impact is still quite small, with a 6.6 percent increase from 11.2 births per thousand without immigrants to 11.9 births per thousand with immigrants. Additionally, the report found a negative correlation between the immigrant share of the population and the fertility rate of U.S.-born women in the nation's largest metropolitan areas, suggesting that immigration may reduce the fertility of the U.S.-born. The report also discusses the possible reasons why immigration may lower the fertility of the U.S.-born, including driving up housing costs, lowering wages, and straining public services. 'The long-term decline in fertility has been more pronounced for the foreign-born than the U.S.-born since 2008,' said the report. 'Though there was a modest post-Covid uptick in birth rates in 2021 and 2022, this increase had largely abated by 2023.'

**Russia's Birth Rate: A Concern and a Call for Action**
Russia's birth rate has been a concern, with a total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.4 children per woman in 2024, according to Vice-Premier Tatyana Golikova. President Vladimir Putin has set a goal to increase the TFR to 2.3 by 2030. However, instead of implementing effective measures, the government has proposed various unproven and sometimes absurd solutions, such as paying women to wear short skirts or banning the word 'bride'. In contrast, professional demographers have identified proven methods to increase the birth rate, including providing large, one-time payments to families for each additional child, developing a system of accessible childcare, and ensuring that mothers have time for rest and self-realization. According to demographer Alexei Raksha, the key to success is to provide families with financial support, particularly for the second and third child, and to make it easier for mothers to balance work and family life. Raksha estimates that the government would need to spend around 1.02-1.38 trillion rubles per year to achieve the desired results. He also suggests that the government should learn from successful examples in other regions, such as the Nizhny Novgorod region, which has promised to pay families 1 million rubles for each child born after 2025, and the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, which has implemented a successful program of cash payments for families with multiple children.

Russia has started to offer incentives to pregnant high school students, with some regions offering up to 67,500 lira (150,000 rubles) in support. According to Rosstat, Russia's total fertility rate (TFR) has hit a record low of 1.41 children per woman in 2024, down from 1.47 in 2021. This decline is the fastest trend since the dramatic drop in the 1990s, and is deepening Russia's demographic crisis. As one commentator noted, 'In this strange age, we're starting to lose our ability to be shocked by the absurd things that happen in countries.'

Russian Vice-Premier Tatyana Golikova reported that the country's total fertility rate in 2024 is preliminarily estimated at 1.4, showing a slight decrease compared to 2023. 'According to preliminary results for 2024, we see that the total fertility rate has almost remained the same as in 2023, staying at 1.4', she said. However, 18 regions have seen an increase in birth rates, including some in Central Russia and the North-West. Golikova also noted that the trend of an increase in the number of third and subsequent children in 2024 remains, with a 1.1% growth compared to 2023. In 2023, the total fertility rate was 1.41. Golikova also mentioned that infant mortality rates have decreased, with preliminary data showing it will not exceed 4 per 1,000 births. 'We see our achievements in reducing infant mortality. We don't have final data yet, but preliminary data shows that infant mortality will not exceed 4 per 1,000 births. This is a good indicator', she said.

**Russia's Natural Population Decline Increases by 20.4% in 2024**
According to Rosstat, natural population decline increased by 20.4% in 2024, reaching 596,200 people, compared to 495,200 in 2023. The number of births decreased by 3.4% to 1.222 million, while the number of deaths increased by 3.3% to 1.818 million. First Deputy Minister of Health Viktor Fisenko stated that the absolute number of births in Russia has approached the 2000 level, which was one of the lowest in modern Russian history. He attributed this to the reduction in the number of women of reproductive age and a decrease in 'fertility intensity'. Fisenko expects an increase in fertility intensity after 2027. Experts from the Institute of Social Analysis and Forecasting predicted a rise in birth rates in Russia by 2035, citing the entry of women born in 2010 and later into the reproductive age group. They forecast that the number of women aged 24-26 will increase from around 2 million to nearly 3 million by 2035-2045. The authorities plan to include the total fertility rate (TFR) indicator in the assessment of the effectiveness of governors' work, as reported by Forbes.ru. The TFR characterizes the average number of children that one woman can have from 15 to 49 years old, maintaining the level of fertility of the period for which it is calculated.

**Russia's Natural Population Decline Increases by 20% in 2024**
According to Rosstat, the natural population decline in Russia in 2024 increased by 20% to 596,200 people. The number of births decreased, while the number of deaths increased. The natural population decline is the difference between the number of deaths and the number of births. The number of births in 2024 was 1.222 million, which is 3.4% lower than the result in 2023 (1.265 million). The lowest birth rate was recorded in 1999, when the number of newborns fell to 1.215 million. Deputy Minister of Health Viktor Fisenko said in January that, according to Rosstat's forecasts, the increase in the intensity of childbirth will occur rapidly after 2027, and after 2030, there should be an increase in the absolute number of births due to an increase in the number of women of reproductive age. The largest decline in birth rates in 2024 occurred in the Jewish Autonomous Region (minus 16%), Kalmykia (minus 12%), Altai (minus 10%), and Belgorod Region (minus 8%). The birth rate (number of births per 1,000 people) decreased in 2024 to 8.4 from 8.7 in 2023. The number of deaths in 2024 increased by 3.3% to 1.82 million, according to Rosstat. The number of marriages in 2024 decreased by 7% to 880,000, and the number of divorces decreased by 5.7% to 644,000.

**Low Fertility Rates: A Threat to Russia's Population**
According to the UN, global fertility rates have reached a historic low, with an average of 2.2 births per woman in 2023. In Russia, the fertility rate was 1.41 in 2023 and is expected to drop to 1.32 in 2024. Experts warn that if fertility rates remain below 1.4 for decades, it will lead to a rapid decline in population and significant aging. Vera Nikišina, director of the Institute of Clinical Psychology and Social Work, notes that many young people are not planning to have children, with 70% of those aged 18-25 not having reproductive plans. When asked if they plan to have children, over half of respondents replied, 'Yes, but someday later', when they expect to have a stable career and a comfortable life.
