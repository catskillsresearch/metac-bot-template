**Grant Cardone Says Jerome Powell Is 'Antagonistic To Trump Administration,' Claims He Might Be Trying To Block Trump's Pro-Business Agenda**
Grant Cardone has criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of being 'antagonistic to the Trump administration' and potentially trying to block the president's pro-business agenda. Cardone argued that Powell's interest rate decisions are 'always reactionary, never proactive' and that the U.S. has 'some of the most expensive debt amongst developed nations.' He also suggested that Powell's reluctance to lower rates might be politically motivated, aiming to create economic headwinds for Trump. Cardone warned that Powell's approach could put the U.S. economy at risk, particularly those facing high debt costs, and threaten Trump's broader economic agenda.

**Trump Administration Fires US Copyright Office Director Shira Perlmutter**
The administration of US President Donald Trump has dismissed Shira Perlmutter, the director of the US Copyright Office, just days after firing the Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden. According to a statement from the office, Perlmutter received an email from the White House on Saturday informing her that her work as a copyright registrar and director of the US Copyright Office had been terminated 'effective immediately'. This move comes as part of the White House's continued purge of those seen as opposing the president and his agenda. Hayden had appointed Perlmutter to lead the Copyright Office in October 2020. Trump has also announced that he will not fire Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, before his term ends in May 2026, but has described him as 'completely inflexible', reiterating his call for interest rate cuts. The White House has not commented on a request for comment today. Democrats have condemned the firing of Perlmutter. Representative Joe Morelle of New York, a leading Democrat on the House Administration Committee, said that 'the Trump administration's termination of Shira Perlmutter's work as a copyright registrar is an unprecedented power grab without any legal basis'.

**Trump and Powell: A Tense Relationship**
The tension between US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has escalated. Trump has been urging Powell to lower interest rates to mitigate the effects of the tariffs he has imposed. Powell has stated that there is 'a high level of uncertainty' surrounding the impact of the tariffs and that the Fed prefers not to move its rates for now. Trump has responded by calling Powell an 'idiot' and saying that he is 'always late' but that it won't matter because the US is 'very strong'. Powell has maintained that the repeated criticism from Trump does not affect his work. Trump has also threatened to fire Powell, but this would require a long and complex process. Powell has stated that he intends to remain in office until the end of his term in 2026, and that the independence of the Fed is guaranteed by law.

**Trump Criticizes Powell for Not Lowering Interest Rates**
Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, is facing criticism for not lowering interest rates despite the economic challenges. Some economists believe that Powell has a strong chance of being labeled as 'too late' due to the Fed's history of being slow to act. However, others argue that Powell is doing the right thing by not taking any action, given the uncertainty surrounding the economy. President Trump has been criticizing the Fed for not lowering interest rates, but Powell has refused to make any 'preemptive' cuts. The data does not show any significant inflation or economic slowdown, but the surveys indicate growing concerns in the manufacturing and services sectors, as well as a decline in consumer sentiment. Experts believe that the Fed is likely to be slow to act and may repeat past mistakes. Joseph LaVernia, a former economic advisor to Trump, said that the Fed is 'already late' in considering a rate cut, and that they are not looking far enough ahead. Krishna Guha, a global policy and central banking strategist at Evercore ISI, said that Powell has given two reasons for not acting: 'there is no real cost to waiting' and 'we are not sure what to do'. Powell has a history of being slow to act, and some experts believe that he may repeat past mistakes.

Grant Cardone, CEO of Cardone Capital, has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of being 'antagonistic to the Trump administration' and potentially trying to block the president's pro-business agenda. Cardone claims that Powell's approach is 'always reactionary, never proactive' and that tons of economic data support immediate rate cuts. He points to signs such as a slowdown in U.S. GDP, weak home sales, and a global economic downturn. Cardone also suggests that Powell's reluctance to lower rates might be politically motivated, saying that Powell 'appears antagonistic to Trump Administration and Trump's goal to renegotiate international deals via tariffs.'

**Trump Calls Powell 'Stupid' for Not Lowering Interest Rates**
US President Donald Trump has renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him 'stupid' and complaining that the central bank refuses to lower interest rates. Trump has been criticizing Powell for weeks, threatening to fire him and calling him a 'big loser' on social media. Trump stated that lowering interest rates would be like fuel for airplanes for the economy, but he doesn't want to do it. He also claimed that Powell 'doesn't love me.' The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, as expected by the markets.

**Fed Chairman Powell: Trade Policies' Impact Exceeds Expectations, Risks to Economy Rise**
Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, stated that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate target range at 4.25% to 4.50% as expected by the market. Powell emphasized that monetary policy adjustments will be based on economic data and will not be influenced by any political pressure. He refused to comment on President Trump's repeated threats to remove him from office. Powell noted that while inflation has eased recently, it is still slightly above the Fed's 2% target, and the unemployment rate has risen slightly. He warned that the impact of recent US trade policies has exceeded expectations and may further push up prices and suppress employment if the current trade policies remain unchanged. Powell also stated that short-term inflation expectations have risen, but long-term expectations remain stable and are not significantly deviating from the policy target. However, he acknowledged that there is still uncertainty about whether long-term inflation can be avoided, which depends on the scale, duration, and market expectations of the trade policies.

**Trump's Attitude Shift: No Plans to Fire Fed Chairman Powell Before Term Ends**
US President Trump has been putting pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, repeatedly asking for a rate cut and publicly criticizing Powell's performance, claiming that he knows more about interest rates than Powell. However, in a recent interview, Trump changed his tone, stating that he will not remove Powell from office before his term ends. Trump had previously threatened to fire Powell, but now says, 'Why would I do that? I'd have to nominate someone else right away.' Powell's current term will end on May 31, 2026. Despite his change of heart, Trump still complained about Powell, saying that he is 'not a Trump fan' and 'a very rigid person.'

**Trump Says He Won't Remove Fed Chair Powell, Says Good Parts Of Economy Are His Doing**
US President Donald Trump stated that he will not remove Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Board chairman before his term ends in 2026, describing Powell as 'a total stiff' and calling for the Fed to lower interest rates. Trump attributed a first-quarter contraction in the US economy to former President Joe Biden's policies and claimed that his own moves to upend the global trading system with higher tariffs would eventually make Americans rich. Trump also sent mixed messages on the economy, dismissing concerns about a first-quarter decline in GDP and arguing that his predecessor was to blame for any economic weakness. Trump's whipsaw moves on tariffs have sparked the most volatile weeks on Wall Street since the early part of the COVID pandemic five years ago. Trump said, 'It partially is right now. And I really mean this. I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because he's done a terrible job.' He also declined to rule out making some of the tariffs permanent, saying, 'No, I wouldn't do that because if somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?'

**Trump Rules Out Firing Powell Before Term Ends**
US President Trump stated that he will not fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before his term ends in 2026, and once again called for the US central bank to lower interest rates. In an interview with NBC's 'Meet the Press with Kristen Welker' on Sunday, Trump said that Powell is not his fan, but he expects the Fed to lower interest rates at some point. Trump said, 'Yes, he should lower interest rates. At some point, he will. He doesn't want to because he's not a fan of mine. You know, he just doesn't like me because I think he's a stiff person.' When asked if he would fire Powell before his term ends in 2026, Trump made a clear denial, saying, 'No, no, no. Why would I do that? I can just replace him in a short time.' Trump's comments on Sunday's show are the clearest indication yet that he will allow Powell to continue serving. Last month, Trump doubled down on his criticism of Powell and warned that he might let the Fed chief go early, as he wants the central bank to lower interest rates to ease pressure on the US economy, but Powell has largely refused Trump's request.

**Trump Backtracks on Threat to Fire Powell Before Term Ends**
US President Donald Trump has announced that he will not fire Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, before his term ends in 2026. Trump described Powell as 'very rigid' and repeated his call for him to lower interest rates. Trump said, 'I'm not impressed by him, and he should lower interest rates. He will do it at some point. He prefers not to because he's not impressed by me, and he's simply not a fan of mine because I think he's very rigid.' Powell's term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve has been marked by controversy, particularly after Trump's criticism of his handling of inflation and interest rates. Trump has repeatedly called for Powell to resign, and his comments have caused concern about the independence of the Federal Reserve and the stability of the markets. However, Trump's latest comments suggest that he will keep Powell in his position, which may calm the markets that have been affected by Trump's trade policies. Trump has imposed tariffs on several countries, including China, and has threatened to make them permanent. However, he has also acknowledged that he is willing to negotiate with China and other countries to reach a fair trade agreement.

He also claimed that Powell is not a fan of his and that he prefers not to reduce interest rates because of this. Trump's previous statements indicating his intention to fire Powell had a negative impact on global markets and led to a decline in Wall Street stocks. However, he later toned down his rhetoric, and the main indices of the New York stock exchanges operated in an upward trend. Trump also downplayed concerns about potential economic problems, stating that everything would be 'OK' in the long term, even if the US economy suffers a recession in the short term.

**Trump Denies Plans to Remove Federal Reserve Chairman Powell**
US President Trump stated in a recent NBC interview that he does not intend to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Powell, citing that his term is almost over. Trump emphasized that there is 'a very short period of time' left in Powell's term. He questioned why he would remove Powell, saying 'Why would I do that when I can appoint a new chairman in a short period of time?' Trump claimed that the Federal Reserve's refusal to lower interest rates is due to Powell's dislike for him, stating 'I think he's a very rigid person, and I don't think he likes me.' Trump has repeatedly called for an early interest rate cut, but Powell and other high-ranking officials at the Federal Reserve have been cautious about making a move, citing the risk of inflation caused by the Trump administration's large-scale tariff policy. Trump has expressed his frustration with the Federal Reserve's refusal to lower interest rates, posting on social media on April 17 that 'we should fire Powell immediately.' However, he later retracted his statement on April 22, saying 'I don't intend to fire him.'

**France Warns of Economic Disorder in US if Trump Fires Fed Chairman**
French Finance Minister Eric Lombard warned that Donald Trump's threat to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will further erode investor confidence in the US, leading to 'deep disorder in the country's economy'. Lombard stated, 'The trust will be damaged even more, considering the development on the bond market.' He added that the US will face increased expenses on debt servicing and 'deep disorder in the economy'. Lombard also expressed concerns about the 10% tariff imposed by the US on EU countries, saying it poses 'serious risks to global trade'. He called on European companies to show 'patriotism' and cooperate with their governments to avoid losing in the tariff war. Meanwhile, sources close to the White House revealed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has privately warned the administration about the potential destabilization of financial markets if Powell is fired. 'I don't think he'll do it, but, honestly, it's a grenade with the pin pulled out,' said the source. Powell's term expires in a year, and the White House is seeking a Supreme Court ruling to allow the president to fire independent agency heads.

Prior to this, some high-ranking White House officials had seriously considered Trump's public suggestion to fire Powell. Sources revealed that White House lawyers had privately reviewed the legal options for firing Powell, including whether there was a 'good reason' to do so. Firing Powell could escalate tensions between the White House and the Federal Reserve. The law states that Fed governors can only be removed from office before their term ends for just cause, which is typically defined as misconduct or dereliction of duty. Bessent and Lutnick reportedly told Trump that firing Powell would not lead to any actual change in interest rates, as other governors would likely adopt similar monetary policies. Most analysts believe that attempting to fire Powell before his term ends would not give Trump the lower interest rates he wants, as all 12 FOMC members supported keeping rates unchanged last time. Tariffs have also caught Fed officials off guard, as they fear tariffs will drive up prices and bring new inflation risks, even if tariffs later suppress spending and hiring, thereby weakening the economy.

**Trump Discusses Firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell**
According to the Wall Street Journal, US President Donald Trump has been discussing the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for several months, but has not yet made a final decision. Trump has held several meetings at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida, where he discussed the idea of firing Powell and replacing him with former Federal Reserve member Kevin Warsh. However, Warsh advised Trump against taking this step, emphasizing the need to allow Powell to complete his term without interference. The discussions continued until February, and Trump's close associates continued to raise the idea with him until early March. In a report, the Wall Street Journal stated that Trump mentioned during a meeting in the Oval Office that he has great confidence in his ability to fire Powell quickly if he decides to, saying, 'If I want to get rid of him, it will happen quickly, believe me.' He added that he is 'not satisfied' with Powell's policies and believes that the latter is 'manipulating' interest rate decisions. The Wall Street Journal believes that any attempt by Trump to fire Powell would face significant legal challenges, potentially leading to a Supreme Court case, which could put the potential successor under legal scrutiny and raise concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve. The newspaper noted that this issue does not have internal consensus within Trump's team, with Treasury Secretary Scott Mnuchin opposing the idea, warning that the consequences would be greater than any expected gains, and describing the independence of the Federal Reserve as a 'treasure box' that should be preserved without interference. The Wall Street Journal also reported that the US administration plans to begin interviewing candidates to succeed Powell in the fall, about 6 months before his term ends, following Warsh's actual presentation to take over the position after Powell's term ends, reflecting the seriousness with which the administration is treating this file. Despite the warnings, Trump continues to promote the idea of firing Powell, emphasizing that the legal provision requiring 'good cause' for the removal of Federal Reserve officials can be overturned in court, where the Wall Street Journal sees the issue as raising unprecedented legal questions, as no Federal Reserve chairman has been removed before the end of their term, leaving the door open for further controversy over this issue. In a previous statement, Trump acknowledged in October that he was thinking of firing Powell during his first term, but wondered, 'Can we actually do that?' The newspaper also reported that Trump is seeking to fire some of Biden's appointees, based on a 1935 law precedent known as 'the Humphrey Executor Act,' which protects federal agency officials from unlawful removal. On the other hand, the Department of Justice is seeking to repeal this legal precedent, which is considered a basis for protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve, and officials in the White House are closely monitoring the potential position of the Supreme Court on this issue, which is expected to affect the case of Powell's removal directly. In a previous comment earlier in the week, Powell said he does not believe that a legal challenge to the removal of a member of the National Labor Relations Board would affect the Federal Reserve, citing that the Supreme Court has protected the independence of the institution even if it overturned the previous historic ruling, adding that he will appeal to the courts in any attempt to remove him, a position that has not changed to this day. If any attempt to remove Powell were to be made, the Wall Street Journal notes that the Federal Open Market Committee would stand by him, which could complicate any attempt to remove him, as the committee consists of 7 governors in addition to the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks, meaning that any attempt to remove him would face complex legal obstacles that could take a long time to resolve.
