**TRADING DAY-Selloff on nervy hold**
Global markets experienced a relative calm on Thursday, despite the recent selling across markets fueled by weakness in long-dated government debt. Investors drew breath from the recent selling and pushed up stocks, the dollar, and bond prices. However, Wall Street's rebound lacked conviction and fizzled out, pointing to a lackluster open on Friday. The dollar has lost 5% of its value against a basket of major currencies since Trump's tariff 'Liberation Day' on April 2, and has fallen 10% since mid-January. Some investors are reassessing their exposure to dollar-denominated assets due to the economic and policy uncertainty caused by Trump's trade war and its chaotic implementation. The U.S.-China tariff truce expires on July 9, and Trump's tax-cut bill may not be finally approved until the July 4 recess. The dollar's longer-term direction may be lower, but a pause or correction may be warranted in the near term.

**Howard Lutnick says Trump's tariffs won't raise prices**
Howard Lutnick, a former Wall Street CEO and billionaire, believes that the US will make trade deals with most of its top 18 trading partners by the middle of the summer. He stated, 'I think most countries, we'll have an idea of what we want to do with them.' Lutnick, who has taken a leading role in the Trump White House's attempt to redraw the rules of international trade, rejected 'silly arguments' that tariffs raise prices. However, Walmart has announced that it will increase its prices due to the tariffs, and several other companies, including Nike, have suggested that they may follow suit. Trump has argued that the tariffs will boost American manufacturing and bring in billions of dollars, but retail executives expect cost pressures to increase and consumers will feel more price rises by the end of June or early July.

**Wall Street and Main Street are split on Trump's chaos**
The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which measures Main Street's nerves, has reached its highest monthly level in 35 years, with 1,000 local newspapers reporting on economic uncertainty. However, Wall Street has calmed down, with the VIX index, a fear gauge, hitting only its 24th-highest monthly level in the past 35 years. This split is odd given Donald Trump's words, where he claims to be 'proud to be the president for the workers, not the outsourcers -- the president who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street.' Nicholas Bloom of Stanford notes that last time round, Wall Street got it right, with Trump being 'all bark and no bite.' It remains to be seen if this pattern will repeat itself. Meanwhile, local newspapers have been affected by Trump's policies, with one paper in New York state closing due to proposed tariffs on Canada raising the cost of newsprint.

**Trans-Pacific Cargo Space Vanishing Fast Ahead of Tariff Deadlines**
Retailers and importers are scrambling to secure ocean freight space ahead of two tariff deadlines in July and August, and new expected surcharges. Logistics services provider Seko Logistics is advising customers to book space as soon as possible, as the traditional peak shipping season is being pulled forward. According to Frank Wiltgen, senior vice president at freight forwarder American Shipping Company, 'with limited capacity at this time, the talk has changed from the tariffs to space.' Wiltgen added, 'It is likely at this stage, reading this news flash, that all new bookings from this point forward are for June vessel sailings.' Importers are now ramping up orders to get out in front of costs added by the new surcharges and rate increases, with some carriers starting to cancel bookings in favor of higher-revenue cargo or higher-priority clients. The congestion in the market has started to become more of a concern, with vessels waiting up to 72 hours to berth at ports in China and Europe.

**Home Depot doesn't plan to raise prices due to tariffs. Some items will just disappear.**
Home Depot executives stated that they do not plan to raise prices broadly due to new tariffs, but some product options may disappear from store shelves if extra import costs make them not worth it. According to Billy Bastek, Home Depot's merchandising chief, 'We don't see broad-based price increases for our customers at all going forward.' However, some individual prices may increase, and some products may be discontinued: 'There's items that we have that could potentially be impacted from a tariff that, candidly, we won’t have going forward,' Bastek said. 'There’ll be some things that don’t make sense that just end up going away.' Home Depot's advantageous position in the retail world, with a massive market share and ability to source more than half of its items from the U.S., allows it to absorb tariff costs. The company expects to purchase no more than 10% of its products from any single foreign country by mid-2026. Home Depot hopes its steady prices will help it attract shoppers from other retailers.

**Wall Street Opens Lower Amid Bond Market Tensions and Tariff Uncertainty**
The New York Stock Exchange opened lower on Wednesday due to ongoing tensions in the bond market, a budget impasse, concerns over debt, and uncertainty over US tariffs. The Dow Jones index fell 365.24 points, or 0.86%, to 42,312.00 points. The S&P 500, the largest index, dropped 38.53 points, or 0.65%, to 5,901.93 points. The Nasdaq Composite lost 137.25 points, or 0.72%, to 19,005.46 points. Several Federal Reserve officials have stated that they expect tariffs to lead to higher prices, while the White House downplays this risk. Donald Trump's plan to reduce the US budget deficit has been met with resistance from Republicans, with analysts estimating that his plan could add between $3,000 and $5,000 billion to the US debt. Daniel Bergvall, head of economic forecasts at SEB, noted, 'When tariffs and uncertainty reduce growth, other questions also arise about how the US federal deficit will be affected by the economy.' This uncertainty has led to a rise in bond yields, with the 10-year US bond increasing by 6.2 basis points to 4.5426%. In the stock market, the retail sector (-1.24%) is suffering, with Target falling 5.26% after lowering its annual sales forecast due to declining consumer confidence and discretionary spending in the face of trade tensions. TJX, a discount retailer, lost 1.67% after its annual forecast, while Lowe's was just flat despite announcing a less severe decline in comparable sales for the first quarter. Unitedhealth plummeted 5.22% after reports that the healthcare conglomerate secretly paid nursing homes to reduce transfers of sick residents to hospitals.

**India seeks 'full exemption' from 26% tariff in trade deal with US**
India and the US are close to announcing an interim trade agreement before July 8, with India seeking full exemption from the additional 26% tariff on domestic goods. The US imposed the tariff on April 2, but suspended it for 90 days till July 9. Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal met with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to give an impetus to the trade talks. 'Talks are moving positively,' said an official, adding that India is seeking concessions for its labour-intensive sectors such as textiles and leather. India is looking to more than double bilateral trade to USD 500 billion by 2030. The US has suspended the additional 26% tariffs on India till July 9, and officials are looking to take advantage of the 90-day tariff pause window to advance the talks.

**Adam Smith Cannot Win Tariff War Without Capital**
The Wall Street Journal editors have made a mistake in declaring the Trump Administration's trade war against Adam Smith a loss. For Adam Smith to truly triumph, free trade in capital must accompany free trade in goods. The Wall Street editors are also mistaken in describing economic warriors in Washington as battling Adam Smith, as they may find common ground against foreign repressors and manipulators, particularly China and the EU. The author argues that the America First warriors should focus on the capital culprits behind the current trade malaises, specifically China and the euro-zone, which have large current account surpluses due to systemic currency manipulation and financial repression. The author suggests that Washington should press for reforms in China, including alleviating financial repression, lifting exchange controls, and making the pension industry more efficient. Similarly, the author argues that the EU's high savings surplus is due to financial repression and the deeply ailing European Monetary System, and that Washington should focus on capital flows rather than just trade in goods markets.

**Electricity Tariffs for Population to Increase by 12.6% from July 1, 2025**
According to the State Duma, electricity tariffs for the population will increase by 12.6% from July 1, 2025, and by 9.3% from July 1, 2026. First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Construction and Housing and Communal Services, V. Koshelov, reminded that the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia predicts that the growth of electricity tariffs for the population will be 6.9% from July 1, 2027, and 4.9% from July 1, 2028. The increase in prices is expected due to the increase in investments in the construction of new generation and the growth of the transmission tariff. The indexation of tariffs for electricity for the population from July 1, 2025, is set at 12.6% to the level of September 1, 2024, and from July 1, 2026, it is 5.2%. However, the forecast for 2026 and subsequent years was revised upwards. The indexation of tariffs for housing and communal services from July 1, 2025, will be 11.9%, and from July 1, 2026, it will be 5.4%. However, the forecast for 2026 and subsequent years was revised upwards. V. Koshelov also spoke about the work on consolidating territorial network organizations (TNOs). He said that in 2022, according to the data of the Ministry of Energy of Russia, 54% of the 1683 registered TNOs did not have investment programs for development, many TNOs did not meet the requirements for the reliability of energy supply, but received high tariff revenue from their consumers. Therefore, it was decided to reduce the number of TNOs and determine clear criteria for their compliance, including the number of personnel, equipment, and the ability to quickly eliminate emergencies, as well as the length of the networks and the transformer capacity of the equipment. Today, there are 619 TNOs that have the right to receive a tariff, control over TNOs will be strengthened, and from January 1, 2025, system-forming territorial network organizations (STNOs) will be determined in the subjects of the Russian Federation, which will participate in the consideration of all investment programs of network companies in their regions and will perform the functions of a single window for paying services for electricity transmission.

**Fuegian Industry Threatened by National Government Decrees**
The National Government has published Decrees 333/2025 and 334/2025, which threaten the Fuegian industry protected by Law 19.640. According to Martín Pérez, 'the tariff, absolutely moderate and rational at 16% that protects our industry, disappears, and thousands of Fuegian jobs are at risk. Nobody was lied to as much as Tierra del Fuego by the libertarian government.' Pérez warned that this decision puts not only the productive structure, but also the social stability of the province at risk, whose economy relies heavily on the electronic industry, historically protected by a special regime with tax and customs benefits. 'After the October elections, the offensive against our province will be worse.'

**Trump’s tariff chaos rattles markets — and conservative media is split - Poynter**
The stock market has been experiencing significant volatility due to Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff policies. The Wall Street Journal, a conservative publication owned by Rupert Murdoch, has criticized Trump's trade policies as 'reckless' and called for a policy reversal. Meanwhile, Trump supporters are trying to explain or dismiss concerns about his policies, which is a departure from their previous criticism of Joe Biden's administration. The article also mentions a legal battle between Newsmax and Dominion Voting Systems, with a judge ruling that Newsmax made defamatory statements about Dominion. Additionally, the article touches on various media news and tidbits, including a defamation retrial between Sarah Palin and the New York Times, and a new editor-in-chief at The Advocate.

**Trump Spotted Reading New York Post on Tariff Policy**
During a recent visit to the Trump National Golf Club in Florida, President Trump was photographed reading a newspaper while driving. According to the Associated Press, Trump was reading the New York Post, a tabloid newspaper, specifically the four-page special feature on his tariff policy. The article discussed the pros and cons of the policy, noting that it may lead to increased employment in the US and Japan as major automakers move their production bases to the country. However, it also warned that tariffs imposed on Asian countries could lead to price increases for products such as yoga wear. The article also mentioned China's potential retaliatory tariffs and the concerns of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell regarding inflation and slowing growth. Trump has been known to favor conservative media outlets, and the New York Post is often seen as a more populist alternative to liberal-leaning newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post. Trump has previously expressed his admiration for the New York Post on social media and has even displayed a large front-page image of the newspaper on the wall of his Oval Office. Additionally, the Associated Press reports that Trump was also seen reading the Wall Street Journal while driving on the same day.

**How Trump’s Tariff Brinksmanship Could Still Pummel NYC’s Economy**
President Donald Trump's tariff brinksmanship could still pummel New York City's economy, despite a 90-day pause in the latest round of reciprocal tariffs. Experts warn that higher prices, even from earlier tariffs and the 125% levy still in place for China, will strain budgets, especially for less well-off New Yorkers. Emily Eisner, chief economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, said, 'This is going to be a bad year, and that’s going to take a hit on the economy and the revenue that is going to be raised from income taxes.' Businesses are worried, with 90% of those responding to a Manhattan Chamber survey expressing concern about the tariffs. The damage on Wall Street is clear, with major stock market indexes down 20% and mergers and acquisition activity falling sharply. The New York City Tourism + Conventions agency is revising its 2025 forecast downward, and the first signs of the impact of tariffs might come in May, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics releasing the consumer price index. The state and city will report personal income tax collections for the April to June period in July, which will signal how much damage has been done to Wall Street.

**Murdoch's Paper: Trump Just Made the Swamp So Much Bigger**
The Wall Street Journal's editorial board criticized President Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs, stating that they will be a windfall for Beltway lobbyists. The tariffs, which include a 10% baseline import tax and additional duties ranging from 20 to 34% on products from about 60 countries, will likely be passed along to consumers. Companies will seek exemptions to avoid these costs, which the Journal warns will be used as a way to leverage campaign contributions from businesses. The editorial board wrote, 'Mr. Trump is saying there will be no tariff exemptions. But watch that promise vanish as politicians, including Mr. Trump, see exemptions as a way to leverage campaign contributions from business. Liberation Day is Buy Another Yacht Day for the swamp,' implying that the tariffs will only benefit the Washington, D.C. swamp, not the American people.

**Wall Street Journal Flags 4 Words From Donald Trump That Could Now Haunt The GOP**
The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has flagged four words from Donald Trump that could haunt the GOP in the 2026 midterm elections. Trump's recent remark, 'I couldn't care less' about the impact of his 25% tariffs on American consumers, could be used against Republicans. The Journal's conservative board slammed Trump's 'ideological fixation' on tariffs, noting that even he has acknowledged they will cause short-term pain for Americans. The newspaper predicted that Trump's comments will be used in Democratic campaign ads next year, linking Republicans in Congress to Mr. Trump and his comments.

**Wall Street rallies as Trump set to take more targeted approach on...**
Markets rallied on Monday as reports suggested that President Donald Trump's tariffs on April 2 may be more targeted than initially anticipated. According to Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, the tariffs may not include industry-specific levies, and may not be as wide-ranging as originally reported. This welcome news for Wall Street saw the S&P 500 rise 1.7%, the Dow jump 1.4%, and the Nasdaq 100 rise 2%. Trump's administration is focused on applying reciprocal tariffs to the 'dirty 15' - about 15% of nations designated as particular trade abusers. The exact countries included in this list are unclear, but it will likely include nations like Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and more. Trump boasted that his planned tariffs will bring in 'tens of billions' of dollars, and argued that they will help bring manufacturing back to the US and pressure neighboring countries to tamp down on illegal border crossings and fentanyl trafficking.

**WSJ: Trump's Tariff Plan is 'The Dumbest Trade War in History'**
The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has described the tariff imposed by US President Donald Trump on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China as 'the dumbest trade war in history'. The article states that the tariff will negatively affect various sectors, from automotive to agriculture. According to the WSJ, the reason given for the tariff was to prevent the flow of narcotics and increase national security, but it was noted that the problem of drug trafficking in the US is not new. Trump has responded to the WSJ's article by calling it 'Fake News Wall Street Journal' on his Truth Social account, suggesting that those who support the US are in favor of the tariffs, while those who oppose them are controlled by China or certain companies. Trump's tariff plan aims to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on imports from China. The tariffs are set to take effect on February 4, 2025, at midnight US time.

**Trump's Tariffs: A Recipe for Disaster**
The Wall Street Journal has called Trump's trade war 'the dumbest economic war in history'. The editorial board argues that Trump's reasons for imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada do not make sense. The tariffs are unlikely to address issues such as drug smuggling and illegal immigration, and the trade deficit could be addressed through other means. The tariffs are also expected to increase prices for consumers, with the Tax Foundation estimating that households will have to pay an additional $830 in 2025. The Foundation also predicts that the tariffs will shrink the US GDP by 0.4% and lead to the loss of 350,000 jobs. Trump's trade policy is seen as a way to dismantle the international trade and security structure, as outlined in the 'Project 2025' plan. This plan, developed by the Heritage Foundation, aims to transform the US and American society according to extreme right-wing conservative ideals. The plan's architect, Peter Navarro, has been widely criticized for his economic ideas, which have been rejected by economists across the political spectrum. Navarro's idea that tariffs will be paid by China is 'an unwarranted truth' that has been repeated by Trump. The New York Times concludes that tariffs are not a means to an end for Trump, but the end itself, and that he wants to raise money, even if it means that his own citizens will have to pay for it.

**Trump's Tariffs: A Recipe for Economic Disaster**
The Wall Street Journal has called Trump's trade war 'the dumbest economic war in history'. The editorial board of the newspaper argues that Trump's reasons for imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada do not make sense. The tariffs are intended to combat drug smuggling and illegal immigration, but this cannot be achieved through tariffs. The trade deficit could be addressed through other means, and protectionism is not an effective solution. Economists and industry leaders warn that the prices of meat, fruits, and vegetables will rise due to the tariffs, with the Tax Foundation estimating that households will have to pay an additional $830 per year. The Foundation also predicts that the tariffs will lead to a 0.4% decline in GDP and the loss of 350,000 jobs. Trump's trade policy is seen as a way to dismantle the international trade and security structure, as stated in the 'Project 2025' plan, which aims to transform the US and American society according to extreme right-wing conservative ideals. Economists have debunked this plan, pointing out that tariffs are ultimately paid by consumers. The New York Times concludes that tariffs are not a means to an end for Trump, but rather the end itself, and that he wants to raise revenue, even if it means that his own citizens will have to pay for it.
