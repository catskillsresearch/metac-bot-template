**Russia's proposals call for elections in Ukraine, followed by peace treaty signing**
Russia's proposals for resolving the Ukrainian crisis include holding elections in Ukraine, followed by the signing of a peace treaty. According to the Russian memorandum, the sequence of steps is as follows: a 30-day ceasefire, elections, and the formation of governing bodies in Ukraine, and finally, the signing of the treaty. The peace treaty must be approved by a 'legally binding resolution of the United Nations Security Council' before it can be ratified and implemented. As stated in the document, 'the signing of a Memorandum on the ceasefire with specific dates for the implementation of all its provisions and the determination of the date for the signing of the future Treaty on the final settlement' is to be done immediately after Russia transfers 6,000 bodies of deceased military personnel to the Ukrainian side.

**SPD to Adopt New Program by 2027 Ahead of 2029 Federal Election**
The SPD plans to adopt a new basic program by 2027, ahead of the 2029 federal election. After the party's historic defeat in February, 'nothing can remain as it is', said Tim Klüssendorf, the designated general secretary, in Berlin. The SPD must rephrase its core values of freedom, justice, and solidarity and thus re-deal the cards. The process will be initiated at the party conference at the end of June. By 2027, the new party program should not only serve as the foundation for daily work but also for the election program for the 2029 federal election, according to Klüssendorf.

**India-EU free trade pact could be concluded before year end: Piyush Goyal**
Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal stated that negotiations for the proposed comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union (EU) are progressing rapidly and the deal could be concluded before the year end. Goyal mentioned that India will raise its concerns over certain EU regulations such as carbon tax and deforestation rules in the trade talks. He emphasized that all issues are on the table and will be negotiated to achieve a fair, balanced, and equitable FTA. Goyal also expressed optimism that the talks could be concluded faster than the year end, citing the rapid progress being made. He highlighted that India and the EU have complimentary economies, and most issues of interest to India do not hurt the EU economy. However, he acknowledged that there are sensitive issues on both sides that need to be resolved amicably. Goyal also mentioned that India will discuss issues related to gender and sustainability in the trade pact. He will hold a bilateral meeting with EU Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Marcos Sefcovic on June 2 to discuss the agreement. The negotiations cover 23 policy areas, including trade in goods, services, investment, and intellectual property rights. India's bilateral trade in goods with the EU was $137.41 billion in 2023-24, making it the largest trading partner for goods.

Goyal also stated that 'India does not shy from any subject for discussions,' and that 'Subject like gender, India bats on the front foot, and when it comes to subjects like sustainability, India is right at the fore front.'

**Health Ministry aims for a smoke-free Malaysia by 2040, says Dzulkefly**
Malaysia's Health Minister, Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad, reaffirmed the country's goal to become 'Malaysia Bebas Rokok' (Smoke-Free Malaysia) by 2040. He emphasized the importance of shared commitment and firm policies to achieve this vision. Dzulkefly highlighted Malaysia's international recognition, including the World Health Organisation's adoption of the country's Lung Health Resolution. He stressed that policy enforcement must be complemented with health promotion and community engagement. According to the National Health and Morbidity Survey, smoking prevalence among adults has declined from 22.4% in 2019 to 19.8% in 2023, but vape usage has increased among adolescents. Dzulkefly announced several strategic initiatives to prevent and intervene in substance abuse, including the Kotak programme and school counselor training. The Ministry of Health also launched the Pak Lung mascot to drive public awareness and support community outreach. 'As we push one epidemic back, another rises in its place,' Dzulkefly said, 'Vape usage has unfortunately crept up from 4.9 per cent to 5.1 per cent, especially among adolescents.'

**Hacienda to Have Access to All Bizum Operations from 2026**
The Spanish Tax Agency (Hacienda) has confirmed that it will have access to all Bizum operations from January 1, 2026. According to the Real Decreto 253/2025, published in the Boletín Oficial del Estado (BOE), individuals and businesses must inform Hacienda about transactions made through Bizum, including the identity of the recipient, number of the commercial operation, payment terminals, total amounts, and bank accounts involved. This may cause confusion for self-employed workers who use a single bank account for personal and professional purposes, as stated by María Pozo, an expert in finance. Hacienda will increase control over transfers between parents and children, and may open inspections or impose sanctions if something unusual is detected. In 2024, there were 58 million operations on the Bizum platform. Additionally, the Real Decreto 253/2025 requires businesses to report on loans, credits, and cash movements in annual informative declarations, and to inform about balances exceeding 6,000 euros and cash payments or dispositions exceeding 3,000 euros or any other currency.

**Cyprus, Finland, Hungary, Slovenia, Latvia, and Portugal Ratify UN 'Treaty on the High Seas'**
Cyprus, Finland, Hungary, Slovenia, Latvia, and Portugal have ratified the 'Treaty on the High Seas' of the United Nations. This brings the total number of countries supporting the treaty to 28, out of the 60 needed for it to come into effect. The treaty, officially known as the 'Agreement on the Law of the Sea relating to the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction', aims to conserve and sustainably use the world's oceans. According to Rebecca Hubbard, director of HSA, 'A healthy ocean sustains a stable future for all of us.' She emphasizes the need to 'integrate ocean action into all diplomatic agendas because no country can solve this environmental crisis alone.' The treaty was approved in June 2023 and six European countries have ratified it this week, ahead of the UN Ocean Conference in Niza, France, which will take place from June 9-13.

**WHO adopts pandemic treaty, but experts warn of future pandemics**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted a new 'pandemic treaty' just in time before the big outbreaks that are rapidly approaching. The treaty aims to improve international coordination and surveillance to better recognize and combat pandemics. However, US Health Minister Robert F. Kennedy Jr. criticized the treaty, calling for a 'restart of the entire system'. He stated that the WHO has not addressed its shortcomings during the COVID-19 pandemic and instead added to them with the pandemic treaty. The treaty has been widely praised, but some experts warn that future pandemics could be even deadlier. A recent study found that cats can be infected with bird flu through various means, including direct contact with infected birds or contaminated raw chicken feed. Infected cats can suffer from acute encephalitis and other severe symptoms, with a mortality rate of 90%. The article also mentions that Jesus warned of numerous 'plagues' in the days before his return, as stated in Matthew 24 and Luke 21. Revelation 6:8 also mentions that a quarter of the world's population will die during the seal judgments. The article concludes that the future will be marked by great plagues and widespread death, and that people should use the current time of relative stability to prepare for the coming disasters.

**Swiss government sets out curbs on free movement**
The Swiss government has introduced a safeguard clause to temporarily limit the free movement of persons from the European Union and EFTA countries. The clause will be triggered if national indicators such as immigration levels, unemployment rates, and social assistance recourse surpass predefined thresholds. Justice Minister Beat Jans described the clause as an 'emergency brake' that can be used without jeopardising the bilateral accords with the EU. The Federal Council continues to view free movement as a net benefit, but acknowledges the need to mitigate potential strains through well-calibrated restrictions. Precise thresholds for triggering the clause will be determined during a consultation process scheduled to begin in June. The government insists that any difficulty prompting restrictions must be clearly and demonstrably linked to immigration from the EU. If approved, protective measures could include immigration caps, employment preferences for residents, or restrictions on residency rights for jobseekers and the unemployed. The EU may adopt rebalancing measures, though only within the domain of free movement. Switzerland also reserves the right to act unilaterally, even if the arbitration panel does not endorse the intervention.

**CANZUK Gains Momentum Following Trump's Tariffs**
The CANZUK initiative has gained momentum following the tariffs imposed by Trump. The concept of CANZUK, which refers to a potential economic union between Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, has been gaining traction in recent years. In 2018, the Conservative Party of Canada adopted it as an official policy, with overwhelming support. The initiative has also received support from the Liberal Party of Canada, with the party endorsing it in its 2023 policy convention. The CANZUK International organization, led by Erin O'Toole, has been working to promote the benefits of a CANZUK union, including increased economic cooperation and trade. As Boris Johnson said, 'The CANZUK initiative has the potential to create a third major economic power in the world.'

**Russian Businesses Can Withstand Tight Monetary Policy with Government Support, Says 'Delovaya Rossiya'**
The head of the 'Delovaya Rossiya' subcommittee on public markets, Alexei Lazutin, stated that Russian small and medium-sized businesses can only withstand a long period of tight monetary policy (DKP) with sufficient government support. 'It is clear that high-quality, rapidly growing companies with medium and small capitalization, which became the main driving force in the process of replacing products of companies that left Russia in 2022-2023, can withstand a long cycle of key rate increases due to their reserve capacity. However, this capacity is gradually coming to an end. If we do not see the start of the cycle of easing DKP in the near future, without increasing government support, it will be unlikely for businesses to withstand a long period of high key rates and expensive loans,' Lazutin said. He believes that there is a high probability that the Central Bank of Russia will keep the key rate at 21% at the next meeting. 'On the one hand, the Central Bank's rhetoric about slowing down inflationary processes gives us hope for the start of the cycle of easing DKP soon. On the other hand, the lack of sustainability of disinflationary trends and 'tectonic changes in global trade', characterized by the head of the Central Bank as a new significant risk, makes any rate movements risky,' Lazutin reasons. He reminded that 'Delovaya Rossiya' has been advocating for supporting companies going public and welcomes the fact that the Ministry of Economic Development, the Central Bank, and the Moscow Exchange are developing a program to subsidize the placement of shares and bonds on the domestic market until 2030. The first selection of companies to receive subsidies, which they can use to cover the costs of placement services, auditors, lawyers, is planned for June-July 2025. 'For many companies with medium and small capitalization, issuing bonds today is often a more optimal way to attract funding than loans. Therefore, the program of subsidizing the issuance of bonds and shares may, to some extent, compensate for the reduction in support for preferential lending, where the number of authorized banks has decreased and the list of industries, companies from which can use preferential lending, has been reduced,' Lazutin added. 'Of course, the capital market today will not replace bank lending in full, but the trend of the capital market tools gaining more weight in the process of financing transformation and economic development is extremely important,' Lazutin concluded. In March, the regulator kept the key rate at 21% for the third time in a row, changing the signal: now the regulator will consider raising the rate if the disinflation dynamics do not ensure the achievement of the target. The next meeting of the Central Bank's council of directors on the key rate will take place on Friday, April 25.

**Russia to Ban Cash Purchases of Real Estate**
The Russian government is planning to ban the purchase of real estate with cash, according to Russian media reports on April 21. The proposed law, authored by Svetlana Razuvaeva, a deputy of the State Duma, aims to prohibit the use of physical cash for transactions over 1 million rubles. The move is allegedly intended to combat property-related crimes, which have increased from 6,000 in 2022 to 8,000 in 2023. Razuvaeva expressed hope that the law could be passed by the end of the year, saying, 'I hope that theoretically, it can be adopted by the end of the year.'

**International Pandemic Treaty Ready for Adoption**
After three years of negotiations, an international pandemic treaty has been agreed upon by numerous countries to prevent similar chaos during future pandemics. The treaty will be presented for adoption at the World Health Organization's (WHO) annual meeting in May. However, the United States has opted out of the treaty due to a decision made by the new administration, with the country's withdrawal from the WHO set to take effect in January 2026. According to experts, the treaty will only come into effect after 60 countries have ratified it, a process that may take several years. Gian-Luca Burci, a professor at the Graduate Institute in Geneva, expressed confidence that the world will be better prepared to handle future pandemics after ratification, saying, 'I have no doubt that the world will be much better prepared to face another pandemic and will overcome it better and more fairly.'

**Is It Time For Canada, Australia, New Zealand and UK To Form CANZUK?**
The proposed CANZUK diplomatic union between Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK is gaining momentum due to the current geopolitical situation. The formation of the BRICS nations and the US administration's actions under President Donald Trump, including adopting brash rhetoric towards allies and imposing tariffs on countries with trade surpluses, have contributed to this development. As a result, there is a growing question about the reliability of the US as a global leader, leading some to consider forming a new alliance.

**UN Report Highlights Ongoing Human Rights Violations in Colombia**
The latest report from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights highlights the ongoing human rights violations in Colombia, despite some legal advances and efforts towards a 'total peace'. The report, focusing on the situation in 2024, warns of the continued recruitment of minors, gender-based violence, and territorial control by non-state armed groups. According to the UN, there were 72 massacres in 2024, a 27% decrease from 2023, but with 252 victims registered. Additionally, 216 cases of child recruitment and use by armed groups were documented, mostly in areas with a history of illegal actors. The report emphasizes that 50% of displaced persons and 66% of confined populations belong to indigenous and Afro-descendant communities, exacerbating concerns about the disproportionate effects of the conflict on these groups. The publication reiterates that there have been normative advances, such as the ratification of the Escazú Agreement and the adoption of new security and human rights protocols. However, the High Commissioner considers it essential for the State to accelerate the adoption of effective policies to protect social leaders, ex-combatants, and human rights defenders. The report recommends strengthening institutional presence in territories, as threats from armed groups limit the action of authorities responsible for attending to victims of displacement and sexual violence. As the report states, 'The risk of physical and cultural extermination persists in several indigenous peoples, who suffer the pressure of poverty, violence, and extractive projects.' The report also warns about the importance of ensuring justice and reparations to the families of those who suffer forced disappearance and child recruitment, a topic that requires 'urgent actions, with a gender and ethnic focus.' The report indicates that the 'total peace' policy pushed by the Government has generated expectations in various communities, but emphasizes that, to protect the civilian population, it is crucial to integrate the dialogues with armed groups, security actions, and the implementation of the 2016 peace agreement in a coherent manner. The UN recognizes some decreases in the number of homicides attributed to illegal groups, but emphasizes the urgency of articulating state and community efforts to reduce violence and guarantee fundamental rights such as education, health, and free movement.

**Donald Trump could ruin Keir Starmer's EU dream with one key policy**
The proposed CANZUK politico-economic union between the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand could provide a valuable alternative to the EU, especially in a post-globalized world with rising trade tariffs. This union would create a trade bloc with the world's largest polity and third-largest economy, allowing for greater cultural and economic ties between the member states. Sir Keir Starmer's desire for closer ties to the EU could be challenged by the potential benefits of a CANZUK deal, which would include freedom of movement ties and a security tie-up that would cover much of the globe. As the EU recedes into the background, the UK could reset its relationships with the Commonwealth, making a CANZUK deal a 'no-brainer'.
