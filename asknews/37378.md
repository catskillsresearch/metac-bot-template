**China Approves 32 New Undergraduate Schools to Meet Industry Demands**
The Chinese Ministry of Education has recently announced the approval of 32 new undergraduate schools. Among them, 23 are vocational undergraduate schools. This move is seen as a response to the growing demand for high-skilled workers in various industries. According to Anhui Province Education Department's Director, 'Developing vocational undergraduate education is a necessary requirement for adapting to industrial upgrading and a pressing need for perfecting the modern vocational education system.' The number of vocational undergraduate schools in China has been increasing steadily, from 21 in 2020 to over 80, with the addition of the 23 new schools. The schools are designed to meet the needs of industries and the job market, with many of them focusing on emerging fields such as new energy, smart manufacturing, and artificial intelligence. 'The two vocational undergraduate schools in Anhui, Anhui Vocational Technical University and Wuhu Vocational Technical University, have strong expertise in engineering and have set up a number of professional groups in new energy, smart networking vehicles, and new generation information technology, with a professional setting and matching degree of over 90% with regional industries,' said Anhui Province Education Department's Director. The 32 schools also include 4 ordinary undergraduate schools that will be renamed. The renaming is not just a simple change of name, but also involves adjustments to professional settings and talent cultivation strategies. For example, the South China University of Technology will be renamed as Guangdong University of Technology. The school's party committee deputy secretary and president, Liu Zuwu, said that this is a response to the urgent need to cultivate high-level applied talents in the field of water resources and electricity. 'Jiangxi is located in the middle of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and there is a strong demand for water resources and electricity talents,' Liu said. The school will focus on water resources and electricity engineering, and actively connect with major projects such as the Yangtze River water resources allocation project and the Yangtze River ecological control project, to provide strong support for the high-quality development of regional economy and society and water resources and electricity industry.' Experts believe that the overall trend of setting up 32 new undergraduate schools is in line with the needs of economic and social development, and is a necessary step in building a high-quality education system. With the upcoming college entrance examination, students will have more choices, and experts advise students to consider their own strengths and make rational choices based on factors such as employment prospects.

**Universities right to reduce foreign language seats, start new majors**
Over 100 Chinese universities have closed or merged their foreign language colleges in the past five years due to a decline in bachelor's degrees awarded to foreign language majors. This decline is attributed to the increasing number of graduates competing for limited teaching and translating job vacancies. However, the author, a journalist who majored in English literature, believes that this development is a sign of the Chinese people's improved grasp of foreign languages. With most Chinese people with higher education degrees now able to read, write, and speak a foreign language, the need for interpreters and translators has decreased. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology has also made language translation more accessible, and the author thinks that universities are making the right decision by reducing foreign language department seats and starting new majors that combine foreign languages with other subjects. As the author notes, 'a big part of language translation and interpretation work will be done by AI and bilingual or even trilingual talents may soon find themselves struggling to find a well-paying job.'

**Arab Countries Make Strides in Artificial Intelligence Amid Global Competition**
According to the 'Artificial Intelligence 2025' report, there have been significant changes in the global landscape of artificial intelligence, with Arab countries making a notable presence in several international indicators. This comes amidst a wave of massive government investments and intense competition for talent and skills. The report highlights several key points, including: 90% of the most prominent AI models in 2024 came from industrial companies, up from 60% in 2023. The gap between the best American and Chinese AI models narrowed from 103 points in January 2024 to 23 points in February 2025, with the launch of the Chinese 'Deep Seek' model. China accounted for 70% of global AI patent applications as of 2023, according to a Stanford University report. The cost of inference for a system with a similar performance level to 'GPT-3.5' decreased by over 280 times between November 2022 and October 2024, while energy efficiency improved by 40% and hardware costs decreased by 30% annually. Today, two-thirds of the world's countries, or those planning to do so, offer computer science education in early school stages, a doubling of the number of countries in 2019, with Africa and Latin America leading the way in this field. The United States led the world with 40 AI models in 2024, followed by China with 15 models, then France with three models, and Saudi Arabia and Canada tied for fourth place with one model each. India led the world in terms of AI talent growth, with a 33.4% increase in AI employment growth rate, followed by Brazil with 30.8%, and Saudi Arabia with 28.7%. Canada announced a $2.4 billion package to develop AI, while China launched a $47.5 billion fund, France allocated €109 billion, India invested $1.25 billion, and Saudi Arabia's 'Transcendence' project is a massive $100 billion initiative. In 2024, 69.5% of AI professionals on LinkedIn were men, while 30.5% were women, with a higher concentration of AI talent among men in all countries except India and Saudi Arabia. Luxembourg topped the list in attracting AI talent and skills, followed by the UAE in third place, and Saudi Arabia in eighth place, with the US ranking 13th among the countries studied.

**Scholars from China flock to Malaysia**
Over 2,300 Chinese scholars are pursuing their PhD research at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) in Penang, making up the majority of foreign nationalities in USM's student population. They, along with more than 3,700 others from China, are attracted to Malaysia due to its affordability, academic freedom, and cultural familiarity. However, they lamented that their tertiary degrees are 'valued less' than those from Singapore or Hong Kong. Ms Lola He Ying Lei said, 'In some parts of China, a PhD from Malaysia is seen as less prestigious than one from a mid-tier Chinese university.' Despite this, she noted that academic freedom in Malaysia is considerably greater, and supervisors encourage students to explore and let their scholarly research evolve. USM vice-chancellor Abdul Rahman Mohamed said USM's global recognition and rankings are a major appeal, with the university ranked 18th in the Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings and 146th in QS World University Rankings. He added that almost all courses at USM are taught in English, cutting down language barriers for China's students, and tuition fees and living costs are significantly lower than in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.

**Writing's on the wall for out-of-sync Chinese university majors**
China has revoked or adjusted over 5,000 university majors between 2019 and 2024, with a significant increase in the number of discontinued programs in recent years. The most frequently discontinued programs include information management and information systems, public affairs management, and apparel and fashion design. According to the Ministry of Education, the discontinuation of programs is due to a lack of qualified faculty and infrastructure, as well as a mismatch between the curriculum and market demand. Associate Professor Cai Zhenhua said that the discontinuation of programs reflects the need for higher education to evolve to serve national needs and changing societal demands. He emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary fields and industry-academia integration, and advised students to prioritize personal interests and align with national or regional development needs. Associate Professor Sun Lijun, who experienced the discontinuation of an undergraduate program, views it as optimization rather than elimination, and sees it as an opportunity for reflection and realignment.

**QS World University Rankings: Chinese Universities Rise to the Top**
The QS World University Rankings, released in 2025, lists 1,500 universities and 105 higher education systems worldwide. The rankings are dominated by Anglo-Saxon universities, but Chinese universities are rising in the top 20, with Tsinghua and Beijing universities ranking 12th and 13th, respectively. This is a significant shift in the global context, with Asian universities, such as the National University of Singapore, also rising in the rankings. The rankings are influenced by factors such as university size and funding, but also by the investment in research and development (R&D) by companies like Huawei and Samsung. The article notes that the Chinese government's investment in R&D has led to significant advancements in the country's scientific capabilities, with 70% of smartphone components being produced domestically. This has allowed Huawei to increase its market share in China to 14%, just behind Apple. The article concludes that the European Union should invest in R&D and follow the example of countries like China, which is investing heavily in its scientific capabilities. 'The awakening will be painful and expensive,' the article warns, 'but it is essential for the EU to invest in its future.'
