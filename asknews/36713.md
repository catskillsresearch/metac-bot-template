**Can Elon Musk be removed as CEO of Tesla?**
Tesla's board of directors has been accused of being too loyal to Elon Musk, the company's CEO and largest shareholder. The board's composition, with members such as Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother, and Ira Ehrenpreis, one of the company's earliest investors, has been criticized for being too close to Musk. The board's president, Robyn Denholm, has been accused of being overly generous in her compensation package, which includes stock options worth millions of dollars. The article suggests that the board's loyalty to Musk is driven by a desire to benefit financially from their relationship with him. However, the board's actions have been questioned in recent months, with a court ruling that Musk's 2018 compensation package was not properly disclosed to shareholders, and another ruling that the board's members had enriched themselves at the expense of shareholders. The article concludes that the board's loyalty to Musk is not absolute, and that they may be willing to remove him as CEO if it is in the best interests of the company.

**What's next for Tesla as Musk departs Trump White House**
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has officially stepped down from his role as a special government employee in the Trump administration, allowing him to refocus on the electric vehicle maker. Musk's departure is seen as a welcome development for investors, who have been critical of his political activism amid sluggish consumer demand for EVs. Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said that Musk's departure is 'music to the ears of Tesla shareholders' and that the company's focus on autonomous vehicles and robotics will drive its future. Ives added that the 'brand damage and black cloud' over Tesla related to political blowback is in the rearview mirror. A group of Tesla shareholders has also called for Musk to spend at least 40 hours a week working at Tesla, citing concerns that his outside endeavors have diverted his time and attention from actively managing the company.

**Elon Musk Leaves Trump Administration 'Quickly and Quietly'**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has left the administration of US President Donald Trump 'quickly and quietly', according to Reuters sources. Musk did not have an official conversation with Trump before his departure, sources said. Musk himself wrote that his work as a government official 'is coming to an end' and thanked Trump for the 'opportunity to reduce unnecessary expenses.' Trump said of Musk, 'I don't need Elon for anything except what I like. But I'm telling you, this guy, this guy has done fantastic work. I don't need his car [Tesla], although I bought one.' Musk announced his departure after criticizing a bill that would provide significant tax breaks, promised by Trump during his election campaign, which Musk believes undermines the work of DOGE. Some high-ranking officials, including White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, were reportedly annoyed by Musk's comments, according to Reuters. The agency also links Musk's departure to a decline in his ratings. Musk's steps as head of DOGE, including mass layoffs of government employees, have been widely criticized. Large-scale protests against Tesla have taken place in the US and around the world due to its activities. According to Reuters, the Trump administration and DOGE were able to reduce the number of federal employees by almost 12%, or 260,000 people out of 2.3 million, mainly due to threats of dismissal, buyouts, and early retirement offers. Musk has also had conflicts with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Reuters notes. Musk said, 'I will focus on managing the company and in the future will spend 'much less' time on politics, as I believe I have already done enough.' He has been the CEO of Tesla since 2008 and its largest shareholder with a 13% stake.

Musk wrote, 'The Doge mission will become even more important over time and will be part of the government's daily routine.' This comes after Musk previously criticized Trump's new tax law, saying it undermined all his work.

**Elon Musk commits to stay as Tesla CEO for 5 more years amid political backlash | Company Business News**
Elon Musk has committed to staying as Tesla's CEO for at least the next five years, despite facing intense scrutiny from consumers and investors due to his political affiliations. When asked if he sees himself as Tesla's chief executive in five years, Musk responded, 'Yes.' He emphasized that his decision to stay with Tesla is less about money and more about 'reasonable control' over the company's future, especially as Tesla ventures into AI and robotics. Musk said, 'I want sufficient voting control so I cannot be ousted by activist investors,' and noted plans to build 'millions, potentially billions of humanoid robots.' Tesla's shares initially jumped 3.3% following Musk's comments but later settled up about 1%, with the stock down 15% for the year.

**Elon Musk's Future at Tesla: A Possible Departure?**
Tesla has responded to a bombshell report from the Wall Street Journal, which suggested that the company's board of directors is exploring a plan to replace Elon Musk as CEO. According to the report, the board has been in talks with headhunting firms to find a new CEO. However, Robyn Denholm, the chair of the board, has denied the report, saying 'Absolutely false.' Despite this, some investors believe that the scenario is plausible, given Tesla's recent poor performance. The company's deliveries have decreased by 1% in 2024 and by 13% in the first quarter of 2025. Elon Musk's distraction from the company, as he focuses on his role as the US government's 'minister of efficiency,' has also contributed to the tensions within the board. According to Ann Lipton, an expert in corporate governance, the board can remove the CEO with a simple majority vote. However, it is unlikely that the board would betray Elon Musk, given his close ties to the company and his family members who sit on the board. One possible scenario is that Elon Musk could abdicate, in agreement with the board. 'Whatever happens, it will be Elon's will,' said Ross Gerber, a long-time investor in Tesla. Elon Musk's focus on his AI company, xAI, may also be a factor in his potential departure from Tesla.

**Tesla Investor Calls for Elon Musk's Removal as CEO**
A major investor in Tesla, Ross Gerber, has called for Elon Musk to be removed as CEO of the company. According to Gerber, Musk's political activity, including his role in the Trump administration, has negatively impacted the company's reputation and financial results. 'It's time for the Tesla board to remove Musk as CEO,' Gerber said in a phone interview with Newsweek.

His involvement in politics has caused concern among investors, leading to a 37% drop in Tesla's stock price in 2025.
