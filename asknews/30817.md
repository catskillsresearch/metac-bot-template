Israel's Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the Nova massacre, will represent Israel at the 2025 Eurovision contest. Raphael's song, 'New Day Will Rise,' is a power ballad that represents the healing process of those affected by the massacre. Meanwhile, Israel's hostage situation has been resolved, with 33 hostages expected to be freed in the first stage of a potential ceasefire deal. The deal was negotiated after a 'tense' meeting between Netanyahu and Hamas, and is expected to see the release of most of the remaining captives. However, the deal has been met with criticism from some Israeli officials, who claim that Hamas has reneged on some of the details. The Israeli government has also downplayed the role of the Palestinian Authority in the post-war Gaza situation, and has denied promising the Saudis a Palestinian state. President Herzog has spoken out against the treatment of Israel by international bodies, accusing the ICC and ICJ of 'manipulating the definition of genocide for the sake of Israel's enemies.' The article also mentions various other events, including the 80-year anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and the inauguration of the new US president, who has hailed the Gaza deal as a 'big day' for Israel-US relations.

**Why so few atrocities have ever been recognized as genocide**
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is currently hearing a case in which South Africa has accused Israel of committing acts of genocide in Gaza since October 2023. However, the concept of genocide is narrowly defined in international law, and few events have been labeled as genocide as a matter of law. According to Raphael Lemkin, who first defined the concept in 1944, genocide is about attempting to destroy a group of people. The first international conviction for genocide was not until 1998, when the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda found Jean-Paul Akayesu guilty of genocide for his role in the mass killings of minority ethnic Tutsis in 1994. The article highlights the limitations of the genocide definition, citing examples such as the mass killings under Joseph Stalin and the Khmer Rouge, which were not considered genocide because they did not target groups defined by nationality, ethnicity, race, or religion. The article concludes that the definition of genocide should be expanded to cover a greater range of protected groups, but notes that this is a difficult task until the definition is amended or creatively interpreted by the courts.

The definition of genocide, established in 1948, requires that the killings be aimed at destroying a group of people defined by nationality, ethnicity, race, or religion. Despite this, many atrocities have been committed throughout history, but few have been recognized as genocide. Examples include the Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, and the Srebrenica massacre. However, even in these cases, the definition of genocide was not fully met, and other labels such as 'crimes against humanity' were used instead. The article argues that the definition of genocide should be expanded to cover a greater range of protected groups and that it should be easier to infer the existence of genocidal intent from a pattern of facts. Until this is done, it will remain difficult to apply the label of genocide even to the most egregious of mass killings.

**Israel and Myanmar Form Genocide Alliance: A Shocking Comparison**
Penny Green, a leading Australian law professor, made a striking comparison between two ongoing genocide investigations at the Gaza Tribunal in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Green noted that when Myanmar was brought to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for allegedly violating the Genocide Convention, Israeli Ambassador to Myanmar Ronen Gilor expressed support on social media, saying 'good decision and good luck.' However, in January 2024, the ICJ issued a provisional ruling that found a 'reasonable risk of genocide' in Israel's actions. Green stated that this obligation is already a requirement for all states that are parties to the Genocide Convention. Green then commented, 'In this context, Israel's support message for another state (Myanmar) being tried for similar allegations, while it is itself accused of genocide, could raise discussions about collaborating with genocidal regimes.' Green's remarks suggest that Israel's actions in Gaza are equivalent to Myanmar's genocide against the Rohingya Muslims.

**Gaza Court Continues Public Sessions in Sarajevo**
The 'Gaza Court' initiative continued its public sessions in Sarajevo for the third day in a row, investigating war crimes committed by Israel in the Gaza Strip. The sessions, held at the University of Sarajevo, featured academics, intellectuals, human rights defenders, media representatives, and civil society organizations. They discussed topics such as 'genocide as a state crime', 'the history of ethnic cleansing', and 'the philosophical roots of genocide in Gaza'. The court aims to provide a transparent and impartial platform for investigating human rights violations, which international courts like the ICC and ICJ may not be able to handle due to political or procedural reasons. The court will announce its final verdict in Istanbul in October, where it will hear testimonies from victims and witnesses. Israel will be tried in absentia for war crimes and genocide in Gaza. 'The Gaza Court' was established in London in November 2024 by a group of academics, intellectuals, and human rights defenders due to the 'complete failure of the international community to apply international law in Gaza.'

**Chile Demands Israel Cease Military Operations in Gaza, Withdraws Diplomatic Attachés**
Chile has announced the withdrawal of its military attachés from the Israeli embassy in Tel Aviv, in protest of what it calls 'disproportionate and indiscriminate' Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip. The move is part of Chile's firm stance on the humanitarian crisis facing the Palestinian people, with over 50,000 victims in the past 20 months, according to international organizations. The Chilean government has demanded that Israel immediately cease its military offensive in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, allow free humanitarian aid, and respect international law and humanitarian law. 'The Government of Chile informs that, today, our embassy in Israel has notified the authorities of that country of the withdrawal of the military, defense, and air attachés,' said the official note. The decision is based on the 'grave humanitarian situation' faced by the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip, attributed to the Israeli offensive and the obstacles to the entry of humanitarian aid. Chile has raised its diplomatic tone on the conflict, aligning with previous measures taken by the administration of President Gabriel Boric, such as supporting judicial demands in international instances. In January 2024, Chile and Mexico formally requested the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate possible war crimes in the context of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. In September 2023, Chile also joined the complaint presented by South Africa to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for alleged genocide committed by Israel, strengthening its position on the multilateral level regarding respect for human rights in Palestine.

**Gaza Court Affirms Palestinian Right to Resist, Condemns Israeli Genocide**
The Gaza Court has issued a statement affirming the Palestinian people's right to resist, including armed resistance, as recognized by the UN General Assembly. The statement condemns Israel's 'genocide and decades-long settler colonialism, torture, and destruction' and asserts that the Palestinian people's right to self-determination is 'clear and fundamental.' The court, established to investigate and prosecute international crimes committed by Israel, including genocide and war crimes, has been organized by human rights defenders, international law experts, and civil society organizations. The court aims to hold Israel accountable for its ongoing war crimes and to provide a platform for victims and civil society organizations to testify. Israel will be tried in absentia for genocide and war crimes, and the court aims to conduct its proceedings with transparency, independence, and without external interference. The Gaza Court seeks to complement the work of international courts such as the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which have been hindered by political influence and lengthy proceedings. As an alternative to these courts, the Gaza Court aims to produce legally sound results and raise global awareness.

**Chile Recalls Military Attachés from Israel in Response to Gaza Operations**
The Chilean government has recalled its military attachés from the Israeli embassy in Tel Aviv in response to Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza. According to a statement on the government's website, a 'very serious' humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in Gaza, and the decision was made in light of this. The statement also called on Israel to stop its 'disproportionate and discriminatory' attacks in Gaza and to allow for immediate humanitarian aid to enter the region. Interior Minister Alvaro Elizalde emphasized that the decision was based on principles such as 'human dignity, the right to life, and the protection of international law.' The Jewish community in Chile has criticized the decision, arguing that foreign policy is being shaped by ideological approaches and that the country's strategic interests are being ignored. The government had previously decided not to invite Israeli companies to the 'FIDAE International Air and Space Fair' in 2024. Chile is also a party to the International Court of Justice case brought by South Africa against Israel for alleged genocide.

**Silence on Gaza: Paris Rally Demands Justice for Killed Journalists**
A rally was held in Paris in front of the Agence France-Presse (AFP) headquarters to honor and protest the killing of Palestinian journalists in Gaza. The event, organized by several associations, aimed to denounce the 'deafening silence' of major media outlets on the issue. According to the organizers, 244 Palestinian journalists have been killed in 29 months. The recent death of Hassan Majdi Abu Warda, a journalist killed with his family in an Israeli bombing, has sparked outrage. The protesters, mostly wearing blue, held signs demanding 'justice for the assassinated journalists', 'support for the survivors', and 'free access for international journalists to Gaza'. They also criticized the AFP for its 'lack of coverage' of these killings and its alleged role in 'invisibilizing the violence' against Palestinian journalists. The protesters emphasized the urgency of allowing international journalists to access Gaza to document the atrocities on the ground. 'Preventing the press from entering is preventing the truth from coming out,' one of the banners read. Israel has blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza since March 2, citing security reasons. Several NGOs, including Médecins du Monde, Oxfam, and the Norwegian Refugee Council, have condemned this blockade, warning of a 'total collapse' of humanitarian aid and denouncing 'one of the worst humanitarian failures of our generation.' In this context, the Israeli Minister of Defense, Israel Katz, reaffirmed that 'no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza.' Since the resumption of hostilities on March 18, 2025, Israeli attacks have killed nearly 4,000 Palestinians, bringing the total death toll in Gaza to over 54,000 since the conflict began in October 2023. The majority of Palestinian victims are civilians, including children and women. Despite the announcement of a ceasefire, violations persist, exacerbating the already critical humanitarian situation. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ordered Israel to prevent any act of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and to allow access to humanitarian aid. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued several arrest warrants, including one for Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Gaza.

**ICJ Extends Deadline for Israel's Defense in Genocide Case**
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has extended the deadline for Israel to submit its defense in a case filed by South Africa, accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. According to the ICJ, the deadline for Israel's response was previously set for July 28, 2025, but has been extended to January 12, 2026, following Israel's request. The ICJ stated that Israel had experienced various problems with the evidence presented by South Africa, and that the consultation process initiated by the UN General Assembly on December 19, 2024, had affected the resources of the ICJ. South Africa opposed the extension, arguing that the case's scope had not changed, that the evidence issues were limited to a few documents, and that the UN General Assembly's consultation request could not be used as a reason for the delay. The ICJ has approved the extension, stating that Israel must submit its defense by January 12, 2026. South Africa filed the genocide case against Israel on December 29, 2023, citing the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The ICJ had issued three provisional measures on January 26, March 28, and May 24, 2024, requiring Israel to take all necessary measures to prevent genocide and to report its actions to the ICJ. Thirteen countries, including Turkey, had intervened in the case. South Africa submitted a 750-page main defense document and over 4,000 supporting documents on October 28.

**ICJ Rules Against South Africa: 'Serious' Procedural Abuses Give Israel 6 More Months to Respond to Accusations**
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled against South Africa, granting Israel a 6-month extension to respond to accusations of genocide. The ICJ found that South Africa's procedural abuses, including concealing witness identities and evidence, were 'serious' breaches of legal norms. According to Avishai Grinzaig, a legal commentator for i24NEWS, the court reinforced the principle of due process by ruling that witness identities and evidence cannot be concealed from the defendant state. Israel now has until January 12, 2026, to respond to South Africa's claims, pushing the deadline back from the original July 2025 date. South Africa has refused to withdraw from the case, taking the position that Israel does not have the right to respond to terror against civilians because it is an 'occupying' power.

The ICJ had issued three provisional measures on January 26, March 28, and May 24, 2024, requiring Israel to take measures to prevent genocide and report to the ICJ. Thirteen countries, including Turkey, had submitted requests to participate in the case.

**Israel Granted Six-Month Delay in Presenting Case Against South Africa's Genocide Allegations**
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague has granted Israel a six-month delay in presenting its case against South Africa's genocide allegations, citing procedural violations by South Africa in presenting evidence. According to i24NEWS, citing two Western diplomats familiar with the case, the ICJ found that South Africa had illegally attempted to present its evidence without providing Israel with access to the materials, violating both ICJ procedures and legal norms. Israel had objected to South Africa's actions and received an additional six months to review the evidence presented by South Africa and prepare its response. The original deadline for Israel's response was July 2025, but it has now been extended to January 2026. In December 2023, just two months after Hamas terrorists killed over 1,000 Israelis, South Africa filed a complaint against Israel, accusing it of genocide against Gaza residents. On January 26, 2024, the ICJ ruled on the case initiated by South Africa, stating that Israel must do everything possible to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza and take 'immediate' measures to provide aid. However, it did not order Israel to stop the war in Gaza. In November 2023, the South African government announced the recall of its ambassador and entire diplomatic mission from Israel in protest against Israel's attempts to defend itself against the terrorist organization Hamas after the October 7 massacre. There have been changes in the leadership of the ICJ in recent months. In 2024, Lebanese judge Nava Saliem, who was the president of the court, became the prime minister of Lebanon in January. Ugandan judge Julia Sebunya took over as acting president of the ICJ in his place. While Saliem referred to Israel as 'the enemy', Sebunya is considered to be the most fair-minded judge towards Israel in the ICJ. In April last year, Sebunya was the only judge (excluding the Israeli-appointed judge Aaron Barak) among 17 judges to rule in favor of Israel in a court case regarding Israel's war with Hamas.

**SA defies US pressure on ICJ case against Israel**
South Africa has reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), despite mounting pressure from the Trump administration, including financial aid cuts and political threats. Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola stated, 'Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the world and the rule of law.' The case, filed in December 2023, accuses Israel of committing genocide during its military operations in Gaza, which has resulted in over 48,000 deaths and widespread destruction. Several countries have joined the case, including Nicaragua, Colombia, Cuba, Libya, Mexico, Spain, Belize, and Turkey. The ICJ case comes alongside separate legal actions by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

**'No chance': South Africa says won't withdraw Israel genocide case despite Trump threats**
South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola has stated that the country will not withdraw its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), despite threats and aid cuts from the Trump administration. 'There is no chance' of withdrawing the case, Lamola told the Financial Times. He emphasized that standing by their principles has consequences, but they remain firm in their commitment to the rule of law. The case was filed in December 2023, and several countries have joined the proceedings, including Nicaragua, Colombia, and Türkiye. The International Criminal Court has also issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

**Voci da Gaza: giorno 112**
The 112th day of the genocidal war against Gaza saw the testimony of Zainab Al Ghonaimy, a resident of Gaza under bombardment and aggression. The International Court of Justice has ruled that Israel's actions in Gaza constitute a crime of genocide, but the Israeli government has ignored the decision and continues to commit atrocities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that he will continue the aggression until Hamas is eliminated, and has accused South Africa of being hostile to Israel for presenting the case to the International Court of Justice. A member of the Israeli war gang has also stated that the residents of Gaza deserve what is happening to them because they do not rebel against Hamas. The Israeli government's position is not surprising, given its history of arrogance and brutality. The US administration has also supported Israel, despite the fact that it has accepted a shipment of arms that will help Israel commit more crimes against the Palestinian people. The International Court of Justice's decision is symbolic for the Palestinian people, as it does not have the power to force Israel to stop its crimes. The court has given Israel a month to submit a report showing that it has stopped its crimes, but it is clear that Israel will not comply. As Zainab Al Ghonaimy said, 'We will continue to resist this racist entity and defend our legitimate rights with confidence and determination.'
