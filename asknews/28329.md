**The Erasure of Gaza: A Deliberate and Systematic Effort**
The Israeli war on Gaza continues, with the aim of erasing the Palestinian presence in the territory. The Israeli military has destroyed homes, infrastructure, and institutions, leaving Gaza in ruins. The goal is to create a humanitarian crisis, making it difficult for Palestinians to survive. The US-mediated ceasefire proposal, led by envoy Steve Wietkof, has failed to bring a lasting end to the violence. The proposal, which was accepted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, called for a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of 10 Palestinian prisoners and the return of the bodies of 38 Israeli citizens killed during the conflict. However, the proposal did not include any steps towards a long-term reduction in tensions or a political solution. The Israeli government has rejected international criticism, with some officials accusing French President Emmanuel Macron of hypocrisy due to France's colonial past. The US has also been criticized for its role in the conflict, with some accusing it of working as a channel for Israeli policy rather than a neutral mediator. The article concludes that the destruction of Gaza is a deliberate and systematic effort, supported by the US and Israel, and that the future of Gaza and the rule of international law are at stake.

**Israel-Palestine Conflict Escalates as Hamas Rejects US-Brokered Peace Plan**
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is escalating, with Hamas refusing to accept the current form of the US-brokered peace plan, while Israel continues to pursue a military solution. The plan, proposed by US envoy Steve Wietkoff, aims to establish a ceasefire and provide humanitarian aid to Gaza. However, Hamas has rejected the plan, citing its lack of guarantees for a permanent ceasefire and its bias towards Israel. The situation is further complicated by the internal divisions within Israel, with some officials calling for a more aggressive approach towards Hamas. Dr. Nashat Al-Aqush, a professor at Birzeit University, argues that Israel's goal is not just to defeat Hamas, but to eradicate the Palestinian presence in Gaza and the West Bank. He believes that Israel's strategy is to create a 'demographic vacuum' in Gaza, making it uninhabitable for Palestinians. Al-Aqush also points out that Israel's actions in Gaza are not limited to Hamas, but also target the broader Palestinian population. He warns that the current situation is a 'humanitarian catastrophe' and that any attempt to impose a ceasefire without a comprehensive halt to violence will only lead to further suffering. The US envoy's plan is seen as a 'trap' by some, as it does not provide a clear path to a lasting peace. The situation remains volatile, with both sides dug in and unwilling to compromise.

**Arab Committee Stands Firm on 'Two-State Solution' Despite Israeli Obstacles**
A delegation from the Arab Islamic Committee, tasked with international action to stop the Gaza war, has shown commitment to the 'two-state solution' despite Israeli attempts to hinder it. The delegation, led by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan, met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas via video conference and with Jordan's King Abdullah II, who emphasized the need for international support to enable the Palestinian people to achieve their legitimate rights and work towards a political horizon for peace based on the two-state solution. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said that Israel's refusal to cooperate with the visit 'is a manifestation and confirmation of its extremism and adherence to violence', adding that the committee will continue its diplomatic efforts to reach the two-state solution. Meanwhile, Israel has exploited Hamas's request to modify US envoy Steve Wietkoff's ceasefire proposal, launching a comprehensive military escalation and doubling down on deportation measures, resulting in the deaths and injuries of dozens.

**Israel-Palestine Conflict: Ceasefire Talks Stall Amid Ongoing Violence**
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues with no end in sight. The Hamas has accepted a US proposal for a ceasefire, but with conditions. The US proposal includes the release of 10 Palestinian prisoners and the return of the bodies of 18 Palestinian militants in exchange for the release of 10 Israeli hostages. However, the Hamas has added new conditions, including a longer timeframe for the release of the hostages and a guarantee that Israel will not resume hostilities after the ceasefire. The US has expressed optimism that a ceasefire can be reached soon, but the situation remains uncertain. Meanwhile, the Israeli military continues to launch airstrikes on Gaza, resulting in the deaths of at least 60 Palestinians in the past 24 hours. The international community has condemned Israel's actions, with France's President Emmanuel Macron calling for a more decisive response from Israel. The situation in Gaza remains dire, with over 2 million people in need of humanitarian aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has reported that it has distributed over 2 million meals to those in need, but the situation remains critical. The international community is calling for a ceasefire and an end to the violence, but a resolution remains elusive.

**International Community Shifts Stance on Israeli-Palestinian Conflict**
The international community's support for Israel after October 7, 2023, has changed dramatically over the past year and a half. Despite Israel's brutal actions in Gaza, the international community is now taking a more critical stance towards Israel. The Arab-Islamic Summit in November 2023 marked a significant shift in the international community's position, with the establishment of a committee to work towards a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The committee, which includes Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, Indonesia, and Nigeria, aims to promote a two-state solution and end the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The international community's shift in position is also reflected in the United Nations, where a recent resolution condemning Israel's actions in Gaza was passed with a significant majority. The French government has also taken a more critical stance towards Israel, with the country's foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, stating that the international community must take concrete actions to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The international community's shift in position is a significant development, and it marks a new era in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even if the Palestinian resistance were to be defeated, it would not mean a victory for Israel, as the international community's support for a two-state solution and an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine remains strong.

**US Envoy Proposes Modified Plan to End Gaza Conflict**
US envoy Steve Wietkof has proposed a modified plan to end the conflict in Gaza, which includes a 60-day ceasefire, the release of 10 Israeli prisoners and 18 Palestinian bodies, and the delivery of aid to Gaza. In exchange, Israel will release 180 Palestinian prisoners and 1111 Palestinians arrested since October 7, 2023. However, Hamas has rejected the proposal, citing the need for a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The Israeli government has accepted the proposal, but Hamas has not ruled out the possibility of continuing its military operations. The US envoy has stated that Hamas's response is 'unacceptable' and will lead to a withdrawal of the proposal. The Israeli government has also stated that Hamas's response is 'unacceptable' and will lead to a continuation of the military operations. The situation remains uncertain, with ongoing negotiations and secret meetings between the parties and mediators in Doha and Cairo.

**Egypt and Qatar reaffirm commitment to US plan for Gaza ceasefire**
Egypt and Qatar have reaffirmed their commitment to working towards a ceasefire in Gaza based on the US plan. In a joint statement, both governments stated that 'they continue their intense efforts to bring positions closer and resolve points of contention in order to achieve a ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip', in line with the plan promoted by US envoy Steve Witkoff. The mediators urged the conflicting parties to take responsibility and support the initiative, with the goal of restoring stability in the region. The document notes that Cairo and Doha hope to resume indirect negotiations, which have been stalled in recent weeks, and aim to achieve 'a 60-day temporary truce that leads to a permanent ceasefire'. According to the text, this agreement would contribute to alleviating the humanitarian crisis that Gaza is facing, under intense attacks since October 2023. A Israeli official confirmed on Thursday that the new proposal presented by US envoy Steve Witkoff provides for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, without implying a commitment from Israel to end the war. This confirmation, made to the Israeli medium The Times of Israel, aligns with previous statements from the terrorist group Hamas and Witkoff himself, who had outlined the central terms of the new negotiating framework. The proposal includes the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and the return of the bodies of 18 others in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire. During that period, the United Nations would resume the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza, a devastated area under almost eight months of intense hostilities. Despite the limited nature of the agreement, the proposal does not include any formal commitment from Israel to cease military operations definitively, which has been a central point of disagreement in the negotiations. 'The text of the agreement will not contain any Israeli promise to end the war,' said the Israeli official. Witkoff had announced on Wednesday from the White House that a new roadmap was to be presented and expressed his expectation that it could pave the way for a temporary truce and a broader solution. 'The President (Trump) will review it and I have very good expectations of achieving a temporary truce and a long-term solution,' said the US diplomat.

**The Wietkof Plan: A Pro-Israel Proposal to End the War in Gaza**
Stephen Wietkof, a 67-year-old American, was appointed as a special envoy by US President Donald Trump in May 2024, despite having no prior political experience. Wietkof is a strong supporter of Israel and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and has previously expressed his support for Trump's handling of the Middle East. The proposed 'Wietkof Plan' was presented by the US as a way to stop the war in Gaza, but it has been criticized for being biased towards Israel and imposing harsh conditions on Hamas. The plan does not include a ceasefire or an end to the war, and has been seen as a failure. According to expert Imtinas Shihada, Wietkof's proposal is a reflection of Trump's approach to the conflict, which is pro-Israel. Shihada notes that the US has been biased towards Israel since the beginning of the conflict, and that Wietkof's proposal is just an extension of this approach. He also believes that the days ahead will determine whether Trump's proposal will be a solution to the conflict or a continuation of it. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been waging a genocidal war on Gaza, backed by the US, resulting in the deaths of 55 Palestinians and over 118,610 injuries, as well as over 14,000 people missing under the rubble.

**Netanyahu's High-Stakes Gamble: The Gaza Ceasefire and the Two-State Solution**
Despite the efforts of Netanyahu to make a Palestinian state unviable, the international community continues to consider it as a plausible solution. A recent international summit in Madrid, attended by European and Arab states, agreed on the two-state solution as a way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu's attempts to finance Hamas through Qatar and build new settlements in the north of the West Bank have not been successful. Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Kantz, has stated that the ultimate goal of these settlements is to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. However, 146 countries have already recognized Palestine as a state, indicating a strong consensus in the international community. Yair Golan, a member of the opposition, has stated that 'Israel would become a pariah state if it continues the war.' The opposition has taken action, with Golan offering a pre-election coalition to Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid that prioritizes the end of the war, diplomatic solutions, and a two-state solution. The US has proposed a 60-day ceasefire, which would involve Hamas releasing 10 hostages and 18 bodies, in exchange for the release of 125 Palestinian prisoners and 1,100 detainees in Gaza. The ceasefire would also involve negotiations for a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.

**Hamas Hostage Deal: 10 Living & 18 Bodies - War End Demand - TIme News**
A 39-day Israel-Hamas ceasefire has been proposed, but experts warn that it may be a 'fragile hope' or a 'false dawn'. The deal includes the release of 10 living hostages and 18 bodies. However, several factors could derail the ceasefire, including Hamas's potential demands for changes to the US proposal, Israel's insistence on disarmament, and the deep-seated mistrust between the two sides. The international community, including the US, will likely play a crucial role in shaping the 'day after' in Gaza, but the path forward remains uncertain. Dr. Alana Bloom, a political science professor specializing in Middle Eastern conflict resolution, notes that a lasting peace will require not only a cessation of hostilities but also a comprehensive political solution that addresses the underlying causes of the conflict. 'The conflict between Israel and Hamas has significant implications for the United States,' she says. 'As a key ally of Israel and a major player in the Middle East, the US has a vested interest in promoting stability in the region.'

**Spain urges immediate Gaza war halt and progress on Two-State Solution - Khaama Press**
Spain's Foreign Minister Manuel Albares called for an immediate end to the 'massacre' in Gaza and an end to the ongoing conflict during a high-level Madrid summit. Albares emphasized the need to end Israel's 'inhumane war' in Gaza, lift the blockade on humanitarian aid, and move decisively toward a two-state solution. He also highlighted the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, called for an arms embargo on Israel, and pledged Spain's continued support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) alongside increased humanitarian aid for Gaza. Albares described the war in Gaza as an 'open wound for humanity' that continues to claim victims daily, warning that silence equates to complicity in the ongoing massacre. Spain, which officially recognized Palestine as an independent state in 2024, remains a strong advocate for the two-state solution.

**Germany Calls for Immediate End to Gaza War and Progress towards Two-State Solution**
German State Minister Florian Hahn emphasized the need for an immediate end to the destructive war in Gaza and progress towards a two-state solution. In a written statement before his visits to Madrid and Jerusalem, Hahn stated, 'Firstly, the immediate end to the destructive war in Gaza. This requires the release of hostages, the urgent improvement of the humanitarian situation in Gaza, the elimination of the threat from Hamas, and progress towards a two-state solution to resolve the Middle East conflict in the long term. Secondly, the rising anti-Semitism requires clear and concrete measures to address this global issue.' Hahn stressed that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is unbearable and that Hamas is holding Israeli and German hostages, which is why they continue to advocate for a ceasefire and support a two-state solution. He added, 'We have a clear stance against the construction of settlements in the West Bank, settler violence, and annexation efforts. We also support the reform and strengthening of the Palestinian government in Ramallah, including the long-term regional economic and political integration of Israel and Palestine. All of these measures must be taken in a way that ensures Israel's long-term security.' Hahn will attend the Two-State Solution Promotion Group Foreign Ministers Meeting in Madrid today and the Anti-Semitism Conference of Foreign Ministers in Jerusalem on May 26-28.

**Two-state solution is path to lasting Middle East peace**
Israel and Hamas have resumed ceasefire talks in Doha, with Hamas agreeing to release more hostages in exchange for a 60-day truce and Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners. However, the timing is ironic as Israel has escalated operations in Gaza, carrying out airstrikes and deploying ground forces. According to Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, Hamas has changed its position due to the military operation. The core obstacle to ending the 19-month war is a fundamental mismatch in demands, with Hamas insisting on a full Israeli withdrawal and lasting truce, and Israel refusing to end the war before destroying Hamas and recovering all remaining hostages. The international community, including European leaders and Arab leaders, has condemned the crisis and called for an immediate end to the violence, emphasizing the need for a durable ceasefire and the two-state solution. China has also reaffirmed its stance that only a permanent ceasefire and the two-state solution can break the cycle of violence. As China's deputy permanent representative to the UN said, Israel's blockade and military operations have pushed Gaza into 'unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe' since October 2023.

**Thousands Demand End to Gaza War and Political Solution at Jerusalem Rally**
Over 5,000 people gathered in Jerusalem on Friday (09.05.2025) to demand an end to the war in Gaza and a political solution to the conflict. The event, called 'It's Time', was attended by Israeli soldiers, families of hostages, public figures, and leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Palestinian President Mahmud Abás. 'It's a collective call: stop the war, now it's time for a political solution,' said the statement sent to EFE by Physicians for Human Rights, one of the organizations behind the event, the People's Peace Summit. The gathering is the largest civilian protest against the war since the start of the offensive in October 2023, according to the 'It's Time' coalition, an alliance of over 60 organizations that organized the meeting with the support of New Israel Fund (NIF), a US-based NGO that finances progressive Israeli groups. The participants heard video messages from international leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron, who praised the value of those present for working 'for coexistence and peace.' 'Peace is possible,' said Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abás from Ramala, adding that 'through justice, we can ensure security and a future for all people in the region.' Ilana Kamin-Kaminka, who lost her son in Hamas' attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, said that Israel is trapped in a 'circle of bloodshed for a century' and appealed to democracy. 'We owe it to our children,' she added. Other participants included Arab and Jewish politicians, such as former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, retired Israeli military officer and politician Yair Golan, and Palestinian-origin lawyer and politician Ayman Odeh. According to The Times of Israel, Olmert stated that Gaza belongs to the Palestinians and should be part of a future Palestinian state, while defending the two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.

**UNRWA Condemns 'Systematic Starvation' of Gaza and 'Silent Killing' of One Million Palestinian Children**
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has condemned the 'systematic starvation' of Gaza and the 'silent killing' of one million Palestinian children. The agency's spokesperson, Juliette Touma, stated that the blockade, which began on March 2, 2024, is the longest in the history of the Gaza Strip, lasting four times longer than the blockade imposed by Israeli forces at the start of the war on October 7, 2023. UNRWA's Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, expressed his deep concern over the 'brutality' with which Israeli forces are treating UNRWA staff in detention centers, using physical violence and forcing them to make false confessions. In New York, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that 'there is no end in sight to the killing and suffering in Gaza,' and that the promise of a two-state solution is facing the risk of collapse. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denied any progress in negotiations with Hamas over a prisoner exchange, despite Egyptian sources claiming that 'significant progress' had been made in Cairo. The Israeli delegation, led by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, met with Egyptian Intelligence Chief Hassan Mahmoud Rashad in Cairo on Monday evening, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The proposed agreement includes a five-year ceasefire in exchange for the release of all prisoners held by both sides. However, it is expected that Israel will reject this proposal. The Egyptian government has also announced that it will establish a buffer zone in Rafah and a secure area between the Philadelphi Corridor and the Egyptian border, as part of a new mechanism to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches Gaza without being diverted to Hamas. The negotiations have seen progress on many points, but there are still significant disagreements that need to be resolved in the coming hours to reach a ceasefire agreement.

**Expert Calls for Two-State Solution to End Israeli-Palestinian Conflict**
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues, with 17 months having passed since the Hamas massacre on October 7. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has intensified his response to free the remaining hostages. A French expert believes that Netanyahu's strategy, which does not spare the Gaza population, is unlikely to succeed. The expert suggests that a two-state solution is the only viable option, where Israel and Palestine can coexist peacefully. The expert also proposes that the international community, including Europe and France, recognize the Palestinian state. The expert estimates that the reconstruction of Gaza would cost between 55 and 75 billion dollars over five years, and proposes that a force of international technocrats, with massive funding, be established to oversee the process. The expert also suggests that a port, airport, and other infrastructure projects be built to provide a better life for the people of Gaza. The expert believes that with a recognized Palestinian state, the conflict would not have escalated to the point of the October 7 massacre. The expert also criticizes the French far-right politician Jordan Bardella for meeting with Israeli officials, saying it is 'inadmissible' and that Bardella's party is 'against the peace'.

**Palestinian Ambassador to UN: Israel's Plan is to Eliminate Palestinian Presence**
Palestinian Ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, stated that Israel's plan is to eliminate the Palestinian presence, and her dream is to end the conflict by erasing the Palestinian people. He said, 'Israel's plan is clear in Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the rest of the West Bank - to eliminate the Palestinian demographic presence to end the Palestinian geography.' Mansour added, 'Israel has this recurring dream that she will end this conflict through the disappearance of the Palestinian people.' He emphasized that 'failed recipes' in the past will not achieve a different future, and that the history of the Palestinian people is 'filled with wars waged by Israel and threats that they will be decisive but were not.' Mansour stressed that 'the idea that more oppression, brutality, and repression will lead to peace is madness, and the idea that more killing, mutilation, and displacement will bring security is a illusion.' He emphasized that 'there is no military solution to this conflict, but only a political one,' and that 'there is only one way to move forward: maintaining the ceasefire in Gaza and ensuring its complete implementation according to Security Council Resolution 2735, and ending the escalation and aggression in the West Bank.' Mansour also shared an audio recording of the moment when 15-year-old Liyan Hamada was killed by Israeli fire in Gaza in January 2024, after she called the Palestinian Red Crescent Society after her parents and siblings were killed by Israeli fire. Liyan said, 'They are firing at us... we are inside the car and the tank next to us.' After that, her 6-year-old cousin, Hend Rjeb, picked up the phone and said, 'They are dead. I am inside the car... the night is approaching. I am afraid. Please come and take me.' Mansour said, 'Our children deserve empathy and solidarity,' and emphasized that 'peace is possible.' Between October 7, 2023, and January 19, 2025, Israel committed a genocide in Gaza that left over 160,000 Palestinians killed or injured, most of them children and women, and more than 14,000 missing. On January 19, 2025, an agreement to stop the fighting and exchange prisoners between Hamas and Israel began, which includes 3 phases lasting 42 days each, with the condition of negotiating the next phase before the current phase ends. In contrast, since January 21, 2025, the Israeli army has expanded its military operations, which it called 'the Iron Wall,' in Palestinian cities and refugee camps in the north of the West Bank, especially in Jenin, Tulkarm, and Tubas, leaving 61 dead, according to the Ministry of Health, and displacing tens of thousands, and causing widespread destruction. The Palestinian authorities warn that this operation comes 'within the framework of Netanyahu's government plan to annex the West Bank and declare sovereignty over it, which may represent a formal announcement of the death of the two-state solution.' The Israeli army has expanded its operations in the north of the West Bank after the escalation of Israeli military and settler attacks in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since the start of the genocide in Gaza on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the killing of at least 924 Palestinians, injuring around 7,000 people, and arresting 14,500 others, according to official Palestinian statistics. Israel has occupied lands in Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon for decades, refuses to withdraw from them, and rejects the establishment of a Palestinian state, with its capital in East Jerusalem, on the pre-1967 borders.

**African Union Summit: The Two-State Solution is the Only Way to End the Conflict**
The final statement of the 38th ordinary session of the African Union, which concluded its work on February 16, 2025, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, emphasized that the two-state solution is the only way to end the conflict and achieve stability. The statement condemned the Israeli war and the brutal attack on the Gaza Strip, and rejected Israel's violations of international law and its targeting of civilians and infrastructure. The statement also emphasized that the forced displacement of Palestinians from their land is a violation of international law, and that 'Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians and must be tried internationally.' The African leaders called for a halt to any form of cooperation or normalization with Israel until it ends its occupation and aggression against Palestine. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed the final statement of the African Union, particularly its stance on the occupation and aggression of Israel and the war of extermination against our people. The statement also rejected the plans for displacement and annexation. The Ministry congratulated the African leaders, the peoples of the continent, and their governments on the success of the summit, wishing them all progress, prosperity, and stability. In his speech to the summit, the President reiterated his absolute rejection of any calls for the forced displacement of our people from their land, which would keep the region in a circle of violence instead of moving towards peace. He said, 'Whoever thinks they can impose a new century deal, or displace our Palestinian people and take over any inch of our land, is mistaken.' He added that calls for the displacement of our people from their land and the annexation of our land are aimed at distracting the world from the crimes of war and genocide and destruction in Gaza, and the crimes of settlement and attempts to annex the West Bank. The President emphasized that the only place that the million and a half refugees in the Gaza Strip should return to is their cities and villages inside the country. He stressed that the practices of Israeli colonialism require urgent action from the international community and the UN Security Council before the forces of extremism work to bury the two-state solution.

**A Future for Gaza: Is it Possible?**
After 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas, a ceasefire was signed in January 2025. However, the governance of Gaza remains uncertain, and Donald Trump has proposed placing the enclave under American control. Trump envisions making Gaza a luxury tourist destination, a 'Mediterranean Riviera' in the Middle East, by attracting international investments. He claims that no American soldiers will be necessary and that Gaza will be handed over to the US by Israel once the war is over. Trump also plans to resettle Palestinians in Egypt and Jordan, a plan criticized by his detractors as 'ethnic cleansing'. Israel welcomes this initiative with broad political support, including from the center and left. Netanyahu and Trump, with their strong alliance, see this project as a confirmation of Hamas' strategic defeat and a step forward for Israel's annexation plan of the West Bank. However, this plan violates UN resolutions and raises questions about the future of Palestinians and regional stability. 'This project may mark the end of the two-state solution,' said Sarah Daoud, a political science doctorate associated with the CERI of Sciences-Po and the CEDEJ of Cairo. 'The international community must react without exacerbating tensions.' The question remains whether Egypt and Jordan have the necessary power to play a role in this crisis.
