**Airfare Prices to Drop by 15-20% During Two Summer Periods**
According to data from online booking platforms, airfare prices for direct flights from the UAE to Arab destinations will be relatively stable throughout the summer, except for two periods where prices will drop by 15-20% on average. The first period is from June 13 to 22, and the second is from July 25 to August 4. The data includes prices for direct flights from the UAE to Cairo, Amman, Beirut, and Alexandria for a 7-day trip. The data shows significant price increases in airfare during two peak periods in the coming months, one during the Eid al-Adha holiday in early June and the other during the start of the summer break in late June and early July. According to the data, airfare prices will be under pressure at the end of August and the beginning of September due to high demand for return flights after the summer break. Bader Al Ahli, the CEO of Dubai World Tours, said that the demand for travel during the summer is currently high, citing bookings for various destinations for both tourism and visit purposes. He noted that airfare prices are relatively stable compared to last summer, but with higher demand, there may be some price increases. Al Ahli emphasized the importance of early planning to get the best deals on airfare, especially for popular destinations. He advised travelers to monitor airline offers and use electronic comparison tools to track price changes and receive notifications. Yassin Diab, the general manager of Faisal Travel Agency, said that the high demand for flights during the Eid al-Adha period is the main driver of price increases, followed by a lull before the start of the summer break. He noted that prices tend to drop during this period, only to rise again with the start of the summer break. Diab emphasized the need for early planning and booking to avoid high prices and limited options. He advised travelers to book their flights and accommodations well in advance to ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip.

**Erbil International Airport Begins New Era in Receiving International Flights**
The Erbil International Airport has begun a new era in receiving international flights and night landings. According to Hirdi Salih, the spokesperson for the airport, 'preliminary tests have been conducted to open night flights at the airport, which started today with the arrival of a technical team from Radiola to conduct the annual inspection of air traffic control and automatic landing systems and to conduct preliminary tests to open night flights at the airport.' Salih added that 'opening night flights is part of the strategic plan to ensure the efficiency and readiness of air communication and navigation systems and the need to conduct regular inspections to enhance aviation safety and ensure communication between air traffic controllers and aircraft according to international standards.' The airport administration announced in January 2025 that a committee from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) visited the airport to inspect it and include it in the list of international airports within the next two months. Salih said that 'Erbil International Airport will soon be included in the list of international airports after the ICAO committee and another committee from the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority conducted a field visit to the airport and inspected the completed facilities.' He added that 'the airport's night runway is now ready in terms of lighting, presence of night controllers, and other equipment completed by the organization, which praised the international standards applied in the airport.' The airport currently operates daily flights to several international airports in the region, and with its inclusion in the list of international airports, it will be able to increase the number of flights to other airports around the world after completing the required administrative procedures within the next two months.
