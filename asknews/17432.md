**Ghosted Again? The AI Love Revolution of 2025**
In 2025, people are turning to AI partners as a solution to the problems of traditional dating, such as ghosting and emotional unavailability. According to a software developer, Emma, 'I've been ghosted more times than I can remember. You get emotionally involved and then they disappear. It's exhausting and disheartening.' AI partners, on the other hand, offer consistency and emotional reliability, with 340% increase in AI partner sites since 2023. Dr. Rebecca Chen, a relationship psychologist, explains that 'With an AI partner, all of this is explicit and adjustable. It's a comfort factor that humans, unfortunately, do not possess.' Many users find AI partners to be a supplement to their social circle, helping them learn to communicate better and build confidence in their human relationships. However, critics worry about the potential for codependency and detachment from reality, as well as data privacy concerns.

**Bill Gates' Vision for 2025: A World Where Work is Optional**
Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, believes that 'we were not born to work, work is an artifice derived from scarcity'. He predicts that by 2025, AI will change our lives, making it possible to have a more balanced and creative life. Gates thinks that as AI eliminates routine tasks, society will have more free time. However, he acknowledges that reprogramming our mindset will be a significant challenge. He believes that only three professions will survive the automation revolution: biologists, energy experts, and programmers. Gates is optimistic about the future, envisioning a world where the workweek will be reduced to just two days in the next ten years. He sees AI as a key to achieving a more balanced and creative life, where people can focus on activities such as education, leisure, or creativity. 'Innovation can solve global problems', he said, maintaining his faith in human progress. 'We didn't come to work to survive, we came to work to create', Gates added, emphasizing the importance of human intelligence in providing a wide range of services.'

**Pop star says we're 'on cusp of extinction' as AI robots consider humans a 'nuisance' - Daily Star**
Pop star Gary Numan has expressed concerns that humans may become extinct due to the rise of Artificial Intelligence. He stated, 'AI could be the end of us. When it becomes self-aware, we'll be considered a nuisance.' Numan believes that humans are a hindrance to the smooth operation of the world and that our extinction would be beneficial for nature. This sentiment is shared by others, including Nobel Prize winner Sir Demis Hassabis, who thinks humans could be 'obsolete' within the next decade. Legendary film director Ridley Scott also warned of the dangers of AI, stating that it could 'turn medieval' and that humans would be in trouble if the AI becomes emotional. Rapper Ice-T also expressed his fears, saying that robots will 'eat us' and that there's nothing that can be done to stop it.

**Can Artificial Intelligence Help Solve the Millennium Problems?**
The Clay Mathematics Institute's 'Millennium Problems' have been unsolved for 25 years, with only one problem, the Poincaré Conjecture, being solved by Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman. The other six problems remain unsolved, but researchers believe that artificial intelligence (AI) may be able to help. AI can process vast amounts of data and find hidden patterns that elude human understanding. For example, in the theory of knots, AI has already discovered new, unexpected connections. Additionally, AI has helped in the work on the Navier-Stokes equations, where machine learning has narrowed down the search for solutions. While AI is not a panacea, it can complement human ingenuity and creativity, and may lead to new insights and discoveries. As Marcus du Sautoy notes, 'I suspect that over the next decade we may see the emergence of some interesting new hypotheses that we wouldn't have been able to see without using this tool.'

**UFC and Meta Partner to Develop AI-Powered Ranking System**
The UFC has partnered with Meta to develop an AI-powered system for ranking fighters. The system, which will be introduced at the end of this year, will use machine learning algorithms to generate and update rankings automatically and constantly. The current system, which relies on anonymous votes from journalists and analysts, has been criticized for its inconsistencies, such as the case of Ilia Topuria, who lost his title but still holds the third spot in the rankings. Dana White, the UFC president, wants to end such situations and believes that the AI system will provide a more accurate and fair ranking. However, he also recognizes that the AI system will not solve all problems and that the traditional system will continue to exist alongside it. 'I wouldn't be surprised if the AI didn't solve all the problems,' White said. 'So we'll have two rankings: the AI one and the human one.' The partnership with Meta is part of a broader agreement with TKO Group Holdings and aims to leverage the latest technological innovations to enhance the fan experience and interaction.

**Why AI, even AGI, will not be the end of human work.**
The author argues that even if AI surpasses human capabilities, it will not lead to the end of human work. The two fundamental reasons for this are: 1) Human Problems: new problems will always arise, and AI will not be able to solve them all. 2) Fragmentation: AI will always encounter information gaps or 'out of reach' data, requiring human intervention. The author uses examples such as war strategy and disease research to illustrate this point. In these scenarios, AI may be able to automate certain tasks, but human decision-making and problem-solving will still be necessary. The author concludes that humans will continue to play a role in unlocking AI's potential, particularly in areas where information is fragmented or requires human judgment. The author also speculates that humans may become 'hybridised' with AI through brain-computer interfaces, but this is still uncertain.

**Google AI Solves 10-Year-Old Problem in Just Two Days**
Google's artificial intelligence (AI) system solved a problem that scientists had been working on for 10 years in just two days. According to The Independent, the AI was given a short hint about how some super-bacteria develop antibiotic resistance, and it provided several answers, including one that the scientists knew was correct. The experiment was led by researchers from the Imperial College London. 'Our results show that AI has the potential to synthesize all existing evidence and direct us to the most important questions and experimental plans,' said one of the study's leaders. This achievement is part of a growing trend in AI-assisted research, including a system developed by Russian scientists that can automatically detect heart fibrosis using MRI data.

**AI Becomes Our Best Ally in Solving Math Problems That Seem Impossible**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to solve complex mathematical problems that seemed impossible. Beyond its everyday applications, AI is being used in the design of medications, disease diagnosis, industrial process optimization, and the analysis of complex physical or chemical mechanisms. It is also being used to solve math problems that have been difficult to solve for a long time. The algorithms that use deep neural networks and machine learning are designed to identify complex patterns in large amounts of information, allowing them to recognize images, voices, or process natural language with great efficiency. Meta AI, the AI developed by Meta, was able to generalize the Lyapunov function in October 2024. This is a significant achievement, as mathematicians have been trying to find a general method to identify Lyapunov functions since 1892, but have not been successful. However, Meta AI was able to do so by training a model to recognize patterns and relationships between certain dynamic systems and their corresponding Lyapunov functions. This is a major breakthrough, as it allows us to approach complex mathematical problems in a new way, identifying patterns that were previously hidden from humans. However, AI still has to improve to help us solve the great challenges that humanity faces. Sergei Gukov, a professor of theoretical physics and mathematics at Caltech, is leading a team of researchers who are using AI to solve advanced mathematical problems that require millions or even billions of steps. They are currently working on the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, a problem in group combinatorial theory proposed 60 years ago. While they have not yet solved the main conjecture, they have been able to refute several families of related problems that had been open for over 25 years. Gukov recognizes that current AI models have significant limitations when facing very complex mathematical problems, but he hopes that in the future, this technology will allow humans to solve the millennium problems.

**Anthropic Predicts AI Will Reach Nobel Prize-Level Intelligence by 2026-2027**
Anthropic, a leading AI research organization, has predicted that AI will reach Nobel Prize-level intelligence by 2026-2027. They have submitted six suggestions to the US government to accelerate AI innovation and risk control. Meanwhile, the US military has decided to integrate AI into its operational planning and combat actions. The US military has signed a contract with Scale AI to develop AI-powered systems for military planning and operations. The systems will be able to perform tasks such as text generation, audio and video generation, autonomous operation of mice and keyboards, and browsing the internet. The US military plans to deploy these systems in the initial stages in Hawaii and Germany, and then expand to all 11 joint combat commands. Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, has predicted that by 2026-2027, humans will witness the birth of powerful AI systems that possess the following characteristics: cross-disciplinary intelligence, digital interfaces, long-term problem-solving, and interaction with the physical world. These predictions are not mere fantasies, as Anthropic's latest models, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code, have shown significant improvements in AI capabilities and autonomy. The US government has also taken action to accelerate AI deployment, with the Pentagon signing a contract with Scale AI to develop AI-powered systems for military planning and operations. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into military operations, Anthropic has emphasized the need for the US government to take decisive action to maintain its technological leadership and balance the economic and security impacts of AI.

**Madhyamik ends; AI 'emerges as new cheating tool'**
The Madhyamik 2025 exams in West Bengal have revealed a new method of cheating using Artificial Intelligence (AI). For the first time, a student was caught using an AI app to solve maths problems during the exam. According to Board officials, six students were caught with mobile phones, with three sending question paper images to private tutors, one to a senior, and another to a friend's 'special friend'. The sixth student relied on an AI-powered app to solve the questions. Despite this, there was a decline in exam-related cheating compared to last year, with 43 students caught in 2024 and only 20 this year. Officials credited stronger security measures, including serial-numbered watermarks on question papers, and regular awareness campaigns. However, a controversy arose in Malda, where the District Inspector (DI) of Schools (Secondary) allegedly handled exam duties despite his ward appearing for the Madhyamik exam. WBBSE president Ramanuj Ganguly expressed satisfaction over the smooth conduct of the exams and thanked students, guardians, schools, and the state administration for their cooperation, saying, 'We hope all students performed well. The results will be published on time.'

**Google's AI Solves 84% of IMO Geometric Problems, Outperforms Human Gold Medal Winners**
Google's DeepMind has released a new math AI called AlphaGeometry2, which has solved 84% of the geometric problems in the IMO competition from 2000 to 2024. The AI completed 42 out of 50 problems, a 15-problem increase from last year's model. In contrast, OpenAI's o1 and Gemini Flash Thinking were unable to solve any of the problems. Nature magazine praised the AI, saying it has 'crushed' mathematical problems and reached the level of gold medal winners, comparable to top human players. The AI's ability to solve problems quickly was demonstrated in the 2024 competition, where it completed the fourth problem in just 19 seconds. The problem required proving that the sum of angles ∠KIL and ∠XPY is 180°. The AI constructed a complex auxiliary structure to prove the problem, with the positions of the auxiliary points predicted by the neural network. The AI's four major upgrades include: 1) a domain-specific language with 9 basic 'predicates' that can cover 66% of IMO geometric problems, but not linear equations or point/line/circle movements; 2) a more powerful symbol reasoning engine DDAR2, which can handle 2D and 3D geometry, inequalities, and non-linear equations; 3) a new search algorithm SKEST, which can search for proof paths more efficiently; and 4) a stronger language model Gemini, which can generate more accurate and efficient proofs. However, the AI is not open-source, and the 2025 IMO competition will be held in Australia in July.
