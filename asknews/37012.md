**The "bracelet" for the tracking of patients on call was launched at the Evangelism - How the new system will work - ProtoThema English**
The Evangelismos hospital in Greece has launched a new system to track patients in emergency rooms, allowing doctors to monitor tests and 'stops' made by patients. The pilot program will be extended to 14 hospitals by mid-July and 80 hospitals by January 2026. Patients will receive a portable GPS device and a 'wristband' with a barcode, which will record their route and waiting times. The data will be collected on a digital platform, enabling the Ministry of Health to identify 'problematic spots' in on-call services and promote interventions. According to Health Minister Adonis Georgiades, the new system will provide real data, enable targeted policies, and allow patients to know waiting times in advance. 'We will collect real data on what is happening and we will be able to intervene in conditions of excessive delay,' Georgiades said. 'In a short time, everyone will know, depending on the hospital we choose, how long the waiting time will be.'

**Amid housing crisis, London looks to fast-track large multi-unit buildings | CBC News**
The City of London is looking to fast-track large-scale housing developments to address the housing crisis. A report outlines a process that combines two approval stages for developers who commit to starting construction by 2025. The list of 31 projects considered good candidates for fast-tracking includes a 340-unit building proposed by Farhi Developments and a proposal by Royal Premier Homes to build 182 new units. Mike Wallace, executive director of the London Development Institute, said the fast-track option will be helpful to his members, while Planner Mike Davis of Siv-ik Planning and Design emphasized the need for a critical lens in prioritizing projects. Paul Kitson, vice president of planning with Westdell, supports the move to streamline approval steps but noted that projects can be held up by quibbles with city staff.

**Tracking the Purge**
The Project 2025 tracker has visually demonstrated the progress of the Trump administration's initiatives, with over one-third (105 out of 301) already executed and 44 more in progress. The site breaks down progress by agency and project objectives, showing a far-right agenda to erase civil rights progress, whitewash American history, and marginalize women. Initiatives include dismantling USAID, removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization, and allowing political appointees to 'personally review and authorize appropriated funding.' The author argues that these actions are fascist and push a Christian nationalist agenda, denying racism and perpetuating the belief that white men are victims of a 'woke' agenda. The author cites research to support their claims, stating that white men hold most CEO roles, dominate Congress, and receive better medical treatment, among other privileges.

**Trump's 'Project 2025': A Threat to Democracy?**
US President Donald Trump is implementing the 'Project 2025', a 922-page strategic document that outlines his plans for restructuring the US government. The document, which was written by the Heritage Foundation, a national-conservative think tank, aims to give the president absolute power over institutions. According to the document, over 42% of the program's objectives have been achieved in less than two months, with 100 projects out of 302 completed. The document also mentions the imposition of higher tariffs on imports from countries such as China, Taiwan, India, and the European Union. Adrienne Cobb, the creator of the 'Project 2025 Tracker' website, warns that the project is a 'major threat to democracy and the common good', and that it is essential for Americans to understand its implications. The website, which attracts between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors daily, has been translated into several languages and is available online.

**Tracking SCRD project progress to get simpler**
The Sunshine Coast Regional District (SCRD) has developed a reporting and prioritization tool to track project progress and simplify the process of finding out what's going on with current projects. The tool is a spreadsheet that lists approved projects with resourcing details, including monetary budget and assigned staff hours. A red line indicates the limits of the organization's current capacity, with projects above the line prioritized for implementation in 2025 and those below it formally deferred for reconsideration in 2026. Chief administrative officer Tina Perreault explained that as projects above the red line are completed, capacity is anticipated to free up for projects below the line to move up. The plan is to act as a tool for both board decision-making and operational execution, and an updated version of the workplan report is slated to be in front of directors every two months. Perreault said this might not happen when 2025 Q1 reports come forward in April, but she will be pushing for it to be available when 2025 Q2 results go to elected officials in July. The tool is expected to provide something that is not too cumbersome and highlight areas where attention is needed rather than going line by line through a couple of hundred different things.' Kelly Backs, committee chair and Area D director, was 'overjoyed' to introduce the item, stating, 'It is one of the best pieces I have seen in my two and a half years on the board,' and something that will help 'organize the organization.'
