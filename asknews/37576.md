**Taiwanese Tech Industry Faces Uncertainty in May Amid US Tariffs and Currency Appreciation**
The Taiwanese technology industry is facing significant uncertainty in May due to the US's 'equal tariff' policy and the New Taiwan Dollar's appreciation. Despite the 90-day grace period for US tariffs on China, the industry is expected to face increased pressure. However, some analysts believe that traditional IT companies will accelerate their shipments to the US, reducing pressure, while the memory market is expected to see a price increase due to Chinese subsidies and US demand. AI servers continue to be a bright spot for the industry, but design changes to the GB300 may delay production, leading to increased sales of the GB200, which will positively impact component sales such as assembly, cabinets, and heat dissipation. However, the easing of tensions between the US and China has reduced systemic risk and decreased stock market volatility, but individual stock recommendations have decreased, and investors should focus on companies such as Yitai (3289), Xinjin (1582), TSMC (2308), and Kinching (8210) for future performance. Analysts note that while downstream companies may see short-term revenue growth due to pre-shipment, upstream companies are affected by production cycles and exchange rates, limiting growth. In addition, the short-term recovery of PC/NB/phone/TV demand in China is expected to be offset by supply chain chaos and US tariffs on Europe, leading to instability. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to see a positive impact from the US's 'America First' policy, which is driving the production of pharmaceuticals back to the US, affecting Taiwan's CDMO industry. Specifically, companies such as Evergreen (1565) are expected to see low single-digit growth, while Mei Shi (1795) may see a decline in May revenue due to a high base in April, and Baoli (6472) is expected to see stable orders in May, with increased demand in the US in the second half of the year, while Visun's silicon water gel products are expected to see increased exports to Japan and Europe in the second half of the year.

**China's Industrial Activity Contracts for Second Straight Month**
China's industrial activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, despite a temporary ceasefire in its trade war with the US. Official data showed that factory production declined, with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling to 49.5 points. This is higher than the 49 points recorded in April, but still below the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the country's GDP continued to expand in May, with some 'US-related companies' reporting a surge in foreign trade orders and improved import and export conditions. However, the non-manufacturing PMI, which measures service sector activity, fell to 50.3 points from 50.4 points in April. Chinese leaders aim to achieve 5% economic growth this year, a target considered ambitious by many economists, given the weakness in domestic consumption.

**China's Industrial Activity Shows Signs of Recovery in May**
China's industrial activity continued to show signs of recovery in May, driven by an acceleration in industrial production and an improvement in market expectations. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector reached 49.5 points in May, up 0.5 points from April. Although still below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction, the increase indicates a gradual recovery trajectory. 'The improvement reflects an acceleration of production and more positive business expectations', said Zhao Qinghe, a statistician at the NBS. The sub-index of production rose to 50.7 points, representing an increase of 0.9 points from the previous month, while the sub-index of new orders reached 49.8, signaling greater dynamism in domestic demand. Large industrial enterprises led the recovery, with their PMI reaching 50.7, returning to the expansion zone after a 1.5-point increase. Strategic sectors, such as high-tech, recorded continuous growth for the fourth consecutive month, reaching 50.9. The equipment and consumer goods manufacturing segments also advanced, with PMIs of 51.2 and 50.2, respectively. Expectations of production and commercial activity for the next months also improved, with the sub-index measuring this perception rising to 52.5, indicating optimism among entrepreneurs about growth in the short term. According to Zhao Qinghe, this result reinforces that recent efforts to boost the economy - with a focus on more intense macroeconomic policies - are starting to bear fruit. Analysts consulted by Xinhua observed that this positive movement in the indicators may signal the beginning of a more sustained recovery of the manufacturing sector, a traditional driver of the Chinese economy.

**China's Industrial Production Contracts for Second Straight Month Amid Trade Tensions**
China's industrial production contracted for the second consecutive month in May, according to an official survey released on Saturday. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 49.5 from 49.0 in April, but remained below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The PMI for the service sector, which includes construction, fell to 50.3 from 50.4. However, the sub-index for new orders improved to 49.8 from 49.2 in April, and the sub-index for new export orders rose to 47.5 from 44.7. The data suggests that further economic stimulus measures may be needed to support the economy amid the ongoing trade tensions with the US. US President Donald Trump has accused China of violating a bilateral agreement to reduce tariffs, and has threatened to double global steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. 'The recent developments between China and the US indicate that bilateral relations are not improving,' said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 'Companies in China and the US that are active in international trade must conduct their business under persistently high uncertainty, which will weigh on growth prospects in both countries.'

**Tatarstan's Industrial Production Index Rises by 6.6% in Q1 2025**
Tatarstan's industrial production index rose by 6.6% in the first quarter of 2025, driven by a 13.7% increase in manufacturing. The production of motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers grew by 10.2%, while the production of chemicals and chemical products increased by 9.5%. The fastest-growing sectors in Tatarstan were rubber and plastic products (+35.1%), metallurgical production (+21.3%), and furniture manufacturing (+20.5%). In contrast, the production of clothing (-28.4%), textiles (-15%), and pharmaceuticals and materials (-14.2%) declined. Tatarstan has surpassed Moscow in growth, with an industrial production index of 106.6% compared to Moscow's 105%. Vladislav Bukharsky, junior director for sovereign and regional ratings at Expert RA, comments, 'The industrial production dynamics of Tatarstan in the first quarter of 2025 look more positive compared to the national average (+6.6% versus 1.1%).' Olga Belenkaya, the head of macroeconomic analysis at Finam Group, notes, 'A strong increase in Tatarstan’s manufacturing sector in the first quarter of 2025 was driven by several industries, including chemical production (+9.5%), the production of rubber and plastic products (+35.1%), and the production of motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers (+10.2%).' However, maintaining such growth rates may prove challenging, as the decline in mineral extraction (-4.5%) is only slightly above the national figure (-3.7%), and the production of coke and petroleum products declined by 0.8%.

**India's manufacturing PMI eased to three-month low in May | Mint**
India's manufacturing sector activity dropped to a three-month low in May, with the HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling to 57.6 from 58.2 in April and 58.1 in March. Despite this, the sector showed robust growth, with employment rising at a record pace and input purchases increasing. However, input cost inflation hit a six-month high, prompting a sharp rise in selling prices. According to Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, 'India's May manufacturing PMI signalled another month of robust growth in the sector, although the rate of expansion in output and new orders eased from the previous month.' The acceleration in employment growth is a positive development, but manufacturers are facing higher costs for materials such as aluminium, cement, and iron. The sector's growth is expected to continue, with GDP growth projected between 6.3% and 6.8% for FY26.

The US and China had agreed to suspend some tariffs for 90 days, but US President Donald Trump accused China of violating the agreement on Friday. The Chinese economic data showed that the country's GDP continued to grow in May, but with some improvement in trade conditions. 'According to some US-related companies, foreign trade orders have resumed their rapid pace, and import and export conditions have improved,' said Cao Chenying, the national statistician.

**Brazilian Industrial Production Shows Resilience in March**
The Brazilian industrial production rose 1.2% in March compared to February and 3.1% compared to the same month last year, according to the IBGE. This is a sign of resilience in the sector despite a low unemployment rate, high income, and domestic consumption in early 2025. Economists still believe in a slowdown in the year, but at a lower speed and with a more balanced performance among sectors. The XP highlighted that the Sondagem Industrial de março results were positive after five consecutive weak readings, with the largest growth coming from the 'Coque, derivados de petróleo e biocombustíveis' category (+3.4% monthly). The good performance was also spread across three of the four main economic categories and 16 of the 25 manufacturing activities. However, the XP also notes that the category of Bens de Capital (-0.7% in the month and -0.2% compared to March last year) decelerated after several readings with better-than-expected performance. Despite this, the Formação Bruta de Capital Fixo grew significantly in the 1st quarter of 2025. The XP maintains the scenario of a gradual slowdown in the industry of transformation. 'Conditions of more restrictive finance and the worsening of business confidence should reflect. On the other hand, the resilience of the labor market - the real income available to families continues to increase - and the recent government measures should support domestic demand in the short term,' says the analysis. The projection is that the general industrial production will increase 2.2% in 2025, below the 3.1% of 2024. For the GDP, the projection is an increase of 1.5% in the 1st quarter and 2.3% for the whole year of 2025.

**Russia's Industrial Production Growth Forecast Increased to 2.6% in 2025**
The Ministry of Economic Development has increased its forecast for the growth of industrial production in Russia to 2.6% in 2025, up from 2.0% in the September version. At the same time, the forecast for investment growth in fixed capital has been reduced to 1.7% from 2.1%. According to the ministry's representative, the ministry has submitted a project of scenario conditions for the forecast of socio-economic development for 2025-2028 to the government. The ministry expects industrial production to grow by 2.9% in 2026, 2.8% in 2027, and 2.8% in 2028. The forecast for growth in the processing industry for 2025 is 4.3%, for 2026 is 3.4%, for 2027 is 3.6%, and for 2028 is 3.6%. 'We slightly lowered the pace of investment growth, but they still remain in the positive zone. We reduced them to 1.7%, which is still a good growth against the backdrop of a high base (investment growth in 2024 was 7.4% - IF),' said the ministry's representative. 'The economy is becoming more fragmented, and growth is no longer frontal. There was a period from 2023-2024 when growth was frontal, now the situation is slightly changing - sometimes higher, sometimes lower, some industries have gone into the minus - the question is for how long,' he added.

**Industrial Production Grows 4.7% in February, 5.4% in First Half of 2025**
According to a private report, the first half of 2025 saw a 5.4% increase in industrial production. In February, industrial production grew 4.7% year-over-year, and the first half of the year closed with a 5.4% expansion, according to data from the Centro de Estudios Económicos de Orlando J Ferreres & Asociados. On a seasonally adjusted basis, there was a 1.3% monthly expansion in February, reversing the decline of January, which was recalculated to a 0.9% contraction. This improvement left the first half of the year 'slightly positive compared to the last two months of last year.' The automotive complex was particularly notable, with a 13.1% annual increase in production for the second month of the year. The food sector also contributed positively (+6.3%), thanks to the boost from oils (+10.5%). Additionally, the non-metallic minerals sector showed a gain (+5.6%). In detail, 'cement portland production had a 8.1% increase.' The 'Machinery and Equipment' sector remained the most dynamic at the beginning of 2025, with a 16.1% increase for February and a 19.0% bimestral accumulation. The basic metals sector continued with the negative trend, registering a 6.6% annual decline in February, accumulating a 7.5% decline for the first half. Within this sector, 'finished hot-rolled laminates fell 13.4%, and cold-rolled 18.9%; at the same time, crude steel production fell 2.2%, and aluminum 1.5%, always compared to February 2024.' Other sectors with negative annual variations in February were Tobacco (-7.7%), Plastics (-6.6%), Paper (-6.3%), and Textile (-3.8%). For the future, it is expected that 'industrial production will continue to improve, driven by the increase in internal consumption.' However, the report warns about the risks associated with 'the uncertainty about the direction that the government will give to monetary, exchange rate, and commercial policy, and the effects it may have on some of the most fragile industrial sectors in terms of competitiveness.'

**German Industrial Production Hits Lowest Level Since May 2020**
Germany's industrial production has fallen to its lowest level since May 2020, according to the latest data. The decline in production is also reflected in the export sector, which has seen a decrease. The economic situation in Germany is not looking good, especially with the upcoming elections and the threat of US tariffs on European goods. The country's GDP growth predictions for 2025 are already showing a negative trend, following the contractions in 2023 and 2024. In December, industrial production fell by 2.4% compared to the previous month, worse than expected by economists (-0.6%). The German Federal Statistical Office, Destatis, also revised down the growth of November. The production remains around 10% below pre-pandemic levels, the lowest since May 2020. Carsten Brzeski, analyst at ING, commented, 'The data once again highlights that industry will be a brake on German growth.' In the machinery and equipment sector, the decline in 2024 was 5.6% year-on-year, with a significant drop in the automotive sector (-7.2%) and in the production of machinery and equipment (-8.1%). However, there were positive signs from the data on industrial orders, which increased by 6.9% in December, mainly due to large orders for aircraft, ships, trains, and military vehicles. Excluding these large orders, the increase was around 2%.
