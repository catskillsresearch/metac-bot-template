**There may be a surprising upside to losing coral reefs as oceans warm**
Researchers have found a potential upside to the decline of coral reefs due to warming oceans: the seas may absorb up to 5% more carbon dioxide by 2100, slowing the build-up of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Lester Kwiatkowski, a researcher at Sorbonne University, notes that while this is a beneficial effect, the decline of corals will also reduce biodiversity, harm fisheries, and leave coasts more exposed to rising seas. Kwiatkowski's team used a computer model to estimate that the oceans could take up between 1 and 5% more carbon by 2100, and up to 13% more by 2300. However, this does not account for other factors that can cause reef decline, such as overfishing and coral diseases. If their estimates are correct, it means that the amount of emitted CO2 that will lead to a given level of warming - the carbon budget - is a little larger than currently thought.

**More acid, less oxygen: Scientists say Earth’s ‘blue ally’ buckling hard and fast under climate strain**
The world's oceans are experiencing alarming symptoms of stress due to climate change, including heatwaves, loss of marine life, rising sea levels, falling oxygen levels, and acidification caused by excess carbon dioxide. According to Angelique Melet, an oceanographer at the European Mercator Ocean monitor, 'oceans are warming faster and faster', with the rate of ocean warming more than doubling since 1993. Average sea surface temperatures reached new records in 2023 and 2024, and despite a respite in 2025, temperatures remain at historic highs. Marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency, become longer lasting and more intense, and affect a wider area. Scientists expect that the world will breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming threshold, which could lead to the loss of 70-90% of corals this century. The oceans' thermal expansion and the melting of ice caps and glaciers are causing sea levels to rise at an alarming rate, with the pace of global oceans rising doubling in three decades and expected to double again by 2100. Melet said, 'Ocean warming, like sea-level rise, has become an inescapable process on the scale of our lives, but also over several centuries.' However, reducing greenhouse gas emissions can reduce the rate and magnitude of the damage and give time for adaptation.

**Countdown to 2030: Achieving global targets on disaster displacement**
A new report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) reveals that disasters triggered 264.8 million forced movements of people across 210 countries and territories between 2015 and 2024. In 2024 alone, disasters forced people to flee their homes nearly 45.8 million times, the highest annual figure on record. IDMC director Alexandra Bilak said, 'Disaster displacement is not a future problem. It's happening now, it's happening more often, and it can happen anywhere, although it is hitting the poorest the hardest.' The report highlights that while climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense, lack of preparedness, inadequate infrastructure, and high exposure to risks are also major factors in disaster displacement. The IDMC warns that displacement risk is likely to grow, with 100 million people globally at risk of internal displacement caused by disasters in any given year under a pessimistic warming scenario. Bilak added, 'Our window to act is closing. It's time to turn what we've learned from the data into political solutions and financial commitments.'

**Nearly 40% of the world's glaciers are already doomed, scientists say**
A new study has found that nearly 40% of the world's glaciers are already doomed, even if global temperatures stopped rising immediately. The researchers estimate that glaciers will eventually lose 39% of their mass relative to 2020, which will contribute to a 113-millimeter increase in global sea level rise. If the world continues to pursue its current climate policies, the loss rises to 76%. James Kirkham, a glaciologist, said, 'The difference between being able to adapt to the loss of the glacier and not is the 39% of glacier mass lost compared to 76%.' The study's authors are trying to give a message of hope, saying that with every tenth of a degree less of global warming, they can preserve glacier ice. However, temperatures keep rising, and the world is currently on track for up to 2.9 degrees of warming by 2100. The study predicts that every additional increase of 0.1 degrees between 1.5 and 3 degrees of warming results in an additional 2% of the global glacier mass being lost.

**World Oceans Day 2025: Oceans bearing the brunt of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions**
The world's oceans are warming at an alarming rate, with sea surface temperatures reaching new records in 2023 and 2024. According to Angelique Melet, an oceanographer at the European Mercator Ocean monitor, 'oceans are warming faster and faster' due to the absorption of excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases. The rate of ocean warming has more than doubled since 1993, and marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency, become longer lasting and more intense, and affect a wider area. Warmer seas can make storms more violent, feeding them with heat and evaporated water, and can be devastating for species, especially corals and seagrass beds. Scientists expect that up to 90% of corals will be lost this century if the world reaches 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming compared to pre-industrial levels. The pace at which global oceans are rising has doubled in three decades and if current trends continue it will double again by 2100 to about one centimetre per year. 'Ocean warming, like sea-level rise, has become an inescapable process on the scale of our lives, but also over several centuries,' said Melet. 'But if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will reduce the rate and magnitude of the damage, and gain time for adaptation'.

**Climate Change and Women: Impacts and Prospective Views**
The effects of climate change on women are becoming increasingly severe, with women being more vulnerable to its impacts. According to the IPCC, the economic costs of climate change in developing countries will range from $290 billion to $580 billion annually by 2030. Additionally, 189 million people, mostly women and children, are affected annually by extreme weather events in developing countries since 1991. The IPCC has released a report outlining possible future scenarios under continued climate change, including a scenario where global carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to zero by 2050, aligning with the Paris Agreement's goals. However, an opposing scenario assumes a doubling of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, leading to a 4.4°C temperature increase by 2100, which will undoubtedly affect women's health worldwide. The article emphasizes the need for international cooperation and education to mitigate the effects of climate change on women and promote sustainable development.

**Scientists Predict Sea Level Rise and Irreversible Consequences Due to Glacier Melting**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if current warming trends continue, three-quarters of the Earth's glacier mass will disappear by 2100, causing a 23 cm sea level rise and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the journal Science, highlights the situation in Alaska, where up to 69% of the glaciers could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest glacier reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even in the best-case scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, and global losses would be 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers the period until the glaciers reach a state of 'equilibrium' - in the case of Alaska, this would take 330 years. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 glaciers. The scientists believe that even if warming stops, glaciers will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia'. They consider the current decade critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**Scientists in Panic: Planet Faces Catastrophic Consequences Due to Ice Loss**
A group of international scientists from Switzerland, the US, Belgium, and other countries have concluded that if the current rate of warming continues, three-quarters of the Earth's ice mass will disappear by 2100, resulting in a 23 cm rise in sea levels and other irreversible consequences. The study, published in the Science journal, notes that the situation in Alaska is particularly alarming, where up to 69% of the ice could disappear, despite the region having the third-largest ice reserve in the world (16,246 gigatons). Even under an optimal scenario, Alaska would lose 41% of its ice, with global losses reaching 47%. Unlike previous studies, which were limited to 2100, the new modeling considers a period of up to 330 years to reach 'equilibrium' for Alaska's ice. The study involved 21 scientists from 10 countries, using eight different climate models to analyze 200,000 ice formations. The researchers emphasize that even if warming stops, ice will continue to melt for hundreds of years due to 'climate inertia.' They stress that the current decade is critical for taking measures to preserve the Earth's cryosphere.

**40% of glaciers "are doomed" even if we were to stop global warming and sea levels would rise by 10 centimeters**
Even if global warming were to stop, 39% of the world's glacier mass would still disappear, and sea levels would rise by over 10 centimeters, according to a study led by Harry Zekollari. The study, which simulated the long-term impact of current climate policies, found that glaciers would continue to melt for centuries, even without additional warming. 'Most glacier studies stop at the year 2100, which is problematic when simulating the long-term impact of current climate policies, given the glaciers' long-term response over time,' explains Zekollari. The study also found that around 20% of the current glacier mass would be lost regardless of future warming. The researchers note that the retreat of glaciers allows us to see the effects of climate change with our own eyes.

**New Study Warns of Continuous Deterioration of the Earth's Systems**
A new study has created a comprehensive picture of the Earth's state by 2100, using data from model-based future scenarios and the concept of planetary boundaries. The study shows that if no additional policy measures are taken, there will be a continuous deterioration in almost all areas, except for the ozone layer and air pollution. By 2050, climate and nitrogen loading will be far in the high-risk area. Even ambitious climate policy aimed at a maximum of 1.5°C global warming will not be enough to get out of the high-risk area everywhere by the end of the century. The study suggests that other ambitious and technically feasible measures are needed to reduce the crossing of planetary boundaries. According to the study, it is possible to halt and reverse the deterioration of the Earth's systems, with the planet being at least as good as it was in 2015 by 2050, and continuing to recover in the second half of the century. However, even in this scenario, planetary boundaries will still be exceeded in 2100, particularly for climate, phosphorus and nitrogen cycles, and the integrity of the biosphere. The search for better policy measures remains on the agenda.

**Limiting Global Warming to 1.5°C Could Protect 400 Million Children, Report Says**
According to a report released by Save the Children and the VUB, limiting global warming to 1.5°C by 2100 could protect approximately 400 million children, which is one-third of the world's 5-year-old children. The report, 'Born in a Climate Crisis 2: A Life Unprecedented,' analyzed the impact of climate change on children. It found that if current countries' greenhouse gas reduction targets are met, 83% of the 1.2 billion children born in 2020 will experience extreme heat for their entire lives. However, if the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C is achieved, the number of children exposed to extreme heat would decrease to 62.5 million, protecting 380 million children. The report defines climate change-induced weather extremes as 'a life unprecedented' and estimates that 800 million children could be protected from crop failures, 500 million from floods, and 500 million from tropical depressions. If global temperatures rise by 3.5°C, the worst-case scenario is expected. In this scenario, 92% of children born in 2020, or 1.1 billion, could be exposed to extreme heat for their entire lives. The report emphasizes that 'climate justice requires measures beyond temperature limits' and calls for 'phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, expanding climate finance, and introducing child- and community-led climate adaptation policies.'

**Children Born After 2020 Condemned to Live in Unprecedented Climate Conditions**
Researchers from the University of Brussels have warned that children born after 2020 will face unprecedented climate conditions. According to their study, published in the journal Nature, people born in 2020 will be exposed to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and floods, at a level that has only a 1 in 10,000 chance of occurring in a world without greenhouse gas emissions. The study found that in a scenario where global warming reaches 1.5°C by 2100, 52% of children born in 2020 (over 60 million people) will experience 'unprecedented' exposure to heatwaves throughout their lives. If global warming reaches 3.5°C by 2100, the figure rises to 92% (111 million people). The researchers also found that people socio-economically vulnerable will continue to have a higher risk of being exposed to unprecedented heatwaves. They confirm the injustice of climate change, as those who have contributed the least to global warming will suffer the most extreme consequences. As one researcher put it, 'It's a matter of life and death'.

**Britain will be battered with cold snaps, floods, and storms by 2100**
Scientists at the University of Exeter and the Met Office warn that Britain could be battered with cold snaps, floods, and storms by 2100 due to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is a natural and temporary cooling and warming over parts of Europe and the North Atlantic ocean. According to their findings, errors in current climate models have led to uncertainty in predictions of the NAO's future behavior. Taking account of these errors reveals that the NAO could be disastrous for Britain, which is seriously underprepared. Dr Doug Smith, lead study author, warned, 'These findings have major implications for understanding and preparing for extreme weather events.' The team found that a negative NAO could mean a big freeze, like the one of 2009-10 that caused transport chaos in Britain and was blamed for 90 deaths in Europe. Under a scenario of high emissions from fossil fuels, but in absence of major volcanic eruptions, NAO will increase to unprecedented levels by 2100, 1.4 to 3.7 times greater than any in the historical period. 'Our study suggests that taking model projections at face value could leave society unprepared for impending extremes,' said Dr Smith. 'Mitigation efforts are crucial to prevent the severe impacts associated with an unprecedented increase in the NAO.'

**Study: Fighting Climate Change is Economically Worthwhile**
According to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group and the University of Cambridge, inaction against climate change would result in massive economic losses. If global warming reaches 3 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100, the global economy could shrink by 15 to 34 percent. To limit warming to 2 degrees, researchers estimate that investments of 1 to 2 percent of global GDP in climate mitigation and adaptation would be necessary, limiting economic consequences to 2 to 4 percent of global GDP. This aligns with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, or at least below 2 degrees.

**Terrifying study predicts how many people will DIE in fires by 2100**
A study published in Nature Cities predicts that the frequency of fires in cities will skyrocket due to climate change, leading to devastating consequences. Under a high emissions scenario, the scientists predict a 22.2 per cent increase in outdoor fires in cities around the world by 2100, resulting in 335,000 fire-related deaths and 1.1 million fire-related injuries. The researchers warn that global warming could lead to an 'unexpectedly high volume of fire casualties.' The study found that the UK would be one of the worst affected countries, with a 40% increase in fire-related incidents, including a 10% surge in building fires, a 15% increase in vehicle fires, and a 20% increase in outdoor fires. The researchers hope the findings will help shape climate mitigation strategies around the world.

**New Research on Climate Change: The Arctic in 2100: Barely Recognizable**
According to current climate models, human-induced climate change will dramatically alter the Arctic and its habitats. Researchers are warning of the need for action. On February 2, 2025, the temperature at the North Pole was still above freezing, despite being in the middle of the Arctic winter. This shows the dramatic warming of the Earth and the Arctic. By 2100, temperatures are expected to rise globally by an average of 2.7 degrees Celsius, assuming countries meet their climate goals. If not, even higher numbers are expected. 'The resulting consequences will be melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and decreasing sea ice, as well as thawing permafrost,' explained Dirk Notz from the Exzellenzcluster Cliccs at the University of Hamburg and Julienne Stroeve from the National Snow and Ice Center (NSIDC) in Colorado, USA. 'Die daraus resultierenden Folgen sind schmelzende Gletscher, das Steigen des Meeresspiegels und schwindendes Meereis bis hin zum Tauen der Permafrostböden,' they said.

**Dire Future Predicted for the World by 2100: Rising Sea Levels, Extreme Weather, and Catastrophic Air Pollution**
A study using Google's ImageFX generator and the latest scientific research predicts a dire future for the world by 2100. Cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main factors will be rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions. If nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these changes will continue for a century. Climate scientist Professor Julian Stoye said, 'The biggest impact that everyone will feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will be increasing over the century if we do nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.' The IPCC predicts that the global temperature will rise by 2.7°C by 2100 under a medium scenario and by 4.4°C under a worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than double, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. Countries like France, already struggling with water scarcity, will likely face devastating droughts. It is predicted that only extreme heat will lead to 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. Barcelona will be the most affected city, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. The study predicts that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather events will become more frequent, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. The risk of sudden floods will be high in areas where droughts have already weakened the land. Mega-tornadoes will become more common, posing a threat to countries like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the southern states of the US. Large-scale forest fires will also become more frequent, with a 50% increase in extreme forest fires by 2100. The World Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with 60,000 additional deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.

**Scientists Predict Bleak Future for Earth in 2100**
Scientists from Google and MailOnline used a generator with artificial intelligence to predict what the world will be like in 2100. The picture is bleak: cities will be underwater, and millions of people will die from heat. The main impact will be the rise in sea levels and extreme weather conditions. 'The biggest impact we'll feel is the rise in sea levels and the change in extreme weather conditions. All of this will increase over the century if we don't do anything to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,' said Dr. Julian Stowell, a climate expert from University College London. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that the global temperature will be 2.7°C higher than the pre-industrial average by 2100, and 4.4°C higher in the worst-case scenario. The number of people living in arid regions will increase by more than twice, from 2.3 billion to 5 billion by 2100. The risk of 'sudden droughts' will increase from 32% to 53% in Europe by 2100. 'This will lead to devastating droughts in countries like France, which are already struggling with systematic water shortages,' said Dr. Stowell. It is predicted that only excessive heat will cause 5.8 million additional deaths in Europe by 2100. The city of Barcelona will be the most affected, with 246,000 additional deaths predicted. The melting of ice and rising sea levels will continue as the atmosphere warms over the next 75 years. 'This will warm the Arctic even faster, leading to more melting of Greenland and a faster rise in sea levels, destabilization of permafrost zones, and disruption of deep ocean currents,' said Dr. Stowell. It is predicted that more than half of the world's glaciers will disappear by 2100, and the European Alps will lose 75% of their glaciers under a high-emissions scenario. Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore predict that the global sea level will rise by 1.9 meters by 2100 if CO2 emissions continue to increase. Extreme weather will become more frequent and intense, with a 47% decrease in summer rainfall in the UK by 2070 and a 35% increase in winter rainfall. 'When these sudden downpours hit areas where drought has already weakened the land, the risk of catastrophic flooding becomes extremely high,' said experts. The number of 'megastorms' will increase, which occur when warm, moist air rises from the ocean. For places like Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and southern US states, these destructive storms will become much more common by 2100. Large forest fires will also become more frequent, as a combination of strong heat and low rainfall makes some regions extremely vulnerable to fires. The UN Environment Programme predicts that extreme forest fires will become 50% more frequent by 2100. The frequency of extreme fires will increase by 14% by 2030, 30% by 2050, and 50% by the end of the century. Air pollution will become catastrophic, with cities like Delhi in India facing even worse conditions. Warm air and less rainfall mean that pollution stays in the air longer. In countries experiencing rapid industrial growth, poor environmental regulation has led to hazardous levels of pollution. Research shows that if climate change continues, air pollution will cause an additional 60,000 deaths worldwide by 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100.

**An Arctic “Beyond Recognition” Expected by 2100**
According to a new review paper published in Science, global temperatures are projected to reach 2.7 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrial levels by 2100, based on current country pledges. This will lead to extreme and cascading impacts in the Arctic, including sea-ice-free Arctic summers, accelerated melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet, widespread permafrost loss, and more extreme air temperatures. As Julienne Stroeve, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, noted, 'The Arctic is warming at four times the rate of the rest of the planet.' The study's authors warn that these changes will devastate infrastructure, ecosystems, vulnerable communities, and wildlife. As Dirk Notz, professor for polar research at the University of Hamburg, said, 'Our paper shows that, already today, mankind has the power to wipe out entire landscapes from the surface of our planet.'
