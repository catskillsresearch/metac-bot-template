**Alaska Governor's Race Heats Up as GOP Candidate Makes New Staff Picks**
The Alaska gubernatorial race is heating up as Bernadette Wilson, a businesswoman from Anchorage, announces her candidacy. Wilson has hired two seasoned strategists, Brad Herold and Ben Yoho, who have a proven track record of success in national Republican campaigns. Herold has experience running top-tier campaigns, including Gov. DeSantis' 2018 victory and President Trump's 2016 ground game in Florida. Yoho has worked with President Trump's Super PAC MAGA Inc. and has expertise in message delivery, targeting, and maximizing media impact. Wilson's campaign is seen as a serious contender, leveraging her 'not a politician' label and opposition to Alaska's ranked-choice voting scheme. As the election approaches, Wilson's qualifications and experience will be put to the test.

**Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly announces run for Florida governor**
Former U.S. Rep. David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Florida governor, citing the state's affordability crisis as a major issue. Jolly stated, 'We have an affordability crisis in Florida driven by an insurance crisis that continues to worsen in the face of complete neglect by Tallahassee. We have abandoned public education, and we've allowed corruption to run rampant. It's time for a change.' Despite the long odds, Jolly will face competition from other candidates, including Southwest Florida Congressman Byron Donalds, who has already launched his campaign for the GOP nomination, and Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, who is considering a run. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.

**'Radical Leftist': Byron Donalds Laughs Off Never Trumper Ex-GOP Rep Running For FL Gov As Dem**
Former Republican Rep. David Jolly announced his candidacy for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race as a Democrat. Jolly, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, stated that Florida is in crisis and needs a change. Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-endorsed frontrunner, referred to Jolly as 'an anti-Trump, radical leftist' and said he is 'completely out of touch with Florida's voters and our values.' Donalds added that he will fight side by side with Trump to protect Florida families and Make America Great Again. The Florida Republican Party also criticized Jolly, calling him a 'flip-flopping political relic' and stating that Floridians won't be swayed by his candidacy.

**Converted Democrat David Jolly launched bid for Florida governor**
Former congressman David Jolly has launched his bid for Florida governor, promising to end the politics of division and return Florida to voters who want a functional economy, top-notch education, safe communities, and a government that respects personal freedoms. Jolly's campaign centers around expanding Medicaid, relaxing strict immigration policies, tackling the affordability crisis, increasing education investments, and rolling back what he sees as intolerant Republican policies. He faces a difficult path ahead, as Florida has swung solidly red in recent years, and a potentially crowded field of Republican and Democratic candidates, including Rep. Byron Donalds and Casey DeSantis. Jolly believes he can win by winning over independent voters and disillusioned Republicans, saying, 'There are not enough Democratic votes to win the governorship... We need a campaign, a candidate, and a party that can win hearts and minds back... And that's our job.'

David Jolly, a former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump, has announced his bid to run for governor in Florida as a Democrat. Jolly, who has been a vocal critic of Trump's policies, believes that issues such as affordability, funding public schools, and strengthening campaign finance and ethics laws will resonate with all voters in 2026. He predicts that the elections next year will herald nationwide change. Jolly, who was first elected to his Tampa Bay-area congressional seat in 2014, has undergone a political evolution, leaving the Republican Party in 2018 to become an independent and then a registered Democrat. He has built a national profile as an anti-Trump political commentator on MSNBC. Jolly has broken from his old party on immigration, and has criticized Republicans who have 'conflated immigration and crime,' which he described as wrong and immoral. He will face Trump-backed Rep. Byron Donalds in the Republican primary, as well as other potential candidates such as former Rep. Matt Gaetz and Casey DeSantis.

**What Pinellas' David Jolly brings to Florida's governor race | Column**
David Jolly, a former congressman from Pinellas County, has announced his candidacy for Florida governor in 2026. Jolly, who switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party in April, is running on a moderate agenda that focuses on affordability, education, and economic growth. He has proposed reforms such as creating a state catastrophic fund to ease insurance premiums and giving Florida students better access to state colleges and universities. Jolly's appeal lies in his ability to work across the aisle and build a coalition to address concerns across a broad front. However, his biggest challenge is his own party, as registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in Florida. Jolly will need to break through the new mediascape and convince Democrats that he is genuinely one with them. As Jolly said, 'I've been out of politics long enough to tell the truth. Some of our leaders escalate problems instead of de-escalating them. We have to de-escalate division.'

**Drivers forced into extra step before getting license under new July 1 law**
A new law in Florida, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, will require teenage drivers to complete a full driver's education course before applying for a learner's permit. Starting July 1, those aged 15 to 17 must take a comprehensive course, which includes defensive driving, hazard prevention, and safe habits. Debbie Adams, head of Florida Virtual School's driver's education program, supports the change, saying, 'The legislators really got this right.' She believes the longer process will better prepare teenage drivers and make roads safer. The state hopes that the new requirement will reduce the risk of deadly crashes, which is higher for teens driving with other teens. Florida Virtual School offers the course online for free and currently serves over 55,000 students, making it the largest driver's education provider in the state.

**Florida Law Targets Cuba and Other Countries in 'Foreign Countries of Concern' Initiative**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a new law, SB 768, which targets Cuba and five other countries considered strategic enemies by the United States. The law, titled Foreign Countries of Concern, aims to strengthen conditions for scientific, commercial, and technological links with these nations. The law will take effect on July 1, 2025, and prohibits the use of foreign software in public health laboratories and establishes stricter controls on the financial interests of entities linked to 'concerned' countries. According to the law, these countries are considered threats to national security and cannot have any technological influence in Florida's healthcare processes. As stated in the law, 'this decision responds to a need to ensure that no genetic sequencing system or operational base comes from suspicious or insecure technological environments.'

**Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Warns of Hurricane Season Dangers and Promises Tax Relief**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned of the dangers of the 2025 hurricane season, which began this weekend. He emphasized the need for residents to have food, water, and basic supplies for at least a week. DeSantis noted that the state has made 'historical investments' in hurricane preparedness infrastructure and continues to improve preparation, response, and recovery initiatives. He also stated that 'Florida sets the standard in disaster response and emergency management.' The governor added that the state does not rely on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for preparation or response efforts, but rather has its own programs for individual assistance. DeSantis called for residents to prepare for the hurricane season, citing the experience of 2024, where thousands of homes suffered power outages and material damage. He promised that the state will 'ensure tax-free purchases' for hurricane supplies, although the tax exemption has not been confirmed yet. The governor estimated that the tax relief could save residents up to $72 million.

Attorney General James Uthmeier and others have also announced their candidacy for governor. Donalds is urging voters to support him on Election Day, April 1st, to continue pushing for a safer and stronger Florida. Meanwhile, Debbie Wasserman Schultz notes that DeSantis' increased political activity is 'not even trying to hide it'.

**Casey DeSantis Leaves Door Open for 2026 Florida Governor Run**
Casey DeSantis, the wife of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, has left open the possibility of running for governor again. This comes as the distance between Ron DeSantis and President Donald Trump grows due to their differing support for candidates in the upcoming Florida elections. Trump has announced that Byron Lowell Donalds, a representative from Florida's 19th congressional district, is his ideal candidate to run for governor in 2026. Trump stated, 'As governor, Byron would have a GREAT voice and would work closely with me to advance our America First agenda. He would fight tirelessly to secure our border, stop illegal immigration, strengthen our military, protect our veterans, restore our economic power, promote American energy dominance, and defend our always besieged Second Amendment.' Despite this, Casey DeSantis has left open the option of running for governor again. When asked about her desire to become governor, she replied, 'We'll see.' She then referred to the transformation her husband has made in Florida during his governorship, saying, 'Florida, in many cases, is a free state and an inspiration to many other states in the US. But when people from all over the world travel and see what he's done, they're very proud. So the long and short of it is, 'We'll see.' According to a recent poll, Casey DeSantis has a 57% approval rating among registered Republicans in Florida, compared to 27% for Byron Lowell Donalds.

**Casey DeSantis Responds to Speculation About 2026 Governor Run**
Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis praised her husband, Governor Ron DeSantis, as 'the greatest of all time' in a speech on Friday, responding to speculation that she may run for governor in 2026. Casey DeSantis said, 'I've seen many politicians, but few have the courage like him. I must applaud him.' She added, 'What he's done is easy to undo. Just replace him, and the results will be gone.' DeSantis emphasized that she will not confirm or deny whether she will run for governor, saying 'We'll just have to wait and see.' Republican Congressman Byron Donalds has announced his candidacy for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial election, with the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. Casey DeSantis had initially planned to support incumbent Senator Ashley Moody, but later appointed her to replace Marco Rubio in the Senate. According to a recent poll, 57% of registered Republican voters have a positive view of Casey DeSantis, while Donalds has 27%. However, an internal poll conducted by Donalds' team shows him leading Casey DeSantis 34% to 30%. Casey DeSantis has been rumored to be planning to run for governor, with a source close to her saying that she has 'always had big ambitions' and 'sees herself as a new power couple in politics.'

**Byron Donalds Launches Gubernatorial Bid with Trump's Endorsement, Raising Tensions with DeSantis**
Republican congressman Byron Donalds has officially announced his candidacy for governor of Florida in 2026, with the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. This move intensifies the competition for control of the Republican Party in the state. Donalds, 46, has been a representative of Florida's 19th district since 2020 and has aligned himself with Trump's agenda. 'I've been on the front lines of these conservative battles and I'm ready to take Florida to the next level,' he said. Trump praised Donalds on Truth Social, calling him 'a proven leader and a total winner.' However, the absence of an official endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis, who will be leaving office in January 2027, adds uncertainty to the landscape. DeSantis has hinted that his wife, Casey, could be a strong candidate, saying 'she would be a great governor. She has conservative fiber and has been with me on every achievement.' This move is seen as an attempt by DeSantis to maintain influence in the state party after his failed presidential bid in 2024. Donalds has been endorsed by Trump, but DeSantis has downplayed his qualifications, saying 'he didn't participate in our conservative victories.' This move highlights the rift between the DeSantis and Trump factions within the Republican Party. Casey DeSantis is now being considered as a serious contender, with some donors reportedly encouraging her to run during a meeting in Palm Beach in early 2025.

**The Case for Casey**
Casey DeSantis, the wife of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, is gaining popularity as a potential candidate for the 2026 gubernatorial race. According to a February 2025 poll, 57% of registered Republicans have a favorable opinion of her, a margin 22% higher than her closest contender. However, she has yet to announce her bid, possibly due to her husband's potential presidential run in 2028 and her own health concerns following a battle with breast cancer. Additionally, she is the mother of three young children, which may raise concerns about her ability to balance her campaign with childcare responsibilities. As the DeSantis family weighs its options, it remains to be seen whether they will continue to hold power in Florida or pursue new endeavors.

**Casey DeSantis: The Potential Successor to Ron DeSantis as Florida Governor in 2026**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis cannot be re-elected in 2026, and his potential successors are already being discussed. One of the possible candidates is his wife, Casey DeSantis, who has been a key figure in his administration. According to sources, she is seriously considering running for governor and has the support of her husband. Casey has increased her visibility in recent years through social initiatives and public speeches at official events. Her potential candidacy would mark a continuity in the DeSantis administration in Florida, generating expectations about whether the family will remain in the governor's mansion after 2027. Casey's profile is seen as suitable for the Republican nomination, but she faces challenges, including getting close to former President Donald Trump, who has the support of a large part of the Florida electorate. Casey has played an active role in initiatives related to mental health, education, and family support in Florida, and her work has been widely promoted at official events. She has consolidated relationships with community leaders and strategic sectors, which could facilitate the construction of her own political platform if she officially announces her candidacy.

**Casey DeSantis Considers Running for Governor in 2026**
Casey DeSantis, the wife of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, is considering running for governor in 2026, according to US media. As DeSantis is term-limited and cannot run for re-election, many Republican donors have started discussing the possibility of her competing in the primaries. 'She has heard that donors have been urging her to run, and while she wouldn't want to do it, they're making her at least stop and listen,' said a source close to the DeSantis family. A recent poll by the Florida Atlantic University showed that Casey DeSantis leads the pack with 43% of the vote, followed by Byron Donalds with 19%. This potential candidacy could spark a small war between DeSantis and President Donald Trump, as Donalds is an ally of Trump and has also announced his intention to run for governor.

**Casey DeSantis to Run for Governor in 2026: A Proxy Between Her Husband and Donald Trump?**
Casey DeSantis, the wife of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, is seriously considering a run for governor in 2026, driven by growing support from Republican donors. This move could change the political landscape in the state and nationally in the United States. According to sources close to the event, there has been a significant push for her to consider this option. 'I've heard that donors have been urging her to run,' said a source. 'Although she hasn't wanted to do it, they're making her at least stop to listen.' Casey DeSantis has been a constant figure in her husband's campaign, leading many to wonder if she would ever seek a position of her own. In a recent interview, she mentioned that the interest in her potential candidacy reflects her husband's success: 'When people talk about me running, I think it speaks very well of the governor himself,' she said. If Casey DeSantis decides to run, her campaign could be seen as a proxy between her husband and Donald Trump, given their history of relationships. Although Trump supported Ron DeSantis in his 2018 gubernatorial campaign, their relationship has been affected by the competition in the 2024 presidential primaries. The rivalry between the candidates could intensify, especially with Byron Donalds in the mix, who has expressed interest in the governorship. Additionally, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson is also considering a candidacy. Although he doesn't have the same national profile as Casey DeSantis or Donalds, he has significant financial backing, making him a serious competitor. Ron DeSantis, who cannot seek re-election, sees his wife's potential candidacy as an opportunity to influence the state's future leadership. 'That's what finally opened her up to the idea of running,' said a source close to DeSantis. DeSantis has expressed his intention to be active in the 2026 gubernatorial campaign, using his political committee to support a candidate who shares his vision. The governor has been clear in his support for candidates who align with his policies, leaving many wondering who he will back. 'The Florida Freedom Fund was instrumental in raising large sums to defeat measures in 2024,' he posted on X last month, suggesting that his influence in the next election will be significant. With growing speculation about Casey DeSantis' candidacy, many observers believe that her run is imminent. 'She's going to run. At this point, most people see it that way,' said a source close to her circle. As events unfold, the future of Florida politics may be more tied to the DeSantis family than anticipated.
