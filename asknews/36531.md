**Supreme Court Faces Pivotal Challenges Against Trump Administration Orders | Law-Order**
The U.S. Supreme Court is addressing pivotal cases challenging executive orders signed by President Donald Trump, including the transgender military ban, restricting birthright citizenship, and deportations of migrants. The court's decisions could significantly impact U.S. immigration and military policies. Recently, the court permitted the Trump administration to enforce its transgender military ban, while challenges continue in lower courts. The Supreme Court is also hearing arguments involving Trump's attempt to restrict birthright citizenship, potentially affecting thousands of children born annually in the U.S. and redefining constitutional interpretations.

**Top cases before the US Supreme Court**
The US Supreme Court is currently hearing several high-profile cases, including birthright citizenship, guns, gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, online pornography, religious rights, preventive healthcare, Planned Parenthood funding, job discrimination, federal regulatory powers on nuclear waste storage and vape products, voting rights and more. Some of the notable cases include: the court's conservative justices seeming willing to limit the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions in the birthright citizenship case; the court blocking a bid to establish a taxpayer-funded religious charter school in Oklahoma; the justices upholding a federal regulation targeting 'ghost guns'; the court appearing sympathetic to a bid by two American gun companies to throw out a Mexican government's lawsuit accusing them of aiding illegal firearms trafficking; and the justices hearing arguments over whether a Texas law that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of users in an effort to restrict access to minors violates the First Amendment protections against government infringement of speech. A ruling is expected by the end of June in many of these cases.

**Supreme Court's Pivotal Role in Trump's Administrative Orders | Law-Order**
The U.S. Supreme Court has recently played a crucial role in addressing several high-stakes challenges to executive orders signed by President Donald Trump. The court has permitted the Trump administration to enforce its ban on transgender military personnel, allowed the deportation of Venezuelan migrants, and dealt with Trump's efforts to restrict birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of non-citizen parents. These cases reflect the court's influence over pivotal government policies amidst ongoing legal disputes, as Justice [no specific quote from the article] noted.

**Sen. Marsha Blackburn Introduces Bill To Kneecap 'Multi-Million Dollar Birth Tourism Industry'**
Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) has introduced the 'Ban Birth Tourism' act to prevent migrants from entering the United States for the purpose of having a child in America and obtaining birthright citizenship. Blackburn stated that foreign networks in China and Russia have built a multi-million dollar industry by taking advantage of America's birthright citizenship policy, where pregnant women can pay a fee to a broker to come to the US, have a baby, and start the chain migration process once the child turns 21. Blackburn's legislation aims to prevent foreign nationals from exploiting the system and buying American citizenship for their children. This comes after the Supreme Court began hearing arguments on President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born in the US without at least one parent who is a citizen or legal permanent resident.

**US Anti-Migrant Policies: A Boomerang Effect**
The US immigration policy is regressive and discriminatory, and counterproductive for Americans. The executive order to restrict birthright citizenship, the initiative to tax remittances, and the possibility of a reality TV show to grant citizenship are all measures that are not only regressive and discriminatory, but also potentially counterproductive for Americans. Fortunately, Governor Noem denied that the Department of Homeland Security was considering a reality TV show to grant citizenship through competitions. The executive order pushed by Trump to prevent children of undocumented or unlicensed individuals from obtaining automatic citizenship at birth is currently being debated in the Supreme Court. However, beyond the legal debate, the order breaks with the narrative of US inclusion and its paradox is that it could double the population of undocumented second-generation immigrants in ten years (Migration Policy Institute, 2025). This would not stop migration, but rather deepen exclusion. The initiative to tax remittances at 5% is moving forward and is expected to be approved this week. The legality of this measure is debatable, but its negative effects on the economy and society, especially for vulnerable populations in receiving countries, are clear. In 2023, Mexico received $63.3 billion in remittances (Banxico). A 5% tax would represent an annual loss of at least $3.25 billion, equivalent to a 0.18 percentage point reduction in GDP. This amount is equivalent to the complete budget of the 'La Escuela es Nuestra' program for 2024, which was $28.35 billion 345 million pesos. The national damage will be significant, while for states like Michoac√°n, Oaxaca, or Guerrero, which often rely on remittances as a primary source of family income, the damage will be devastating and affect the food security and health of millions of people.

**They're Coming for Your Birthright: Citizenship as Spectacle, Transaction, or Privilege**
The Trump Administration's attempts to redefine birthright citizenship and gut the Fourteenth Amendment are a threat to the rule of law and individual rights. The Constitution guarantees birthright citizenship to all born on American soil, regardless of parentage. The Trump Administration's efforts to restrict the power of federal district courts and redefine who qualifies as an American citizen are a calculated attempt to strip the judiciary of its ability to check executive abuse. This would mark a seismic shift in the balance of powers, subordinating the courts to the whims of the executive branch. Revoking birthright citizenship would create a stateless class of people born on U.S. soil who are denied recognition by their own country. This is a line that must not be crossed, as it would be a direct threat to the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and the future of liberty in America.

**Courting Controversy: High-Stakes Legal Battles at the U.S. Supreme Court**
The U.S. Supreme Court's current term is tackling complex cases involving birthright citizenship, religious rights in education, and regulatory powers, among others. Notable cases include challenges to Trump's executive order on citizenship, age-verification laws for online pornography, and healthcare provisions under Obamacare. According to the article, the justices' decisions will have 'sweeping impacts on American law and society.' The court is also reviewing the establishment of taxpayer-funded religious charter schools, which raises broader implications for education across the nation, and the age-verification requirements imposed on pornographic websites in Texas, which raises First Amendment concerns.

**Birthright citizenship and a post-constitutional order**
The Supreme Court's recent decision on birthright citizenship has been overshadowed by the issue of nationwide injunctions, which have been used by district court judges to block President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement efforts. Solicitor General John Sauer argued that these injunctions are a form of 'political warfare' against the administration. The court seemed more interested in whether district court judges can issue universal restraining orders against the president, rather than the merits of Trump's executive order. The Department of Justice did not ask the Supreme Court to decide the birthright citizenship matter, citing concerns that a fast and furious court decision would hinder the national political debate. Congress has the power to regulate the jurisdiction of the district courts and can withhold the power to issue nationwide injunctions or even to withhold the power to issue injunctions on matters of immigration altogether.

**Supreme Court understands assignment on birthright citizenship**
The Supreme Court's oral argument on President Donald Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship focused on whether a single district court has the authority to issue a nationwide injunction. The justices appeared to be more concerned about Trump's contempt for the rule of law than giving too much power to a single district judge. It's likely that the court will strike down Trump's order as violating the Fourteenth Amendment, possibly next year. The case is unusual because any rational Department of Justice would have tried to avoid bringing it to court, but Trump's solicitor general, John Sauer, pressed on. Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that Sauer would have tried to keep the case out of the court if he were in his shoes. The justices are concerned about 'universal injunctions,' which allow a single district court judge to block an executive action unilaterally. The birthright citizenship case is at the opposite extreme, with the stakes being enormous and the law clear. The justices seem to understand the assignment: protect the rule of law from Trump's threat.

**Supreme Court Hears Birthright Citizenship Case That Could Also Sharply Reduce Judicial Power**
The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could reduce judicial power and allow the executive branch to reinterpret the Constitution. The Trump administration is challenging the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions against its orders, including the now-halted order to end birthright citizenship. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said, 'You also have this piece, the other headline, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Really at Stake in the U.S. Supreme Court [Case] on Birthright Citizenship.‚Äù' Andrea Flores, a lawyer, explained, 'There is absolutely no plan by the federal government in how you would implement that or how you would prevent mistakes, discrimination.' The Trump administration is trying to use a procedural move to implement an order that multiple courts have found to be unconstitutional. As Andrea Flores said, 'They didn‚Äôt argue. They didn‚Äôt even defend their order as constitutional, because most would agree that it is absolutely not.' The Supreme Court is being asked to ignore the point that the order is unconstitutional and instead focus on the procedural issue. Andrea Flores warned, 'If the Supreme Court grants this relief, they will be emboldened, and I imagine we see executive orders on each of those fundamental rights, which is why every American cannot dismiss this as an immigration case. This is a constitutional, really, test for the Supreme Court, and I hope that they do the right thing here.'

**US Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Birthright Citizenship Restriction**
The US Supreme Court held oral arguments on May 15, 2025, regarding a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order that restricts birthright citizenship. The executive order, signed on President Trump's first day in office, denies citizenship to children born in the US to individuals who are in the country on temporary visas or without valid immigration status. The plaintiffs argue that this executive order violates the Constitution, which grants citizenship to individuals born in the US. Multiple federal courts have blocked the executive order nationwide, but the Trump administration has appealed, arguing that the injunction should only apply to the plaintiffs. The Supreme Court's decision is expected to be announced by the end of June.

**US Supreme Court scrutinizes Trump bid to restrict birthright...**
The US Supreme Court heard arguments on May 15, 2025, in a case regarding Donald Trump's executive order to limit birthright citizenship. The order, which would affect thousands of babies born each year, was challenged by Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and individual pregnant immigrants. The administration argued that the order was 'protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship,' but liberal justices expressed concerns that it would deny citizenship to over 150,000 newborn children annually. The court is considering the administration's request to scale back injunctions issued by federal judges blocking the order nationwide. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett expressed skepticism about the administration's ability to reach a decision on the merits of the policy expeditiously. 'Are you really going to answer Justice Kagan by saying there's no way to do this expeditiously?' Barrett said. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch also asked, 'How do you suggest we reach this case on the merits expeditiously?'

**US Supreme Court to Review Trump's Birthright Citizenship Restrictions**
The US Supreme Court has agreed to review President Donald Trump's executive order that aims to restrict birthright citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. This measure challenges the traditional interpretation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The executive order, signed by Trump on February 19, 2025, states that children born in the US to parents without legal status will not be considered US citizens. It also prohibits federal agencies from issuing documents that recognize the citizenship of these children. The measure has been temporarily blocked by lower courts, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments on May 15. A decision in favor of the Trump administration could redefine the concept of citizenship in the US, affecting millions of people and setting a significant legal precedent.

**Trump's Executive Order on Birthright Citizenship Sparks Debate**
US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to restrict birthright citizenship, which could affect the scope of executive power in the future. The order aims to prevent children of undocumented immigrants born in the US from automatically becoming citizens. Critics argue that this move violates the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the US. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on the order on May 15, 2025, and a decision is expected by the end of June or early July. Some analysts fear that if the order is upheld, it could give the President more power in the future, challenging the balance of power in the US government. A CNN poll shows that 56% of Americans oppose the elimination of birthright citizenship, while 41% support it. The idea of supporting the elimination of citizenship for children born in the US has decreased over the years, with only 4 in 10 Americans supporting the order. Democrats are more opposed to the order, with 51% against it, while 31% of Republicans support it.

**Trump Asks Supreme Court to Allow Partial Implementation of Birthright Citizenship Restriction**
The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow the partial implementation of its executive order restricting birthright citizenship in the United States, despite being blocked by several federal courts. The order, signed on January 20, aims to deny citizenship to children born in the country whose parents are undocumented immigrants or have temporary immigration status. The government argues that the court rulings blocking the order should not apply nationwide, but only to the plaintiffs in each specific case. According to Reuters, the Department of Justice presented an emergency petition to the Supreme Court on Thursday to limit the effects of the blockages imposed by judges in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington. The Trump administration claims that the 14th Amendment of the Constitution does not apply to people born in the US if their parents are undocumented or have temporary status. This would prevent children born in the US after February 19, 2025, from obtaining automatic citizenship if neither of their parents is a citizen or permanent resident. The government also argues that the amendment should not be applied to people who are in the country illegally or those with temporary status, such as students or workers with visas. However, three federal judges have ruled that the executive order is unconstitutional and have blocked its application nationwide. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to limit these rulings so that they only affect the individuals or groups that filed the lawsuits, according to NBC News. The Department of Justice has criticized the growing trend of courts issuing universal injunctions, arguing that these decisions have been used excessively against recent presidential policies. 'Universal judicial orders have reached epidemic proportions since the beginning of this administration,' the government wrote in its petition to the Supreme Court. The future of the measure is now in the hands of a Supreme Court with a 6-3 conservative majority, where three judges were appointed by Trump during his first term. Although the court has ruled in favor of other executive orders by the president, it has never addressed the specific issue of birthright citizenship, according to Associated Press. If the Supreme Court accepts the government's petition, the Trump administration could move forward with the partial implementation of its policy, although it would still face legal challenges.

**Trump administration asks Supreme Court to partly allow birthright citizenship restrictions - ABC11 Raleigh-Durham**
The Trump administration has filed emergency applications with the Supreme Court to allow restrictions on birthright citizenship to partly take effect while legal challenges are ongoing. The administration is seeking to narrow court orders that blocked President Donald Trump's order, which would deny citizenship to children born after February 19, 2025, to parents who are in the country illegally. According to the order, U.S. agencies would also be prohibited from issuing any documents or accepting state documents recognizing citizenship for such children. The administration's request comes after three federal appeals courts rejected their pleas.

**Trump's Birthright Citizenship Order Faces Widespread Legal Opposition**
President Donald Trump's executive order to restrict birthright citizenship has been met with swift legal opposition. Four federal judges have temporarily blocked its application, citing constitutional concerns. Additionally, attorneys general from 22 states and various civil organizations have filed lawsuits to halt the measure. Trump's proposal aims to modify birthright citizenship, but the process is complex due to the 14th Amendment's protections. To make a permanent change, a constitutional amendment would be needed, which is unlikely in the current scenario. Trump has sought to reinterpret the 14th Amendment, claiming that children of undocumented immigrants are not fully subject to US laws. However, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the right to birthright citizenship, as seen in the landmark case Wong Kim Ark vs. United States (1898). The executive order, signed on January 20, 2025, proposes unprecedented changes to American citizenship. According to this measure, children born in the US would not automatically receive citizenship if their parents belong to certain groups. The order also prohibits federal agencies from issuing documents like passports and Social Security numbers to those outside the new framework. Its implementation was scheduled for February 19, 2025, but has been halted by multiple lawsuits. Several federal judges have taken steps to prevent the order's application, with four judges issuing rulings against the proposal as of February 26, 2025. Furthermore, 18 states, led by California and New York, have filed lawsuits to block the measure, while organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have also filed legal challenges.

**Trump Prepared to Take Birthright Citizenship to Supreme Court**
According to White House press secretary Caroline Leavit, US President Donald Trump is prepared to take the issue of birthright citizenship to the Supreme Court. Leavit stated, 'We believe this administration thinks birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, and we're prepared to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary, because Trump believes this is a necessary step to secure our borders and protect our nation.' The White House has already filed a lawsuit against several US states that have challenged Trump's executive order on the issue. Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, aimed at limiting the granting of US citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants. The order, according to Reuters, imposes restrictions on granting US citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants. Earlier, Trump signed an executive order directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to review the Pentagon's policy on transgender service members in the military, potentially paving the way for a future ban on their service. Trump's order stated that individuals who identify as a gender different from their biological sex 'are incompatible with the soldier's commitment to a virtuous, honest, and disciplined life, even in their personal lives.'

**Trump Administration Issues Executive Orders on Extreme Vetting (Including Possible Travel Bans) and Birthright Citizenship**
The Trump Administration issued Executive Orders on January 20, 2025, requiring U.S. agencies to conduct more in-depth background checks on visa applicants and reevaluate the Foreign Affairs Manual. This is expected to lead to additional security checks and delays in visa issuance. The EO also instructs U.S. agencies to identify countries with deficient vetting procedures, which may result in a U.S. travel ban. Furthermore, the EO limits the scope of birthright citizenship, stating that individuals born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, will not automatically receive U.S. citizenship unless their biological mother or father is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. A federal judge has blocked the implementation of the EO, but it is likely to be decided by the Supreme Court. As a result, foreign nationals are advised to remain in the United States or consider returning in the near future.
