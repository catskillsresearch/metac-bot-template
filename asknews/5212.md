**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**China's Electric Vehicle Market in Crisis: 'We Will All Go Bankrupt'**
The strong competition in the electric vehicle market in China has led to a price war that is affecting small and medium-sized enterprises in the country. China is the leader in electric vehicle sales, ahead of other countries in the region and even the United States. The Chinese multinational BYD has been a reference in the sector and has been able to compete with Tesla this year, with sales of 4.27 million vehicles in 2024, a 30% increase from the previous year. However, the president of Great Wall Motor, Wei Jianjun, expressed concern about the future of the industry. 'If things continue like this, we will all go bankrupt by the end of the year,' he said. The situation also affects suppliers. The government's support has allowed Chinese manufacturers to reduce prices and gain market share both domestically and internationally. However, this strategy has only benefited large companies, allowing them to capture a larger market share. This situation can lead to the closure of many other companies that have not been able to cope with this strategy if the current situation continues.

**Without regulations to drive market, Canada's EV battery recycling industry may run out of road, experts warn | CBC News**
Canada's electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling industry is at risk of running out of road without proper government regulation, experts warn. Li-Cycle, a leading EV battery recycler, filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada, citing a lack of government incentives and structure. Mark Winfield, a professor at York University, said, 'There really is no regulatory or policy regime around this in North America... It's a Wild West.' The European Union has set regulations for EV battery recycling, including requirements for recycled materials in new batteries starting in 2031. Experts say that without regulation, Canada won't be ready to deal with the wave of EV batteries that will need to be recycled in the near future. By 2040, there will be at least 93,000 EV batteries that require recycling, with a further 500,000 ready between 2040 and 2045. 'I don't think there's any excuse for not getting ahead of this,' Winfield said. 'It would be a monumental lack of foresight.'

Carlos Ghosn, the architect of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, is rapidly becoming a footnote in history. His legacy is being marred by Nissan's financial struggles, which may lead to bankruptcy. The company is reportedly considering selling its Yokohama HQ, a move that could be seen as a desperate attempt to stay afloat. Automotive News cites Nikkei and others in reporting this development. As Ghosn's influence wanes, his once-promising alliance is crumbling, with Nissan's failed attempt to merge with Honda being a major setback.

**GWM Chairman Hints at Possible Bankruptcy of BYD, Drawing Parallel with Evergrande**
The chairman of GWM, Wei Jianjun, hinted in an interview that he does not rule out the possibility of BYD's bankruptcy, drawing a parallel with the infamous Evergrande. The main risk factors for the largest Chinese automaker are a large debt burden and inflated statistical data. According to Wei Jianjun, the practice of selling new cars as used is used by Chinese automakers to create the illusion of a sales boom, which is necessary to attract investors. Wei Jianjun did not mention BYD directly in his interview, but noted that 'there is an Evergrande in the automotive industry'. BYD has the largest debt among all Chinese companies, totaling 584.7 billion yuan (6.375 trillion rubles) as of 2024. BYD's general director of public relations, Li Yunfei, has taken the comparison with Evergrande to heart. This is a sharp blow to the company's reputation, as Evergrande was once the undisputed leader in the industry, and BYD is currently the leader in the automotive segment. BYD has introduced significant discounts on its products, up to 34%, in May 2025, indicating that the company's position is not as stable as it seems.

**Hynion Sverige Files for Bankruptcy: A Cautionary Tale of the Vätgas Bubble**
Hynion Sverige AB, a Swedish vätgas company, has filed for bankruptcy due to financial problems and weak demand. Many vätgas projects have been canceled or significantly reduced in the past year. Christian Sandström writes in a commentary that this points to another 'green bubble'. The company's Norwegian parent company, Hynion AS, continues to operate: 'We remain committed to building a strong and sustainable vätgas infrastructure in Scandinavia,' said Kurt Dahlberg, a board member. However, the reasons for the bankruptcy in Sweden are high debt, weak demand for vätgas vehicles, and a challenging market situation. The sale of vätgas-powered fuel cell vehicles has fallen by up to 91% on the world's largest markets. Analysts warn of a structural decline in the market for vätgas-powered fuel cell vehicles. Many vätgas projects were put on hold in 2024 due to technical problems, high energy consumption, significant transmission losses, and declining demand. Sandström suggests that vätgas is a 'green bubble' due to the mismatch between political support and the physical realities of the technology. The EU has allocated 430 billion euros for vätgas-based projects by 2030, which is equivalent to around 80% of Sweden's GDP. Sandström argues that this money distorts incentives, eliminates risk-taking, and reduces companies to mere grant recipients. He predicts that there will be more vätgas crashes in the coming years.

**Stellantis Announces Historic R$ 14 Billion Investment in Polo Automotivo de Betim**
Stellantis announced a historic investment of R$ 14 billion in the Polo Automotivo de Betim, which will be implemented between 2025 and 2030. This investment is part of the R$ 32 billion that will be invested by the company in South America, with R$ 30 billion for Brazil and R$ 2 billion for Argentina. The investment will focus on the production of hybrid motors, reinforcing the central role of the Polo Automotivo de Betim in the national industry. The announcement has created expectations of economic and social growth for the city. According to Governor Romeu Zema, 'These motors are in line with the new market trend. We always said that the ethanol-powered car is almost as green as the electric one. So, having a hybrid vehicle, powered by ethanol and electricity, shows that the energy will also be green.' The technology Bio-Hybrid combines electrification with the use of biofuels, such as ethanol. The Polo de Betim is already the global center of Stellantis for the development of this technology, and now it will gain even more strength. The first vehicles with this technology are expected to be launched this year. 'We will continue the incredible legacy of this factory, directing the value to renew our product line, develop new technologies, and create new jobs,' said executive Emanuele Cappellano. The news of the largest investment in the history of the Betim factory has created expectations for the population and local institutions. The installation of the Polo Automotivo as Fiat - today Stellantis - in 1976 has played a fundamental role in the growth of the city as a whole. 'I classify this event in the same way as the arrival of Fiat in the city. Betim took a leap, improved employment, retail, and entrepreneurship. Today, I see it the same way,' said José Barboza, president of the Câmara de Dirigentes Lojistas de Betim (CDL Betim). Barbosa highlighted the flow of companies that the factory already brings to the city and that will increase, and, with that, ratifies the relevance of the formation of qualified labor. 'One of the things that should walk in parallel is the formation of qualified labor, so that the residents of the city occupy these new vacancies - not just in the factory, but also in everything that this will develop together. This forms people, helps families, and reflects in everything, improves commerce, the economy as a whole.' Geraldo Lima, community leader in Jardim Teresópolis and president of the Instituto Aliança Betim (IAB), reinforces the role of the factory for the region that grew around it. 'By announcing the R$ 14 billion that will invest in the city, the company demonstrates and strengthens the representation it already has in the city and region, as it has always given great support to local projects.' Geraldo reiterates the need for young people to be trained and hopes for a special look from the company to the community and social issues. 'I hope they have a special look at the development of local commerce, incentives and support for small entrepreneurs and opening of vocational courses,' said the president of the IAB. For the municipal secretary of Economic Development, Gilmar Mascarenhas, the announced investment by Stellantis points to an optimistic scenario for the growth of the city. 'In this scenario, Betim guarantees, for the next years, an exponential growth of the economy. The expectation is that this industrial and technological reference in the automotive market will provide all the betinense society with access to the greatest economic and social opportunities.'

**Fresh blows to China’s Neta: here’s how the one-time EV darling got here · TechNode**
Chinese electric vehicle startup Neta Auto is facing significant challenges, including bankruptcy proceedings against its parent company, Hozon. Despite receiving government funds, filing for an HK IPO, and announcing restructuring initiatives, Neta has struggled with unpaid debt, mass layoffs, and idle factories. According to chairman Fang Yunzhou, the company aims to break even by 2026 and focus on overseas markets. Neta has received $306 million in credit and has started building a car plant in Thailand. However, the company's struggles highlight the challenges faced by smaller EV makers in a competitive landscape, where vague strategy and poor management can lead to losses. As Fang Yunzhou said, 'We will direct more effort to overseas markets and strive to break even by 2026.'

**European Automotive Industry Faces Bankruptcy Due to Declining Competitiveness**
The European automotive industry is facing bankruptcy due to declining competitiveness on both external and internal markets. The introduction of high tariffs on imported cars by the US, under the Trump administration, has severely impacted German premium car manufacturers such as Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, which rely heavily on exports to the US and Mexico. The situation within the European Union is also concerning, with new car sales volumes failing to reach pre-crisis levels of 2019. As a result, companies are forced to implement unpopular measures, such as layoffs, as seen in Volkswagen's massive layoff program until 2030. Chinese companies are also putting pressure on European automakers by offering more affordable and technologically advanced models, often surpassing European counterparts in terms of price-to-quality ratio. This has prompted European manufacturers to rapidly transition to electric vehicle production, requiring massive investments and adding additional financial burden to the industry.

**Mattias Goldmann: 'Northvolt – this is a likely scenario now'**
After the bankruptcy announcement, at least 10 things can be noted, writes Mattias Goldmann, CEO of the 2030 Secretariat. 'Northvolt is a likely scenario now', says Goldmann. The 2030 Secretariat has long advocated for Sweden to take the lead in the green transition. Goldmann notes that the bankruptcy opens up opportunities, the operation continues, and there are speculators. He also mentions that the clock is ticking, employees are at risk of losing their jobs, national politics can help due to component shortages, but also hinder, the EU will decide, and Korea or Japan could be involved, or a dark horse like Renault. Goldmann concludes that the green transition will continue, but needs a strong signal.

**Ford Europe on the Brink of Bankruptcy: A Crisis of Electric Vehicles and Declining Sales**
Ford Europe is on the brink of bankruptcy due to the poor sales of its electric vehicles and declining sales. The company has received a €4.4 billion bailout from its parent company, Ford Motor Company, to pay off its €5.8 billion debt. However, this is not a long-term solution, and the company is expected to continue to struggle. Ford Europe has been forced to reduce its workforce, with the number of employees at its Cologne site decreasing from 18,500 to 12,700. The company's main union, IG Metall, is concerned about the long-term prospects of Ford Europe and is calling for a clear plan to address the company's financial woes. The decision by Ford Motor Company to stop covering the losses of its European subsidiary is seen as a sign that the parent company is washing its hands of the situation. The European Union's decision to phase out internal combustion engines by 2035 has created chaos and uncertainty for Ford Europe, and the company is struggling to adapt to the changing market. As one commentator noted, 'L'Europe m'a tué' (Europe has killed me).

**EV dead end: Nikola's fall highlights financial and supply woes for startups**
US-based electric vehicle (EV) startup Nikola has filed for bankruptcy protection, a move that was expected by industry insiders. The company's market value plummeted from US$2.7 billion to below US$50 million due to challenges in securing buyers and funding. EV startups face multiple predicaments, including soaring R&D costs, production bottlenecks, delivery delays, and weakening end-market demand. In contrast, Rivian Automotive, another American EV startup, has experienced a different trajectory, reporting revenue of US$1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 and delivering over 14,000 units. Rivian benefits from solid backing, including a US$4 billion investment from Volkswagen and Amazon's plans to deploy 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2030. However, its ability to further ramp up production and accelerate deliveries will be crucial for its long-term success.

**Scholz's Legacy: Stagnation, High Prices, and Bankruptcies**
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his Social Democratic Party (SPD) have been losing popularity among German voters. The SPD's rating has been around 15% for the past year, making it unlikely to win more than third place in the early parliamentary elections on February 23. Scholz has stated that he intends to leave politics after leaving office. During his tenure, Germany has faced economic, industrial, and migration crises. The country's economy has been in recession for the past two years, with a 0.3% decline in 2023 and a 0.2% decline in 2024. The energy crisis has been exacerbated by the shutdown of the last three German nuclear power plants in 2023. Germany has also seen a significant increase in the number of bankruptcies, with over 18,000 companies going bankrupt in 2023. The country's industrial production has declined by 0.3% in 2022, 1.9% in 2023, and 4.5% in 2024. The automotive industry, a key sector for Germany, has been particularly affected. The government's decision to phase out nuclear power and increase the use of renewable energy has led to a significant increase in energy prices. The country's inflation rate has been high, with a 6.9% increase in 2022 and a 5.9% increase in 2023. The unemployment rate has remained stable, but the number of refugees has increased, with over 1.2 million Ukrainians living in Germany as of the end of 2024. The government has also faced criticism for its handling of the migration crisis, with a significant increase in the number of asylum applications. The country's defense spending has increased, with a 2.12% GDP allocation in 2024, and Germany has become the second-largest donor to Ukraine, providing around 44 billion euros in aid. However, the government's decision to provide Ukraine with zirconium-based missiles has been criticized, and the country's migration policies have been criticized for being too lenient. 'The legacy of Scholz is stagnation, high prices, and bankruptcies,' said a government official. 'The country is facing a severe economic crisis, and the government's policies have only made things worse.'

**Why an electric truck maker once worth more than Ford just went bust**
Nikola, an electric and hydrogen truck maker, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and will sell its assets due to a cash crunch. The company, which was once worth over $30 billion and more than Ford at the time, faced a high-profile fraud scandal and struggled to commercialize its technology. Nikola's founder, Trevor Milton, was accused of misleading investors and was sentenced to four years in jail. The company lost over $200 million in the third quarter of 2024 and had only enough cash to last until the first quarter of this year. Industry analyst Sam Fiorani said that the transition to EVs has been slower than anticipated, and commercial vehicles are a difficult segment to break into. Fiorani added that the arrival of higher interest rates has shut off the supply of easy money, making it difficult for EV startups to stay financed. Tesla is the only successful EV startup, and even legacy automakers have struggled to make money on EVs.

Fiorani said, 'The transition EVs has been slower than all manufacturers anticipated, and when it comes to commercial vehicles, that's a really tough segment to break into.' Nikola is the latest once-promising EV startup to run out of money, following in the footsteps of Fisker and Canoo. Fiorani added, 'Keeping these companies financed takes more than just wishful thinking that someday they'll make money.' Only Tesla has been able to become profitable through selling EVs, and even legacy automakers have struggled to make money on EVs, with Ford losing $5 billion on its EV business last year.

**Aston Martin Pushes Back the Launch of Its First EV (Again)**
Aston Martin has pushed back the launch of its first electric vehicle (EV) to within the next five years, or by 2030. CEO Adrian Hallmark said the company will unveil its first EV 'in this decade, but we’ll add hybrid derivatives as well, through to 2035.' Hallmark also stated that full electrification of the brand might not happen until 2040, with 85% of its sales by 2030 expected to be internal combustion engine cars or hybrids. The company is considering multiple options for its first EV, including a competitor to Porsche's Taycan or a battery-electric version of its DBX SUV. Aston Martin has designed four different battery-electric vehicles, but is keeping the details under wraps for now. The company is prioritizing customer demand and avoiding a hasty transition to EVs, citing its history of struggling through bankruptcy.

**Goodbye gas: Volvo to make only electric vehicles by 2030**
Volvo announced that it will phase out the production of all cars with internal combustion engines by 2030, including hybrids. According to Volvo's chief technology officer, Henrik Green, 'There is no long-term future for cars with an internal combustion engine.' The company aims to have half of its global sales be fully electric cars by 2025, with the remaining half made up of hybrids. Volvo will unveil its second fully electric car, a follow-up to last year's XC40 Recharge, a compact SUV. Green emphasized that Volvo is 'firmly committed to becoming an electric-only car maker' to meet customer expectations and combat climate change. Despite the growing number of EVs available in the U.S., fully electric vehicles accounted for less than 2% of new vehicle sales last year.
