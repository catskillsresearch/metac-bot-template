**Could bird flu be the next pandemic? What we know about H5N1**
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has reported 70 human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. since 2024, with the first human death caused by the virus announced in early 2025. While the CDC considers the risk to the public to be low, many experts have varying opinions on the potential for the virus to escalate into a more serious problem. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease specialist, said, 'I think we are living next to a volcano, and it may erupt or it may not, but we need to prepare for the possibility of a pandemic.' The virus has been detected in wild birds, poultry, and dairy cows in the U.S., and has also been found in North Carolina, where no human cases have been announced. The CDC advises that poultry and eggs should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees to kill bacteria and viruses, including avian influenza A viruses. Biosecurity measures can help protect backyard chickens and other domestic birds from infectious diseases, including avian flu. The symptoms of bird flu in humans may include eye redness, respiratory symptoms, and fever, and anyone with direct or close exposure to infected birds or animals should be monitored for illness for 10 days after their last exposure.

**Staff exodus at US farm agency leaves fewer experts to battle bird flu**
The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has lost 16% of its staff, including 400 veterinarians, due to the Trump administration's push for resignations. This has left fewer specialists to respond to animal disease outbreaks, such as the ongoing bird flu outbreak, which has wiped out millions of laying hens and driven up egg prices. State veterinarians warn that the reduced staff will lead to slower response times and less responsiveness to local veterinary needs. As one state veterinarian, Beth Thompson, said, 'The federal government, they won't have the number of people to be able to help out the states. It's a big deal.' The departures also include about half of APHIS' legislative and public affairs office, which handles correspondence with Congress and the press. The USDA did not respond to a request for comment.

**Bird flu is continuing to spread in animals across the US. Here’s what you need to know**
Bird flu, or avian influenza, is continuing to spread in animals across the United States, with over 1,000 herds infected in 17 states. The virus has also caused human cases among U.S. poultry farm workers and culling operations workers. Dr. Tony Moody, a professor of pediatrics and immunology at Duke University School of Medicine, said there has been so much transmission of bird flu in animals that he wonders if mass immunity is far off. The CDC has confirmed at least 70 human cases and one death in Louisiana, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The U.S. government is investing $1 billion to fight bird flu, including $500 million for biosecurity measures and $100 million for vaccine research. However, some experts are worried that the virus could still mutate or adapt to become more severe or transmissible, and that there has been a curtailing of testing and surveillance. Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California, Davis Health, said 'If we don’t have the data then we don’t know what next steps to take.' The U.S. has licensed three bird flu vaccines, targeting the H5N1 strain, which are being held in a national stockpile, but they are not available to the public and would only be distributed in case of an emergency.

**How Pandemics Serve The Needs Of The Biodefense Industrial Complex: Dr. Meryl Nass (TRANSCRIPT AVAILABLE AT LINK. Video is 1 hr 33 minutes)**
Dr. Meryl Nass, an internal medicine specialist with 42 years of experience, discusses the biodefense industrial complex and its role in pandemics. She states that the goal is to create COVID-like situations where 'garbage products are injected into us.' Nass expresses shock at the number of chickens killed and the lack of scientific understanding of the bird flu. She criticizes the European CDC for not conducting basic research and cites the example of a top bird flu researcher who changed his stance on how the virus spreads. Nass estimates that over 500 million chickens have been culled in the US and Europe over the last 5-10 years, and argues that this is driven by large companies owning the animals and the farmers being 'peons' on their own land. She notes that this is a result of vertical and horizontal consolidation of farming, where large companies own 90% of the market in the US.

**Shooting industry is destroying British countryside with 'irreversible consequences' warns TV presenter - The Mirror**
A new report by Animal Aid and Chris Packham warns that the shooting industry and the release of millions of pheasant and partridges each year is having a devastating impact on the British countryside and native wildlife. The report, 'Killing our countryside', highlights the 'terrible harm inflicted on the birds' who are raised on intensive factory farms, as well as the serious repercussions for native wildlife, including declines in their populations. Chris Packham said, 'The UK is one of the most nature-depleted nations on the planet - we need to urgently preserve our biodiversity. If we don't, the consequences will be irreversible and dire.' The report also warns that gamekeepers target animals deemed a threat to these birds, such as foxes, crows, and protected raptors, to create an artificial landscape for those paying to shoot innocent birds for sport. The report estimates that up to 400,000 wildfowl are poisoned by lead ammunition each year, and that the release of millions of birds is also contributing to the spread of avian flu. Emma Slawinski, chief executive at the League Against Cruel Sports, said, 'This report shows the shocking impact the shooting industry is having on the lives of gamebirds, wildlife and the environment.' Iain Green, director of Animal Aid, added, 'The time to act is now.' However, Glynn Evans, head of game and wildlife management at the British Association of Shooting and Conservation, countered, 'Claims about the impact of game bird releasing ignore the vital conservation work done by the shooting community, who manage millions of hectares to support biodiversity and protect vulnerable species.'

**US Egg Crisis: Bird Flu Outbreak and Concentrated Production**
The United States is experiencing a 'chicken egg crisis', with prices for eggs tripling to $6 per dozen. The cause of the crisis is a bird flu outbreak that has significantly reduced the number of laying hens. According to the US Department of Agriculture, over 150 million birds have died since 2022 due to the outbreak. The CEO of Cal-Maine, the largest egg producer in the US, stated that the company has done everything it can to meet the demand for eggs, but the situation is beyond its control. The company's CEO, Miller, said, 'Someone has to be blamed for everything. They are looking for a villain.' Miller also stated that the company does not have the power to control the prices of eggs. The US Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the price increase of eggs and is examining the pricing practices of Cal-Maine and other companies. The article suggests that the high concentration of egg production in the US may be a contributing factor to the crisis.

**USDA's Animal Health Agency Loses Key Personnel Amid Avian Flu Outbreak**
The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has lost 1,377 employees, including 400 veterinarians, due to the Trump administration's push for voluntary resignations. This has left fewer experts to combat the longest outbreak of avian flu in US history and the invasion of the New World beetle, a carnivorous pest detected among cattle in Mexico. 'With the decrease in veterinary positions at the USDA, there is concern that fewer veterinarians may be able to meet the ongoing regulatory requirements, disease investigations, and planning and preparation for responses,' said Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith. 'This may result in slower response times and reduced capacity to meet local veterinary needs,' he added. The loss of personnel threatens the APHIS's ability to respond to the avian flu, which continues to infect dairy herds and birds, said three state veterinarians and three other sources. Seventy people, mostly rural workers, have contracted the virus since 2024, and a wider spread increases the risk of the avian flu becoming more transmissible to humans, experts say. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say the risk of transmission of avian flu to people remains low.

**Solutions to Bird Flu Hatched**
The latest strain of avian influenza, H5N1, has caused a significant shortage of eggs, with prices increasing by over 60% in 2024 and predicted to spike by 50% in 2025. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), over 168 million birds have died or been culled in the last three years, with most being egg-laying hens. Researchers have developed a model to help predict and prepare for the spread of the virus, incorporating waterfowl habitats, environmental factors, and farm locations. The model will be released for broader use, including state and federal agencies, commercial and backyard farmers, to help them prepare for oncoming waves of the virus. As one researcher noted, 'THAT CHILL IN THE EGG AISLE isn't just refrigeration.'

**Robert Kennedy Jr.'s Controversial Plan to Combat Avian Influenza**
US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. has proposed a controversial plan to combat the avian influenza that is decimating poultry farms in the country and fueling the severe egg crisis. He suggests allowing the virus to spread so that immune animals can be identified and preserved. However, this plan is criticized by the scientific community for being inhumane to infected animals and potentially hazardous to public health and the economy. Kennedy is known for his anti-scientific views, being a prominent figure in the US anti-vaccination movement and supporting various conspiracy theories. The H5N1 avian influenza has been spreading in US poultry farms since 2023, primarily through contact between chickens and migratory birds. It has infected around 70 humans, mostly those working closely with animals, but no cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported. The virus is more likely to spread in outdoor farms, but the risk is higher in indoor farms where the virus can spread more easily. When a single case is detected, all animals in the farm are killed, and the farmers are partially reimbursed for their losses. According to the Agriculture Department, 18 million turkeys, chickens raised for meat, and laying hens were culled in December 2024, and 23 million in January 2025. In total, an estimated 167 million birds have been affected. The plan is also criticized for being economically damaging, as it would expose farmers to even greater losses. After the animals' death, it takes months to dispose of the carcasses, sanitize the coops, and raise new chickens to laying age. The consequences would reach consumers, who are already struggling to find eggs, which are now twice as expensive as last summer. 'The disease would cause very painful deaths in almost 100% of cases of chickens and turkeys,' said veterinarian David Swayne, who worked for 30 years at the Agriculture Department.

**Avian Flu: Brittany Remains Free of Outbreaks, but Concerns Grow in the United States**
The Brittany region in France has been spared from the avian flu outbreak in poultry farms for three months. However, the virus continues to kill wild birds. The concern is coming from the United States, where the virus is causing widespread damage in farms and human cases are multiplying. A mutation of the virus is feared. 'No outbreaks in Brittany,' said the director of the Direction de la protection des populations d'Ille-et-Vilaine. The last affected farm in France dates back to January 3, 2025. The virus has been regularly detected in wild animals, including gulls, seagulls, and raptors, which have been diagnosed with the H5N1 virus. This presence requires maintaining France in a high epizootic risk. Brittany had 9 successive infection foci in poultry farms in 2024, a less bad record than in 2022 and 2023. The concern is coming from the United States, where the epizooty rebounded this winter. 18 million birds were euthanized in December 2024 and 23 million in January 2025, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The virus has already killed 158 million ducks, chickens, and laying hens in three years, leading to a sharp increase in egg prices and new imports from abroad. 'The passage to humans is a real subject of concern,' said the director of the Direction de la protection des populations d'Ille-et-Vilaine. 80 human cases have been detected, mainly in the United States and Asia. No cases in France. A case was reported in England in late January 2025. The virus has taken severe forms in some patients, with a death in the United States and a severe case in Canada. The protection of farms is not just an economic issue, but also a health issue. The risk of the virus mutating is higher in industrial farms, where tens of thousands of birds are raised on the same farm. The authorities are on high alert and have organized a vaccination campaign against the flu season for people working with poultry. The vigilance of farmers has paid off, and the absence of contamination in farms remains a good news for this start of 2025. 'The farmers have been very rigorous on biosecurity measures, controlling strictly the entries and exits in their farm building,' said Virshna Heng, director of the Direction de la protection des populations d'Ille-et-Vilaine. The European Union is also concerned about the situation in Hungary, which has the most outbreaks in poultry farms (219 foyers since August 2024) than the four other most affected countries in Europe (Poland, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany).

**Farm News & Views for the week of February 17th, 2025**
A recent USDA report revealed that the number of farms in the US decreased by 14,000 to 1.88 million at the end of 2024. Eric Wareham, senior vice president of government affairs at the North American Equipment Dealers Association, described the situation as 'a perfect storm' for farmers and agricultural equipment dealers due to expected lower farm income and tariffs on new equipment. Bill Bullard, CEO of Rcalf USA, pointed out that the US is losing beef cattle and sheep farms, with a 2.5 million cow reduction in the herd since 2017. USDA staff and veterinarians recommend euthanizing all birds in a flock infected with bird flu to prevent the disease from spreading. However, there have been no recent reports or briefings on the outbreak, and the US has withdrawn from the World Health Organization. Adam Lauring, a Michigan Medicine virologist, expressed concern about the first case of H5N1 influenza in pigs in Oregon, as it could potentially cause a pandemic.

**I'm a farmer who was forced to kill 6.5m hens. Here's the terrifying truth of America's**
A third-generation poultry farmer in Michigan shares the devastating truth about America's poultry industry, which is under attack by the H5N1 bird flu virus. Since 2022, 153 million birds have been infected, and millions more have been euthanized to stop the spread of the virus. The farmer's own operation, Herbruck's Poultry Ranch, lost 6.5 million hens in a single week, resulting in 6 million fewer eggs per day being produced and sold. The farmer likens the avian flu scourge to a terrorist attack, and warns that American consumers are sharing the burden of skyrocketing grocery prices, with a dozen eggs now costing up to $8. 'To a family farmer, that's emotionally and financially devastating. To the American consumer, it's a gut punch,' the farmer says.

**The impact from bird flu spreads**
The current strain of bird flu, H5N1, has had a significant impact since reaching the United States in 2022. Over 148 million chickens, turkeys, and other farm birds have been euthanized. Since the virus jumped from poultry and wild birds to mammals, the number of human cases has risen to 67, with one death. The outbreak is expected to have far-reaching consequences for humans, the poultry industry, egg prices, and U.S. exports.

The United States has reported its first outbreak of H5N9 bird flu in poultry on a duck farm in California. The outbreak, which also detected the more common H5N1 strain, has led to the killing of almost 119,000 birds on the farm by December 2, 2024. The USDA predicts a 20% increase in egg prices in 2025, attributing the rise to the bird flu outbreak, which has caused a strain in the number of layers. USA Today notes that the USDA's egg price outlook also shows that egg prices are expected to increase more than overall food prices, with a 2.2% increase predicted for 2025.

**Over 100,000 ducks to be euthanized at New York farm after bird flu outbreak**
A Long Island farm, Crescent Duck Farm, will euthanize over 100,000 ducks due to a bird flu outbreak. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been infecting people, pets, and poultry across the U.S. Crescent Duck Farm President Doug Corwin said, 'You constantly monitor your flock - three times a day. One day things looked unusual. I noticed a few lethargic birds that didn't seem right.' Suffolk County Health Commissioner Gregson Pigott stated, 'Unfortunately, when you have a situation like this where you have a flock that's infected, the remedy is to put the entire flock down.' The bird flu has been making its way around the world since 1997 and has spread to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In the U.S., there have been 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu since April 2024, with the first reported death in January 2025.

**Over 20 Million US Chickens Killed By Bird Flu, Contributing To Egg Price Rises**
The ongoing bird flu outbreak in the US has led to the deaths of over 20 million egg-laying chickens, contributing to a significant rise in egg prices. The virus, which often surges during the autumn and winter months, has been particularly harsh this winter, with cases linked to contaminated raw milk and the disease spreading across the country. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has reported that all major production systems have been impacted, including conventional caged birds, cage-free, and certified organic types. The federal government has spent $1.25 billion to compensate farmers for their losses and encourage them to report infections and strengthen their biosecurity approaches. Despite the surge in bird flu cases among animals, confirmed cases among people remain low, with 66 reported cases since the outbreak began in 2022, mostly among farm workers who have close contact with animals.

**50,000 Animals to be Killed Due to Bird Flu Outbreak in Schwäbisch Hall**
Due to the outbreak of bird flu in the Schwäbisch Hall district, 50,000 animals will be killed. The disease has broken out in a larger poultry farm, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. To prevent the spread to other herds, the animals of the affected herd will be killed in a humane manner. 'We must assume that the virus of type H5N1 has already spread in the herd,' said a spokesperson. The responsible district office is now investigating how the outbreak occurred. A protection zone with a three-kilometer radius and a surveillance zone with a ten-kilometer radius have been set up around the farm, according to the Ministry. In these zones, a compulsory housing of poultry applies. Agrarminister Peter Hauk called on poultry keepers to adhere to the so-called biosafety measures. 'This means, in particular, that direct and indirect contacts between poultry and other kept birds with wild birds must be prevented at all costs,' emphasized the CDU politician. Also, cleaning and disinfection measures must be consistently maintained. 'It was a great day' said no one, but the situation is serious. The bird flu or avian influenza is an infectious disease that mainly occurs in waterfowl and other birds. It can cause significant economic damage when introduced into farms. Experts consider the H5N1 virus a potential pandemic candidate. The pathogen has killed millions of animals in recent years, including many mammals. Humans can also become infected, as seen in recent cases in the US, where employees of poultry farms became infected. However, there has been no ongoing human-to-human transmission so far. According to the Robert Koch Institute, there has been no proven case of a person infected with H5N1 in the EU.
