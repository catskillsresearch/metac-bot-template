**Catalan Parliament Votes to Lower Voting Age to 16**
The Catalan Parliament has approved a motion from ERC to lower the voting age to 16 years old through 'the relevant actions in Spanish legislative chambers'. The motion passed with the votes of PSC-Units, Junts, ERC, Comuns, and CUP, while PP and Vox voted against it, and Aliança Catalana abstained. Additionally, the Parliament approved a point that urges the Govern to approve the National Youth Plan 2030 by June 2025 and deploy it immediately, followed by the Action Plan 2026. Another point that passed calls on the Govern to present a project to integrate the Cultura Jove program into the Carnet Jove by December 2025, 'guaranteeing its territorial deployment for the promotion of Catalan-language shows'. The Parliament also approved that the Govern ensure by December 2027 that all municipalities with over 5,000 inhabitants have the necessary tools to develop a Local Youth Council.

**Vox Responds to OBEDE Barometer: 'Does Not Reflect Reality'**
Vox has responded to the OBEDE barometer by the UCAM, which suggests that if general elections were held, Vox would maintain its two regional deputies but see a decrease in votes from 22% to 19.9%. Vox has stated that this does not 'reflect reality' and is 'far from showing the party's trend'. They claim to be 'growing, like their allies in other countries', and that they are 'on the side of the Spanish people'. Vox has also expressed skepticism towards polls, stating 'we don't believe in polls' and that 'the true poll is what we see every day in the street, in every event, in every meeting with our fellow citizens who share our concern for the future of our nation'.

**UCAM Study Reveals Majority of Respondents Favor Early General Elections**
A recent study by the UCAM's Observatorio Español de Estudios Demoscópicos (OBEDE-UCAM) reveals that 54.1% of respondents would prefer to hold early general elections. According to the study, conducted in the first two weeks of May in the Region of Murcia, only 31.4% of respondents opt to maintain the current investiture pacts. The study also shows that support for early elections increases with age: 45.8% among 18-30 year olds and 64.1% among those over 65. 'The 69.7% of PP voters and 85.7% of Vox voters demand to go to the polls, while 57.7% of PSOE voters and 84.8% of Sumar voters prefer to maintain the coalition, although it is significant that 29.5% of PSOE voters are in favor of early elections.' The study also predicts a majority for the PP in the Regional Assembly of Murcia, with the party consolidating its dominance from 41.5% to 45.5% of the votes and winning 5 of the 10 seats at stake. 'The PP's gain comes entirely from the left flank, where the former Sumar space (united with Podemos and IU), which two years ago obtained 9.6% of the votes and a deputy, now appears fragmented in two different candidacies: Sumar/IU and Podemos, with 4.8% each.' The study concludes that these left-wing formations would not win any seats in the regional parliament, while the PSOE would maintain its 3 seats and Vox would keep its 2 seats. 'The 39.6% prefer that the PP continues to govern alone, while 28.8% opt for early regional elections and 15.6% miss a PP-Vox pact.' The study also highlights that support for the regional government increases with age: 31.8% among 18-30 year olds and 46.5% among those over 65. The main concerns of the respondents in the region are housing (28.7%), unemployment (24.5%), and security (22.3%). Nationally, the main concerns are the functioning of the political system (33.4%), housing (31.2%), immigration (27.2%), and unemployment (25.2%). The study also reveals that 61.6% of respondents believe that Spain's immigration policy is too permissive, while only 8.3% think it is too strict.

**The Great Taboo of Electoral Overrepresentation in Spain**
The head of the EU mission sent to Spain to investigate the government's refusal to apply the 2018 EU electoral reform law has expressed 'astonishment' at the government's attitude. The government has avoided meetings with the mission, aiming to prevent the reform from becoming a topic of debate in Spain. This would avoid discussing the overrepresentation of separatist parties in the European Parliament and, indirectly, their excessive representation in the Spanish Congress. The 2018 electoral reform law sets a minimum threshold of 2% and a maximum of 5% for parties to enter the European Parliament. In the 2023 European elections, only three Spanish parties, PP, PSOE, and Vox, would have obtained seats with the 5% threshold. The PNV would have been excluded with the 2% threshold. The government's refusal to apply the reform protects its nationalist partners, allowing them to obtain representation that would be impossible in countries with a 5% threshold, such as France, Poland, and Hungary. The current electoral law, LOREG, established in 1985, favors majoritarian parties and nationalist parties with concentrated representation. This system harms parties with national implantation but smaller vote percentages, such as UPyD and Ciudadanos. In some provinces, these parties need up to 15% or 20% of the votes to obtain a single seat. In the 2023 general elections, PP and PSOE seats cost 59,000 and 63,000 votes each, while PNV and EH Bildu obtained seats with 55,000 and 66,000 votes. Vox and Sumar seats cost 91,000 and 97,000 votes, respectively. The overrepresentation of separatist parties has become a major problem for Spanish democracy, allowing parties to boycott common policies. The EU mission's findings will not automatically make the electoral reform a priority, but it is a warning sign about the unsustainability of a system that rewards regionalist parties while harming national forces.

**CEOE Pressures PP and Vox to Block Reduction of Working Week**
The CEOE (Spanish Confederation of Employers) is pressuring the PP (People's Party) and Vox to block the reduction of the working week to 37.5 hours with an amendment to the entirety. The organization has been meeting with most parliamentary groups to persuade them to support an amendment that would return the text to the Government. So far, only Junts has publicly stated its intention to present it, but CEOE is trying to persuade PP and Vox to do the same. According to the president of Foment del Treball, Antonio Garamendi, the goal is to get the parties of the right to make a common front against the measure and support Junts not only with a vote against, but with an initiative that goes in the same direction and rejects the measure that the patronal considers unbearable. This would guarantee that this first debate takes place, even if the formation of Carles Puigdemont closes some kind of agreement with the Ministry of Labor to withdraw this brake. Vox has already voted against reducing the working week by law in February 2024, when Sumar brought a non-binding proposal to the Lower House to measure the support that the future norm would have. In contrast, the PP abstained, which gave hope to a part of the Government and generated concern among some entrepreneurs, who now hope that it will be sensitive to their claims.

**Spanish Government Instructs Students to Protest and Use Anonymity to Avoid Repression**
The Spanish government, led by Prime Minister Sánchez, is instructing students to protest and avoid police repression by using anonymity. The government is preparing a decree to promote youth participation in politics. The Ministry of Education has created a guide that teaches students how to make a manifesto and use social media as a megaphone. The guide emphasizes the importance of anonymity to avoid censorship and repression. The government's goal is to increase youth participation in politics, particularly among those under 24 years old, who voted overwhelmingly for the PSOE in the 2023 general elections. The PSOE has committed to modifying the electoral law to allow 16-year-olds to vote and increasing youth participation in elections by 10 percentage points. The government is also promoting education programs to encourage the importance of voting and civic engagement, especially among young people.

**Over Half of Murcians Want Early Elections, Survey Finds**
According to a recent survey by the UCAM, if general elections were held now, the People's Party (PP) would gain ground and win 5 seats, half of the 10 seats allocated to the Region of Murcia. The survey also found that over half of Murcians want Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez to call for early elections instead of waiting until 2027. The PP's gain is due to the division of the left, as explained by Pablo Blesa, dean of the Faculty of Communication at the University of Murcia, 'The seat that the PP wins is not at the expense of the PSOE or VOX, but due to the division of the left.' The left in the Region would lose representation in Congress, while the PSOE and VOX would maintain their current seats. The survey also found that 4 out of 10 young Murcians would not vote if elections were held now, and none of the leaders are approved by the respondents, with Pedro Sánchez being the most suspended, although also the most well-known. The top concerns of Murcians today are housing and unemployment, followed by security, immigration, and healthcare, as explained by Pablo Blesa, 'The ranking of the top five concerns is housing, unemployment, security, immigration, and healthcare.'

**PP Would Win 5 Seats in Region of Murcia in Hypothetical Election, Poll Finds**
According to a recent poll by the Observatorio Español de Estudios Demoscópicos de la UCAM (OBEDE), the PP would win 5 seats in the Region of Murcia in a hypothetical general election, up from the 4 seats they currently hold. The PSOE would maintain their 3 seats, while Vox would also maintain their 2 seats. SUMAR would lose their single seat. The poll also found that the PP's support increases with age, with 36% of voters over 65 supporting the party. In contrast, SUMAR and Podemos would see their support decrease with age, with 5.7% and 6.6% of voters aged 18-30 supporting them respectively. The poll also found that the PP's leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, is the most popular politician in the region, with a 4.2 out of 10 rating. The PSOE's leader, Pedro Sánchez, is the second most popular, with a 3.7 rating. The poll also found that the majority of voters (39.6%) prefer the PP to continue governing in the region, while 28.8% want to advance the elections and 15.6% want a pact between the PP and Vox. The support for the current regional government increases with age, from 31.8% among 18-30 year olds to 46.5% among those over 65.

**The European Crisis: A Wake-Up Call for Spain**
The world has changed since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and Trump's 'disengagement'. Europe is now more insecure. How will this affect Spain? Today, security is the priority, and Spain cannot afford to be absent. The UK, with its nuclear power and Labour government, is returning to Europe. Along with France, Germany, and Poland, they are forming an informal but crucial European directorate. Italy, the founder of the EU, is not participating because Meloni is not central to European affairs. Spain must change its approach to security and cannot afford to be absent. Some ministers in the Sánchez government are demanding to leave NATO, but this is absurd, given that Trump wants to reduce it. The EU has been a relevant partner for Spain in recent years, particularly in the creation of the economic regeneration fund. However, there is a lack of consensus on foreign policy. Both the PSOE and PP can govern, but the PP uses Brussels to punish Sánchez. The rise of populist extremism is a major challenge. It grew after Trump's election in 2017 and is fueled by social protest. Marine Le Pen is the first choice for workers in France, and Vox is the preferred option for young voters in Spain. The welfare state cannot solve everything, but it generates high expectations that are not always met. The great division in Europe is no longer between left and right, but between Europeanist and democratic forces and the extreme right, which wants to undermine democracy and the European project.

**Comelec: 1.3 million voters over-voted in 2025 polls**
According to Commission on Elections (Comelec) chairman George Erwin Garcia, about 1.3 million out of 57 million voters over-voted in the recent May 12 polls by voting for 13 or more senators. Garcia clarified that the 17 million over-votes mentioned by former Comelec commissioner Rowena Guanzon refer to the votes not given to 12 senators, whoever they are. Garcia stated, 'It's 1.3 million voters who did not vote properly by voting for 13 or more senators.'

**Vox loses almost a point in voting intention estimate after Trump's tariffs**
Vox has lost almost a point in the voting intention estimate after Trump's tariffs. The PP has risen 1.3 points in the voting intention estimate, reaching 33.9%, eight tenths less than the result obtained in the polls. The PSOE remains almost the same as in the previous survey, with a 29.3% voting intention estimate, a loss of 2.4 points since the general elections. Sumar has slowed down the decline, but its 5.4% voting intention estimate, combined with Podemos' 3.1%, is far behind (four points less) than their 2023 result, when they ran together. The data from the online survey shows that Spain has awarded 46 contracts in the Koldo case, and that the PP has reduced its losses to Vox almost in half (from 10.5% to 5.9%). Vox maintains a good voting intention estimate (83.1%), but increases its losses to the PP (from 2.9% in the previous survey to 5.8% today) and reduces its losses to Se Acabó La Fiesta (from 11.3% to 5.4%). The socialist electorate's loyalty is 6.4 points lower (76.2%) than that of the PP, to which it would cede 6.1% of its votes today. Between the electorate that voted for the PSOE in 2023, today 12.4% are abstentionists and indecisive. Sumar barely retains 48.7% of its voters from the last elections, losing almost 28% of its votes to Podemos (which was part of the coalition at the time) and 7.1% to the PSOE. It is the political brand with the highest percentage of indecisives: 7.2%. According to the survey, Vox remains the first party in voting intention among 18- to 24-year-olds, with a 21.2% estimate, two points ahead of the PSOE (19%) and 5.3 points ahead of the PP (15.9%). However, the winning percentage among the youngest is political disaffection: the sum of indecisives, abstentionists, and those who would vote in blank or null reaches 30.3%. Vox obtains its worst voting intention estimate in the 45-54 and 55-64 age groups. The PP obtains its best estimate among those over 65: 27.7%. The socialists obtain their best estimate in the 25-34 age group: 26.3%. Vox outperforms the sum of Díaz's platform and Podemos in all age groups.

**PSOE increases lead over PP in voting intentions**
According to a recent survey by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS), the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) would be the most voted party in the next general elections, increasing its lead over the People's Party (PP). The survey shows that the PSOE would have a 34.8% intention to vote, which is 7.3 points more than the PP, with 27.5%. This is a 2.2 percentage point increase from the previous estimates. The Vox party would be in third place with 15.9%, followed by Sumar (5.7%), Podemos (3.4%), Junts (1.8%), and ERC (1.5%). As for the question of who would vote in the next elections, 19% of the respondents said PSOE, 15% said PP, 8.7% said Vox, and 3.1% said Sumar. 21.9% said they do not know yet, and 10.7% said they would not vote. Additionally, 78.9% of the respondents admitted to voting in the general elections of July 23, 2023, with 29.6% supporting the PSOE, 22% supporting the PP, and 10.9% supporting Sumar.

**CIS Survey on Power Outage Reveals Intention of Vote in Spain**
The Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS), led by José Félix Tezanos, has released a 'flash' survey on the recent power outage in Spain. The survey, conducted on April 29-30, includes a barometer on the intention of vote of the Spanish people if general elections were held today. According to the CIS, the PSOE would win the elections with a significant difference over the PP, while Vox would be the third force. However, the survey also shows that 21.9% of respondents do not know which party they would support. Tezanos has been criticized for incorporating questions on vote in non-electoral surveys, which has led to a significant increase in the number of questions asked. The CIS has been fined 3,000 euros by the Junta Electoral Central (JEC) for conducting a survey during the electoral period of the Catalan and European Parliament elections without prior notification. Tezanos said, 'We are fulfilling our obligation to consult citizens on relevant issues that occur in Spain.'

**Lowering the Voting Age to 16: A Divisive Proposal in Spain**
The Spanish government is preparing a legislative reform to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 years old, as part of a youth law and 'generational justice' aimed at combating political disaffection among young people. The Minister of Youth and Childhood, led by the Sumar party, argues that if a 16- or 17-year-old is mature enough to work, go to prison, or have an abortion, it is contradictory to deny them the right to vote. However, the proposal has sparked a debate, with the left-wing parties in favor and the right-wing parties opposed. Sumar proposes a gradual implementation, starting with European elections in 2029, which would not alter the electoral census in the 2027 cycle. This would add 1.05 million new voters to the census, which could benefit the right-wing parties, as young people's opinions are increasingly conservative, especially among men. A recent CIS study showed that 23.4% of 18- to 24-year-olds voted for the PSOE, while Se Acabó la Fiesta received 14.3%, and the PP and Vox trailed behind.

**Extreme Right Gains Momentum in Spain, Vox Surpasses 14% in Voting Intention**
The latest poll from 40dB for EL PAÍS and Cadena SER shows that the extreme right has gained almost 17% in voting intention, its best result since the general elections. The PP is at 32.6% in voting intention, a point below its result in the 2023 elections, and maintains a three-point lead over the PSOE (29.5%). Vox has gained almost two points since the 23-J, and would obtain 14.1% of the votes if elections were held today, while Se Acabó la Fiesta (SALF) would debut in the general elections with 2.7%. The PP has distanced itself from the extreme right's positions on Trump, but has pending negotiations with Vox on several autonomous budgets. The petition for the Supreme Court to investigate Alvise Pérez for illegal financing has not affected his party's popularity, and SALF has even improved its voting intention by almost a point. The PP is the most loyal party, with 81% of its 2023 voters still supporting it today. Vox is second, with 79.2% loyalty, while the PSOE has a loyalty rate of 74.6%, which is almost five points lower than the PP's.

**VOX's Rise Among Young Voters in Spain: A Rebellion Against the Establishment**
VOX, a far-right party in Spain, has seen a significant increase in support among young voters, with 27.4% of those under 25 years old backing the party, according to a recent poll. This is more than double the support for the PSOE (15%) and PP (11%) in this age group. VOX's success can be attributed to its anti-establishment message, which resonates with young people who feel disillusioned with the traditional political system. The party's strong online presence, particularly on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, has also played a significant role in its appeal to young voters. Oriol Bartomeus, director of the Instituto de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales, notes that VOX's 'anti-establishment' message is a key factor in its success, saying 'It's a fish that bites its own tail. The extreme right's proposal is one of rupture and link with the young vote and also with the networks, which are usually used by the young.' VOX's strategy has been to position itself as the 'rebel' alternative to the traditional system, which many young people perceive as failing them. The party's promise of a radical break with the status quo has been attractive to many young people who feel that the system has failed them. As Santiago Abascal, the leader of VOX, said in a recent interview, 'The right is the new punk.' This phenomenon poses significant challenges for the future of Spanish politics, with the potential for a realignment of the political landscape along generational lines.

**Feijóo's Challenge: Winning Back Young Voters from Vox**
The young voters in Spain are increasingly turning to Vox, a right-wing party, as their preferred choice. According to recent polls, Vox has a 27.4% lead among voters aged 18-24, with Santiago Abascal as their preferred president. The leader of the PP, Pablo Feijóo, is aware of this trend and is trying to reverse it by focusing on concrete problems affecting young people, such as access to housing and the high cost of rent. Feijóo has started to incorporate tools of listening and demographic surveys into his work to identify the niches on which to center his program. The PP is also working on a think tank, Reformismo21, to develop ideas and proposals for young people. Feijóo has stated that 'our strength is our proposals, Vox has a discourse, but no program. And things are not solved just with a 'viva España' or an 'abajo Sánchez'. Also, you have to manage.' The PP is aware that it cannot access the entire electorate of Vox, but it aspires to convince at least the 'less visceral' young voter with proposals that give solutions to their daily concerns.

**The Rise of the Far-Right Among Young People in Spain**
A decade after the 2015 general elections, the political landscape among young people in Spain has undergone a significant shift. According to a January CIS survey, VOX is now the leading force among 18-24 year olds, with 22.9% of the vote, followed by the PP (16.3%) and PSOE (14.1%). The left-wing parties have been relegated, with SUMAR receiving 5.4%, Podemos 2.6%, Más País 0.3%, and Izquierda Unida 0%. This trend is also reflected in a recent 40db survey, which shows a higher percentage of young people voting for extreme right-wing parties. As one might expect, this shift has raised concerns about the rise of the far-right among young people in Spain.
