**Mass Layoffs in 2025: Over 100,000 Jobs Lost Across Tech, Retail, and Manufacturing - TechStory**
The first half of 2025 has seen significant job losses across various industries, including tech, retail, and manufacturing. Microsoft laid off 6,000 employees, Amazon cut thousands of jobs, and Google eliminated several hundred roles. Meta, Walmart, CrowdStrike, Intel, UPS, BlackRock, Salesforce, Nissan, and Starbucks also announced layoffs, with a total of over 100,000 jobs lost. The job cuts are driven by a mix of global economic pressures, post-pandemic business corrections, rising inflation, and heavy investments in automation and artificial intelligence. Companies are rethinking their staffing strategies to adapt to rapid changes in technology, rising costs, and shifting consumer behavior. While some firms have offered severance and training support, many displaced employees will struggle to find similar roles. As one analyst noted, 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' but in this case, it's a reminder of the uncertainty and insecurity of the modern job market. 'The company is pushing toward greater reliance on automation,' said Microsoft's CEO, 'and this strategy has reduced the need for certain roles, even as the company reports strong financial performance.'

**NEW REPORT: Clean Energy Manufacturing Driving Next Chapter of U.S. Economic Prosperity  | AltEnergyMag**
A new report by CLEANPOWER 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America highlights the growth of clean energy manufacturing in the US, which is projected to support over 575,000 jobs and contribute $86 billion annually to GDP by 2030. According to Jason Grumet, CEO of ACP, 'If all announced manufacturing facilities become operational, clean power manufacturing is projected to support over 575,000 jobs and contribute $86 billion annually to GDP by 2030.' The report shows that clean energy manufacturing is creating generational opportunities for local communities, providing jobs with wages well above the national average. The industry's investments are critical to international competitiveness and innovation, positioning the US as a global leader and strengthening energy security. The report calls on policymakers to build on this historic American manufacturing legacy with a suite of targeted policy tools to continue the momentum. These tools include preserving energy tax credits, creating a stable trade environment, and streamlining permitting to benefit American manufacturers and their customers. Employment from existing and planned facilities by 2030 by region is projected to be: Northeast: 4,300+, Mid-Atlantic: 123,000+, South: 172,000+, Midwest: 86,000+, West: 173,000+.

**Trump's Plan to Restore US Manufacturing**
US President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claim that high tariffs can restore US manufacturing, creating enough jobs to employ all federal workers being laid off by Elon Musk. However, according to Investopedia, the US would need 22 million additional workers to reach 1970s manufacturing levels, with 7.2 million unemployed Americans in April 2025. This would require Trump to find 14.8 million additional workers, or 11.8 million if he fires all federal workers. The article suggests that the only way to achieve this is through mass immigration, which Trump's base opposes. The article implies that the true motivation behind Trump's plan is to benefit the oligarchy with a massive tax cut, and that the tariffs are a ruse to maintain a 'kayfabe' of job creation.

**ADMR Ortes: Maintaining Good Working Conditions Amidst Funding Challenges**
The ADMR Ortes association in Orthez has prioritized good working conditions for its employees since its creation in 2021. The president explains, 'We want to use our employees as little as possible, which requires a lot of work, so we have hired an additional person for administrative tasks.' This approach has allowed the association to avoid recruitment crises. As Audrey Kaszubowski notes, 'We received 211 CVs in 2024, and in 2025 we have 4 full-time employees, compared to 2 last year. This allows us to anticipate events. For example, we know that there is always an increase in activity in the second semester, so we recruit and train people beforehand, to be ready when the need arises.' However, the association is facing a decrease in funding, with the local council being their main financier, covering 81% of their resources. Christian Wils adds, 'Today, they ask us to be precise to the minute. Overtime is no longer funded, and it's the association that has to compensate.' The association has a slight surplus for 2024, which will allow them to cover some increased expenses, but this may not be enough in the long term. For 2025, the association will continue their projects, including the development of their animation pole and their Alzheimer pole, and will deploy a new training program for their employees. The association is also planning to move to a new location, which will provide them with more space and a rest room for their employees.

**ADP Reports Weakest Job Growth Since July 2024, Wage Growth Re-Accelerates**
The ADP report showed that the US economy added only 62,000 jobs in April, the lowest since July 2024. Education and health services, information, and professional and business services lost jobs, while other sectors saw moderate hiring. According to ADP, employers are trying to reconcile policy and consumer uncertainty with positive economic data, making hiring decisions difficult. Pay for job-stayers rose 4.5% in April, while year-over-year pay gains for job-changers accelerated to 6.9%, the highest since December 2024. The report raises questions about whether the weak jobs print will prompt the Fed to re-evaluate their policies or if the wage re-acceleration will keep them at bay.

**Is Trump's Plan Working? ADP Shows Biggest Jump In US Manufacturing Jobs Since Oct 2022**
According to the ADP Employment report, the US economy added 155k jobs in March, exceeding the expected 120k and almost doubling the 77k added in February. This is the biggest jump in US manufacturing jobs since October 2022. Nela Richardson, Chief Economist at ADP, stated, 'Despite policy uncertainty and downbeat consumers, the bottom line is this: The March topline number was a good one for the economy and employers of all sizes, if not necessarily all sectors.' The report also showed a rebound in service industry jobs and a slowdown in wage growth, which may indicate that Trump's economic plan is working.

**ADP: US Private Sector Adds Only 77,000 Jobs in February, Below Expectations**
According to the ADP report, in February, private companies in the US added only 77,000 jobs, far below the expected 148,000 jobs. This is the smallest increase in jobs since July last year. The leisure and hotel industry added 41,000 jobs, leading the growth in February. Professional and business services added 27,000 jobs, while financial activities and construction added 26,000 jobs each. Manufacturing and other services added 18,000 and 17,000 jobs respectively. On the other hand, the trade, transportation, and public utilities sector lost 33,000 jobs, while education and healthcare services lost 28,000 jobs, and information services lost 14,000 jobs. The natural resources and mining industry lost 2,000 jobs. ADP's chief economist Nela Richardson said, 'The uncertainty of policies and the slowdown in consumer spending may have led to the slowdown in hiring or layoffs last month. Our data, combined with other recent indicators, suggest that employers are hesitant to hire in light of the uncertain economic environment.' The weak job growth data from ADP is the latest in a series of economic data that has raised concerns about the slowdown in the US economy, and the uncertainty of President Trump's new tariff plan has added to the uncertainty about the US economic outlook. ADP's data is released before the US Labor Department's non-farm employment report, which is scheduled to be released on Friday morning. While the two reports sometimes have large differences in their statistics, ADP's report is a precursor to the government report. Economists expect the government data to show an increase of 160,000 jobs in February, higher than the 143,000 jobs reported in January.

The private sector added 183,000 jobs in January, exceeding economists' expectations of 150,000 jobs. According to ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, 'We had a strong start to 2025, but it masked a dichotomy in the labor market.'

**ADP Report Shows Solid Job Gains But Hiring Still Weak in Manufacturing**
According to the ADP report, U.S. businesses added 183,000 jobs in January, exceeding expectations. However, hiring in manufacturing remains weak, with a loss of 13,000 jobs.
