**Republican Tax Plan Increases Deductions, Eliminates Some Taxes, and Extends Trump's Cuts**
The Republicans in the House of Representatives unveiled a tax plan that increases the deduction of state and local taxes, eliminates some taxes on tips and overtime pay, and extends the tax cuts proposed by US President Donald Trump, partially paid for by reducing incentives for electric cars and clean energy production. The plan, released by the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday, details how Republicans are trying to fulfill Trump's campaign promises and shows where they want to increase taxes to cover part of the cost. The plan is the starting point for two weeks of negotiations. The panel will meet on Tuesday to analyze the tax measure, which is expected to pass easily and be included in Trump's 'big and beautiful bill'. The broader part, which Republicans can approve without Democratic votes through a process called budget reconciliation, will also include spending cuts and new funding for border security and national defense. The idea is that the president will sign the bill by July 4. However, things may get complicated with the narrow margin of the Republican Party, which allows them to lose only a few votes from their own members in the House plenary. Moderates are concerned about the practical and political impact of planned Medicaid and healthcare spending cuts, while extending tax cuts for high-income individuals and corporations. Hardline conservatives do not want the tax cuts to be much larger than the spending cuts, limiting this difference to $2.5 trillion over a decade. Trump's party has set a goal of new revenue sources, including university and foundation funding, foreign remittances, and tax credits for electric vehicles and renewable energy.

**Trump Rallies GOP To Back 'Big, Beautiful Bill' As House Releases 389-Page Text**
President Donald Trump has called on congressional Republicans to unify behind his 'ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL', a sweeping legislative package that merges tax cuts, immigration reforms, and domestic priorities into a single reconciliation measure. The bill includes a 5% remittance tax on international money transfers, a rollback of Biden-era environmental policy, and a new federal income tax deduction for qualified tips and overtime compensation. However, the bill also extends provisions from the 2017 Trump tax law, including the higher estate and gift tax exemptions and the limitation on the deduction of state and local taxes (SALT). Democrats have criticized the bill, with Representative Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) calling the proposal 'catastrophic'. The bill is expected to be marked up by three powerful House panels this week, with a floor vote possible next week.

**Anti-Abortion Provision in Budget Bill Could Spark 'Rebellion' Among Cowardly Moderate House Republicans: Report**
A provision in President Donald Trump's reconciliation bill to defund large abortion providers has sparked warnings of a 'rebellion' among moderate House Republicans, who fear alienating voters in swing districts. According to a Fox News report, Rep. Mike Lawler of New York warned colleagues that defunding abortion providers would be 'running into a hornet's nest.' Lawler and other moderates, such as Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Jen Kiggans of Virginia, are hesitant to take a strong stance on the issue, prioritizing their seats over their supposed convictions. House Speaker Mike Johnson must hold the line and rally the party to pass the provision, which aligns with Trump's broader cost-saving priorities. The stakes are high, and the GOP's legacy on life hangs in the balance. If the party fails to pass this measure, it will confirm that their pro-life stance is a hollow promise.

**House field hearing will tackle barriers to geothermal energy**
A House Natural Resources subcommittee will hold a field hearing in Utah to discuss strategies for removing barriers to geothermal energy development on federal lands. The hearing follows the full committee's passage of a reconciliation budget bill that includes a section addressing increased geothermal lease sales. According to the Bureau of Land Management, 14 geothermal power projects have been approved, which would have the capacity to power about 700,000 homes. The BLM has also held a large lease sale in Utah, generating $5.7 million in bids, and plans to hold additional geothermal lease sales in Idaho, California, Oregon, Washington, and Nevada this year. The agency has also approved the Newcastle Geothermal Development project in Cedar City, Utah. 'The Bureau of Land Management during the Biden administration approved 14 geothermal power projects that would have the capacity to power about 700,000 homes,' said the article. 'BLM in the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term has similarly advanced geothermal,' it added. The BLM's efforts to promote geothermal energy development are a positive step towards a more sustainable future.

**Holland & Knight Defense Situation Report: April 2025**
The US Congress is working on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), with the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) and Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) expected to mark up the bill in late spring or early summer. The FY 2026 NDAA will include provisions for defense spending, including a topline funding request of $1.01 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD). The DOD request is for $892.6 billion plus $119.3 billion, which would be added to the overall FY 2026 funding should congressional Republicans pass a reconciliation bill. The HASC has released a reconciliation bill with 11 primary funding objectives, including improving capacity across the maritime industrial base and integrated air and missile defense. The bill was approved by a bipartisan vote of 35-21. The DOD has also announced several initiatives, including the Software Fast Track (SWFT) Initiative, which aims to reform the way the DOD acquires, tests, and authorizes secure software. Additionally, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Army to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy, including streamlining force structure, eliminating wasteful spending, and reforming the acquisition process. President Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at acquisition reform, including 'Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base,' which directs the defense secretary to provide a plan for accomplishing this goal by giving a 'first preference' for acquisition of commercial solutions and a 'general preference' for use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA).

**Congress passes budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 14) April 10 &#x2013; The House of Representatives passes the altered budget resolution, 216-214. No taxes on tips or overtime.**
On April 10, the House of Representatives passed H. Con. Res. 14, a budget resolution blueprint, with a vote of 216-214. This resolution sets spending and revenue targets for the federal budget, but does not have the force of law. It is an important step towards passing a budget reconciliation bill, which can focus on budget-related measures and only requires a simple majority to pass the Senate. According to the process, the House will be able to continue working on a budget reconciliation bill. 'No taxes on tips or overtime' was included in the altered budget resolution.

The Trump administration has defended the FDA in a lawsuit brought by Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri over the approval of mifepristone, an abortion medication. The administration has filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiff states lack standing. Meanwhile, Republicans are advancing reconciliation debate in the House, with a focus on Medicaid policies, including work requirements for able-bodied adults and restrictions on state coverage of undocumented immigrants. The Energy and Commerce Committee is set to hold a markup on May 13, 2025, and Democrats are expected to offer amendments to try to undermine the legislation. The Congressional Budget Office has released estimates of Medicaid coverage losses for five proposed policies, ranging from 2.3 million to 8.6 million people. President Trump has signed two healthcare-related executive orders, one on regulatory relief for domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and another on gain-of-function research. The administration is also expected to pursue 'most favored nation' pricing for prescription drugs in the Medicare program. HHS Secretary Kennedy will testify on Capitol Hill on May 14, 2025, on the FY 2026 skinny budget proposal. Democrats will likely question Kennedy on his response to the measles outbreak and HHS restructuring and reductions in force.

**Trump wants to slash discretionary spending, but reconciliation bill on tap first**
The White House has released its 2026 'skinny budget' proposal, which aims to increase defense spending by 13% and cut non-defense discretionary spending by 23%. However, Congress is currently working on the reconciliation package, which includes tax cuts, debt ceiling increase, and mandatory spending cuts. Cato Institute budget expert Romina Boccia said it's 'curious timing' for the White House to release the budget proposal now, as Congress is already discussing the reconciliation bill. Boccia also criticized the reconciliation package for not offsetting deficit increases with enough spending cuts, which could lead to a $5 trillion or more deficit increase over the next 10 years. The fiscal 2026 budget will be harder to pass, requiring some Democratic support to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Boccia applauded the Trump administration for the cuts proposed in the 2026 skinny budget, saying they are 'long overdue' and would reduce spending on federal programs that should not be within the purview of the federal government.

**White House unveils reconciliation-augmented fiscal 2026 budget - Roll Call**
President Donald Trump's proposed fiscal 2026 budget includes steep cuts to domestic and foreign aid spending, while increasing defense and border security spending. Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker expressed concerns that the flat discretionary defense budget would be a cut when factoring in inflation. Wicker stated, 'The Big, Beautiful Reconciliation Bill was always meant to change fundamentally the direction of the Pentagon on programs like Golden Dome, border support, and unmanned capabilities — not to paper over [the Office of Management and Budget]’s intent to shred to the bone our military capabilities and our support to service members.' Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins shared similar criticism, stating she had 'serious objections' to both the flat discretionary defense spending and proposed cuts to biomedical research, low-income heating subsidies and Education Department services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. The $119 billion boost to defense is entirely offset by equal cuts to nondefense programs in fiscal 2026, amounting to a nearly 17 percent reduction on average. Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray said Trump's budget would 'eviscerate programs that matter most to working families.' The Transportation and Veterans Affairs departments are poised for increases under the proposal, while the State Department's actual funding level would dip to $31.2 billion, from the $59.6 billion current level. Cuts to other Cabinet departments range from 8 percent for the Justice Department to 35 percent for Labor, and the proposal would also decimate some smaller agencies like the EPA, which is facing a nearly 55 percent cut.

**Trump Urges Patience as Congress Works on His Agenda**
President Donald Trump is urging Americans to be patient as he works to implement his agenda and as Republicans on Capitol Hill move forward with a reconciliation package. Trump stated on Truth Social that the current stock market is 'Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,' but that tariffs will soon start kicking in and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Trump pointed out a significant increase in domestic investment during the first quarter of 2025, stating that 'this is the highest in four years and comes as businesses and consumers -- bolstered by rising take-home pay -- fuel an economic boom.' House Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to reassure anxious Trump supporters that Congress is on track to pass a reconciliation bill as soon as possible to meet deadlines on expiring Trump tax cuts before the end of the year.

**Holland & Knight Health Dose: April 29, 2025**
The U.S. Congress is aiming to pass a reconciliation bill by Memorial Day 2025, with a focus on budget savings and funding recissions. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to mark up its section of the package, which includes $880 billion in savings. President Donald Trump is also expected to share a list of up to $9 billion in 'recissions,' federal funding the Trump Administration would like to pull back on spending. Several committees will hold hearings and markups on provisions that may be included in the reconciliation bill. The Trump Administration has continued to release executive orders, including one that extends the federal hiring freeze through July 15, 2025. The administration also announced a potential pathway to restore accountability to policy-influencing positions within the federal workforce. The House Ways and Means Committee issued a request for information on the tax status of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs). The Senate HELP Committee released a report titled, 'Congress Must Act to Bring Needed Reforms to the 340B Drug Pricing Program.' The report makes five recommendations for Congress to consider as it looks to potentially reform the program. The Health Tech Investment Act was introduced to establish a payment pathway for AI-enabled medical devices. The CMS issued the proposed fiscal year (FY) 2026 Medicare Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) and Long-Term Acute Care Hospital (LTCH) Rule. The MACPAC and MedPAC April Meetings highlighted the importance of Medicaid coverage for maternity care services and long-term services and supports (LTSS). The report finds that China leads in biotechnology advances, and the U.S. is at risk of losing its competitive edge. The Department of Commerce initiated a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas vacated part of CMS' rule to require a minimum nurse staffing for nursing homes. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc., which may have implications for access to no-cost preventive services under the Affordable Care Act.

**Trump and Johnson strategize ahead of budget reconciliation talks at the Capitol**
House Speaker Mike Johnson met with President Donald Trump to discuss the GOP's strategy for budget reconciliation talks. Republicans aim to cut at least $2 trillion from federal spending over the next decade to align with the president's domestic agenda. Johnson expressed optimism about the upcoming legislative process, saying, 'We're working on the big, beautiful bill, the reconciliation bill.' He also predicted that the bill would 'solve a lot of problems' and 'be a turbo-boost for the economy.' Despite recent polling showing the public souring on Trump's job performance, Johnson remains confident that the GOP will defend its narrow majority, citing a 'lopsided map' that favors Republicans in the midterm elections.

**House GOP packs May schedule with megabill vote on the horizon - Washington Examiner**
House Republicans have a packed schedule for May, with 16 session days and several key votes on the horizon. The GOP aims to pass a reconciliation bill, which would renew Trump's 2017 tax law and prioritize energy, defense, and border issues. The bill, dubbed the 'Renewing the American Dream Act,' would also include symbolic votes on renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and granting current and former presidents more legal flexibility when prosecuted. Republicans are also planning to vote on a $9.3 billion rescissions package, which would claw back funds from the Public Broadcasting Service and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Additionally, lawmakers will consider a bill to increase defense spending by $150 billion, matching the Senate's goal. However, the decision may face pushback from fiscal hawks, who demand offsets for new spending. Trump has urged Republicans to pass his 'one big beautiful bill' as quickly as possible, citing the need for predictability for the business community and the impact of market turmoil from his tariffs.

**Trump's**
US President Donald Trump's proposed 'big, beautiful bill' may worsen the nation's debt and deficit, experts have warned. The bill, which includes expanded military spending, major tax cuts, and new energy policies, could add to already record-high deficits and the ballooning national debt. According to Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, 'It clearly will make the debt/deficit worse than the baseline.' Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a non-resident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that the deficit will grow and the debt/GDP ratio will continue to rise. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, stated that the budget's reconciliation instructions would allow for legislation to add 5.8 trillion dollars to deficits through Fiscal Year 2034. The US budget deficit for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 reached a record 1.3 trillion dollars, the second-highest six-month level on record.

The Senate Finance Committee has held a hearing on the nomination of Mehmet Oz, MD, as CMS administrator, where he agreed to address upcoding in Medicare Advantage. President Trump has also issued an executive order (EO) on domestic preparedness, which seeks to expand the role of states and localities in preparedness and may have implications for drug supply chains and pandemic response.

President Donald Trump has promised House Republicans that they will secure the U.S. border through a reconciliation package, which will include full funding for border security personnel and retention bonuses for ICE and border patrol. Trump also vowed to work with Congress on the 'largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history', which will extend tax cuts set to expire in 2025. Trump stated that it doesn't matter whether the legislative branch pushes one or two bills, saying 'We don't want to get hung up on the budget process … whether it’s one bill, two bills, I don’t care.' National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott said, 'I think for us, results are more important than process,' and that they will produce results for the people, regardless of the process.

**Senate passes immigrant detention bill that could be the first measure Trump signs into law**
The Senate has passed a bill, the Laken Riley Act, which would require federal authorities to detain migrants accused of theft and violent crimes. The bill, which is likely to be the first measure signed into law by President Donald Trump, aims to crack down on illegal immigration and deport millions of migrants. Trump has made a broad crackdown on illegal immigration his top priority, and the bill's passage is a sign of how Congress has shifted sharply right on border security and immigration. Critics of the bill, including Sen. Patty Murray, argue that it will cause chaos, punish legal immigrants, and undermine due process in America. The bill would require $100 billion in funding, which Republicans are debating how to approve through budget reconciliation. Democrats on the Appropriations Committee estimate the bill would cost $83 billion over the next three years.
