**Russia's Conditions for a Ceasefire in Ukraine**
The Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Istanbul for the second time to discuss peace talks. They agreed on a prisoner exchange, but the details of the memorandum presented by Russia are still unclear. Russia wants Ukraine to recognize the annexation of Crimea, and for Ukrainian troops to withdraw from Luhansk, Donetks, Zaporijya, and Herson. Russia also wants Ukraine to be recognized as a non-nuclear state and for nuclear weapons to be banned on Ukrainian territory. The West is expected to stop providing military aid to Ukraine for a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenski said that Ukraine is ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but that the process should start with a ceasefire and humanitarian measures. He also called for sanctions against Russia if no concrete results are achieved. The Ukrainian delegation said that they were unable to respond to Russia's proposals in Istanbul, but that they will make a decision after reviewing the memorandum. The next meeting is expected to be at the leader level. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rüstem Umerov said that a new prisoner exchange will focus on wounded young people and that Russia and Ukraine will exchange all wounded and under-25 prisoners. He also said that the remains of 6,000 soldiers killed in the war will be exchanged. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mihail Galuzin said that the idea of a unconditional ceasefire was rejected by the Russian delegation. Russian Presidential Adviser Vladimir Medinskiy said that Russia offered Ukraine a ceasefire in certain areas and that a large-scale prisoner exchange was agreed upon, with all wounded and heavy wounded soldiers to be exchanged. He also said that Ukraine will receive 6,000 frozen soldier bodies next week.

**Russian and Ukrainian Officials Meet in Istanbul for New Talks on Conflict**
Russian and Ukrainian officials are set to meet in Istanbul on Monday for new direct talks on the conflict sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The two sides will present their 'vision' for a resolution to the conflict, a prospect that seems distant. Here are their official positions before this meeting, mediated by Turkey. Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained maximalist demands since the invasion began. He insists that the resolution process must address the 'deep-seated' causes of the conflict, primarily Ukraine's desire to join NATO, which Moscow considers an existential threat to its borders. Russia claims the annexation of four regions in southern and eastern Ukraine (Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia) and the Crimean Peninsula, annexed in 2014. Putin has justified the February 2022 offensive as a means to 'protect' Russian-speaking populations in eastern Ukraine and 'denazify' a country he accuses of being under the control of hostile Western powers. Moscow demands an end to Western arms deliveries and the removal of Ukrainian ultranationalist groups. Putin has also suggested a 'transitional administration' for Ukraine under the auspices of the UN, which would involve the departure of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky is not considered legitimate by Putin, who argues that his five-year term expired in May 2024, despite the impossibility of holding elections due to the war. In Ukraine, the question of territorial concessions is highly divisive, with the population having made enormous human sacrifices and suffered significant material destruction since 2014 to preserve its established borders. Zelensky has suggested possible 'exchanges' of territories with Moscow regarding areas held by Kyiv in the Russian region of Kursk, but Ukrainian forces were eventually pushed out by Russia in late April. The question remains as to what concessions might be possible between Kyiv and Moscow, as Ukraine continues to demand the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian troops from its territory. This includes the contentious issue of Crimea. Zelensky publicly supports the idea that Kyiv will not give up this Ukrainian-majority Russian-speaking peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014, as it is explicitly stated in the Ukrainian Constitution that it is part of Ukraine's territory. More broadly, Zelensky calls on his allies to provide 'security guarantees' to Ukraine to deter Russia from invading again after a peace agreement is reached. In this context, Kyiv's main request is to join NATO, a possibility categorically rejected by Moscow and also excluded by US President Donald Trump. As an alternative, Ukraine has discussed with Europeans the creation of a Western military contingent that could be deployed in the country, with the support of NATO, in the event of a peace agreement. This option is also firmly rejected by Moscow. To initiate a diplomatic process to resolve the conflict, Kyiv has been calling for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire for several weeks, as requested by the Trump administration and Europeans. Putin has consistently rejected Kyiv's and its allies' demands for a ceasefire, believing that it would allow Ukrainian forces, struggling on the front, to rearm with Western support.

**Vlad stooge threatens UK with ‘ice war’ as Russia & Kyiv talks end after 1 HOUR**
A second round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine ended after just one hour, with no breakthrough in sight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Putin must not be rewarded for his invasion, adding, 'The key to lasting peace is clear, the aggressor must not receive any reward for war. 'Putin must get nothing that would justify his aggression.' Russia rejected an unconditional ceasefire, and Ukraine handed Russia a list of children it wants returned. The talks were presided over by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who said US support for the talks is 'extremely important'. The two sides remain far apart, with Russia demanding that Ukraine pull its forces out of occupied territories and Ukraine refusing to recognize Russian ownership of these territories. Zelensky said Ukraine is ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but Russia must show flexibility. Meanwhile, NATO's General Carsten Breuer warned that Russia is producing weaponry at a rapid pace and that NATO must be ready for war in the next four years.

**Russia and Ukraine to Meet Again for Peace Talks, but Optimism is Low**
Russia and Ukraine are set to meet again for peace talks, but neither side is giving reasons for optimism. Since their last meeting, Russia has launched four of its five largest drone attacks against Ukraine, killed over 340 civilians, and continued to spread its false narrative about the unprovoked war it has been waging for over a decade. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the next round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will take place in Turkey on Monday. However, Kyiv has expressed skepticism about the talks, with President Volodymyr Zelensky calling the lack of a Russian plan for a ceasefire 'another Russian disappointment.' Zelensky also accused Moscow of not wanting to end the war. 'For a meeting to be significant, its agenda must be clear and the negotiations must be well-prepared,' Zelensky wrote on X. The Ukrainian leader also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday to discuss a possible second round of peace talks. Despite the talks, it is unlikely that the summit will produce immediate results. Russian officials have made it clear that Moscow is maintaining its demands, including the elimination of 'the root causes' of the conflict, which include historical grievances such as Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and NATO's expansion to the east since the end of the Cold War. Kyiv has rejected these demands, saying that accepting them would be equivalent to surrender. The talks may be designed primarily to please Trump, who has warned both Ukraine and Russia that there will be consequences if they do not participate in his peace process.

**Ukraine to Send Delegation to Negotiate with Russia**
Ukraine will send a delegation to negotiate with Russia. Ukrainian President Zelensky said that Ukraine's priorities are to obtain 'a complete and unconditional ceasefire', according to AFP. He also mentioned that the 'return of prisoners' and 'Ukrainian children who Kyiv accuses Moscow of kidnapping' are priorities. Zelensky added, 'We are doing everything to protect our independence, our state and our people.' Ukraine had asked Russia to present a memorandum with its position on the end of the war, which has been ongoing for over three years, before the meeting. Russia responded that it will share the memorandum during the talks in Istanbul. The Russian and Ukrainian delegations have already held talks in Istanbul on May 16, with the goal of ending the war sparked by Russia's invasion in February 2022. However, the meeting was not very fruitful, with the two countries only agreeing on a limited exchange of prisoners. Russia proposed a new meeting in Istanbul on Monday, but Ukraine left its participation uncertain until today. Despite diplomatic efforts, Ukraine and Russia have opposing positions. In particular, Russia demands that Ukraine definitively renounce its membership in NATO and hand over the five regions it claims to have annexed. After annexing Crimea in 2014, Moscow declared in September 2022 that the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia were part of the Russian Federation. Ukraine's conditions are unacceptable to Kyiv, which, in turn, demands the definitive withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. Russia also refuses the unconditional ceasefire demanded by Ukraine, the United States, and European allies of Kyiv. Zelensky also referred to the preparatory nature of the meeting, arguing that 'the main questions' of the conflict can only be resolved 'between leaders', in a new appeal for a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Ukrainian leader had previously proposed a meeting with Putin, but the Russian president did not follow up.

**Ukraine Refuses to Commit to Peace Talks with Russia**
Ukraine has refused to commit to attending peace talks with Russia on June 2, citing a lack of information on Moscow's proposals. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that for the talks to be meaningful, the agenda must be clear and the negotiations must be well-prepared. He expressed regret that Russia has not provided the necessary documents, saying that 'it's unfortunate that Russia is doing everything to ensure that the next meeting has no results.' Zelensky also spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the possibility of a four-way meeting between Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the US. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has urged Moscow and Kiev to cooperate to achieve a deal and end the war, which has been ongoing for over three years. Russia has proposed holding the second round of face-to-face talks with Ukrainian officials in Istanbul on June 2. However, Ukraine has not committed to attending, and the US has warned that Russia will be 'severely damaged' by new sanctions. The US Senate is expected to continue pushing for a bill to impose new sanctions on Russia. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is set to meet with Trump at the White House on June 5 to discuss the conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as the strained trade relationship between the two countries. Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned that recognizing Crimea as Russian territory would be a 'historic mistake.' He said that the US failed to take sufficient action to prevent Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, and that the US should not give up on the issue now.

**Ukraine Hesitates on Attending Russia's Meeting in Istanbul**
Ukraine has not confirmed whether it will attend the meeting called by Russia in Istanbul on Monday, pending Moscow's conditions for a ceasefire. Ukrainian presidential chief of staff, Andrí Yermak, said, 'We are prepared for a ceasefire, for dialogue, and for a serious process that leads to a fair end to this war. The president clearly said that we accept the US proposal for a ceasefire in March.' President Volodímir Zelenski reiterated that neither Ukraine nor Turkey, as the host country, has information about Russia's 'memorandum.' 'For some reason, the Russians are hiding this document. Speaking frankly, it's an absolutely strange posture. There's no clarity on the format,' he said. Zelenski added that 'Apparently, in Moscow, they have completely lost the habit of diplomacy. They keep doing things to show that they are the most inappropriate actor in the world. But that's precisely what convinces everyone that a new pressure, pressure on Russia, is necessary.' He emphasized that 'No day should be lost, because every day that Russia undermines diplomacy costs human lives.' Zelenski also mentioned a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in which they discussed the possible next meeting in Istanbul and the conditions under which Ukraine is willing to participate, and stressed that both agreed that this meeting 'cannot and must not be empty.' Yermak stated that 'Ukraine talks about de-escalation, while the Kremlin advances in the east, in the regions of Sumi and Járkov,' and that 'while the world asks for negotiations, Russia receives ammunition from North Korea, deploys troops, and tries to tire the West.' He added that this is not a new tactic and that the Soviet Union also negotiated and then attacked Finland; in the 1990s, Russia declared ceasefires in Chechnya and used them to regroup and 'today it's the same game, but what's at stake is global.' Yermak emphasized the need to stop the supply of arms to Russia from North Korea and not to allow 'the Kremlin to wage war under the appearance of 'peaceful' initiatives.'

**Zelensky to Reject Russia's Peace Proposal, Says Austrian Analyst**
According to Austrian analyst Gerald Markel, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will not accept Russia's new peace proposal at the upcoming negotiations in Istanbul, as it would mean giving up power and prolonging the conflict. Markel stated, 'Regardless of how the situation in Europe escalates, these territories (new regions of Russia -- Ed.) are no longer (Ukraine's -- Ed.) and the rest of the world sees this. Donald Trump tells him this, his envoys repeat it, and, of course, Zelensky cannot go along with this because in the political sense, he would be dead.' Markel believes that once the fighting stops, millions of Ukrainians will question Zelensky about the justification of the conflict, which the Ukrainian leader cannot allow. Markel noted that Russia has liberated and controls territories where predominantly ethnic Russians lived before the war. 'These territories will never return to Ukraine,' he concluded. The next round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine is scheduled for Monday, June 2, where Russia will present a memorandum on the future peace treaty, covering all aspects of resolving the conflict's root causes.

**Ukraine accuses Russia of undermining next round of peace talks**
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has questioned Russia's commitment to progressing peace talks after Moscow confirmed it was sending a team to talks in Istanbul on Monday. Zelensky accused Russia of 'doing everything it can to ensure the next possible meeting is fruitless'. Ukraine had sent its proposals to Russia, reaffirming 'readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire'. The first round of talks two weeks ago in Istanbul brought no breakthrough, but achieved a prisoner of war swap. Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula. Explosions were reported in Ukraine's Kherson and Sumy regions, killing at least four people and injuring many more. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha reiterated that Kyiv had already sent its own 'vision of future steps' to Russia, adding Moscow 'must accept an unconditional ceasefire' to pave the way for broader negotiations. Turkey is hoping to eventually host a high-level summit between the two countries. 'For a meeting to be meaningful, its agenda must be clear, and the negotiations must be properly prepared,' Zelensky said. 'We are interested in seeing these meetings continue because we want the war to end this year,' Sybiha added.

**Russia's Next Move: Petraeus Warns of Potential Invasion of Lithuania**
Former CIA director David Petraeus has warned that if Russia succeeds in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is likely to invade a NATO country, with Lithuania being the most at risk. Petraeus, a former US general, stated, 'If he succeeds in Ukraine, Putin is ready to invade a NATO country. Lithuania is the most at risk.' He also criticized US President Donald Trump for repeatedly giving Putin second chances and attacked his predecessor Joe Biden for not adequately arming Ukrainian forces. Petraeus said, 'We have seen three episodes where the US President has threatened to take a different approach in two weeks. This time, we will see what really happens. We should have done more for the Ukrainians so they could change the dynamics on the battlefield and show Moscow that they cannot gain further advantages at an acceptable cost.' He believes Russia's goal is to overthrow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and install a puppet leader, and then focus on a Baltic country, such as Lithuania, which has often been mentioned in Putin's speeches.

**Majority of Americans Disapprove of Trump's Approach to Ending Russia-Ukraine War**
A majority of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump's approach to ending the Russia-Ukraine war. According to a survey conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, published on April 25, 56% of respondents disapprove of Trump's approach, including 42% who strongly disapprove. 35% expressed support for Trump's actions, with 20% 'strongly approving' and 15% 'somewhat approving'. 9% said they couldn't answer the question. Among Republicans, 74% support Trump, while 90% of Democrats strongly disapprove of his actions. Trump has accused Ukraine of 'provoking' a full-scale war because it wants to join NATO, as reported by Time. Time notes that Trump is likely to be remembered for violating decades of foreign policy, which has been followed by both Republican and Democratic presidents. Trump has distanced himself from NATO allies and sided with Russia in the war against Ukraine, Time writes. He also stated that Crimea will remain under Russian control and that he is the 'only one' who can negotiate with Putin to end the war. Trump previously accused his predecessor Joe Biden of provoking a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine by saying that Ukraine should have the opportunity to join NATO. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff stated that Ukraine cannot join NATO 'due to Russia's and the US's positions', but leaves open the question of providing it with guarantees under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty on collective defense. In contrast, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted that Ukraine's path to NATO is irreversible, as stated at the end of the Washington Summit in July 2024.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on EU leaders to support a truce between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the air and at sea, saying it would test Russia's will to end the three-year invasion. Zelensky stated, 'Everyone needs to make sure that Russia, as the sole source of this war, accepts the need to end it.' He proposed a truce in two areas: no attacks on energy and civilian infrastructure, and no military operations in the Black Sea. Zelensky emphasized that any truce would be a first step towards a comprehensive agreement on ending the war and providing security guarantees to Ukraine. He also stressed the importance of including Ukraine in any talks on its security, saying, 'Anything that affects the security of Europe should be resolved with the participation of Europe.' Zelensky expressed hope that a meeting with American officials next week would be 'meaningful'.

**Ukraine Prepares for Next War as Ceasefire Talks Continue**
As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, Vladislav Chumachenko, a 39-year-old medical assistant on the front lines, is already preparing for the next war. He believes that if the negotiations between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin lead to a ceasefire, the conditions would be unacceptable for Ukraine, especially if Ukraine is forced to cede territory to Russia. 'For us, it's obvious that we won't be satisfied with any result of these negotiations,' Vladislav said to AFP. 'The only thing we can do is continue our work and prepare for the next stage of the conflict.' His wife, Anastasia Chumachenko, who runs the non-profit organization Medicina Táctica Norte with him, agrees that Russia will not stop trying to attack Ukraine. 'They will try to attack again, we have to be prepared,' she said. Vladislav and Anastasia have recommended that their volunteers stay vigilant in case of a ceasefire. After three years of brutal war, two of their volunteers decided to leave, exhausted, but the others are preparing for 'the next phase of the conflict,' according to Vladislav. The couple has also provided medical training to soldiers, which will continue even if hostilities cease, Vladislav said. 'History teaches us that in our part of the world, no pause is permanent,' he explained. Some Ukrainian soldiers want to return to civilian life, but others do not want to go back home to 'harvest potatoes.' Oleksandr, a commander of an assault unit in the 93rd brigade, is one of those who will stay in uniform, no matter what. 'I'll be here in my element,' he said, referring to his life as a soldier on the front lines. Oleksandr believes that it would be a grave mistake for Ukraine to cede territory, and he will stay in the east of Ukraine to be 'ready' in case of another conflict. 'We were fooled once, but we won't let it happen again,' he said, referring to the eight years that passed between the conflict launched in 2014 by pro-Russian separatists and the Russian invasion in 2022.

**US May Abandon International Efforts to Prosecute Russia for Ukraine Invasion**
The US may abandon international efforts to prosecute Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, according to The Telegraph. US officials have refused to call Russia 'the aggressor' at a meeting of the 'core group' of countries preparing a Nuremberg-style tribunal to try Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes. The US has also refused to co-sign a UN statement supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity and demanding that Russia withdraw its troops from the war-torn country. The Trump administration has also refused to sign a planned G7 statement marking the third anniversary of the full-scale war, which calls Russia 'the aggressor.' Trump has accused Ukraine of starting the war, called its president Volodymyr Zelensky a 'dictator,' and pushed for Russia's return to the G7. European officials fear that Trump's flattery of Putin may lead to the Russian leader avoiding punishment for his invasion in any future peace agreement. This position has raised doubts about the preparation for the final meeting of the 'core group' next month. The group is led by a coalition of 40 countries working to create a Special Tribunal to investigate crimes of aggression against Ukraine, modeled after responses to Nazi war crimes after World War II. 'If they don't recognize it as aggression, they can't participate,' said one official about the US objection to recognizing Russia as the aggressor. The loss of US support for the tribunal would be a significant blow to its international reputation and authority. 'This is a pretty fundamental change. Rewriting history and pretending that Russia didn't start this war is something we simply can't and won't agree to,' said a European diplomat in a comment to the publication. The US has not officially withdrawn from the scheme and is expected to participate in the next meeting in Strasbourg in March. A diplomatic note seen by the publication showed that European officials were 'shocked' by the Americans' statements on a series of international meetings that Russia should be invited back to the 'civilized world.' European capitals are now negotiating a possible collapse of the special tribunal if the US leaves. The latest US position marks a significant change in policy between Joe Biden and Trump. The former US leader called Putin a 'war criminal' and signed several international statements calling Russia a state-aggressor. Now, however, Washington is insisting that the almost three-year war be called the 'Ukrainian conflict' in discussions with international allies. For example, the State Department's report on the meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov describes the war as a 'conflict in Ukraine' twice. Trump has also stated that he sees no need for Zelensky's participation in negotiations to end the war.

**Trump Disapproves of Zelenskyy's Involvement in Ukraine-Russia Negotiations**
US President Donald Trump has expressed his disapproval of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's involvement in negotiations to end the Ukraine-Russia war. Trump stated in an interview with Fox News that he doesn't think it's 'very important' for Zelenskyy to participate in the talks, saying 'He's been there for three years, and he makes it very hard to come to agreements.' Trump also claimed that the Ukrainians have nothing to contribute to the negotiations and that he has had 'very good' conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but 'not so good' conversations with Ukraine. Trump had previously referred to Zelenskyy as a 'dictator without elections' and accused him of being responsible for the Russian invasion. The US government has been holding high-level talks with Moscow to end the war, excluding Kiev and other European allies. This move has sparked irritation and criticism from Ukraine and its supporters.

**Putin Accepts Negotiations with Ukraine, Amid Growing Rift with US**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to sit down for negotiations with Ukraine, a move he had previously rejected. Putin stated, 'The negotiation process will be carried out with the participation of both Russia and Ukraine. No one excludes Ukraine from this process,' according to Nexta. However, Ukrainian officials have disputed Putin's claims, with Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Defense Center, saying that a Russian sabotage group attempted to enter Ukrainian territory, but was destroyed. Ukrainian President Volodimyr Zelensky has also criticized US President Donald Trump for repeating Russian propaganda points, including that Ukraine initiated the war and that Zelensky has lost the support of Ukrainians. Zelensky stated, 'Unfortunately, he lives in this space of disinformation. I want there to be more truth in the Trump team.' The comments highlight a growing rift between Ukraine and the US, which has been Ukraine's main ally. Trump has expressed a desire to quickly resolve the war in Ukraine, which began when Putin ordered a large-scale invasion of the smaller neighbor three years ago. Trump has increasingly blamed Ukraine (and Zelensky personally) for the invasion, while discussing with Putin ways to end it.
