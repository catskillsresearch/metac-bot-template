**Putin Expert: War Will Not End with Peace Treaty or Ceasefire**
Sir Bill Browder, a Putin expert, believes that the war between Russia and Ukraine will not end with a peace treaty or ceasefire. He says that Vladimir Putin has not reduced his ambitions since the war started and is willing to sacrifice five million Russian lives to win the war. Browder, who lived in Russia for nine years, believes that the only way to stop Putin is to give Ukraine the tools and resources it needs to win the war. He thinks that Ukraine should have been given these resources from the start of the war in 2022. Browder also criticizes US presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden for not doing enough to stop the war. He believes that Putin went to war because he is a successful kleptocrat who has stolen billions of dollars from the Russian people. Browder says that Putin's main motivation for the war is not a grand vision of a Russian empire or hatred of NATO, but rather to distract from his own corruption and the fact that the Russian people are suffering. Thor Halvorssen from the Human Rights Foundation agrees with Browder and believes that Ukraine is a threat to Putin personally because it is home to millions of Russians. He also believes that a ceasefire or peace treaty is not realistic. Browder is clear on how the war will end: it will only end when one side wins. He believes that for Putin, the war is about survival, and if he loses, he will lose power and die. For the Ukrainian people, the war is also about survival, and if they accept Russian occupation, they will be killed, their children will be kidnapped, and their women will be raped.

**USA to impose harsh sanctions on Russia**
According to Senator Lindsey Graham, President Trump will decide within two weeks whether he has been misled. The US Senate is almost unanimous in its support for a new sanctions package against Russia, which would impose 500% tariffs on countries like China and India that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, thereby supporting the Russian war economy. Senator Graham and his Democratic colleague Richard Blumenthal recently visited Kiev and saw some of the destruction, and then traveled to France to meet with President Emmanuel Macron, who they say is '100% with them' on the war in Ukraine. Graham says that he learned during this trip that Vladimir Putin is preparing for more war, and that the sanctions package has been developed in consultation with Trump's advisors. Graham trusts Trump's diplomatic instincts, but believes that attempts to negotiate with Putin directly have made it 'painfully clear that he is not interested in ending this war.' Blumenthal says that Putin is 'playing with President Trump, taking him for a ride.' The two senators want to convey the message that the US risks being drawn deeper into a worse conflict in the future. 'Now it's up to Putin and the world, as Russia prepares for a new offensive,' says Blumenthal.

**Kara-Murza: 'Change Happens Suddenly in Russia, We Must Be Prepared'**
Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has spoken out about the importance of being prepared for sudden and unexpected changes in Russia. Kara-Murza, who has been imprisoned twice for his criticism of Putin, said, 'It is how change happens in Russia. It is how it will happen next time, political change. We don't know when and how, but we know it will happen.' He emphasized the need for the world to be prepared to act immediately when change occurs in Russia. Kara-Murza also spoke about his own experiences in prison, where he was subjected to isolation and psychological torture. He said, 'The worst was not being able to talk to my family. It's a Soviet tactic where not only the prisoner, but also their family, is punished.' Kara-Murza's wife, Jevgenija, also spoke about the importance of teaching children to stand up for what is right and to be brave. She said, 'We can teach our children to fight, to distinguish between right and wrong, and to recognize a bully. Otherwise, the world will never change.' The couple's story highlights the ongoing struggle for democracy and freedom in Russia.

**Klitschko Hopes for Peace in Ukraine by 2025**
Kiev's Mayor Vitali Klitschko expressed hope for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine by the end of 2025. 'We're keeping our fingers crossed and hoping' that a diplomatic solution will be found and the war will end, he said. Klitschko acknowledged that finding a solution will be a 'difficult task' and that the Ukrainian delegation is 'well-prepared' for the negotiations with Russia in Istanbul. However, he emphasized that the talks must continue and a solution must be found to move towards peace. The Ukraine has been fighting against a Russian invasion for over three years. Klitschko was awarded the Franz-Werfel-Menschenrechtspreis for his 'unwavering commitment to freedom and democracy'.

**The Russian novels fuelling a rise in young people fighting for Putin**
A new wave of ultra-nationalist fiction, dubbed 'Z literature', is sweeping through Russia, targeting teenagers and young men with a central message of fighting, dying, and serving. These action-packed novels, named after the 'Z' symbol used to promote the invasion of Ukraine, present a dystopian world where Russia stands alone, noble, and embattled. Heroes are portrayed as martyrs, laying down their lives for glory, brotherhood, and Vladimir Putin's vision of resurgent Russia. Experts warn that this genre is part of a larger system shaping a generation primed for conflict, not peace, and that the consequences could be far-reaching, making any future efforts to liberalise Russia all but impossible. Dr Colin Alexander said, 'What the state is trying to do to create a culture in which everyday life is militarised.' Dr Garner added, 'There is often a sense of brotherhood, that you can turn into a good citizen, a good patriot, a strong man, a man who can provide for his family, a man who defends the country and the community.' Jaroslava Barbieri said, 'Five years from now, these readers will be soldiers. The Kremlin isn't trying to appease aggression - it's cultivating it.'

**Kara-Murza: US Leadership Under Trump is 'Skammelig'**
Vladimir Kara-Murza, a well-known critic of the Russian regime, describes the behavior of US President Donald Trump and the US administration as 'skammelig' (shameful). He criticizes Trump's attempts to build a full-scale alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine. Kara-Murza states, 'I think the title of 'leader of the free world,' which the US has been known for for many years, is now vacant.' He emphasizes that under Trump's leadership, the US does not appear to be a leader of the free world, citing Trump's statements that Ukraine started the war and his desire to have Russia rejoin the G8. Kara-Murza also mentions the US decision to temporarily suspend the sharing of intelligence with Ukraine, which he believes had catastrophic consequences, including the deaths of hundreds of civilians. He argues that Europe should take a more significant role in the conflict and negotiate with Putin to end the war. Kara-Murza believes that the US, under the current administration, will not be able to take on this role, and that Europe should take responsibility and become the leader of the free world. He also mentions that the recent talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul led to a significant prisoner exchange, which he hopes will continue. Kara-Murza, who was a political prisoner in Russia for 25 years, emphasizes that there will be no peace in Ukraine or Europe as long as Putin is in power, and that a democratic Russia is necessary for peace.

**Putin's War Plans: Expert Predicts Russia's Ability to Wage War Against Ukraine for Another Two Years**
Russian President Putin will not agree to end the war against Ukraine because he believes that peace would be a shock to Russian society and economy, according to military expert Dmitry Snegirev. Snegirev stated, 'The latest reports from Western intelligence and the statement from NATO's European commander Christopher Cavoli indicate that Russia can maintain the ability to conduct active combat operations for another two years.' He also added that the war has become a factor in maintaining the Russian ruling regime. 'The war is a factor in maintaining the regime. And this regime is held only by the war. The empire has actually begun to disintegrate, and the only thing that is holding it back is the presence of an external factor in the form of war,' Snegirev said. Experts have previously reported that the Kremlin is not planning to engage in peace talks and is instead planning to continue occupying Ukraine. According to experts, the Kremlin plans to annex at least five more Ukrainian regions, including Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Odessa, and Nikolaev. These plans are being discussed in the Kremlin despite the fact that Russia still does not have full control over the regions that were formally annexed in 2022, including Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

**The Resurgence of Russian Nationalism: From Soviet Tool to Putin's Pillar**
The recent installation of a statue of Joseph Stalin in Moscow's Kurskaya metro station is a significant event in the complex narrative of modern Russia. This act, far from being a mere anecdote or nostalgic revisionism, reflects the selective invocation of Soviet past shadows to cement the present. The Stalin statue represents a brutal instrumentalization of Russian nationalism, used to galvanize the state during times of war and peace. This phenomenon is part of a deeper process: the progressive absorption of Russian identity and nationalism as a unifying and power-vectorizing nucleus, first within the Soviet project and now, with renewed vigor, in Vladimir Putin's Russia. The Russian Federation, formally democratic and post-communist, has reincorporated this ideological matrix, displacing the Marxist-Leninist repressive machinery with an essentialist, authoritarian, and revanchist national identity cult. Putin's words, spoken years ago but now more relevant than ever, 'The disappearance of the USSR was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century,' reflect a deep imperial nostalgia and reveal the fusion of Russian nationalism and post-communist authoritarian state practice. The reappearance of Stalin in Moscow's public space, highlighted by international press, underscores this continuity. The article explores how the Soviet Union's constitutional architecture proclaimed the formal sovereignty of each federated republic, but in practice, it was a mirage. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union operated as a fiercely centralized structure, dominated by ethnic Russians and a logic of vertical subordination to Moscow. The article examines how this led to the russification of the Soviet Union, including the imposition of the Russian language, the promotion of a Russian-centric historical narrative, and the repression of peripheral nationalities. The article also discusses how Putin's Russia has revived this matrix, using nationalism as a tool for control, projection of power, and symbolic cohesion, and how this has led to a new imperialist geopolitics, with Ukraine being a key example. The article concludes that Putin's Russia is not a radical break with the Soviet past, but rather its heir, having absorbed and refined the Soviet apparatus of repression, centralism, and the instrumentalization of Russian nationalism.

**Expert: Ukraine Needs to Increase Daily Russian Losses to Break the War**
According to Tarek Zhovtenko, an expert on international security at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, Ukraine needs to significantly increase the daily losses of the Russian army to break its ability to continue the full-scale war. Currently, Russia loses around 1500-1800 soldiers per day, but this is not enough to force the Kremlin to stop the aggression. Zhovtenko notes that with the current mobilization rate of around 30,000 new recruits per month, the Russian army is able to 'cover' its losses. However, he believes that increasing the daily losses of the enemy to 2500-4000 soldiers could lead to a strategic turning point. 'If the Russians start losing 3000-4000 soldiers per day, their mobilization resources simply won't be able to recover. In this case, Putin will have to either declare a large-scale mobilization or significantly reduce the intensity of the fighting,' Zhovtenko explains. He also notes that even the involvement of foreign troops, such as the reported 14-15 thousand North Korean soldiers, will not provide sufficient compensation for the losses. Therefore, Ukraine's strategic advantage lies not only in defense and preserving its forces, but also in exhausting the enemy's personnel as much as possible. Only significant losses will force the Russian leadership to make unpopular and painful political decisions. As of May 31, the total combat losses of the Russian invaders were 987,330 people, with an additional 1,250 killed in the past 24 hours.

**The Future of Democracy in Russia: A Gradual Transition**
The author argues that democracy in Russia cannot happen suddenly, but rather will develop gradually, within and based on post-Putin hybrid regimes. The author criticizes traditional Russian democrats for their lack of political experience and their tendency to demonize the Russian people and the country. They suggest that this is a result of the absence of a strong tradition of democratic politics in Russia, where people have not been taught to respect the will of the people and to be responsible for the fate of the country. The author also notes that the current Russian democratic movement is dominated by people who are not politicians, but rather human rights activists and moralists, who are not equipped to deal with the complexities of politics. The author predicts that traditional Russian democrats will become scapegoats in post-Putin Russia, blamed for being unpatriotic, anti-national, and anti-Russian. The author suggests that a more realistic scenario for post-Putin Russia is a gradual transition to democracy, with a focus on building coalitions and finding common ground with other political forces.

**What 'Systemic Opposition' Can Offer in 2026 Elections: Explaining the Kremlin's Strategy**
According to Meduza, the political bloc of the presidential administration is considering transforming the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) into a 'party of diplomacy' that would help the Kremlin establish connections with far-right forces abroad and pro-Russian parties in post-Soviet countries. LDPR leader Leonid Slutsksy has proposed this idea, which would need to be approved by the head of the presidential administration's political bloc, Sergey Kirienko. Meduza's special correspondent, Andrey Perets, explains that this move could be a part of the Kremlin's strategy to maintain control over the 'systemic opposition' ahead of the 2026 elections. Perets notes that the LDPR and other 'systemic opposition' parties are still unclear about their stance on the war and Putin's leadership, and it remains to be seen how they will position themselves for the upcoming elections.

**Russia jails head of independent election watchdog for 5 years**
Grigory Melkonyants, the head of Russia's independent election watchdog Golos, was sentenced to five years in a penal colony for working with an 'undesirable organization'. Melkonyants, who pleaded not guilty, was arrested in August 2023. Human rights campaigners say the case is part of a wider crackdown on civil society since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Golos co-chair Stanislav Andreichuk said, 'This absurd case defies easy explanation, not only for foreigners but even for ourselves.' Despite being designated as a 'foreign agent', Golos continues its work in Russia, with Andreichuk stating, 'Even though things are getting tougher, we're still doing what we do.' The Kremlin has described the 2024 election that returned Putin for a fifth term as a demonstration of the Russian people's support for the president. However, Andreichuk said, 'A real democracy in Russia wouldn't be a military threat. But an authoritarian government will keep threatening its neighbours.' Rights group OVD-Info reports that over 1,600 people are currently imprisoned in Russia on political grounds.

**Putin and Volodin Discuss Development of Parliamentarism in Russia**
Russian President Vladimir Putin and State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin discussed the development of parliamentarism in Russia during a working meeting. According to the Kremlin, Volodin noted that since 1993, there have been significant changes in the development of parliamentary democracy. He expressed gratitude to Putin for his initiative to introduce a new approach to distributing the results of post-election campaigns, saying, 'The format, where the winning party 'does not take everything for itself, but divides the opportunities equally,' having a majority in the State Duma, shows results and affects the quality of decisions made.'

**Kremlin Denounces Violation of Democratic Norms in European Capitals**
The Kremlin has denounced the increasing number of 'European capitals' that violate democratic norms, citing the case of Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French far-right party, who was convicted and banned from politics by the French justice system. According to Dmitri Peskov, the Russian Presidential Press Secretary, 'more and more European capitals are following the path of trampling democratic norms.' Peskov emphasized that Russia does not want to interfere in France's internal affairs and has 'never' done so. However, he noted that 'in general, what we see in European capitals shows that they are not at all reluctant to overstep democratic boundaries during the political process.' Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison, two of which are firm, and five years of ineligibility, which will immediately take effect. This verdict puts her political future at risk, particularly her intention to run in the 2027 presidential elections, for which she was the leading candidate in polls. Le Pen's party has been accused of receiving funding from Russia.

**Putin Suggests Temporary Administration in Ukraine Under International Supervision**
According to Reuters, Putin stated that Russia has been making steady progress towards its goals in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which has been ongoing for over three years. Putin suggested that a temporary administration could be established in Ukraine under the supervision of the United Nations, the US, European countries, and their allies.

Putin noted that he has been making efforts to engage in direct dialogue with Russia, unlike his predecessor Joe Biden, and that he sees this as a sign of his desire to bring about peace. Putin also stated that Russia supports peaceful solutions to conflicts, including the current one in Ukraine, and that they have the strategic initiative on the front lines.

**Vladimir Kara-Mourza: 'We Must Prepare for the Day After Putin'**
Vladimir Kara-Mourza, a Russian historian and opposition leader, was imprisoned for two years in Siberia for speaking out against Vladimir Putin's regime. He was released in August 2023 as part of a prisoner exchange. Kara-Mourza spoke to La Libre about his experiences in prison, where he was subjected to solitary confinement and forced to live in a small cell with no human interaction. He said that the regime's goal is to break the spirit of its opponents, and that he was lucky to have had access to a book and a pen to keep his mind occupied. Kara-Mourza also spoke about his forced deportation to Turkey, where he was treated like an animal and had to cross the border without a valid passport. He warned that Putin's regime will not change its aggressive behavior, and that there is a high probability of another attack on other countries. Kara-Mourza called for a change in the Russian government, saying that the only solution is a democratic and legitimate government that respects human rights and international norms. He also emphasized the importance of preparing for the day after Putin, and that the international community should start thinking about how to support the transformation of Russia into a democracy. Kara-Mourza also spoke about the current state of the Russian opposition, saying that it is impossible to evaluate the real opinion of the people in a country where expressing dissent can lead to imprisonment. He mentioned that there are many Russians who are in deep disagreement with the current government, but that the regime's propaganda and repression make it difficult to assess the true state of public opinion.

**Is the Democratic Opposition in Russia Dead with Alexei Nawalny?**
It's been a year since the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Nawalny, and his supporters are still fighting for democracy in Russia. Julia Nawalny, his widow, said, 'It will be a place of hope and strength for all those who dream of a wonderful Russia of the future.' She hopes the grave will become a symbol of resistance against the Putin regime. Despite the challenges, Nawalny's supporters continue to fight for their goals, both in Russia and in exile. Ksenia Fadeeva, a former leader of Nawalny's election office in Tomsk, said, 'I knew they could put you in prison, break up protests with batons, and invent criminal charges. But poisoning with a chemical weapon? I thought there were limits, but I was wrong.' The Russian opposition is heavily criminalized, and the few remaining critics are rigorously pursued. Wladimir Kara-Mursa, a prominent activist, wrote from prison, 'The arrest of Nawalny was a deep wound for the entire opposition.' He was sentenced to 25 years in prison for criticizing Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Fadeeva is skeptical about the future, saying, 'I don't know where we can find a new leader like Nawalny under these harsh conditions.' The hope for a democratic Russia remains, but the path to it is fraught with challenges.

**US Proposes Presidential and Parliamentary Elections in Ukraine by 2025**
The US has proposed that Ukraine hold presidential and parliamentary elections by the end of 2025, especially if a ceasefire is agreed upon between Kyiv and Moscow in the coming months. However, the Ukrainian government has rejected this idea. US Special Envoy for Ukraine Conflict Resolution, Kurt Volker, stated, 'In most democratic countries, elections are held during war. I think it's important that they [Ukrainian authorities] do this. I think it's good for democracy, -- it's the beauty of a strong democracy when you have more than one person who can potentially run.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously stated that the US should first consult with Ukraine, and then he would like to see 'the United States, Ukraine, and Russians at the negotiating table.' The Russian government has repeatedly stated that it considers the current Ukrainian leadership illegitimate and that this raises questions about the possibility of peaceful negotiations. 'You can negotiate with anyone, but because of their illegitimacy, he [Zelensky] does not have the right to sign anything. If he wants to participate in negotiations, I will appoint people who will conduct these negotiations, please,' -- said Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Ukrainian government has stated that it will not hold elections until the war is over and the military situation is stable. 'Zelensky wants all soldiers and refugees abroad to be able to vote. Today, all resources must go to the war,' -- explained the head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak.
