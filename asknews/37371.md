**My evil boyfriend 'tried to kill me', he's being release early**
Lucy Buxton, a mother of three, has spoken out against the early release of her former abusive partner, Kevin Jones, who controlled her life for 14 years. Jones, 43, was jailed for 3.5 years for driving a motor vehicle dangerously and harassment to put a person in fear of violence, but will be released in August after just 10 months. Lucy says she is terrified Jones will seek revenge and hurt her and their children, and that the Labour government's plans to free criminals recalled to custody after 28 days will put women like her at extreme risk. She claims that Jones' abuse was 'exhausting' and that she was barely surviving when their youngest boy was born in 2018. Lucy says she made peace with herself that the only way she'd get out of the relationship was if one of them died, and that she is now terrified that Jones will be released and she will have to go back into hiding. She says: 'The government will have blood on their hands. I'm disgusted. There's no justice.'

**Flore de Lille's Arrest Sparks Outrage Among Her Lawyers**
Flore de Lille, a Cameroonian-French social media influencer, was arrested on May 21, 2025, and taken to the central prison in Yaoundé, Kondengui. According to her lawyers, she was not notified of the reasons for her arrest and was not given the opportunity to appeal.

However, her lawyers claim that the judgment was appealed and that the mainstay of the appeal was set for June 6, 2025. Despite this, the prosecutor refused to execute a subsequent court order to release her from custody, and she was instead taken to prison. Her lawyers are outraged by this 'flagrant abuse' and claim that Flore de Lille is being unfairly targeted.

**Tanzanian Opposition Party Leader Detained Ahead of Elections**
The Tanzanian authorities have detained Amani Golugwa, the deputy general secretary of the Chadema opposition party, citing 'confidential information' that he was regularly entering and leaving the country without following legal procedures. According to the party's spokesperson, Brenda Rupia, Golugwa is currently being held at the central police station in Dar es Salaam. The International Democratic Union (UID) has condemned the 'illegal detention' and called for his immediate release, stating that 'silencing opposition voices violates the very foundations of democracy.' This is the latest incident targeting Chadema members, the main opposition party in the country, which is set to hold elections in October. Last month, the party's president, Tundu Lissu, was detained and accused of 'treason', a crime punishable by death, and the party was excluded from the electoral process. Golugwa had also reported the disappearance of a Chadema supporter, who he claimed was abducted by police agents. The Chadema party accuses the government of President Samia Suluhu Hassan of reverting to authoritarian practices reminiscent of her predecessor's regime.

**Custody dispute leads to arrest of fraud suspect wanted for 11 years**
Phandelani Klaas, a 39-year-old man, was arrested at Pretoria Central Police Station after a routine fingerprint check revealed his identity as a suspect wanted for 11 years for fraud.

Now, law enforcement is ramping up efforts to bring her to justice and your help could make all the difference,' Fumba said. Between 2014 and 2015, Nofilita allegedly manipulated financial records to mislead SARS, falsely declaring that her business was non-operational, and defrauding SARS of more than R633,000.
