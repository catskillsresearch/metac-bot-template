**'Free' Government Money Accounts For 19% Of All Personal Income**
Free government money, including Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and Social Security, accounts for 19% of all personal income in the US. When adjusted for inflation, the numbers remain nearly identical. The US is facing a significant demographic shift, with a record number of people reaching the age of 65 by 2025, which will impact retirement planning, healthcare, and the economy. Social Security payments and Medicare costs are expected to skyrocket, while the number of replacement workers with skills is decreasing. The current path is unsustainable, and the latest tax bill is expected to add $22 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.

**Indian economy to be close to $30 trillion mark by 2047: Amitabh Kant**
India's economy is expected to reach $30 trillion by 2047, according to G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant. He emphasized the country's advantage of a young demographic, saying, 'The demographics are very young. The Western part of the world is ageing and Japan has already aged, even China is ageing. India is just 28 and even when we become 100, the average age will be 35 years.' Kant also highlighted the need for sustainable urbanization, stating that the country will see around 5 million people getting into the process of urbanization and will need to create 500 new cities in India. Additionally, he noted that India's ambition is to create 400 airports, with more than 150 operational airports already in the country. 'You need to create two new Americas in the next five decades. You need to create a Chicago every five years in India. That is the challenge for India,' he said.

**The Invisible Resilience of Older Women in Colombia: A Call for Gender-Sensitive Policies**
Colombia is undergoing a profound and silent demographic transformation, with 15% of its population already over 60 years old, and projected to reach 26% by 2050. However, this aging process is not uniform, and a gender-based approach reveals significant differences. The country is aging with a feminine face, with 55.5% of the population over 60 being women and 44.5% being men. This gap widens in the centenarian group, where women almost double the number of men. The longer life expectancy of women (80 years compared to 74-75 years for men) explains this phenomenon. However, the feminization of aging also implies a higher incidence of loneliness, widowhood, and economic dependence among women. The life trajectories of older men and women are deeply unequal, with women living most of their lives in contexts that relegated them to unpaid or informal work, leaving them without access to pensions. Only one in eight women manages to retire with moderately dignified income, while men have greater access to the formal market, but face a retirement transition marked by isolation and loss of social sense. While men tend to stay at home, women continue to be active in their daily activities. As the Fundación Saldarriaga Concha notes, 'The deterioration of the physical functionality of the older person after retirement is related to the deterioration of mental health, especially in men.' Despite their crucial role in sustaining households and communities, older women remain invisible to public policies. They perform care roles, lead households, and participate in micro-enterprises, but are not recognized as producers of economic or social value. The digital divide affects rural women, although many are willing to learn, as evidenced by the digital appropriation programs led by the FSC. Incorporating a gender approach into aging policies is essential to ensure social justice. The DANE and FSC have pointed out that 'gender inequalities accumulate disadvantages in the old age of women.' Therefore, differentiated policies are required to recognize these historical trajectories and empower older women as entrepreneurs, caregivers, educators, and community leaders.

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**Denmark to Raise Retirement Age to 70 by 2040: A Response to Aging Population**
Denmark plans to raise the retirement age to 70 years by 2040, with the current retirement age being 67 years. The retirement age will increase every five years, reaching 68 in 2030 and 69 in 2035. This move comes as protests continue over low pensions, with experts calling for changes to labor laws to address the issue. A proposed labor reform aims to increase flexibility in work arrangements, reduce state intervention in private agreements, and allow for more flexible salaries and work relationships. Meanwhile, a proposed pension reform aims to address issues such as the 'envejecimiento poblacional' (aging population), where people are living longer but having fewer children, leading to uncertainty over the future of pensioners. Experts suggest moving from a 'beneficio definido' (defined benefit) system to a 'contribución definida' (defined contribution) system. According to Jacqueline Maubré, 'El sistema de reparto está en crisis en la Argentina. La expectativa de vida ha crecido, pero tambien baja el ritmo de la natalidad.' (The pension system is in crisis in Argentina. Life expectancy has increased, but the birth rate has also decreased.)

**Álava's Aging Population: A Need for More Care Services**
The 'baby boom' generation in Álava is aging, and many are starting to rely on social services. According to the Fundación Eguía-Careaga report, the number of people over 65 will increase by 17.2% by 2030, and those over 80 will increase by 26.8%. The report suggests that the current number of care home places is 'sufficient', but there is a need to strengthen other types of services, such as home care. The report also calculates that there will be a need for 160 more places in day centers. Additionally, the report notes that there will be a need for 1,300 family members to care for their relatives who are unable to perform daily activities without support. The study does not attempt to predict the future of disability in 2030, but notes that the number of people with recognized disabilities in Álava has increased by 80% since the COVID-19 pandemic. As Gorka Urtaran, the deputy for Social Policies, has previously stated, there will be a need for 1,000 more professionals to care for dependent people in their homes by 2030. 'We need to adapt the system to these changes,' said Urtaran. 'The people want to stay at home and live their last years there, or until they have no other choice but to go to a residence.'

**South Korea's Aging Population: A Call for Action**
South Korea is expected to become the world's oldest country by 2045, with 37% of the population over 65. To address this issue, the government should consider increasing the retirement age to 70, allowing seniors to continue working and contributing to the economy. Additionally, the government should provide a 'choice of retirement extension' option for companies, similar to Japan's 'employment stabilization measure'. This would enable seniors to continue working beyond the current retirement age of 65. Furthermore, the government should transform community centers (known as 'gongdan' in Korean) into multi-generational spaces where seniors can socialize and engage in leisure activities. Finally, the government should invest in AgeTech, a technology-based care industry, to create a new growth engine for the economy. According to a survey, 78.1% of respondents agreed to increase the retirement age to 70, and 81.5% considered 70 to be the appropriate age for seniors. The government should also consider providing a 'choice of retirement extension' option for companies, similar to Japan's 'employment stabilization measure'. This would enable seniors to continue working beyond the current retirement age of 65. The government should also invest in AgeTech, a technology-based care industry, to create a new growth engine for the economy.

**The Invention of the Fourth and Fifth Age**
The concept of the fourth and fifth age is emerging as the global population ages. According to the World Health Organization, in 2020, the population over 60 surpassed that of children under 5 for the first time. By 2050, there will be over 2 billion people over 60 worldwide. In the US, centenarians are expected to quadruple in the next three decades. Harvard researcher David Sinclair predicts that the first person to live to 150 is already alive, and that advances in AI will accelerate discoveries and help find cures for complex diseases. However, there is a lack of thought and writing on how new older adults will adopt new customs, what social rules they will establish, and how they will differ from each other. Journalist Dariela Sosa has launched an investigation into this topic, asking questions such as how families with four or five generations will function, and how inheritances will be transferred between generations. The concept of retirement may also be replaced by new rhythms of work, pause, and re-invention. The invention of the fourth and fifth age is underway, and we are creating a new universe of ideas, objects, and interpretations.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Aussies call for redefining retirement for a longer lifespan**
According to MetLife, over half of Australians hope to live to 100 years, and 90% believe retirement should be redefined to account for a longer lifespan. The study found that 53% of Australians and 58% globally believe it will be commonplace to live to 100 by 2035. However, this has flow-on effects, including outliving savings, health fears, and funding large purchases. Despite these concerns, over half of Australians have not calculated their income needs in retirement or created a retirement plan. MetLife stated, 'There is great opportunity for organisations that identify and move with these changes. Those that don’t will be left behind.'

**30.4% of Russians will be 60 years old or older by 2046, says Ministry of Health geriatrician**
According to Olga Tkaacheva, the head of geriatrics at the Russian Ministry of Health, by 2046, 30.4% of the Russian population will be 60 years old or older. However, the aging process can be influenced by slowing it down. Currently, 24.4% of the Russian population (35.6 million people) are 60 years old or older, and this number is expected to increase to 25.4% by 2030 and 30.4% by 2046. Tkaacheva noted that 'now there are 35.6 million elderly people in Russia, 4.6 million are over 80, 600 thousand are over 90, and almost 18 thousand are over 100 years old. And indeed, living to 100 years today is a chance for any newborn.' The goal is to increase the expected lifespan at 60 years old from 20.7 years to 22 years by 2030.

**South Korea sees job seekers up in 60+ group only: report**
According to government data, South Korea saw a decrease in new job seekers in all age groups except for the 60 and above group in 2024. The 60+ group has been the second most active job searchers behind 20-somethings since 2023, and this year marked the fifth year straight that the number of 60+ job seekers increased on-year, accounting for 21.3 percent of all job seekers. In January 2025, 29 percent of all job seekers were aged 60+, surpassing the figure of even the 20-somethings. The government has announced that South Korea has become a super-aged society, with 20 percent of the population aged 65 or above. Statistics Korea projects that the percentage of those 60 and older in the country is expected to surpass 30 percent in 2035 and reach 43 percent of the population by 2050.

**Gender and Age: We need a female perspective on ageing populations**
The world is experiencing a significant demographic shift with a growing proportion of older people. By 2050, 82 million people aged 65 and older will live in the US, and 80% of older adults will live in low- and middle-income countries. This poses challenges to healthcare systems and economies, with every 1% increase in healthcare burden resulting in a 0.083% decrease in GDP growth rate. Social isolation affects one in four people worldwide, with over 2 million people in England over 75 living alone. Women are more likely to experience loneliness, especially with disability, and face greater disadvantages of 'multiple forms of inequality' throughout their lifespan. As the UN's decade for 'healthy ageing' (2021-30) is underway, nations must include 'social' perspectives in policies and programmes to fight social isolation and loneliness, focusing on the special needs of women. 'They encounter tremendous hardship in their twilight years as they fight against the twin challenges of patriarchy and vulnerability,' noted an exploratory research study among older women residents of a care home in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.

**One in Five Girls Born in 2030 Expected to Live to 100, Study Finds**
A recent British study found that one in five girls born in 2030 will live to be at least 100 years old, with the percentage increasing to one in four by 2047. The study, published by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) and reported by The Independent, also found that boys will see an increase in average lifespans, with more than one in eight boys born in 2030 expected to live to 100, rising to one in six by 2047. According to the estimates, 17.9% of girls and 11.5% of boys born in 2023 have a chance of reaching the age of 100. These numbers are expected to rise to 19.9% for girls and 13.1% for boys by 2030, and to 24.7% for girls and 17.3% for boys by 2047. The predictions were made based on an analysis of annual death records, assuming improvements in survival rates among the elderly.

According to the Pew Research Centre, the number of people 100 years of age or older is projected to quadruple by 2054, increasing from 0.03% to 0.1% of the U.S. population. Dr. Gifford Jones, author of '90+ and How I got There', notes that living a balanced and healthy life can increase one's chances of living a healthy life into and beyond the century mark. However, he also emphasizes that there are many factors that can shorten one's lifespan. Dr. Jones has recently written another book, 'Healthy Retirement Residence Living', and launched a natural supplement called 'Giff's Own CardioVibe', which is based on the research of Linus Pauling on the cardiovascular benefits of high-dose vitamin C.

**One in five girls born in 2030 will live to 100**
According to new research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), one in five girls born in 2030 is projected to live until at least 100 years old, rising to almost one in four for those born in 2047. For boys, the projections are less dramatic, with more than one in eight males born in 2030 expected to reach 100, increasing to about one in six by 2047. The figures are based on past trends in annual death registrations and assume improved mortality rates among elderly people. Kerry Gadsdon of the ONS said, 'The gap between male and female cohort life expectancy at birth has fallen over the past four decades. This is likely due to improvements in lifestyle, for example reduction in smoking rates and the working conditions of men over several decades, as well as advances in healthcare, for example the prevention and treatment of heart disease.' The ONS published the data to 'allow us to understand the size of the projected population at older ages, which is important for policy making and service planning.'
