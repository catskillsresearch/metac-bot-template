**Mayor calls on Transport for London to cancel abortion advert ban**
London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan is 'urgently' looking into Transport for London's (TfL) ban on adverts from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which share stories of police investigations into women who were prosecuted for having an abortion. According to Heidi Stewart, chief executive of BPAS, the adverts support Tonia Antoniazzi MP's amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill. TfL previously stated that the campaign made 'serious allegations about the police' and could bring TfL or the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) into disrepute.'

**London Mayor Reverses Abortion Ad Display Ban on City's Transportation Network**
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for an urgent review of Transport for London's (TFL) decision to ban ads from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) calling for the decriminalization of abortion. The ads, featuring anonymous stories of women investigated by police, were deemed not to comply with TFL's advertising policy. According to a source close to the mayor, 'Women's voices must be heard.' TFL previously approved pro-choice ads to run on buses, and the mayor hopes for a quick decision to allow the BPAS ads to run, understanding that they are not criticizing the police, but rather calling for a change in the law on abortion.

**France to Ban Smoking in All Public Outdoor Spaces from 2025**
France has announced a ban on smoking in all public outdoor spaces starting from 2025, as part of a broader national plan to combat tobacco. According to Health Minister Frédéric Valletoux, the measure aims to create a 'smoke-free generation' by 2032. 'It's unacceptable that in 2024, 75,000 people still die every year in France due to smoking,' Valletoux said. 'We want to create environments where smoking is no longer the norm.' The ban will be implemented gradually, following the example of over 7,000 areas that have already become 'smoke-free' through local ordinances. The government will establish the ban nationwide, uniforming the rules across the country. The new regulations will be accompanied by awareness campaigns, fines for those who break the rules, and incentives for those who quit smoking. The price of cigarette packs will also increase, reaching 13 euros by 2026. The plan has received support from health and environmental organizations, which highlight the harm caused by smoking not only to human health but also to the environment. Some representatives of the tobacco industry and tobacconists have expressed concerns about the economic impact, while some smokers have questioned the measure, considering it too restrictive. France is taking a leading role in Europe in the fight against tobacco, following the example of countries like New Zealand and Canada. The French government hopes that this move will inspire other European countries to take similar initiatives to protect public health and the environment. This ban represents a deep cultural shift: from a symbol of freedom and transgression, the cigarette becomes an habit to overcome for the common good.

**Adriana Smith's Case Sparks Debate on Anti-Abortion Policies and Maternal Health in the US**
Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old pregnant woman, was declared brain dead after suffering a stroke, but her body was kept on life support to allow the fetus to develop. The case has sparked a debate about the ethics and legality of anti-abortion policies in the US, particularly in states with Republican governors. Smith's family, including her 5-year-old son, continues to visit her in the hospital, but they are not allowed to disconnect her life support machines because of a state law that prohibits abortion after the detection of fetal activity. The law was passed in 2019, but only took effect in 2022 after the Roe v. Wade case was overturned. Experts, including Kimberly Mutcherson, a reproductive rights specialist, have expressed concerns about the impact of such policies on women's health and the potential harm to the fetus. 'It's a kind of experiment: allowing a fetus to develop in a woman's body with brain death. Knowing the enormous effort a pregnant woman's body needs to sustain and nourish a pregnancy, it's impossible to know for sure the damage a fetus may suffer while remaining attached to a body without a functioning brain,' Mutcherson said. The case highlights the need for better healthcare and reproductive rights in the US, particularly for women from low-income backgrounds. According to the CDC, 80% of maternal deaths in the US are preventable. The country has one of the highest maternal mortality rates among developed countries, with 18.6 deaths per 100,000 births in 2023. The rate has decreased from 22.3 deaths per 100,000 births in 2022, but the number of deaths among black women has increased, reaching 50.3 per 100,000 births in 2023. 'In Tennessee, for example, we have one of the strictest abortion bans, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or young girls. It's also one of the states with the highest infant mortality rate (6.6 per 100,000) and maternal mortality rate (41.1, the highest in the country). At the same time, Republicans have complete control,' said Senator London Lamar. 'So, instead of fighting a lost battle, I changed my strategy to raise the banner of maternal health.'

**No, OBGYNs are not systematically fleeing states that banned abortion**
Contrary to popular narrative, research published in JAMA Network Open finds no evidence of obstetrician-gynecologists (OBGYNs) fleeing states that have banned abortion. Using administrative records, the study found that 94.2% of OBGYNs who were practicing in states with abortion bans in 2022 were still practicing in September 2024. The study also found that OBGYNs continued to move into states with abortion bans at similar rates to other states. The authors suggest that the narrative of OBGYNs leaving states with abortion bans may be due to a small number of physicians who left being interviewed by multiple reporters, and that the real issues with reproductive health care are related to broader doctor shortages and hospital closures. The study's findings imply that removing abortion bans would likely improve the quality of care that OBGYNs can provide, but would not address the underlying economic and structural forces driving maternal ward closures and doctor shortages. 'Our findings imply that while removing abortion bans would likely improve the quality of care that obstetricians can provide by giving them the ability to follow established standards of care, it is unlikely to shift the economic and structural forces driving maternal ward closures and doctor shortages,' said the authors.

**Syria's Unmet Family Planning Needs: A Study Reveals Alarming Statistics**
The Ministry of Health and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) organized a conference to present the results of a study on unmet needs in family planning for the year 2024. The study, which targeted married women aged 15-49 from 15,600 families, aimed to determine the percentage of Syrian women with unmet needs in family planning and to study the rate of induced abortion as an indicator of unmet needs. According to Dr. Hussein Al-Khatib, Deputy Minister of Health, this study is an important step in the national strategy for women's and children's health, and has contributed to analyzing the current reality and providing accurate indicators about the reality of family planning, in addition to highlighting issues such as induced abortion, which is one of the indicators of unmet needs. Dr. Al-Khatib emphasized the ministry's commitment to achieving the health goals outlined in the Syrian Constitution and working to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 through coordination between relevant sectors and improving the quality of health services provided through comprehensive health coverage. Moriel Mafiko, Director of the UNFPA Office in Syria, stated that 22% of women of childbearing age in Syria have unmet needs in family planning, reflecting obstacles related to access and social and cultural factors. She emphasized that providing family planning methods contributes to promoting family stability and health, as well as social and economic growth. Mafiko reiterated the Fund's commitment to supporting the Ministry of Health in providing high-quality services and empowering women to make informed decisions about reproductive health. Dr. Alia Arqousi, responsible for the Reproductive Health Program at the Ministry of Health, presented the most important results and recommendations of the study, which concluded that more than 78% of the women surveyed have met needs, explaining that the indicator of unmet needs plays a crucial role in preventing induced abortion and its associated health complications. She emphasized the need to strengthen planning to prepare a national strategy to regulate family planning, which would include working to reduce unmet needs in family planning, and to support maternal and child health procedures, as well as monitoring the implementation of laws related to abortion, and integrating work between ministries and sectors, and increasing coverage of family planning services in Syria, which requires providing resources, personnel, and necessary medicines.

**Poland's Presidential Election: A Closely Contested Vote**
The upcoming presidential election in Poland is expected to be closely contested between centrist Rafal Trzaskowski and nationalist Karol Nawrocki. Poland has been a strong ally of Ukraine, providing political, logistical, and military support. However, the country has also faced criticism for suspending asylum rights for migrants crossing the border from Belarus. Poland accuses Belarus and Russia of organizing a migrant influx as part of a hybrid attack to destabilize the region and the EU. The country has increased its defense spending, exceeding the NATO target of 2% of GDP, with 4.7% of GDP allocated to military expenses. Poland plans to increase this level to 5% of GDP next year, a goal also supported by US President Donald Trump. The country has modernized its army, signing contracts with the US and South Korea, and has also signed a new treaty with France for mutual assistance in case of aggression. A large-scale military training program has been announced to ensure that every adult in Poland can be mobilized in case of war. The program, which is also open to women, will be based on voluntary participation and aims to train 100,000 civilians per year from 2027. Poland remains a coal-dependent country, with 63% of its energy production relying on this fuel. The country has signed an agreement to build its first nuclear power plant, with the first reactor expected to enter service in 2033. The Poles are also less and less Catholic, with only 71.3% of the population identifying as Catholic in the 2021 census, compared to 87.6% a decade earlier. Abortion is almost completely banned in Poland, with women only allowed to have an abortion in hospital if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or if it poses a direct threat to the mother's life or health. Assistance with abortion is punishable by up to three years in prison. In 2024, only 896 abortions were performed in the country of 38 million people, but a network called 'Abortion without Borders' reported supporting 47,000 people in accessing abortion that same year.

**France to Ban Smoking in Public Spaces Where Children Are Present**
France will make it illegal to smoke in public spaces where children are present, starting from July 1. The law aims to create a tobacco-free society by 2032. Those who break the law will face a fine of 135 euros. According to Health and Families Minister Catherine Vautrin, 'where there are children, tobacco must disappear.' The law does not apply to smoking in cafes' terraces or the use of e-cigarettes, but new measures are expected to reduce vaping. Tobacco causes 75,000 deaths per year in France, representing 13% of all deaths. The law is part of a National Program to Combat Tobacco, which started in 2023 and will end in 2027, with the goal of creating a tobacco-free generation by 2032. Yves Martinet, president of the National Committee against Tobacco, said that this law is also positive for non-smokers, as it protects them from 'passive smoking, which also kills.' Martinet added that the law 'desnormalizes tobacco consumption and leads smokers to think about quitting gradually.' The law has been shown to be effective, with many local governments in France already having similar measures in place.

**Lawsuit challenging Kentucky's near-total ban on abortions is withdrawn**
A lawsuit challenging Kentucky's near-total ban on abortions has been withdrawn. The attorneys filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case without giving a reason. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, which represented the plaintiff, said it will continue to fight for abortion access in Kentucky. 'People have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,' said Amber Duke, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. The lawsuit was challenging Kentucky's trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.

**Red State Voters Approved Progressive Measures. GOP Lawmakers Are Trying to Undermine Them.**
Republican lawmakers across the US are trying to undermine or undo the will of voters by making it harder to pass amendments and laws through citizen-led initiatives. They argue that the initiative process is susceptible to fraud and unduly influenced by out-of-state money. In some cases, legislators are acting shortly after citizen-led efforts failed but came too close for comfort. For example, in Florida, an abortion-rights initiative fell just short of the 60% of votes needed to pass in November. Republican lawmakers have passed laws tightening the process, requiring initiative sponsors to detail how their proposal would be funded and pay for costly publication of the ballot language in newspapers across the state. They also voted to put a 2026 measure before voters that would require a 60% supermajority for any tax-related initiatives. Critics say the laws are an attempt to rewrite the rules to get their way no matter what a majority of folks in their state wants. 'This is very much connected to the rise of authoritarianism that we’ve seen across the country,' said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. 'They can’t win fairly, so they’re trying to undermine the will of the voters.' In Missouri, lawmakers have overturned the will of voters by advancing a new measure to place another amendment on the ballot that would ban abortion again. They also moved to repeal a sick leave requirement and portions of a minimum wage increase, which had also passed through the initiative process. Critics say the laws are an attempt to undermine the citizens’ ability to use the initiative process. A new campaign called Respect Missouri Voters is recruiting volunteers to collect signatures for a statewide ballot measure in November 2026 that would bar lawmakers from overturning voter-approved initiatives or undermining the citizens’ ability to use the initiative process.

**Amerikas neue Untergrundmedizin: Frauen riskieren alles, um bei Abtreibungen zu helfen**
In the US, abortions are once again largely illegal. However, many people are resisting this and working underground, inspired by a secret, historical network. In the late 1960s, flyers in Chicago promised desperate women help, with the message 'Pregnant? Help sought? Call Jane.' Over a half-century later, the question sounds alarmingly relevant. Since the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to abortion in 2022, the situation for unwanted pregnancies in the US has become precarious again. As in the 1950s and 60s, women are organizing outside the law to enable access to safe abortions.

**Russia to Ban TV Series and Movies Promoting Childlessness Amid Declining Birth Rates**
Russia is planning to ban popular TV series and movies that promote 'childlessness' as part of its efforts to combat declining birth rates. According to reports, distribution licenses will not be issued for these content starting from September, and they will be removed from digital platforms. The move comes as Russia's birth rates continue to decline, with only 294,000 births recorded in the first three months of 2025, a 2.3% decrease from the same period in 2024. As reported by El Pais, the number of births in February decreased by 7% compared to the previous year, and by 4% in March. Alexéi Raksha, a demographer, has criticized Rosstat for not releasing full data on births, deaths, marriages, and divorces, and has predicted a 14% increase in mortality rates in April 2024 compared to the same month in 2023. The Kremlin has implemented a new population protection plan for the 2030-2036 period, which includes financial support for families and restrictions on abortion. The Russian Culture Ministry has also decided to ban TV series and movies that promote childlessness, citing examples such as 'House of Cards', 'Sex and the City', and 'Game of Thrones'. According to Newsweek, the banned content includes narratives that promote childlessness, negative portrayals of pregnancy, motherhood, and fatherhood, and any media content that glorifies childlessness. The United Nations has reported that Russia's population may decline to 100 million by 2080, making it one of the countries with the lowest population growth rates in the world.

**See where abortions are banned and legal  --  and where it's still in limbo**
Following the US Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in June 2022, 19 US states have banned or limited access to abortion. States with limited abortion access report higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, as well as greater economic insecurity. In March, the Justice Department dropped a lawsuit against Idaho that sought to protect abortion access in emergency situations. Ten states had reproductive rights on the ballot in the November 2024 election, with seven states passing measures expanding or protecting abortion access. CNN is tracking these legal challenges as they make their way through the courts. Currently, abortion access varies across the United States, with some states banning the procedure and others protecting it.

**Telemedicine abortions rose in 2024 as legal battle looms - Washington Examiner**
According to the Guttmacher Institute, the share of elective abortions performed by online-only clinics in states without bans rose to 14% in 2024, with over 145,000 medication abortions provided. This number is an underestimate, as it does not include data from 12 states with total abortion bans. Eight states have enacted 'shield laws' to protect telemedicine providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states where elective abortions are prohibited. The Society for Family Planning estimates that around 214,000 abortions nationwide were provided by online-only clinics in 2024. A civil case against a New York telemedicine physician who prescribed mifepristone to a pregnant woman in Texas is expected to escalate to the Supreme Court, putting a strain on the state-by-state position on abortion policy.

**Abortion becomes more common in some US states that outlawed it**
Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, eight US states have implemented 'shield' laws, which protect abortion providers from criminal and civil litigation, regardless of where pills are sent. These laws have led to a significant increase in telemedicine abortions, with nearly 10,000 abortions per month under these provisions in the first six months of 2024. Dr. A, a founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, says, 'It sounds absolutely bananas, right? How could it be legal? How could it be safe?' Yet, it is safe and legal. The process involves women filling out online forms and sending $5 for medication, which is then shipped to them. Although there are risks, including improper disposal of a corpse, shield laws have so far held up against challenges from anti-abortion activists. A challenge in federal court is likely, and some experts predict that the shield laws will eventually end up before the Supreme Court. The constitutional questions are profound, and some experts worry that the use of shield laws could spread beyond abortion to cover other banned or permitted activities.

**US Abortion Bans Linked to Increase in Infant Mortality**
Since the US Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022, infant mortality rates have increased by 6% nationwide, resulting in 500 more deaths than usual. This is according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), which analyzed data from 2012 to 2023. The study found that the new abortion bans have disproportionately affected low-income and black communities, with a 11% increase in infant mortality among black children. Texas has seen the largest increase in infant mortality, with 94 of the 478 deaths recorded in a year. The authors of the study warn that the new laws are blocking progress in reducing infant mortality, as they can lead to continued pregnancies with congenital abnormalities and limit access to healthcare for high-risk pregnancies. 'These prohibitions can increase infant mortality through the continuation of pregnancies with congenital abnormalities, the main cause of infant mortality in the US,' said the study's authors. 'They can also increase infant mortality by limiting access to healthcare for high-risk pregnancies, which could increase complications related to these outcomes.'

**After Florida's 6-week ban, abortions declined 28% in 2024, data shows**
According to data from the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration, the number of abortions in Florida decreased by 28% in 2024 compared to 2023, with 60,755 abortions reported. This decline is attributed to the six-week ban on abortion, which was implemented in May 2024. The ban has led to a significant decrease in out-of-state visitors seeking abortions in Florida, with a 51% decline in non-Florida residents getting abortions in the state. Michelle Quesada, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida, stated that Florida is no longer an access point for abortion in the southern U.S. and that clinics are now helping women travel to states with looser restrictions. Women are also visiting clinics earlier than before, sometimes before a pregnancy can be detected, and are seeking pregnancy-regulated education. David Heyman, executive director of First Care Women's Clinic, said that women are paying more attention to their menstrual cycles and fertility when visiting the clinic, indicating that the six-week ban is affecting women's behavior toward seeking an abortion.

**Republican States Claim Zero Abortions. A Red-State Doctor Calls That ‘Ludicrous.’**
In states with total or near-total abortion bans, government officials have reported zero or very few abortions in 2023, the first full year after the Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion rights. However, medical professionals and researchers say these statistics are not only untrue but fundamentally dishonest. According to Dr. Amy Kelley, an OB-GYN in South Dakota, 'To say there are no abortions going on in South Dakota is ludicrous.' Researchers at WeCount, an academic research effort, have kept a tally of the number of abortions nationwide since April 2022 and have found that the zeroing out of abortions is statistically unlikely and runs counter to the reality that pregnancy 'comes with many risks and in many cases emergency abortion care will be needed.' Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, a public health scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, said, 'We know they are sometimes necessary to save the pregnant person’s life, so I do hope there are abortions occurring in South Dakota.' The discrepancy between the official statistics and the reality on the ground has raised concerns about the politicization of vital statistics and the potential consequences for public health policy.

**Multiple bills filed in Kentucky legislature over abortion issues**
Abortion is a contentious issue in the Kentucky legislature, with multiple bills filed over the past few months. House Bill 203 proposes exemptions to the state's near-total ban on abortion, but is opposed by both Kentucky Right to Life and Planned Parenthood. Addia Wuchner with Kentucky Right to Life suggests that bills should focus on punishing perpetrators of rape and incest, while Tamarra Wieder with Planned Parenthood argues that the six-week time limit for abortions creates barriers for victims of rape and incest. Two other bills aim to prohibit out-of-state providers from sending abortion-inducing drugs to women in Kentucky, with Wuchner claiming it would protect women and Wieder arguing that the drugs are safe and effective. None of these bills have been heard in committee meetings yet, and are modeled after similar laws passed in Louisiana and West Virginia.
