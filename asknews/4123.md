**Brazilian Industry Contracts in May for First Time in 17 Months**
Brazil's industrial activity contracted in May for the first time in 17 months, affected by weak demand, although confidence remains high, according to the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). The PMI for Brazilian industry, compiled by S&P Global, fell to 49.4 in May, the lowest level since December 2023, indicating a deterioration in operating conditions. The survey found that May saw lower levels of new orders and production compared to April. The decline in production was the first in four months and the most intense since July 2023. Brazilian manufacturers also noted a decline in export orders in May, although less intense than in April. However, expectations that adverse conditions will be short-lived boosted confidence and supported job creation in the sector in May. Manufacturers improved their growth prospects in May, and the level of positive sentiment was the strongest in nine months, after hitting a five-year low in April. Companies are betting that acquisitions, new product launches, hiring, and technology investments will support production over the next 12 months. This, combined with planned new product launches, helped create jobs, which increased for the 22nd consecutive month, at the strongest pace since February. 'Although companies were more optimistic, the industrial sector remains in a delicate position. If weak demand persists, we risk seeing the sector increasingly weighing on economic performance,' warned Pollyanna De Lima, associate director of economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

**Gerresheimer AG's Stock Plummets on Downward Revision of 2025 Guidance**
Gerresheimer AG's stock plummeted 19.451% to 51.35 EUR on June 2, 2025, following a significant downward revision of its 2025 guidance. The company, which specializes in medical primary packaging and cosmetics products, faces an operational test, but also presents opportunities for long-term investors. The new guidance includes: * Organic revenue growth: 1-2% (previously 3-5%) * Adjusted EBITDA margin: around 20% (previously 22%) * Adjusted EPS: decline in the low two-digit percentage range (previously growth in the high single-digit range) The company's two operational pain points are: 1. Weakened demand in the cosmetics segment, a high-margin business with sensitive market fluctuations. 2. Temporary decline in demand for containment solutions for oral liquid medications, a growth-oriented segment whose temporary weakness is surprising. The board of directors has proposed a drastic reduction in the dividend from 1.25 EUR to 0.04 EUR per share, citing the goal of securing financial flexibility in a volatile environment. This is not only a signal of caution, but also a drastic shift in capital allocation strategy, which will save around 39 million EUR and provide operational breathing room, but damage trust. The company's management has explicitly stated that the weakness in the containment business is temporary, and if this segment recovers as expected in H2 2025, the stock could rebound.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Artificial Intelligence: Models, Challenges, and the Future**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are classified into three categories: weak, strong, and superintelligent. Weak models are designed for specific tasks, such as analysis, detection, and prediction, and are used in various industries. They have improved in accuracy and interactivity but still lack creativity and deep understanding. Strong models, which can think and reason like humans, have not been developed yet, and current models are advanced forms of weak AI. Superintelligent models, which surpass human intelligence, exist only in theory and are divided into four types: self-improving systems, complete human brain simulation, quantum-based systems, and human-machine integration. Projects like Neuralink aim to enhance human mental capabilities and create superhumans.

**Google's Demis Hassabis Predicts General Intelligence within 5-10 Years**
Google's Demis Hassabis believes that General Intelligence (AGI) could become a reality within the next five to ten years. According to an interview with the New York Times, Hassabis estimates that Google's AI, Gemini, is close to reaching this milestone. Hassabis and OpenAI's Sam Altman both predict that AGI will emerge within the next five years. AGI would be able to reason and adapt to any situation, formulating new conjectures like a mathematician, and would be a significant step up from current specialized AI. Two main technical challenges remain to be solved: generating new intellectual ideas and ensuring intellectual coherence. Google is making significant progress, with Gemini being showcased as the embryo of this future superintelligence. Hassabis believes that the impact of AGI will be immense, going beyond simple assistants and search engines, and could become a universal technological foundation, tackling complex challenges like nuclear fusion and medical breakthroughs. However, Hassabis also emphasizes the need for strong international regulation to mitigate the risks and promises of AGI.

**The Beginnerâ€™s Roadmap to Investing in AGI**
Futurist Eric Fry believes that the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within the next 12 to 24 months will revolutionize the business world. He suggests that investors should focus on companies that are adapting to this seismic shift by investing in AI technologies. Fry proposes a three-step approach: investing 'in' AI, investing 'alongside' AI, and investing in 'stealth' AI. Companies that provide key infrastructure for AI, such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, are good investments. Additionally, companies that will benefit from the rise of AGI, such as data centers and companies that provide raw land for data centers, are also good investments. Furthermore, non-tech companies that will adopt and apply AI to increase efficiency and profits, such as companies in the biotech sector, are also good investment opportunities. Fry emphasizes that only companies that adapt quickly to this change will survive, and he has 41 investment recommendations that have reached over 1,000% gains on his track record.

**DeepMind Predicts AGI Availability within 5-10 Years**
Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, predicts that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could be available within 5-10 years. AGI is a system that can replicate all human cognitive abilities. However, the technology has not yet reached this level. Hassabis stated, 'We're already seeing impressive results in some areas of AI work, but there are areas where it still lags behind humans. We need a lot more research to achieve this goal.' DeepMind's prediction is more conservative compared to other industry leaders. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, believes that the first AGI systems could appear within 2-3 years, while Jitu Patel, director of products at Cisco, thinks that the first AGI could be available this year. Elon Musk predicts that AGI will be available by 2026, and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, hinted that AGI could appear in the 'not too distant future.' Experts believe that AI development occurs in three main stages: Hassabis noted that the emergence of artificial superintelligence (ASI) is only a matter of time, but no one knows exactly when it will happen. If DeepMind's predictions come true, the world is on the cusp of a technological revolution that will change everything: from science to economics and everyday life.

**Mysterious Startup SSI Aims to Develop Superintelligent AI that Serves Humanity**
A mysterious startup called 'Safe Superintelligence' (SSI) or 'SSAI' has attracted massive investments from top venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, increasing its market value from $5 billion to $30 billion in just six months. Despite its rapid growth, the company remains shrouded in secrecy, with its official website containing only a single page with 220 words and relying heavily on traditional recruitment methods through direct interviews and referrals. The founder, Ilya Sutskever, who was one of the key minds behind the development of 'Chat GPT', left OpenAI in 2023 after tensions arose and decided to focus on developing a new type of AI that is completely safe and serves humanity. Through SSI, he aims to develop a superintelligent AI that can develop self-awareness and emotions, while ensuring it is friendly to humans rather than a threat. Unlike the prevailing trend in the AI industry, where many companies are trying to develop 'Artificial General Intelligence' (AGI) that resembles human intelligence, SSI is focused on creating a superintelligent AI that surpasses human capabilities. This idea is intriguing but raises many questions about how to develop such AI, particularly in terms of controlling it and ensuring its goals align with human interests. Interestingly, SSI prioritizes privacy and security, requiring employees to deposit their phones in a 'Faraday' box to block Wi-Fi and cellular signals, ensuring the secrecy of the information handled within the company. So far, SSI has not launched any product for public use, and it does not seem to be in a hurry to do so. Instead, the company is focused on developing its AI in a secure and safe environment, with undisclosed plans to launch any commercial product in the near future.

**The Rise of Superintelligence: A New Era for the Economy**
A recent note, 'Superintelligence Strategy', has warned of the potential consequences of a superintelligence or AGI (artificial general intelligence) takeover. The authors, Eric Schmidt, Alexandr Wang, and Dan Hendrycks, predict that AGI will arrive within 24-36 months, driven by the laws of scale, which suggest that increased computing power, data, and model complexity will lead to greater AI progress. The note's authors argue that the development of AGI will have significant economic and societal implications, including the potential for job displacement and a shift towards an economy of abundance. They also suggest that governments and investors are already preparing for this shift, with the US government, for example, planning to develop strategies to mitigate the risks of AGI. The authors conclude that measuring the capacity of AGI to innovate is crucial, as it could either accelerate technological progress and improve material satisfaction with fewer resources, or lead to a significant shift in societal structures.

**OpenAI CEO Warns of 'Superintelligence' Risks and Uneven Impact**
The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, has warned about the potential risks of 'superintelligence', a type of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that promises significant advancements and benefits. However, Altman believes that these improvements may not be widely distributed, at least initially, and may be concentrated in specific segments. According to Altman, 'We expect the impact of AGI to be uneven. Although some industries will change very little, scientific progress will likely be much faster than it is today; this impact of AGI may surpass everything else.' Altman also emphasized the need for greater human oversight to ensure the correct functioning of the technology. He noted that AGI will be 'excellent in certain tasks, but surprisingly bad in others.' Altman also warned about the risk of AGI being used by authoritarian governments to eliminate freedoms and increase control over the population through mass surveillance systems. To prevent this, he believes that adequate regulation of the sector is necessary. Additionally, Altman predicted that AGI could help reduce the prices of many goods, but this will depend on lower energy costs, which currently restrict some advancements. On the other hand, luxury products and limited resources may become even more expensive. Altman also highlighted that the costs of using AI are decreasing rapidly, with prices falling by around 10 times every 12 months, leading to increased adoption of the technology. For example, the price per token of the GPT-4 model fell 150 times between the start of 2023 and mid-2024.
