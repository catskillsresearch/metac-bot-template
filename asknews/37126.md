**Water Companies in Peru Must Improve Chlorine Treatment Procedures**
Peru's 50 water supply companies must adjust and improve their chlorine treatment procedures to provide optimal and high-quality service to users, according to the Superintendence of Water and Sewer Services (Sunass). The modification of the Regulation of Water Quality in the Provision of Sanitation Services, published in the official newspaper El Peruano, requires the companies to implement five key aspects: incorporating sampling points after filtration and disinfection processes, maintaining a minimum 15-day stock of disinfectant, implementing remote monitoring technology, incorporating strategic sampling points, and submitting quarterly reports to Sunass. Sunass will take immediate action if chlorine residual levels fall below 0.5 milligrams per liter, the minimum limit allowed by regulations. According to Sunass, a chlorine level above 0.5 mg/l ensures the water's safety for human consumption, preventing diseases, contamination, and ensuring proper hygiene. As stated by Sunass, Peru needs S/138 billion over 30 years to close the water gap, according to Sunass.

**Florida becomes second state to ban fluoride in public water**
Florida has become the second state in the US to ban the use of fluoride in public water, following Utah's recent prohibition. The decision was made by Governor Ron DeSantis, who signed the Florida Agricultural Law, which includes a clause that prohibits the use of additives in public water that do not meet the new definition of 'water quality additive'. This decision was supported by the state's surgeon general, who has expressed concerns about the effects of fluoride on health. According to DeSantis, 'Yes, using fluoride for teeth is fine. But forcing it in the water supply is basically forcing people to take medication.' The state's surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has also recommended measures to prevent the fluoridation of water, citing potential adverse health effects. Despite the recommendations by the CDC and WHO on the benefits of fluoride, recent studies have raised concerns about its link to neurodevelopmental problems in children. The decision has sparked diverse reactions, with the American Dental Association supporting water fluoridation as a public health achievement, while critics argue that exposure to fluoride during pregnancy can have negative effects on infant development. The controversy has been fueled by the promise of the US Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to re-examine the recommendations on fluoride. With the recent ban in Utah and the new legislation in Florida, the future of water fluoridation in the US is at a crossroads. The US FDA has also begun to remove fluoride tablets and drops from the market, which could change the way dental health is addressed in the country.

**What Fluoride Really Does to Your Body**
Fluoride is a chemical compound that is not the same as the highly toxic gas fluorine. While fluorine is a highly toxic gas, fluoride is a salt that is found in various natural sources such as minerals, water, and some foods like black and green tea and fish. The daily intake of fluoride through food is approximately 0.4-0.6 milligrams per day. Fluoride is also present in our bones and teeth, but in small amounts, it is considered a trace element. Fluoride is not toxic in the amounts found in toothpaste, which typically contains up to 1.5% fluoride. The recommended daily intake of fluoride for adults is 3.0-3.5 milligrams, while for children, it is lower, with a maximum of 1.0 ppm in children's toothpaste. However, excessive fluoride consumption can lead to health risks, such as fluorosis, which can cause white spots on teeth, especially in children. The research on fluoride intake and its effects is complex, with some studies showing that fluoride in drinking water in low concentrations (0.5-1.5 mg/L) is safe and contributes to caries prevention, while higher doses can cause health problems. There is also evidence that high fluoride intake in children may affect the nervous system and IQ, but the results are not conclusive. A large US study in 1990 found no evidence of a link between fluoride in drinking water and an increased cancer risk. Some studies suggest that high fluoride intake during pregnancy may increase the risk of developmental disorders in children, but this is based on studies from Mexico, where people tend to consume larger amounts of fluoride from various sources. Therefore, based on the current evidence, there are no negative effects for pregnant women in Germany.

**Fluoride Exposure Linked to Lower IQ in Children, Study Finds**
A study conducted by scientists from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and published in the JAMA Pediatrics journal found a strong link between exposure to fluoride and a decrease in IQ in children. The research analyzed 74 epidemiological studies from 10 different countries and found that as fluoride levels in the body increase, children are more likely to have lower scores on IQ tests. Fluoride is a substance found in many dental products, as well as in drinking water and certain foods and beverages. According to the study, for every milligram of fluoride per liter of urine, IQ decreased by an average of 1.63 points. The scientists are concerned about the multiple sources of fluoride that pregnant women and children are exposed to. While fluoride has been recommended for years to prevent tooth decay, it is now known to have other highly detrimental secondary effects. The World Health Organization (WHO) sets the maximum safe level of fluoride in drinking water at 1.5 milligrams per liter. Some experts suggest that pregnant women and children opt for bottled water and reduce their consumption of products containing fluoride, such as toothpaste, processed foods, and certain types of tea. However, more studies are needed to fully evaluate the effects of fluoride on health, especially in children.

**Potosinos Consuming Contaminated Water with Arsenic and Fluoride, Warns UASLP Researcher**
Residents of the San Luis Potosí metropolitan area are consuming water contaminated with arsenic and fluoride, which, in prolonged consumption, pose a severe risk to health, including dental and skeletal fluorosis, cognitive impairments in children, and the development of various types of cancer, according to Dr. Paola Elizabeth Díaz Flores, a researcher from the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí (UASLP). Dr. Díaz Flores explained that since 2007, there have been clear indications that the groundwater in the central region of the state has high concentrations of these toxic elements. 'They are present naturally, but over time, they have increased. The water supplied to homes comes mainly from wells, and in many cases, it exceeds the levels allowed by the regulations by up to three times,' she detailed. According to the specialist, the current physical-chemical processes used by water treatment plants are not sufficient to eliminate fluoride or arsenic. In some cases, the distributed water arrives with a concentration of fluoride of up to 3.5 milligrams per liter, when the official standard sets a maximum limit of 1 milligram per liter. The situation worsens when this water is used for cooking, as, when boiled, the contaminants not only remain but also concentrate. 'When the water volume is reduced, the amount of toxic substances we end up ingesting doubles,' warned Dr. Díaz Flores. In terms of health effects, Dr. Díaz Flores explained that fluoride causes dental stains to skeletal deformities, and in children, it can reduce the intelligence quotient. On the other hand, arsenic is related to various types of cancer, including liver, kidney, and brain cancer. To address this situation, the researcher mentioned that the UASLP updates studies and monitors various wells in the capital city to create a map of the safest extraction zones. However, she emphasizes that the only effective way to eliminate these contaminants is through reverse osmosis processes, such as those used by water purifiers. 'It is urgent to raise awareness: we should not consume tap water, not even boiled water, especially in the case of children. Until the treatment and distribution system is rethought and updated, the only safe option is purified water,' concluded Dr. Díaz Flores.

**Florida Bans Fluoride in Public Water: What Does it Mean for Residents?**
Florida has become the second state in the US to ban the use of fluoride in public water, after Governor Ron DeSantis signed the SB 700 law, also known as the Florida Agricultural Law. Although the law does not mention 'fluoride' directly, it imposes limits on the use of certain additives in the state's water system, effectively preventing its incorporation. DeSantis defended the measure, stating that adding fluoride to water without consent constitutes 'forced medication' and could pose risks to pregnant women and children. Experts, including Florida's Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, also warned about potential side effects. The new law will take effect on July 1. The decision was met with criticism from Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, who vetoed a similar ban in the past, and was celebrated by DeSantis. Cava argued that the measure disregards the support of the medical community, which has long defended water fluoridation as a safe and effective tool for oral health. Despite this, the impetus behind the ban appears to be linked to figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has publicly questioned its benefits. The decision represents a significant change in Florida's public health policy and aligns it with other states that have taken similar measures, such as Utah, Kentucky, and North Carolina.

**Madison water board refuses to revote or pause fluoride removal**
The Madison water authority has decided to proceed with its plan to stop adding fluoride to the water it sells to over 19,000 customers, despite 79% of the 160 emails received on the issue requesting the utility to maintain fluoridation. Board Chairman Terris Tatum and member Connie Spears voted in favor, while members Kerry Straub, Larry Miles, and Al Sullivan voted against. The decision means the utility will stop adding fluoride on June 16. Health officials have stated that many objections to fluoridation are based on poor science or studies of conditions that do not match those in U.S. water supplies. Longtime dentist Jim Hatcher called on the board to revote the decision, criticizing them for seeking public comment months after the initial decision. He also pointed out that the board's decision may affect property values, as some people may not want to move to Madison without optimally fluoridated water.

**Fluoride: What it Really Does to Your Body**
Fluoride is a effective caries protection for our teeth. However, there are various opinions about the use of fluoride in toothpaste. While some recommend it, others warn against it due to its potential toxicity and health consequences. According to the German Fluoride Foundation, fluoride reacts with tooth enamel to form fluorapatite, a substance that is highly resistant to acids and provides an effective caries protection by forming an additional protective layer on the teeth. Additionally, fluoride reduces the acid production of caries bacteria and helps to remineralize small damages to the tooth enamel, which often occur after consuming sugar or acid-containing foods. The research on fluoride intake and its effects is complex, but studies have shown that fluoride in drinking water, pregnancy, and IQ have no negative effects. However, a US study found a link between fluoride and cancer, and a meta-analysis found a potential negative effect on IQ. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have stated that fluoride is not toxic. The German Society for Nutrition (DGE) recommends a daily intake of 75 milligrams of fluoride for children and 150 milligrams for adults. 'Fluoride is not toxic, but it can be problematic if taken in excess,' said the German Federal Office for Risk Assessment. 'It is essential to use fluoride toothpaste in moderation and to follow the recommended dosage,' added the AOK health insurance company. 'Fluoride is good for the teeth, but it can also have negative effects if not used properly,' said the CHIP health expert. 'It is crucial to use fluoride toothpaste in moderation and to follow the recommended dosage,' emphasized the AOK health insurance company.

**FDA moves to phase out ingestible fluoride tablets**
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to phase out ingestible fluoride supplements used to protect children's teeth. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear. The FDA aims to remove these supplements from the market by conducting a scientific review by late October. Fluoride tablets and lozenges are sometimes recommended for children and teens at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities due to low fluoride in their local drinking water.

**EPA to Review Health Risks of Water Fluoridation as RFK Jr. Says He'll Tell CDC to Stop Recommending It**
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to 'expeditiously review' new science on the possible health risks of water fluoridation. Meanwhile, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he plans to tell the CDC to stop recommending water fluoridation nationally. This comes after a federal judge ruled that water fluoridation at current levels poses an 'unreasonable risk' to children's health. The EPA is under a court order to regulate the chemical under the Toxic Substances Control Act, but Zeldin said the agency would conduct a review under the Safe Drinking Water Act instead. The CDC makes recommendations on whether communities should add fluoride to their drinking water, but the EPA sets the maximum levels allowed in water. The current maximum allowable levels of fluoride in drinking water are 4.0 milligrams/liter (mg/L), which is many orders of magnitude higher than the currently recommended dosage of 0.7 mg/L. Recent studies have shown significant associations between higher fluoride exposure and worse neurocognitive outcomes for children, including at the 0.7 mg/L levels. A meta-analysis published in January showed that fluoride exposure was associated with significant reductions in IQ scores in children. 'If EPA files the appeal, as it looks like they will, that will likely say more about EPA's true intentions with fluoride than a commitment to do another review,' said Michael Connett, lead attorney for the plaintiffs. 'The EPA's reviews of the fluoride literature in the past have been atrocious.'

**Opinion | Reexamining water fluoridation is not RFK Jr.'s craziest idea**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s call to stop recommending community water fluoridation has been met with criticism from medical and dental groups. However, emerging research suggests that the benefit-risk trade-off for fluoridation has changed. Studies have found that fluoride exposure has increased through other means, such as toothpaste and oral products, and that high levels of fluoride in drinking water may be associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral problems in children. The Environmental Protection Agency's limit for fluoride is set at 4 milligrams per liter, which is more than three times the level associated with harm. A reexamination of this limit is necessary, and the CDC should revise its recommendations to consider the complexities of the fluoride debate. This would involve alerting communities with high levels of fluoride in their tap water, advising against adding more fluoride, and urging the use of fluoride-containing toothpaste. A nuanced approach is necessary to reestablish trust in public health.

**RFK Jr. Says He Will Tell CDC to Stop Recommending Fluoride in Municipal Water**
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on April 7 that he will instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending fluoridation in municipal water nationwide. Kennedy also plans to reconvene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and make a new recommendation on fluoride. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing 'new scientific information' on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. Kennedy, an outspoken opponent of fluoride in water, praised Utah for banning it and hopes other states will follow. He claims that fluoride is an 'industrial waste' and 'dangerous neurotoxin' and that it can cause hyperthyroidism and osteoarthritis, among other conditions. The CDC's recommendations are generally followed, but state and local governments determine if their communities will add fluoride to water. It cannot surpass the maximum number established by the EPA, which is currently 4 milligrams per liter.

**RFK Jr. urges CDC to stop recommending fluoride in drinking water as EPA reviews health risks**
US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. The CDC's recommendations are not mandatory, but they are widely followed. Kennedy is assembling a task force of health experts to study the issue and make new recommendations. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also reviewing 'new scientific information' on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water last month, and Kennedy praised the state for being 'the leader in making America healthy again.' He hopes many more states will follow suit. The EPA sets the maximum level allowed in public water systems, currently at 4 milligrams per liter. Kennedy has called fluoride a 'dangerous neurotoxin' and has been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels. The CDC recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water, but over time, studies have documented potential problems, including streaking or spots on teeth and a link between excess fluoride and brain development.

**US Department of Health and Human Services to Reconsider Fluoride in Drinking Water**
The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will convene an independent panel of health experts to make a new recommendation on the addition of fluoride to drinking water, according to a spokesperson. The use of the mineral, added to water to strengthen tooth enamel and promote oral health, has been a politically contentious issue in some states for decades. 'The HHS is convening the Community Preventive Services Task Force again to study and make a new recommendation on fluoride,' said an HHS spokesperson. This comes after a report by the Associated Press citing HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. saying he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoride in drinking water. The US Environmental Protection Agency will also review new scientific information on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water in coordination with the HHS, a step towards deciding on standards for its inclusion, said Administrator Lee Zeldin at the same event, according to an EPA statement. Utah has become the first US state to ban the use of fluoride in public water systems after Governor Spencer Cox signed a law to that effect last month. The American Dental Association opposed the Utah law and continues to support community water fluoridation to help prevent tooth decay. The US Public Health Service recommends that fluoride levels in drinking water remain below 0.7 milligrams per liter. Levels above 1.5 mg/L, double the recommended limit, are known to increase health risks, such as bone fractures, thyroid diseases, and damage to the nervous system. The current EPA limit is 4.0 mg/L. In September 2024, a federal judge in California ordered the EPA to strengthen its regulations, saying the compound poses an irrational risk to children. Kennedy, who opposes adding fluoride to public water systems, said, in the absence of conclusive evidence, that fluoridation of water at US levels is associated with various health problems, including cancer. Approximately 63% of all Americans have fluoride in their community water systems, according to CDC statistics from 2022.

**US Health Department Will Make New Fluoride Recommendation**
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will reconvene an independent panel of health experts to make a new recommendation on adding fluoride to drinking water. This decision comes after Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending fluoride in drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will also review new scientific information on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. Currently, about 63% of Americans have fluoride in their community water systems, and the U.S. Public Health Service recommends that drinking water levels for fluoride remain below 0.7 milligram per liter. However, levels above 1.5 mg/L are known to increase health risks such as bone fractures, thyroid disease, and nervous system damage.

**Fluoride: Why Is It in Our Drinking Water, and Is It Safe for Children?**
The safety and effectiveness of fluoride in drinking water have been debated. Experts from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Dental Association, and Environmental Protection Agency weigh in on the topic. Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that occurs in all water sources and is also found in rocks, soil, and plants. It has been added to public water supplies since 1945 to prevent cavities and improve oral health. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named fluoridation of drinking water one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century. The optimal fluoride concentration in drinking water is 0.7 milligrams/liter, but the Environmental Protection Agency's primary drinking water regulation is 4.0 mg/L to prevent skeletal fluorosis. Studies have shown that widespread community water fluoridation prevents cavities and saves money, both for families and the healthcare system. The American Dental Association states that fluoride in drinking water is 'safe, effective, and healthy.' However, some studies have raised concerns about the potential link between fluoride exposure and cancer, particularly osteosarcoma. The National Toxicology Program found a moderate association between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in children, but this is almost double the recommended level. The CDC recommends that communities test their water daily and verify monthly to ensure the optimal level of 0.7 mg/L. If the fluoride level is too high, people should consider using bottled water or a reverse osmosis filter system. Reverse osmosis filters can reduce fluoride by up to 94%, but they may also remove beneficial minerals and generate wastewater. The EPA recommends selecting a WaterSense-labeled filter to ensure water efficiency. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that water fluoridation remains critically important in its Campaign for Dental Health, as tooth decay affects over 90% of Americans by adulthood. The AAP adds that fluoridated water is the most inexpensive method of providing fluoride, considering the per-person annual cost of fluoride rinse programs, fluoride supplements, and fluoride varnishes.

**Literally Everything You Need to Know About Fluoride in Our Drinking Water**
The US Department of Health and Human Services has nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the department, who has stated that he would work to remove fluoride from public water. However, the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have stated that fluoride is safe and effective in preventing cavities. The ADA notes that fluoride is a naturally occurring element found in water sources, rocks, and soil, and is also added to toothpaste and dental products. The CDC recommends an optimal fluoride concentration in drinking water of 0.7 milligrams/liter, which is considered safe and effective in preventing cavities. However, some studies have raised concerns about the potential link between high levels of fluoride and health problems such as osteosarcoma and skeletal fluorosis. The CDC notes that implementing water fluoridation is decided by state and local governments, and that communities can adjust their water fluoride levels to reach the optimal level of 0.7 milligrams/liter. The ADA also notes that well water can have high levels of fluoride, and that people can use commercial test kits or find out if any community programs in their area offer them. If drinking water contains less than 0.7 mg/L of fluoride, the CDC advises that people speak to their dentist and pediatrician to decide if their child could benefit from fluoride toothpaste, mouthwash, or supplements. For water that exceeds 2.0 mg/L of fluoride, the EPA recommends that children age 8 and under be given alternative drinking water sources. 'Reverse osmosis filters can reduce fluoride by up to 94%, depending on maintenance, including cleanliness of the filters and water pressure in the supply line,' Dr. Susan Fisher-Owens, MD, MPH, an expert on oral health and American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson, tells CNET in an email.
