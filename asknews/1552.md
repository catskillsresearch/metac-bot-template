**Turkey's Faith Map Revealed: Religious People in Decline!**
According to a recent study by Konda Research Company, the percentage of people in Turkey who identify as 'religious' has decreased from 55% in 2008 to 46% in 2024. On the other hand, the percentage of people who identify as 'atheist' or 'non-religious' has increased fourfold. The study also found a 3-point increase in the percentage of people who identify as 'believing but not practicing'. The percentage of people who identify as 'devout' or strictly adhering to religious rules remained unchanged. The study's findings suggest a shift in societal attitudes towards religion, particularly among younger generations, where there is a decline in prayer habits and an increase in individual and questioning forms of faith.

**So there is a Muslim immigration problem in Europe, yeah?**
According to Pew Research, Muslims account for approximately 6% of Europe's population as of 2024, and are projected to make up around 11-14% by 2050, even under high-migration scenarios. Fertility rates among Muslim immigrants are declining across generations, converging with national averages over time. The author argues that talk of 'Islamization' or a takeover lacks statistical basis and is often used to sensationalize the issue. 'It sells more to say so,' the author notes, implying that such rhetoric is often used for attention-grabbing purposes rather than being grounded in fact.

**Muslim population to decline in these countries by 2050; Hindus to..., Muslims in India...**
According to the Pew Research Center's study 'The Future of World Religions,' the global Muslim population is projected to rise from 23% of the world's population in 2010 to 30% in 2050. The Muslim population is estimated to be 1,599,700,000 in 2010 and is expected to reach 2,761,480,000 by 2050. However, the Muslim population in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to decline from 61.7% in 2010 to 52.8% in 2050.

**UNESCO Warns of 2.5 Billion People Living in Extreme Conditions by 2050**
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has warned that 2.5 billion people will live in extreme conditions by 2050. The study found that 239 million of them will live in extreme poverty, 'with no or few possibilities of overcoming their precarious socio-economic situation in increasingly threatening climate scenarios.' This highlights the need to protect the most vulnerable. The report, 'Who assumes the cost? How to address inequalities derived from climate change and climate action,' aims to put a spotlight on and address the 'deep social and economic inequalities' that have been 'aggravated' by climate change and introduced into current climate policies. The study's main author, Rodolfo Lacy, explained that the research presents a set of composite indices that evaluate how different sectors and populations will be affected in mid-century climate scenarios. The results show 'significant inequalities' in exposure to climate risks and adaptation capacity, particularly among marginalized groups and low-income households. The analysis indicates that the global south bears an 'unequal' burden of climate change, based on data such as 3.6 billion people living in highly vulnerable areas to climate change effects or 2.5 billion people exposed to extreme heat in 2050, of which 239 million in extreme poverty and with temperatures above 35 degrees for more than 12 weeks a year. According to the study, indigenous peoples, children, irregular workers, and women, of whom 1.4 billion will be directly affected between 2040 and 2060, suffer a 'higher risk.' Lacy argued, 'If equity and justice are not placed at the center of climate agendas, the grave risk of exacerbating current inequalities, undermining global stability, and hindering the shared goal of sustainable development will be taken.' UNESCO's Social Policy Director, Gustavo Merino, explained that the study proposes integrating equity, social justice, and human rights into climate policies to ensure a 'just and inclusive' transition. 'The first effects of global climate change disproportionately affect countries and communities that have barely contributed to the crisis but are extremely vulnerable to its effects,' Merino noted. The study found that the 10% of the richest countries are responsible for nearly 50% of global emissions, while the most vulnerable countries (Chad, South Sudan, Niger, Central African Republic, and Somalia) face complex crises of poverty, lack of infrastructure, and climate stress.

**Parisians Expected to Live More Alone in 2050**
According to the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee), Parisians are expected to live more alone in 2050. A new study by the Insee found that the number of households in the Île-de-France region is expected to decrease by 2,600 households per year on average, from 570,000 households in 2018 to 550,000 households in 2050. The percentage of single-person households is expected to increase from 52% in 2018 to 55% in 2050, while the percentage of couples is expected to decrease from 38% to 35%. The number of single-parent households is expected to remain stable at around 7.5%. The study attributes this trend to a combination of factors, including the decline of the Parisian population, aging, and changes in family structures and cohabitation patterns. As one Parisian said, 'Habiter seul c'est une dinguerie vraiment. Tu peux passer 8h sans dire un seul mot.' (Living alone is a crazy thing. You can spend 8 hours without saying a word.)

**Aging Without Care: WHO Reveals Stark Health Gaps in European Older Populations | Health**
A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) highlights the growing issue of unmet health and social care needs among older adults in the European Region. By 2050, over 35% of the population will be aged 60 or older, but many older Europeans are struggling to access affordable, timely, and quality care. The report found that catastrophic health expenditures affect more than 15% of families in some countries, and that unmet social care needs are widespread, with countries like Croatia and Estonia reporting figures above 50%. The WHO researchers used a two-pronged approach, including a systematic review of 30 peer-reviewed studies and analysis of data from two major population surveys. They identified four main barriers to accessing care: affordability, availability, accessibility, and acceptability. The report makes several recommendations to improve measurement and reduce unmet needs, including harmonization of survey methods, inclusion of social care indicators in global monitoring systems, and mixed-methods research that combines large-scale surveys with qualitative interviews. As Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO expert, said, 'The data shows that many older Europeans are slipping through the cracks, and we need to act now to address this issue.'

**UNAMA: 48% of Afghanistan’s population living below the poverty line**
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has reported that 48% of Afghanistan's population is living below the poverty line, with 22.9 million people requiring humanitarian assistance in 2025. The agency stated, 'These numbers are not just statistics. Our inability to mobilize adequate and timely funding to address these needs will have devastating consequences.' The humanitarian aid sector in Afghanistan is experiencing a severe funding shortfall, with only 12% of the $2.4 billion appeal for 2025 secured so far. The situation has been exacerbated by a decline in international support, including the United States' cut-off of foreign aid under the Trump administration.

**62% Americans identify as Christian; 'religiously unaffiliated' percentage rises: study**
A recent Pew Research Center survey of 37,000 Americans found that 62% identify as Christian, a slight increase from previous years. This marks a temporary leveling off of the decline in Christian identification, which had been steady since 2007. The current breakdown is 40% Protestant, 19% Catholic, and 3% Christian without specifying a denomination. The survey also found that all three major branches of Protestantism have declined in share of the population since 2007.

**Muslim population to surge by 1161780000 in 2050, Islam to become..., India will be...**
A new study by the Pew Research Center predicts that the global Muslim population will surge by 70% in the next 35 years, breaching the 3 billion mark by 2060. This will make Islam the dominant faith globally, surpassing Christianity as the world's largest religion. The study attributes this growth to a young population, high fertility rate, and religious conversion. According to the report, Muslim women have a fertility rate of 3.1, the highest among religious groups. In developing countries, the fertility rate is high and mortality rate is low, leading to rapid population growth. India's Muslim population is expected to increase to 19.4% by 2060, with an estimated 33 crore Muslims by 2050. The Christian population is expected to increase by 34%, while the Hindu population will grow by 27%, below the global average.

**US Population to Become Less Christian by 2070, Report Predicts**
According to a report by the Pew Research Center, the Christian population in the US will decline from 64% in 2020 to 46% by 2070, making them a minority. The report also predicts that the non-Christian population will increase to 41% and other religious groups will make up 13% of the population. The report suggests that the decline in Christian population is due to a switch in faith among 34% of people who were born into Christian families, with 3% converting to non-Christian faiths and 31% becoming unaffiliated. On the other hand, 21% of people who were unaffiliated will convert to Christianity by the age of 30. The report also takes into account factors such as migration, fertility rates, and mortality rates among different religious groups. As per the report, the US will have a diverse religious landscape by 2070, with no single religion dominating the population.

**Survey finds more people in the US identify as religiously unaffiliated**
A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that the percentage of Americans identifying as Christian has declined over the past few decades, from 78% in 2007 to 62% in 2024. However, this decline appears to have stabilized in recent years. The proportion of Americans who are religiously unaffiliated, often referred to as 'nones,' has risen, with 29% of Americans identifying as 'nones' in 2024, up from 16% in 2007. Younger Americans are more likely to be religiously unaffiliated, with 44% of those born in the 1990s and 43% of those born between 2000 and 2006 identifying as 'nones.' The study also found that the gap in religiosity between men and women is narrowing, and that political affiliations appear closely tied to religious identity.

**The US Christian population has declined for years. A new survey shows that drop leveling off**
A new survey from the Pew Research Center shows that the decline in the number of Americans identifying as Christian has slowed, with 62% of U.S. adults now calling themselves Christians, a significant dip from 2007 when 78% identified as Christian. The rapid rise of the religiously unaffiliated, or 'nones', has also reached a temporary plateau, with approximately 29% of U.S. adults identifying as religiously unaffiliated. Despite this widespread spirituality, there are harbingers of future religious decline, including a huge age gap, with 46% of the youngest American adults identifying as Christian, compared to 80% of the oldest adults. Gregory Smith, a co-author of the study, said, 'One thing we can't know for sure is whether these short-term signs of stabilization will prove to be a lasting change in the country's religious trajectory.'

**Christianity declines among U.S. adults while "religiously unaffiliated" grows, study says**
A new Pew Research study found that the percentage of U.S. adults identifying as Christian has declined significantly over the last two decades, but the trend may be leveling off. The study, which surveyed 37,000 Americans, found that 62% identify as Christian, down from 78% in 2007. The decline in Christianity has been most pronounced among younger adults, with nearly three in 10 people identifying as religiously unaffiliated. This trend is expected to continue as more people raised without religion have children. The study also found that the percentage of U.S. adults who identify as a religion other than Christian is on the rise, with 7% of the population identifying as a non-Christian religion. Additionally, the study revealed that women remain more religious than men, but the gender gap is narrowing among younger people.

**Christianity seeing rebound, but 'generational replacement' lags: Survey**
A recent survey by the Pew Research Center shows that the decline in people identifying as 'Christian' in the US may have leveled off in recent years, but people are still praying and attending religious services less than they used to. According to the 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study, 62% of US adults describe themselves as Christians, a relatively stable number since 2019. However, the survey also found that 29% of responders say they are religiously 'unaffiliated', and 35% of US adults have switched religions since childhood, leading to net gains for the 'unaffiliated' population and net losses for the 'Christian' population. The survey suggests that a decline in participation in religion could be seen in upcoming generations, with younger adults (ages 18-24) less likely to identify as Christian, pray daily, and attend religious services regularly. The research also notes that 'generational replacement' is a factor in the long-term trend, as older, highly religious generations pass away and are replaced by younger, less religious generations.

**< Christianity declines among U.S. adults while 'religiously unaffiliated' grows, study says**
A new Pew Research study found that the percentage of people in the U.S. who identify as Christian has declined significantly over the last 20 years, from 78% in 2007 to 62% in 2025. However, this trend may be leveling off. The study also found that the percentage of people who identify as 'religiously unaffiliated' has reached an all-time high of 29%, especially among younger people. Greg Smith, an author of the study, said that this is partly due to more people having no religion and raising children without a religious affiliation. The study also found that the numbers of people who identify as a religion other than Christian are on the rise, with Jews making up the largest minority at 2% of the population. Additionally, the study found that women remain more religious than men, but the gender gap is narrowing among younger people.

However, this trend may be leveling off. The study also found that nearly three in 10 people identify as religiously unaffiliated, which can mean atheist, agnostic, or no religion in particular. Younger adults who were raised in only nominally religious homes or outside of religion altogether are more likely to be unaffiliated than are older adults. According to Greg Smith, senior associate director of religion research at Pew, 'You have more and more people who have no religion having children, so you have more and more people who as children were raised with no religion and many of them grow up to be not particularly religious themselves.' The study also found that the percentage of U.S. adults who identify as a religion other than Christian is on the rise, with Jews making up 2% of the population, Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus each accounting for about 1% of the population. Additionally, the study revealed that women remain more religious than men by a number of measures, but the gender gap is narrowing among younger people.
