**Government steps in to deliver new reservoirs amid water supply concerns**
The UK Government has stepped in to take control of the planning process for two major new reservoirs in East Anglia and Lincolnshire, designating them as 'nationally significant' to improve water resources for over three quarters of a million homes. The move aims to streamline and fast-track the delivery of the two new reservoirs, which will provide up to 253 million litres of water per day. Water Minister Emma Hardy said, 'We are intervening in the national interest and slashing red tape to make the planning process faster to unblock nine new reservoirs.' The Government warns that without action to build new reservoirs, demand for drinking water could outstrip supply by the middle of the next decade. The two reservoirs, proposed by Anglian Water, are expected to be completed by 2036 and 2040, respectively, and will supply water to 250,000 and 500,000 homes. Water companies across England have committed to bringing nine new reservoirs online by 2050, which will supply an additional 670 million litres of water per day.

The UK Government has stepped in to take control of the planning process for two major new reservoirs in East Anglia and Lincolnshire, designating them as 'nationally significant' to improve water resources for over three quarters of a million homes. Environment Secretary Steve Reed aims to streamline and fast-track the delivery of the two new reservoirs, the first for more than 30 years, to address rapid population growth, crumbling assets, and a warming climate that threaten to outstrip drinking water supply by the middle of the next decade. Water Minister Emma Hardy said, 'We are intervening in the national interest and slashing red tape to make the planning process faster to unblock nine new reservoirs.' The two reservoirs are expected to be completed by 2036 and 2040, respectively, and will provide up to 253 million litres of water per day for over 750,000 homes.

**Government intervenes over new reservoirs amid water supply fears**
The UK government has intervened in the planning of two major reservoir projects in East Anglia and Lincolnshire to address growing concerns over the country's water supply. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has designated the projects as 'nationally significant,' allowing central government to take control and expedite their construction. The reservoirs, which will provide water for over 750,000 homes, are expected to be completed by 2036 and 2040. Water Minister Emma Hardy said, 'We are intervening in the national interest and slashing red tape to make the planning process faster to unblock nine new reservoirs.' Without new reservoirs, population growth, aging infrastructure, and climate change could cause drinking water demand to exceed supply by the mid-2030s. Water companies across England have committed to bringing nine new reservoirs online by 2050, which will supply an additional 670 million litres of water per day.

**UK's plan to build two major reservoirs after none built for 30 years**
The UK government plans to build two major reservoirs in England for the first time in 30 years to prevent water shortages. The projects in East Anglia and Lincolnshire have been awarded 'nationally significant' status, allowing Environment Secretary Steve Reed to take control of the planning process. The government hopes to speed up the planning process and begin construction sooner than previously estimated, which suggested the East Anglia project could start in 2030 and be operational by 2037, and the Lincolnshire project could start in 2031 and be operational by 2040. This comes as the Environment Agency warns of the risk of drought this summer without sustained rainfall, with millions of households potentially facing restrictions on water use.

**England 'could run out of drinking water within TEN YEARS'**
England's water minister, Emma Hardy, has warned that the country could run out of drinking water within the next 10 years without building new reservoirs. Hardy stated, 'We've been in an infrastructure crisis because we haven't built the reservoirs that we need. If we don't take action we are going to be running out of the drinking water that we need by the mid-2030s.' The government has designated two new reservoirs in East Anglia and Lincolnshire as 'nationally significant', allowing for central government control over the planning process. These reservoirs, proposed by Anglian Water, aim to supply up to 500,000 and 250,000 homes, respectively, and are expected to be completed by 2040 and 2036. Water companies across England have committed to bringing nine new reservoirs online by 2050, which could supply an additional 670 million litres of water per day.

**Manhattanhenge 2025: A Breathtaking Sunset Event in New York City**
Manhattanhenge 2025 will take place on May 28th and July 11th and 12th. The event occurs when the sunset aligns perfectly with the streets of Manhattan, creating a unique and breathtaking view. According to the American Museum of Natural History, the peak of the event will occur at 8:13 PM local time on May 28th, when the upper half of the Sun will align with the grid of Manhattan. However, the weather forecast is not promising, with expected cloudiness and rain. Nevertheless, there are other opportunities to see the event, including July 11th and 12th. The best locations to view Manhattanhenge include the American Museum of Natural History, where it is recommended to position oneself as far east as possible to maintain views of New Jersey across the Hudson River. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium, coined the term 'Manhattanhenge' in 2002, inspired by the alignment of the Sun with the stones of Stonehenge in England. Since then, the event has attracted thousands of people who come to capture the perfect image or simply enjoy the beauty of the Sun setting between the skyscrapers of Manhattan.

**Check dams, causeway across Kaundinya river in Vellore inaugurated**
The Minister for Water Resources, Duraimurugan, inaugurated two check dams and a causeway with vents across the Kaundinya river in Gudiyatham to prevent flooding during monsoon and provide access to key towns. The check dams, built at a cost of ₹25 crore, have a capacity of 2.51 mcft and can discharge 53,000 cusecs of floodwater. They will help irrigate 560 hectares of farmland and recharge 530 farmwells. The causeway, built at a cost of ₹8.41 crore, measures 104.2 metres in length and 2.7 metres in height, and can discharge 58,000 cusecs per minute of floodwater. Residents of Gudiyatham and adjoining villages have welcomed the new facilities, saying they will end their ordeal of taking a 20 km detour to reach nearby towns. As Assistant Engineer S. Kalipriyarn said, 'The check dams will help irrigate at least 560 hectares of farmlands in the region. Moreover, local bodies can sink borewells along the facilities to draw water for consumption.'

**Activists protest against water pollution across East of England**
Activists, including paddle-boarders, punters, and swimmers, held protests at various rivers and beaches across the East of England to raise awareness about sewage pollution. Mel Sambells, a protester, described the water as 'brown and disgusting' after a day of paddling. The demonstrations were organized by Surfers Against Sewage and took place on the River Cam in Cambridge, the River Deben in Suffolk, and beaches in Essex. Anglian Water apologized for nearly 44,000 sewage discharges in the region in 2024 and committed to spending £1bn to address overflow and spillage issues.

**A derelict device that could alleviate flooding**
A Victorian sluice gate, which has not been used for about 50 years, could be revived to keep roads open during flooding. The gate, located on Mill Lane in Little Paxton, Cambridgeshire, was used to divert water from the River Great Ouse to create an area for ice skaters in the past. According to local historian David Busby, the last time the river fully froze over was in 1929, and since then, the ice has not been strong enough to support skating. The sluice gate was manually operated by a local landowner until the 1970s, but it has been derelict since then. Cambridgeshire County Council is undertaking measures to improve recovery times at Mill Lane, which was closed four times last year due to flooding. As Liz Davis, a former curator at St Neots Museum, said, 'I don't know that the river has ever fully frozen over since the 1960s.'

**Lewes campaigners say sewage in River Ouse is 'a horror'**
Campaigners have described the amount of untreated sewage being pumped into the River Ouse in East Sussex as 'a horror'. According to Southern Water, the Ham Lane outfall near Lewes has had more hours of spills than any other storm overflow in the South East for three years running. Last year, it discharged for 4,824 hours, and in March 2025 alone, spills have lasted for nearly 600 hours, nearly 80% of the month. Southern Water claims the discharge was heavily diluted with groundwater that had entered the sewage network through joints in the pipework.

**Broads beauty spot revealed as Norfolk's sewage hotspot**
A stretch of the River Ant near How Hill, a popular beauty spot in Norfolk, has been revealed as the county's sewage hotspot, with 4,359 hours of 'spills' in 2024, equivalent to 180 days. The spills came from storm overflows, which dump untreated sewage into rivers and the sea. The number of spills in the Broads rose by 20% in 2024, with nearly 50 storm overflows releasing wastewater for 8,913 hours. A Broads Authority spokesman said, 'Given the sensitive location, we are disappointed to read these figures detailing excessive discharge into the River Ant and Bure.' Anglian Water has promised to spend £1bn to tackle spills as part of an £11bn package to improve its performance overall. A spokeswoman said, 'This is largely reflective of the extreme weather and persistent flooding we saw across our region in the first part of 2024, which accounted for nearly 50pc of our spills.' Liberal Democrat MP for North Norfolk, Steffan Aquarone, said, 'The latest figures clearly show how deep the sewage scandal goes, and I am disgusted that Anglian Water will be putting bills up once again in a week’s time.' Nationwide, nearly 4m hours of sewage were released, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed calling the figures 'disgraceful' and a 'stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas.'

**Why are there more than 80 flood alerts and flood warnings in place across England on Mother's Day despite glorious weather? - Manchester Evening News**
Despite the sunny weather on Mother's Day, there are over 80 flood alerts and warnings in place across England. The Environment Agency has issued 69 flood alerts and 16 flood warnings, mainly due to Spring Tides and tidal surges expected on Sunday evening. East Anglia is particularly affected, with a 'precautionary evacuation' alert issued for areas of the Norfolk Coast. In the North West, a flood alert is in place for the River Mersey in and around Warrington, with flooding possible at low-lying lands and roads from 1:30am on Monday. The Environment Agency advises avoiding low-lying footpaths and bridges near local watercourses and not to attempt to walk or drive through flood water. 'Flooding is possible at low lying lands and roads from 01:30 BST on 31/03/2025,' the alert states. 'Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water.'

**£300m Bedford and MK Waterways Park moves a step closer**
AECOM has been appointed to investigate the feasibility of building the £300m Bedford and Milton Keynes Waterway Park, a 26km waterway connecting the River Great Ouse in Bedford to the Grand Union Canal in Milton Keynes. The project, which has been planned for 30 years, aims to provide a new channel for water supply and drainage, improve biodiversity, water quality, and climate resilience, and offer new wildlife habitats and leisure activities. According to Simon Clewlow, chair of the Bedford and Milton Keynes Waterway Trust, the waterway will put 'water where its wanted' and provide significant strategic benefits, including mitigating flood risk and providing flood resilience. Clewlow added, 'At a more local level there will be environmental and wellbeing advantages as well as becoming an asset for recreation and tourism.'

**How creating a new Waveney-Ouse fen could reduce river flooding**
The towns of Diss, Bungay, Thetford, and Beccles, as well as the villages of Needham Mill, Brockdish, and Homersfield, have experienced flooding due to the River Waveney and Little Ouse. According to resilience forums for Suffolk and Norfolk, around 55,000 homes are at risk of flooding, with many threatened by sea flooding, but river flooding remains a threat to thousands of properties, roads, and businesses. Christine Mackenzie, chair of Brockdish Parish Council, recognizes the increasing risk of flooding, citing the 2020 flood that affected over 20 houses in the village. Retired town planner Derek Clarke, who moved to Brockdish 11 years ago, was surprised when his house flooded in 2020, causing 'a lot of panic'. 'We are going to get more flooding and we are going to need this capacity - the meadow knows how to do that - if we give it the conditions to hold the water back here,' said an expert, highlighting the potential for a new Waveney-Ouse fen to reduce river flooding.

**North Humber to High Marnham Power Line: Latest Consultation Updates and What They Mean for You**
National Grid has proposed a 56-mile (90-kilometer) high-voltage power line to transport energy from North Sea wind farms to the national grid. The project aims to balance renewable progress with historic landscape preservation. The revised route will run southwest from Cottingham to the River Ouse near Whitgift, then south across the Isle of Axholme, west of the River Trent. National Grid claims its latest proposals incorporate feedback from previous consultations, increasing the distance of the line from Skidby and Bentley in East Yorkshire and rerouting it further from Ellerker near South Cave. The project highlights the tension between renewable energy infrastructure and natural and historic landscapes. The upcoming consultations will determine the final route and address local concerns. If approved, the line will be operational in 2031.
