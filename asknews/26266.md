**Belarus to Involve 415,000 Hectares of Land in Agricultural Circulation after Melioration**
According to Sergey Nazaruk, the head of the department of melioration and radiology at the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of Belarus, the current five-year program will help to involve around 415,000 hectares of land in agricultural circulation after melioration. This includes 240,000 hectares after the reconstruction of meliorative systems and 175,000 hectares after the implementation of cultural-technical melioration. The changing climate has led to an increase in cases of water deficiency in the soil, requiring the activation of works to restore the effective use of drainage and irrigation systems, as well as the implementation of measures to accumulate water reserves and targeted use of reservoirs. Nazaruk noted that the main task for meliorators now is to maximize the service life of systems. Belarus has achieved certain successes in meliorative construction. In the 90s, from 1995 to 2000, measures were taken to correct the situation, and from 2000 to 2020, four five-year programs were implemented in this area. Nazaruk emphasized that work continues in this direction, and today, within the framework of the sub-program 'Development of melioration of agricultural land' of the state program 'Agricultural Business', the implementation of the current five-year program (2021-2025) will contribute to the involvement of around 415,000 hectares of land in agricultural circulation after melioration, including 240,000 hectares after the reconstruction of meliorative systems and 175,000 hectares after the implementation of cultural-technical melioration.

**New Dyson product does 'what others can't'**
Dyson has unveiled the 'world's slimmest vacuum', the PencilVac, which measures 38mm in diameter and features a conical brush cleaner head that 'ejects hair' for easy disposal. According to James Dyson, the device was created to 'go where others can't' and solves the problem of hair wrapping around the brush bar. The PencilVac's new 'fluffycones' cleaner head features four rotating cones that easily eject long hair and clean in all directions. The device also features a redeveloped Hyperdymium 140k motor, which is teeny weeny at 28mm, and provides top-notch suction. The dirt is stored in the vacuum's thin handle, and a new 'hygienic syringe bin ejection system' is used to dump dirt deep into the bin. The battery will last about 30 minutes, but will take about 4 hours to fully charge. The PencilVac is set to be priced at about $949 and is ideal for urban dwellers with limited space, busy households that need frequent spot cleaning, and anyone who values design-led, functional tools.

**Lugano's Congress Center: A 2040 Deadline May Be Optimistic**
The completion of the new congress center at Campo Marzio in Lugano may be further away than expected. According to a sign in front of the Palazzo dei Congressi, the project is scheduled to be completed in 15 years, by 2040. However, given the city's history of delays, such as the tram-train project, it is possible that the completion date will be pushed back even further. This raises concerns about the project's timeline, especially considering that it has been discussed for a long time but has yet to move beyond the planning phase. As one might say, 'the future is not what it used to be'.

**Italians Seek Cleanliness, but Struggle with Old Habits**
A study by Dyson found that Italians are looking for cleanliness, but are often trapped by old habits. According to the study, 82% of Italians prefer traditional methods for cleaning floors, which leads to a double operation during the cleaning process. However, these traditional methods are not effective in providing a deep clean. Dyson's solution, the WashG1, is a device that cleans dust and dirt like a vacuum cleaner and allows floors to dry 80% faster than using a mop. It also contains 250 billion probiotic microorganisms that continue to break down organic dirt even after use. When used with the WashG1, the probiotics remain on the rollers, floors, and inside the machine even after a self-cleaning cycle, providing a longer-lasting clean. Matthew Lee of Dyson said, 'Based on 20 years of research on microscopic dust, our results confirm that vacuuming is the most effective way to tackle household dust. However, for stubborn stains, liquids are essential to 'rehydrate' them and facilitate their removal.'

**Anthropic CEO says AI will kill half of white collar entry-level jobs for Gen Z**
According to Anthropic's CEO, AI will replace humans for most white-collar entry-level jobs for Gen Z, with a 50% chance of job loss. This prediction is in line with Bill Gates', who believes AI will replace humans in 20 years. Gates emphasizes the importance of being honest about the impact of AI, stating, 'We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming.' OpenAI, on the other hand, does not believe that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a significant threat. However, AI is already affecting entry-level jobs, and it will be interesting to see how generative AI impacts the job market in the long term.

**Humanity's infinite energy solution might be in space**
Physicist Freeman Dyson first proposed the concept of a Dyson sphere in 1960, a megastructure designed to capture the full energy output of a star. While a solid sphere is physically impossible, a Dyson swarm, made up of millions of solar-collecting satellites, is a more realistic version. This would allow humanity to harness a significant portion of the Sun's energy, providing constant, clean, and abundant power. This would be revolutionary for climate and sustainability, as well as for technology, enabling the training of advanced AI and the support of technologies that are currently unimaginable. A Dyson swarm would also provide power for space-based industry, mining operations on asteroids, and permanent settlements beyond Earth. While we are not yet ready to build it, we are starting to develop the technologies that will make it possible, including space-based solar power, robotics, and lightweight materials.

**New Study Suggests Dyson Spheres May Self-Destruct, Making Them Invisible to Us**
A new study by Brian C. Lacki from the University of Oxford suggests that Dyson spheres, hypothetical megastructures that could be built by advanced civilizations to harness the energy of a star, may not be detectable because they could self-destruct after a relatively short period of time. The study focuses on 'Megaswarms', swarms of millions of satellites in various orbits around a star, which are considered a realistic model for Dyson spheres. However, the large number of these orbital components leads to a problem: without continuous control, they become chaotic, collide, and trigger a chain reaction of debris. According to Lacki's calculations, an uncontrolled satellite field is destroyed in a short time, sometimes within a few years. Even optimized swarms with ordered orbits and synchronized inclinations could only last for a few million years without active management. Jason Wright, an astronomer from Pennsylvania State University, is quoted as saying: 'You can't place so much material around a star without it eventually colliding and self-destructing - unless each individual part actively follows the orbit rules.' This means that even if Dyson spheres were built, they would be hardly visible to us - unless they are actively in use. This contradicts a common hope in the SETI research that such structures could exist and remain visible even after the disappearance of their creators. Lacki's study provides a physically grounded counterargument: without continuous navigation, such as solar sails or automatic orbit control, Dyson spheres would decay into dust in a relatively short time.

**The Fragility of Dyson Spheres: A New Study Reveals the Catastrophic Consequences of Advanced Civilizations**
Physicist Freeman Dyson proposed the idea of a Dyson sphere in the 1960s, a massive structure that could be built around a star to collect its energy. However, a new study suggests that such a structure would be prone to catastrophic collisions, known as the Kessler syndrome, which would lead to its rapid destruction. Brian Lackey's calculations show that even a small number of large objects or a dense swarm of smaller objects would collide and destroy each other in a matter of hours or days. The only way for a Dyson sphere to exist for a long time would be for an advanced civilization to actively manage and control each element of the swarm. Jason Wright from the University of Pennsylvania notes that this would be a challenging task, but not impossible. The study also suggests that even if a civilization were to build a Dyson sphere, it would likely be visible only as long as the civilization is actively maintaining it, and would disappear once the civilization is gone. This challenges the idea that a Dyson sphere could be a long-lasting relic of an advanced civilization. 'It's a sobering reminder that any large-scale intervention in complex systems, whether it's our near-Earth space or an entire star system, can have unforeseen and potentially catastrophic consequences,' says Lackey. 'This study doesn't rule out the possibility of finding evidence of advanced civilizations, but it does suggest that we should be looking for other signs of life, such as radio signals or atmospheric pollution.'

**Why is building safety litigation on the rise?**
The construction sector has seen a significant increase in building safety litigation following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. Legal claims for cladding and fire safety losses have exceeded £640m in total value, with a recent influx of fire safety related applications in the Property Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal (FTT). The Building Safety Act 2022 (BSA) has introduced sweeping legal and regulatory changes, including a retrospective extension of the limitation periods for claims pursued under the Defective Premises Act 1972 (DPA), allowing claims to be commenced up to 30 years from the date the right of action accrued. The BSA has also introduced new duties and liabilities, alongside groundbreaking new remedies that can give rise to significant liability orders against professionals. Chloe Derrick, a partner at law firm Stewarts, notes that the FTT now has unfettered discretion to issue Remediation Orders against landlords, which requires them to remediate defective buildings. According to government estimates, there are thousands of buildings awaiting fire safety remediation works, or where 'unsafe' cladding is yet to be identified. The government has published a Remediation Acceleration Plan, which requires certain works or steps to have been taken on high-rise and tall buildings by the end of 2029, with landlords placed under threat of 'severe penalties' if they do not comply. Businesses with multiple high-risk buildings should carefully consider their policy wording and any arguments raised by insurers to extinguish or reduce cover, and may be able to obtain multiple limits of indemnity under different policy years.

**Dyson Swarm: A Double-Edged Sword for Humanity's Energy Needs**
A new study has found that building a Dyson Swarm around the Sun could provide a massive amount of energy for humanity, but potentially make the Earth uninhabitable. A Dyson Swarm is a 'theoretical megastructure composed of numerous satellites that surround a star to maximize solar energy collection.' This concept, proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, is an alternative to the rigid Dyson Sphere. The advantage of a swarm is its ability to be built gradually in response to growing energy needs of civilization. Successful implementation of such a project would bring humanity to the level of a Type II civilization on the Kardashev scale. The Kardashev scale classifies civilizations by their ability to use energy. A Type II civilization is able to control and use a significant portion of its star's energy. Current humanity is approximately at 0.7 on this scale, far from being able to build a Dyson Swarm. The satellites in the Dyson Swarm would use photovoltaic technologies to convert solar radiation into useful energy. However, regulating the temperature of such structures is a serious technical problem. Unlike solar panels on Earth, space satellites cannot dissipate excess heat through the atmosphere. Jan Marius Peters from the Helmholtz Institute for Renewable Energy Research conducted a study that examines the possibility of building a Dyson Swarm using materials available in our Solar System. His calculations showed that small structures in Earth's orbit are inefficient. They either overheat or block too much sunlight necessary for our planet. A larger Dyson Swarm, although it collects energy efficiently, could catastrophically impact the Earth's climate. A fully developed swarm located outside Earth's orbit could potentially raise the planet's temperature by 140 Kelvin. Such a change would make our planet completely uninhabitable. The study proposes a potential compromise. Placing the Dyson Swarm at a distance of 2.13 astronomical units from the Sun could provide significant energy benefits with minimal impact on Earth. Such a configuration can capture about 4% of the energy of our star, equivalent to 15.6 yottawatts of energy. The climatic impact of such a partial swarm would be relatively moderate. The Earth's temperature would rise by less than 3 Kelvin, comparable to current global warming trends. However, even this partial structure requires enormous resources for construction. According to calculations, 1.3 x 10^23 kilograms of silicon would be needed to build such a swarm. This is an incredibly large amount of material, the extraction of which is a separate problem. The most likely source of such resources could be asteroids and other celestial bodies of the Solar System. The concept of a Dyson Swarm highlights the fundamental dilemma of technological development. On the one hand, growing energy needs stimulate the search for more powerful sources. On the other hand, large-scale interventions in natural systems can have unpredictable consequences. A Dyson Swarm remains a theoretical concept. The current technological level of humanity is far from being able to implement such a grand project. However, studying its potential consequences is crucial for understanding the relationship between technological progress and ecological stability. Perhaps the most important lesson of this study is the need for a comprehensive approach to large-scale engineering projects. Finding a balance between energy needs and preserving a habitable environment remains a critical challenge for the future development of humanity.

**Dyson Swarm: A Megastructure to Harness Solar Energy, but at What Cost?**
Scientists believe that humanity may create a megastructure to collect a large amount of energy from the Sun in space, but it must avoid catastrophic consequences for our planet. According to the Kardashev scale, which divides civilizations in the universe by their technological development and energy consumption level, humanity has not yet reached the level of a Type I civilization, which can use all the energy of its planet. Type II civilizations can use almost all the energy of their star using megastructures like the Dyson swarm or the Dyson sphere. However, the Dyson sphere is considered less realistic for humanity, as it requires creating a solid structure around the Sun that would collect the maximum amount of energy from our star. Therefore, some scientists consider the gradual construction of a Dyson swarm, consisting of numerous satellites that convert solar energy into electrical energy, a more realistic project. Such structures would likely rely on photovoltaic technology to convert solar radiation into useful energy. However, temperature regulation is a serious problem. Unlike solar panels on Earth, which can dissipate excess heat using atmospheric cooling, Dyson swarm satellites must balance heat exchange between the Sun, space, and their large surface. Maintaining an optimal temperature system is crucial for ensuring efficient energy conversion, scientists say. Researchers have studied the potential consequences of such a structure for our planet. According to the study, a Dyson swarm located on Earth's orbit can increase the temperature of our planet by 120 degrees Celsius, making it uninhabitable. Scientists have also studied how to build such a megastructure using materials available in the Solar System, without harming the planet and all living organisms on it. The study showed that a small Dyson swarm located on Earth's orbit would be inefficient, as satellites would either overheat or block too much sunlight reaching our planet. On the other hand, a large-scale Dyson swarm, although efficient in collecting solar energy, would sharply increase the temperature on Earth, leading to mass extinction. Scientists believe that the Dyson swarm should be placed at a distance of over 300 million km from the Sun, approximately twice the distance from Earth to our star. Such a structure could collect approximately 4% of the Sun's energy or approximately 15.6 yottawatts (one yottawatt is 10 to the power of 24 watts). At the same time, the temperature on Earth would increase by no more than 3 degrees Celsius, comparable to current global warming trends. However, creating such a structure would require approximately 1.3 x 10^23 kg of silicon.

**Solar structure Dyson swarm could overheat Earth, kill all life: Study**
A recent study has explored the potential consequences of constructing a Dyson swarm, a megastructure designed to maximize energy collection from a star, within our solar system. According to the research, a fully developed Dyson swarm positioned beyond Earth's orbit could elevate the planet's temperature by 140 Kelvin, making it uninhabitable. This idea, first introduced by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, consists of numerous satellites that can be constructed incrementally as energy demands grow. If implemented, it would mark a significant leap in technological progress, potentially classifying the civilization as a Type II civilization on the Kardashev scale.

**Dyson Sphere Feasibility Study: A Step Towards Harnessing Solar Energy**
Scientists have calculated the feasibility of building a Dyson sphere, a hypothetical structure that could collect energy from the Sun for human use. The study, led by Ian Marius Peters from the Helmholtz Institute for Renewable Energy in Erlangen-Nuremberg, found that a partial Dyson sphere with a coverage of 22% at a distance of 2.13 astronomical units from the Sun could provide 4% of the Sun's energy while keeping the Earth's temperature rise below 3K. This would require 1.3 × 10²³ kg of silicon, a massive amount but within the bounds of the Sun's system reserves. Peters noted that a partial structure, or 'Dyson swarm', would be easier to build than a solid sphere and could be constructed gradually as components are manufactured. Freeman Dyson, who first proposed the idea of an energy-collecting 'Dyson shell' in 1937, said that the concept was inspired by Olaf Stapledon's novel 'Star Maker'. However, similar ideas were proposed by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky earlier. Peters' calculations showed that a small Dyson sphere within Earth's orbit would be impractical due to overheating and blocking sunlight, which would lead to the extinction of life on Earth. 'It's not a crazy idea,' Peters said, 'but it's not a simple one either.'

**4% of the Sun's Energy for 3 Degrees of Warming: Scientists Find a Compromise for the 'Dyson Sphere'**
Scientists from the Helmholtz Institute in Germany have modeled the consequences of building a Dyson sphere, a massive structure that would collect energy from the Sun. Their calculations show that a full-scale Dyson sphere outside the Earth's orbit would increase the planet's temperature to 140 degrees, making it uninhabitable. However, researchers have found a possible compromise - a 'moderate' variant of the system that would allow for the collection of astronomical amounts of energy without destroying the ecosystem. This concept, proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, involves launching millions of compact satellites with solar panels, which can be gradually expanded like global satellite constellations, but with a fundamentally different goal. Each element of the swarm would intercept solar radiation, converting it into energy for interplanetary bases or direct transmission to Earth. The problem is that the more satellites, the stronger their impact on the planet's thermal balance. Part of the energy that was previously absorbed by the Earth or dispersed into space would be 'trapped' by the system, amplifying the greenhouse effect - as if the planet were wrapped in aluminum foil. The work of Jan Marius Peters first quantitatively evaluated these risks. It turned out that even a partial swarm, located 2.13 times farther from the Sun than the Earth, could collect 4% of the star's energy - 15.6 iottawatts, which is trillions of times more than humanity's current consumption. However, this would require 130 billion tons of silicon - equivalent to the mass of 200 million average asteroids. Such a system would raise the Earth's temperature by only 3 degrees, comparable to climate change predictions by the end of the century. A full-scale swarm would turn the planet into a Venus-like environment with a temperature of +180°C. This is not just an engineering issue, but a dilemma of energy security. As with the transition to electric cars, where we reduce emissions but face the problem of lithium extraction, here the key is finding a balance between ambitions and preserving the environment. 'It's not just a question of engineering, but a question of energy security,' emphasizes Peters. While the Dyson sphere remains a theory, its ideas are already stimulating discussions about the future of energy. For example, Japan and China are experimenting with orbital solar power stations, and NASA is developing technologies for asteroid resource extraction. If humanity reaches the second level on the Kardashev scale - civilizations using the energy of a star - such systems will become necessary. However, the study clearly shows that any step in this direction will require super-accurate climate modeling. Perhaps instead of monolithic megastructures, the future lies in adaptive satellite networks that not only collect energy but also regulate heat exchange, a kind of thermostat for the Solar System. For now, this work is a reminder that even in space, ecology does not tolerate haste.'

**What is a Dyson Sphere and How Could It Power Civilization?**
A Dyson Sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that would enclose a star to capture almost all of its energy output, providing an almost limitless energy supply. Originally suggested by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, the idea is to surround a star with energy-collecting satellites or a giant shell. While the complete sphere variant is a science fiction fantasy, more realistic variants such as the Dyson Swarm (a system of energy-gathering satellites) are thought to be feasible with future technology. A Dyson Swarm is made up of millions of satellites around the star, each gathering and sending energy back to a planet or space station. Although a Dyson Swarm has been deemed doable within the next few hundred years, its construction is beset with severe difficulties, including technological and economic hurdles. However, numerous scientists believe that a Dyson Swarm might be within reach in a few hundred years, a giant leap towards interstellar colonization.

**The Minister said the NHS could use Dyson fans to help marketing companies, said Covid Inquiry | Covid investigation**
A minister, Lord Agnew, warned a senior official that fans should be bought from Sir James Dyson so that he could market them internationally as being used in British hospitals, according to the Covid Inquiry. The investigation heard that Dyson received a provisional prescription for 10,000 of his fan prototype, called Covent, at the beginning of 2020, after responding to a call from Boris Johnson. Dyson's company was not referred to the VIP route and did not provide EPI. A Dyson spokesman said that Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from the Prime Minister to develop and make a medical quality fan in 30 days during the national emergency. Dyson had no intention of making for-profit fans and spent 450 commercial projects engineers on the project. The British government canceled the order it had placed and none was sold abroad. Dyson has not looked for any payment for the 20 meters that the company spent on the project, it was its contribution to the national effort to save lives. The investigation also rejected a request from Michelle Mone and her husband, Doug Barrowman, for basic status as participants in the investigation, citing a 468-day deadline for the request.
