**Biotech and AI: Is Trump shooting in America's tech foot? China surging ahead of US**
Despite President Trump's efforts to boost American dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) and biotechnology, recent policy moves risk undermining US leadership as China surges ahead. The US has imposed restrictions on the export of critical chip design software and advanced semiconductors to China, but this has prompted China to accelerate its domestic innovation efforts, including the development of home-grown AI chips and large language models. Meanwhile, US funding cuts and freezes for biomedical research are raising alarms among experts, who warn that this could stifle early-stage biotech innovation and allow China to set the pace in life sciences. China has passed the US in the number of clinical trials and is rapidly becoming a linchpin in global drug development, licensing new discoveries to American companies and leveraging a decade-long national strategy to dominate biopharma. US-based venture capitalists are responding by investing in Chinese biotech and reorienting their business strategies around it. The US risks 'shooting itself in the tech foot' by tightening controls and reducing public investment, potentially ceding ground to China in both biotech and AI at a critical moment in the global innovation race.

**The 'Magical' Australian Forest that Shines in the Dark**
A 'magical' Australian forest that shines in the dark has been attracting tourists and scientists with its rare and fascinating natural spectacle. When the sun sets, small points of light appear on the ground and trunks, creating an ethereal scene that looks like it's from a fantasy movie. This natural glow is caused by living organisms, such as fungi, that emit light through a chemical process called bioluminescence. The phenomenon not only showcases its unique beauty but also represents a rich opportunity for science and ecotourism. The bioluminescence occurs when certain substances present in the organisms react with each other and produce light. In the case of the fungi found in this forest, this luminous emission serves to attract insects or facilitate the decomposition of organic matter. 'This type of tourism, known as mycotourism, values the fungi and the environment where they live,' said a scientist. The experience also promotes environmental awareness, encouraging respect for nature and the importance of its preservation. Scientists are also interested in the phenomenon and study the organisms that produce light to better understand their structure and potential applications. The bioluminescence is already being investigated in areas such as medicine, biotechnology, and sustainability. The forest has become a natural laboratory, where discoveries made there can lead to technological advances, such as the development of ecological sensors and non-polluting light sources. However, with the increasing popularity of the site, concerns have arisen about the environmental impact of tourism. It is essential to establish limits and good practices to avoid harming the habitat of the fungi and other species that live in the forest. The protection of the ecosystem also involves local communities and indigenous peoples, who possess valuable knowledge about the region. The union between science and traditional knowledge can strengthen conservation strategies and ensure that the place continues to enchant and teach.

**Gain of Fiction: How COVID Origins Motivated Defunding of U.S. Science | Think Global Health**
The US is experiencing a significant decline in scientific research due to the Trump administration's defunding of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation. This comes as a bipartisan commission warns that China has caught up to the US in biotechnology, an industry that will power jobs, manufacturing, medicine, and national security in the 21st century. The funding cuts are largely due to a fictional, conspiratorial worldview that blames the US scientific enterprise for the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. President Trump, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Special Government Employee Elon Musk have alleged without evidence that an NIH subcontract to China's Wuhan Institute of Virology led to the virus leaking from a lab. However, considerable evidence points to a natural spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to people via a live animal market. The Trump administration has issued an executive order to ban 'dangerous gain-of-function research' in the US and in foreign labs supported by US partnerships. This ban replaces guidance developed under President Joe Biden and could be used to stop a high school biology class. The order's definitions are unworkable and potentially applicable to a wide range of laboratory activities, including vaccine and monoclonal antibody development. The US scientists have a strict safety and security regime for work on dangerous viruses and don't oppose oversight, but it is essential to have a system that allows work to continue to understand, prevent, and defeat viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 or the flu. Without science, the US won't be ready for the next serious health or national security crisis, and the American people—and the world—will pay the price.

**The U.S. Can't Afford to Lose the Biotech Race with China**
The U.S. is at risk of losing its position as the global leader in biotechnology to China, similar to what happened with semiconductors a generation ago. American innovation brought about the semiconductor revolution, but the U.S. share of global semiconductor production has declined from nearly 40% in 1990 to less than 10% today. China has been investing heavily in its chip industry and is expected to capture nearly 25% of the worldwide chip manufacturing market by 2030, according to TIME magazine. 'The U.S. cannot afford to cede another critical industry to China,' TIME warns, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in biotechnology.

**The Only Successful 'De-Extinction' is Spanish: Expert Rejects Warg Claims**
Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology startup, has recreated the extinct species of the warg, a type of wolf that was featured in the popular TV show Game of Thrones. However, according to expert Alberto Fernández-Arias, the recreated wargs are not exact genetic copies of the original individuals, but rather a restoration of lost ecological functions and an increase in biodiversity. This suggests that the process of 'de-extinction' was not fully achieved. The only time a species has been fully brought back to life was in 2003, when the University of Zaragoza successfully cloned a bucardo, a subspecies of the mountain goat that had gone extinct. The bucardo was cloned using the technique of nuclear transfer, which involves inserting the nucleus of a cell from the original animal into an egg cell that has had its genetic material removed. This process created a biological identical copy of the extinct species. In contrast, Colossal Biosciences used genetic engineering techniques to recreate the wargs. Fernández-Arias explains that the difference between the two processes is that the University of Zaragoza used a process of cellular cloning and assisted reproduction, while Colossal Biosciences used genetic engineering. 'It is possible thanks to bioengineering techniques that allow us to manipulate DNA and genomes, or the genetic material of an organism,' Colossal explains on its official website. The biotechnology used to create mammalian substitutes includes retro-crossing, cloning, and genetic editing. 'The recovered DNA, whether from the Pleistocene or the 20th century, makes de-extinction a reality,' Colossal adds. 'The desextinction can work in the following ways:

**Iran on the Brink: A Potential War with the US and Israel**
The situation on the Middle East is nearing a critical point, with ongoing conflicts in Syria, Turkey, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. The 'Iranian question' is a concern for the US administration, with some sources suggesting that Washington and Tel Aviv are planning a massive strike against Tehran. If this happens, the region will be plunged into chaos, according to some analysts. A senior official in the White House has stated that the US plans to complete a military operation in Iran by the fall, if Tehran does not begin dismantling its nuclear program. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has warned that 'war with Iran is almost inevitable' if a nuclear deal is not reached soon. Israel, which has been given a free hand by Trump, is adding fuel to the fire. Iran's military has reportedly warned potential opponents that it will retaliate with a pre-emptive strike against a joint US-British base in the Chagos Islands if necessary. This would be an attempt to keep Trump from launching a military attack on Iran. The US is seriously considering nuclear talks with Iran, according to Axios. For Russia, which has Iran as its main strategic partner in the region, a war between its ally and the West would be a 'catastrophic' event. Russia has warned that such a conflict would lead to 'irreversible catastrophe', according to The Sun. Political analyst Dmitry Rodionov believes that the situation is on the brink of disaster, with Iran's well-developed system of bunkers making it difficult for the US to inflict significant damage. Rodionov warns that Iran could retaliate with a serious attack, potentially reaching as far as the US base in San Diego. He also believes that a war would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy, including a sharp increase in oil prices and a global financial crisis. This would be a 'true Ragnarök', a scenario in which the world is plunged into chaos and destruction. Rodionov is skeptical about Trump's willingness to risk such a conflict, but believes that it is a real possibility. 'This will be a test not only for the US, but for the whole world, which will face serious shocks in politics and economics. It's hard to imagine that Trump or his team, which advocates for war, are so confident. It's unclear if they are willing to take the risk. In the current circumstances, this war will drain the US of all its strength,' Rodionov said. 'It's possible that Trump will become the one who organizes Ragnarök.'

**Building a Sustainable Food Future: Safeguarding Nutrition and Safety for Generations to Come**
The demand for healthier, nutritious, and sustainable food has increased significantly in the last five years. However, global food security faces numerous challenges that threaten the ability of populations to access sustainable, safe, and nutritious food. To solve these challenges, multifaceted solutions involving policy changes, technological innovations, and community engagement are needed. Some of the technologies being developed include bio-engineering, non-thermal processing, and the use of artificial intelligence during the food production process. However, there is still a significant ethical issue surrounding the long-term safety of genetically engineered foods and other biologically modified processes. Critics argue that insufficient testing and regulatory oversight may expose consumers to risks that are not yet fully understood. The use of beneficial microorganisms through biotechnology can enhance nutrient availability, promote plant growth, and improve soil structure. Blockchain technology can also enhance transparency and improve efficiency in the food supply chain, enabling tracking of food quality and safety throughout the value chain. 'A typical domino effect' is seen in the reduction of pesticide use, which benefits both the environment and human health, contributing to safer food production. 'The demand for transparency in food labeling reflects public concerns about biotechnology. Many consumers advocate for clear labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to make informed choices based on personal beliefs and preferences.' However, there is a tension between providing information and potentially stigmatizing biotech products, which can affect consumer trust and acceptance.

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.

**Debunking Common Myths About Biotechnology**
Biotechnology is often misunderstood, with many people associating it with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or thinking it's something out of a sci-fi movie. However, biotechnology is a multidisciplinary field that plays a crucial role in medicine, environmental science, and industrial applications. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and FDA, GMOs are just as safe as non-GMO foods and have the potential to improve global food security and nutrition. Biotechnology has existed for centuries, evolving from traditional practices to advanced scientific breakthroughs, and offers diverse career opportunities beyond lab work. By debunking common myths, we can foster a more informed perspective on how biotech is improving medicine, agriculture, and sustainability.

**Have We Gone Too Far? The Question of Our Time**
The world is on the cusp of a 'scientific and technological revolution' that could fundamentally change our understanding of existence and humanity. We have 'collected information, analyzed data, and broken down barriers' that have been in place for centuries, but the question remains: have we gone too far? Have we acquired too much knowledge that could disrupt the very nature of life? With the rapid progress of technology, are we on the verge of a 'giant scientific leap' that will redefine our understanding of existence, or are we at a crossroads where absolute knowledge may pose challenges that exceed our ability to control them? The amount of data produced globally has reached 149 zettabytes by the end of 2024, equivalent to 149 trillion gigabytes, which is beyond human comprehension. If we assume that each gigabyte represents a digital book, this amount of data would cover the earth in layers of books, raising another question: are we on the brink of a 'knowledge overload' that will redefine our relationship with reality and existence? We are no longer content with observing nature and understanding its laws, but are now capable of 're-shaping it' with technologies like CRISPR, which has gone beyond being a tool for genetic analysis to become a 'genetic scalpel' that enables us to 'edit DNA, redirect the course of evolution, correct genetic defects, and even improve the characteristics of living organisms.' However, the most pressing question is not whether we can 'edit, modify, and write genetic code,' but whether we should do so without controls. How do we set boundaries for tampering with life? Who has the authority to decide what is 'improvement' and what is 'destruction'? Are we qualified enough to play the role of the creator in re-shaping what nature has created over billions of years? Biotechnology today is 'not just a tool for reading and analyzing,' but a 'transformative power' that exceeds our ability to comprehend its future consequences. Just like artificial intelligence, genetic engineering is a rapidly growing field, supported by a global assembly of brilliant minds, accelerating the pace of innovation and available capabilities at an unprecedented rate. However, with all this progress, we face a murky landscape of 'possibilities and risks.' Our ability to manipulate DNA and 're-program life itself' gives us immense possibilities for addressing genetic diseases, producing more sustainable food, and designing innovative materials with properties that were not previously available. But it also opens the door to unpredictable consequences, from unintended extinction of natural species to the emergence of modified organisms with unforeseen impacts on the ecosystem. 'Have we gone too far?' Perhaps. We are at a critical point in history where we have enough knowledge to 'redefine life as we know it,' but the real question is not how much we know, but 'how we use this knowledge.' Will we handle it with wisdom and restraint, or will we rush headlong after the allure of discovery without fully understanding the consequences? Possessing knowledge is a 'great power,' but the ability to control its use is the true test of humanity.

**Green Biotechnology Could Help Secure Global Food Supplies in a Changing Climate**
The climate change poses a threat to global food security, with research showing that crop yields could decline by 5-30% by 2050 if no measures are taken to adapt to the changing climate. Professor Maria von Korff Schmising, head of the Institute for Plant Genetics at the Heinrich-Heine-University in Düsseldorf, says that the agriculture industry is facing a 'Herculean task' under climate change conditions, while also reducing the use of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Green biotechnology could be a key tool in addressing this challenge, as it allows for the introduction of specific genes into plant genomes to make them more resistant to adverse environmental conditions. 'With green biotechnology, we can improve plants so that they require less fertilizer and water, and thus have fewer environmental impacts,' says Professor Liam Dolan from the Gregor Mendel Institute for Molecular Plant Biology in Vienna. Dolan notes that the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique allows for precise changes to be made to plant genomes, without unintended consequences. The technique has the potential to make crops more resilient to heat, drought, and disease, and could help to secure global food supplies in a world affected by climate change and conflict. However, there is still skepticism about the use of biotechnology, particularly from environmental organizations. The EU has strict regulations on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), but scientists are calling for a more nuanced approach to the use of gene editing in agriculture.

**World on Brink of Catastrophe: Science and Security Council Issues Urgent Appeal**
The Science and Security Council has expressed concern about the increasing threat of global catastrophe. According to their statement, 'In 2024, humanity drew closer to catastrophe than ever before.' The council is worried about trends that include the threat of nuclear war, climate change, the potential misuse of biotechnology, and the use of artificial intelligence in warfare. Despite clear signs of danger, world leaders and their societies have failed to take necessary action to change course. The council is appealing to the US, China, and Russia to take action to prevent a global catastrophe.

**World on Brink of Catastrophe: Science and Security Council Issues Urgent Appeal**
The world is on the brink of catastrophe, according to a statement from the Science and Security Council. 'In 2024, humanity moved closer to disaster than ever before,' it says. 'The trends that deeply concerned the Science and Security Council continued, and despite clear signs of danger, world leaders and their societies failed to take the necessary steps to change course.' The danger is not just limited to nuclear weapons, but also the climate crisis, the potential misuse of biotechnology, and 'a variety of new technologies,' including the use of AI in warfare. The council is calling on the US, China, and Russia to take action to prevent a global catastrophe.
