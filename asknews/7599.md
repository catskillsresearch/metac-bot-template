**UK Defense Reform and Nuclear Potential: Britain Enters 'War Readiness Mode'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive defense reform for the UK's armed forces, which includes expanding the country's nuclear capabilities. According to Starmer, 'the world has changed', and the growing threats from Russia cannot be ignored. The best way to prevent conflict is to prepare for it. The principles of the reform, as stated by the Prime Minister, are readiness for combat, integrated armed forces, and an approach aligned with NATO. The British government has agreed to build at least six new ammunition factories, create a hybrid royal fleet, build 12 attack submarines as part of the AUKUS defense pact with the US and Australia, invest £15 billion in nuclear weapons, and improve living conditions for military personnel. However, Starmer did not specify when the UK will start spending 3% of its GDP on defense, only mentioning the planned increase to 2.5% by 2027. The rise to 3%, according to Starmer, may be possible by 2034. UK Defense Minister John Healey noted that the new nuclear investments will be 'a signal to Moscow', and the country plans to purchase 7,000 long-range missiles and invest in cybersecurity.

**UK to Enhance Defense Capabilities, Increase Spending to 3% of GDP by 2034**
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced today, Monday, that the government will adopt significant changes to enhance the country's defense capabilities, making the United Kingdom more secure and powerful. According to Sunak, the UK must transition to a state of military readiness, where the British Armed Forces are always prepared to engage in war to deter any aggression. He pledged to end the reduction of the armed forces and build a more integrated and capable fighting force than ever before. Sunak stated that everything the UK does will enhance NATO's power, highlighting the importance of this alliance, which means that the UK will never engage in a war alone. He emphasized that this alliance is a fundamental source of Britain's strategic power. Sunak noted that the British government will work to accelerate innovation in the military field, to face current and future threats, and to make the army ten times more effective by 2035. He also mentioned plans to build at least six new ammunition factories to provide thousands of jobs, and to manufacture new long-range weapons to support European deterrence, in addition to investing in air and missile defense for the UK. Furthermore, Sunak announced plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines to protect the UK's territorial waters, and to invest £15 billion in updating the UK's nuclear warhead program. Sunak expects the UK to achieve its goal of spending 3% of its GDP on defense by 2034, expressing his hope that the country's readiness to fight will be a strong deterrent against any aggression. Sunak emphasized that the time has come to change the way the UK defends itself, to become more secure, pointing out that every citizen in this country has a role to play, especially as things have changed, and the threats facing the UK have become more serious and unpredictable. Sunak stressed that the war in Ukraine, new nuclear threats, and daily cyber attacks require a new era of defense and security.

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognize the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**Labour accused of making an embarrassing retreat on defence spending**
Labour's Defence Secretary, John Healey, has been accused of making an embarrassing retreat on defence spending after downgrading a commitment to spend 3% of GDP on national security by 2034 to a mere 'ambition'. Just 72 hours after saying Britain 'will spend' such an amount 'in the next Parliament', Healey said it was 'a historic commitment to increasing defence spending to 2.5 per cent in two years' time [2027]'. Critics warn that the ten-year plan is likely to prove unaffordable without a hike to 3 per cent, and that the UK's military spending is already behind other NATO members. Healey said that the Government's Strategic Defence Review, to be launched today, is a 'message to Moscow', with plans to build up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines and invest £15 billion in warheads.

**UK to expand submarine fleet as defense review calls for 'warfighting**
The UK government has announced plans to expand its nuclear-powered attack submarine fleet, with up to 12 new submarines to be built by the late 2030s. The new submarines will be a joint development between the UK, US, and Australia under the AUKUS security partnership. The move is part of a broader defense review, which will call for Britain's armed forces to be placed on a state of 'warfighting readiness.' Defense Minister John Healey stated, 'We know that threats are increasing and we must act decisively to face down Russian aggression.' The UK will also develop a new nuclear warhead, with a cost of 15 billion pounds. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has committed to increasing defense spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027 and 3 percent over the longer term, citing the need to reverse a long-term decline in military capability.

**Why the spectre of Trump looms over Starmer's defence review**
The Labour Party's defence review, written by George Robertson, Richard Barrons, and Fiona Hill, will draw on lessons from the Ukraine war to determine the UK's defence strategy for the next decade. The review aims to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP within two years and potentially reach 3% by 2034. However, US President Trump has called for Nato countries to spend 5% of GDP on defence, and Lord Ricketts suggests the UK may need to rise to 3.5% of GDP. The review recommends building up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of the Aukus programme with the US and Australia, and potentially buying US equipment, including American-made planes armed with tactical nuclear weapons. The full scale of the government's response to the review, which is thought to have accepted all 62 of its recommendations, will reset the UK's defence strategy for the next decade.

**Keir unveils defence overhaul making UK 10x MORE lethal as Putin threat looms – but STILL won’t commit to funding boost**
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer unveiled a defence overhaul, aiming to make the UK 10 times more lethal by 2035. The plan includes building up to 12 new nuclear-powered submarines, investing £15 billion in the UK's nuclear warhead programme, and establishing a new Cyber Command with £1 billion invested in digital warfare capabilities. However, Starmer refused to commit to boosting defence spending to 3% of GDP, saying that the review was premised on 2.5% and that everything will be done within the current spending envelope. Defence Secretary John Healey said that the deterrent is 'what Putin fears most' and that the UK will be 'ten times more lethal' by 2035, but did not provide a clear timeline for when defence spending will reach 3% of GDP.

**Starmer Promises 'New Wave of Investments' in Defense to Strengthen UK's Combat Forces**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has promised a new 'wave of investments' in defense to 'strengthen' its combat forces and 'renovate' the nation, as part of the new defense plan of the Government, which will be made public on Monday and contemplates the creation of at least six new ammunition factories in the United Kingdom. 'We will put an end to the shameful depletion of our Armed Forces. We will invest in a more integrated, more prepared and more lethal combat force than ever, to return Great Britain to its rightful place: Leader in defense and leader in NATO,' Starmer has guaranteed in a written statement published on Sunday by 'The Sun'. The new approach, he emphasized, responds to the need to have a 'constant' capacity for producing ammunition. This change, he defended, goes beyond 'superficial adjustments'. 'We are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, so we must be ready to fight and win. After all, the best way to prevent a conflict is to prepare for it,' he insisted, praising the 'British genius for innovation'. The announcement comes after Defense Secretary John Healey said on Friday that 'Britain will spend 3% of its GDP on defense in 2034, without a doubt', which will allow the British government to 'plan in the long term' and 'face pressures'. Currently, the UK allocates 2.3% of its GDP to defense, a percentage that the United States has described as 'irritating', especially compared to its goal of having NATO countries invest 5% of their GDP in defense spending.

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey, is planning to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War. This move includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. The goal is to increase the resilience of Britain in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The funding will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. Sir Keir Starmer said, 'In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests, is vital.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also set to meet with NATO heads of government in The Hague next month to discuss defence spending targets, with NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte suggesting a high defence spend target of 5%.

**US allies line up for trade deals during the 90-day tariff pause**
The US is in a 90-day tariff pause, allowing for rapid-fire negotiations with nations across the globe to lock down bilateral trade deals. Over 75 countries have expressed interest in negotiating with the White House, with 15 countries in active talks. Japan, the UK, South Korea, Australia, and India are among the top-priority nations for deals. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated that Japan will not offer 'big concessions' for a quick deal, while the US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said that Japan has 'non-tariff barriers' that will be a major issue in negotiations. The US and UK are working on a trade deal to reduce tariffs and levies, with the UK suspending tariffs on 89 US goods. South Korea and the US are also in talks, with a mutual defense treaty in place. Australia has turned down an offer from China to join in fighting US tariffs, and is facing an election on May 3 that may complicate trade negotiations. India and the US agreed to work on a trade deal in February, with a goal of reaching bilateral trade worth $500 billion by 2030.

**Peskov: Without Trust, START Negotiations Impossible**
According to Dmitry Peskov, the restoration of trust between Moscow and Washington is necessary for negotiations on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Peskov stated that only joint efforts from Vladimir Putin and possibly Donald Trump, in the event of his election, can contribute to the restoration of lost trust. 'At present, the prospects for the start of such negotiations appear extremely vague', Peskov said, commenting on the possibility of discussing a new START-4 treaty. He emphasized that the resumption of dialogue on strategic security and arms control issues requires a 'certain level of bilateral relations and mutual trust'. 'It is precisely this that we need to restore, provided there is the necessary political will from the leaders of both countries', he added. The current START-3 treaty, which limited the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads in Russia and the US, has been in effect for 15 years. In February 2023, Putin announced the suspension of Russia's participation in the treaty, stating that Moscow does not intend to withdraw from it completely. Russia insists that the treaty should take into account the combined nuclear potential of not only the US, but also other nuclear powers within the NATO bloc, including the UK and France, before returning to full-fledged negotiations on the treaty's terms. The START-3 treaty is set to expire in February 2026. Meanwhile, Russia is still waiting for a peace treaty with Japan, and the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the call for territorial concessions.

**Finnish Minister Warns of 'Demolishing a Supporting Wall' Without US Military Presence**
Finnish Defense Minister Antti Haataja has warned of the risks of a US military withdrawal, comparing it to 'demolishing a supporting wall without reinforcing the foundation.' He emphasized the need for transatlantic cooperation, stating, 'Without transatlantic support, our current defense system is like a clock mechanism without a spring.' Haataja called for a multi-step plan to transition the EU's defense capabilities to a level of independent security. He cited the European Commission's proposal to redistribute €800 billion through tax reform as an example of such efforts, aiming to turn European armies into combat-ready forces by 2030. This stance contrasts with recent German expert calls to reevaluate the rhetoric, shifting from escalating the conflict through arms supplies to Ukraine to an open dialogue with citizens about the nature of the confrontation. Analysts at the Bundesakademie für Sicherheitspolitik warn that the current policy of 'hybrid involvement' in the conflict increases the risk of direct nuclear confrontation, recommending that European leaders shift focus from military support to diplomatic channels for de-escalation.

**NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe Requests Hypersonic Missile Systems for European Countries**
The Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) of NATO, General Christopher Cavoli, stated that European countries have requested the placement of hypersonic missile systems on their territory. 'There is a request to place one of them in Europe. I can discuss this in more detail at a closed meeting,' Cavoli explained. He also emphasized the importance of the US withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 2019 and the need to capitalize on this move. Additionally, Cavoli warned about Russia's ability to rapidly increase the number of troops in its army. This comes after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (not Kiri Starmer) stated that European countries need to develop a plan for security and deterrence in case of a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron has also been actively discussing deterrence, calling Russia a threat to Europe and suggesting that NATO allies consider using French nuclear weapons for defense. Macron also hinted that the US may not support the EU in this matter. He announced plans to deploy hypersonic missiles, ASN4G, on French Rafale F5 fighter jets by 2035 for deterrence purposes. Russian President Vladimir Putin denied Western claims of Russia's plans to attack Europe, calling them 'nonsense' and 'rubbish' and suggesting that the hysteria is used to justify increased military spending.

**Dutch Intelligence Warns of Possible Russian Maneuver After Ukraine Peace Agreement**
The Dutch Defense Minister, Ruben Brekelmans, warned that Russia could be preparing to execute a 'large-scale' troop movement approximately one year after any ceasefire or peace agreement with Ukraine, according to Dutch military intelligence. Brekelmans stated, 'One year is all that Putin needs.' He painted a scenario where Russian President Vladimir Putin could station 'hundreds of thousands of troops on the border with the Baltic countries for a large-scale exercise.' Brekelmans noted that the experience in Ukraine shows that 'we only know with a week's notice' if such movements are simply exercises or preparations for an attack. The European Defense Commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, previously cited Danish and German intelligence information suggesting that Russia could test the mutual defense clause of Article 5 of the NATO treaty in 2030. Brekelmans warned, 'In summary, Putin has the intention, the capability, and the incentives to continue his aggression beyond Ukraine.' He concluded, 'We are not at war with Russia, but Russia, in a hybrid way, is at war with us.'

**War in Space is coming. Satellites will be armed with lasers and the MOON will be invaded. Sound far-fetched? The world's superpowers are already preparing for this catastrophe, reveals TIM MARSHALL | Daily Mail Online**
The world's superpowers are preparing for a potential war in space, where satellites will be armed with lasers and the Moon will be invaded. The Dynamic Meteorological Satellite (DMS) has warned that a 'first-come, first-served' approach to resources on the Moon could lead to conflict. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 prohibits nuclear weapons in space, but makes no mention of conventional weapons or laser technology. The treaty also lacks guidelines on how close one country's satellite can get to another's. The number of satellites in orbit is increasing, with over 11,000 currently in space and a projected 30,000 by 2030. This has led to concerns about space debris and the risk of collisions. The US has proposed the 'Artemis Accords', which sets guidelines for activity on the Moon, but it has not been signed by all countries. The economics of mining the Moon is complex, but it has not stopped countries from planning for it. The 'Holy Grail' of helium-3, a rare isotope that could be used to create non-radioactive energy, is also a potential resource on the Moon. However, the lack of regulations and agreements on how to deal with space debris and the use of laser technology has led to concerns about the potential for conflict in space. Nato has expanded its Article 5 mutual defence clause to include 'attacks to, from or within space', which could lead to the invocation of Article 5. The idea that space belongs to everyone is eroding, and the regulations we have are outdated and mostly drafted by major powers. Developing nations are at risk of being denied access to the resources and profits that may be found in space. There are many space-related issues that affect us all, including the risk of a major solar flare knocking out a large part of the world's electricity. A global system where emergency transfers of electricity across continents could mitigate the effects, as would a system of quick-launch satellites to reconnect communications.

**Taiwan's Uncertain Future in the Shadow of China**
Taiwan, a small island nation, is waiting in the shadows for the status quo to remain unchanged. The island is threatened by China, which has been seeking to reunify with Taiwan since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. The United States has a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, which was signed in 1955 and is set to expire in 2056. However, under the Trump administration, the US has taken a more isolationist approach, imposing tariffs on its allies and trading partners, and not prioritizing relations with other countries. This has left Taiwan in a precarious position, as China continues to exert pressure on the island. The article notes that Taiwan's status is still uncertain, and that the island is not recognized as a sovereign state by the international community. The US has historically been Taiwan's main supporter, but the current administration's approach has left Taiwan waiting to see if the US will continue to uphold its commitment to defend the island.

**Meinl-Reisinger: Neutralitätsdebatte hilft 'nicht weiter'**
Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger stated that the debate on neutrality is 'not helping further'. She emphasized that Europe must stand on its own when it comes to protecting and securing the freedom of Europeans. Meinl-Reisinger welcomed the European Commission's proposal for an arms buildup strategy for Europe, saying it is 'interesting from an Austrian perspective'. The Austrian government plans to increase the defense budget to two percent of GDP by 2032. Meinl-Reisinger noted that the current situation with the US under President Trump is an 'epochal break' and that Europe must be strengthened. Russia is already waging a hybrid war against the EU, she said. The minister emphasized that Austria and Europe must work together to address hybrid threats, citing Article 42 of the EU Treaty, which establishes a mutual defense obligation. Meinl-Reisinger also advocated for a common European security and defense policy, saying it is 'best and most efficient' for European countries to work together on defense and security issues. She added that Europe is 'a bit more alone' in terms of security and defense due to the current tensions with the US and that it must take care of its own security. Meinl-Reisinger also welcomed the EU's plans to use frozen Russian assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine, saying it is a 'good step'. She emphasized that the current situation requires a 'strong and united Europe'.

**Lithuania Withdraws from Cluster Munitions Treaty Amid Russia Concerns**
Lithuania has withdrawn from the international treaty on cluster munitions. The decision was made due to concerns about Russia's actions, with Lithuania's deputy defense minister, Karolis Aleksa, stating that Russia is using 'all available tools of conventional warfare.' Lithuania plans to also withdraw from the treaty on anti-personnel mines. Meanwhile, the Netherlands has pledged to provide Ukraine with 3.5 billion euros in state aid in 2026, with 700 million dollars allocated for drone production. The EU is holding a crisis summit in Brussels to discuss further support for Ukraine and European defense. The summit is expected to focus on a plan to rearm Europe with a budget of up to 800 billion euros. The US has been criticized for its handling of the Ukraine crisis, with four high-ranking Trump advisors meeting with Ukrainian opposition leaders. Germany's interior minister, Nancy Faeser, has called for a fair distribution of Ukrainian refugees within the EU. French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed expanding the country's nuclear shield over Europe to protect against Russian threats. The Czech government has announced plans to increase its defense spending to 3% of its GDP by 2030.

**Can Europe Defend Itself Without US Help?**
Since the creation of NATO in 1949, the US and Europe have stood together, bound by a mutual defense treaty where an attack on one is considered an attack on all. However, in his first month as US president, Donald Trump has raised doubts among other member states about whether the US will continue to uphold this treaty. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen emphasized the need for a strong commitment to support Ukraine through the war and to ensure Europe can defend itself against an unpredictable and aggressive Russia. In response, the Danish government announced plans to increase the defense budget by 120 billion kroner by 2033, with 50 billion kroner allocated for increased military capabilities this year and next. However, can Europe defend itself without US help? Jacob Kaarsbo, a foreign and security policy commentator, believes it is possible, but it depends on political will. On the other hand, Lars Bangert Struwe, a historian and secretary general of the Atlantic Association, thinks it is not possible for Europe to defend itself without US help, citing the need for a common understanding between the US and Europe. However, he believes it could become possible if European countries in NATO come together. 'It would require establishing a European core within NATO,' he said. 'And it would probably be possible within two to five years.'
