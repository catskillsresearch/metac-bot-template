**Russian Satellite Raises Alarms with Suspected Anti-Satellite Maneuvers**
A recent series of maneuvers by a Russian satellite near a critical US government asset has raised alarms. Despite Russia's insistence that these vessels are only for surveillance and inspection, this activity has increased international concerns that Moscow may be developing and deploying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons (ASAT). The Russian satellite Cosmos 2588, launched on May 23, has been placed in a coplanar orbit with the USA 338 satellite, which is believed to be part of the KH series electro-optical surveillance constellation, known as Crystal. Independent satellite tracker Bart Hendrix was the first to report on the launch and orbital characteristics of Cosmos 2588 on the NASA Spaceflight Forum. Dutch astronomer Marco Langbroek later noted on the forum that the satellite appears to follow a similar trajectory to two previous Cosmos missions, indicating that it may have been built specifically as an anti-satellite platform (ASAT). 'It seems to be following a similar trajectory to two previous Cosmos missions, which suggests it may have been built specifically as an anti-satellite platform,' said Langbroek.

**UK to Expand Nuclear-Powered Submarine Fleet**
The UK plans to expand its nuclear-powered submarine fleet, as announced by the government in London ahead of a review of the defense sector. The new submarines will be designed for offensive operations against other ships. According to Defense Minister John Healey, 'With new, highly modern submarines patrolling international waters and our own nuclear deterrent program on the British coast, we make Britain safe at home and strong abroad.' He added, 'We know that threats are increasing and we must act decisively to counter Russian aggression.' The UK aims to build up to 12 next-generation submarines, which will be nuclear-powered and capable of carrying conventional, non-nuclear weapons. They are expected to replace the current fleet of seven submarines by the end of 2030. The new submarines are being developed as part of the AUKUS security partnership between the UK, the US, and Australia.

**New twist in Russia-Ukraine war as Britain asks for US nuclear-capable fighter jets to..., Starmer govt accuses Putin of...**
The UK is reportedly in talks with the US to acquire a fleet of nuclear-capable fighter jets to enhance its nuclear deterrence against Russia. According to reports, the UK plans to equip US-made fighter jets with nuclear missiles, which could be the largest expansion in UK's nuclear deterrence capabilities. The move has the support of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who believes the world faces its worst nuclear threat since the Cold War era. The UK currently lacks the capability to launch nuclear strikes from the air, but acquiring the US-made F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets would allow it to do so. The deal would also enable the UK to launch nuclear strikes from air, vastly enhancing its deterrence capabilities. Additionally, the Starmer government plans to manufacture 7,000 long-range weapons and increase its defense spending to 3% of the country's GDP by 2034.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. This move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks across the globe. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, has also called for a transformation in how the UK defends itself, saying, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey, is planning to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, the largest sustained increase since the Cold War. This move includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. The goal is to increase the resilience of Britain in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The funding will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. Sir Keir Starmer said, 'In an ever more dangerous world, increasing the resilience of our country so we can protect the British people, resist future shocks and bolster British interests, is vital.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.' The UK is also set to meet with NATO heads of government in The Hague next month to discuss defence spending targets, with NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte suggesting a high defence spend target of 5%.

**UK Considers Purchase of American Fighter Jets for Tactical Nuclear Capabilities**
The UK government is reportedly considering the purchase of American fighter jets capable of using 'tactical nuclear weapons', specifically bombs of free fall, according to the Times newspaper. This acquisition would be the largest 'expansion in defense' for the UK since the Cold War. As stated by the Times, 'The UK wants to buy fighter jets that can use tactical nuclear weapons... Defense Minister John Healey and Admiral Sir Tony Radakin... plan to buy American-made fighter jets that can launch smaller, less powerful bombs than regular nuclear bombs', said the Times. The British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, has also supported these discussions, and the UK government has allegedly held talks with the Pentagon. 'High-ranking sources said that the UK is considering the purchase of the stealthy F-35A Lightning fighter jet from Lockheed Martin, but other types of aircraft are also being discussed', said the Times. Earlier, UK Defense Minister John Healey stated that the country will spend 3% of its GDP on defense by 2034.

**Russia's Kosmos-2576 Satellite Raises Concerns of Anti-Satellite Weapon**
Russia's Kosmos-2576 satellite, launched in mid-May, has raised concerns that it may be an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon due to its unusual proximity to American satellites. The satellite has been identified as a 'test satellite' by the US Space Force, which may have the ability to monitor or interfere with other satellites. US officials say the satellite is currently in a low Earth orbit (LEO) near the USA-314 satellite, with a distance of approximately 10 kilometers, raising security concerns. Experts believe that Russia's recent development of space military capabilities may be part of its 'Hunter' program, which aims to deploy space assets with ASAT capabilities. These satellites could pose a threat to enemy satellites through electronic interference, laser attacks, or mechanical collisions. The US Space Force spokesperson emphasized that the US will closely monitor the satellite's movements and ensure the safety of its space assets. Russia has denied the allegations, stating that Kosmos-2576 is a scientific research satellite used to collect space environment data. The incident highlights the growing tensions in the space domain. The US and Russia's competition in space military technology may further escalate their bilateral relations. International society is calling for the establishment of space militaryization regulations to prevent conflict escalation. However, as countries continue to enhance their space capabilities, future space security challenges will become increasingly severe.

**China Is Preparing a "Pearl Harbor" Attack on America, US General Warns**
US Air Force Brigadier General Doug Wickert warned that China is preparing a 'Pearl Harbor' style attack on the US, which will likely target US satellites in space. China has developed a novel anti-satellite (ASAT) laser weapon that can seize control of a satellite, rendering it ineffective. Blinding imaging satellites will give China a decisive home field advantage in a potential war with the US. Disabling US nuclear weapons and military communications in space will severely degrade the US nuclear threat to China. China has also demonstrated the capability to deploy co-orbital satellites into geostationary orbit, which can physically push American satellites out of their orbits. The US must prepare accordingly to counter China's strategic high ground in outer space.

**SOFREP Morning Brief: Russian Satellite Tied To Nuclear Weapons Program Out of Control, Trump Skeptical of Putin's Intentions in Ukraine, Nine Killed in Vancouver After Car Rams Street Festival**
A Russian satellite, Cosmos 2553, linked to Russia's nuclear anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons program, has malfunctioned and is no longer operational. The satellite was sent into space in February 2022 and was intended to test how radiation affects spacecraft and gather radar intelligence. U.S. officials and analysts believe that Russia's intentions are to develop nuclear weapons capable of knocking out entire groups of satellites. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has taken a sharper turn against Russian President Vladimir Putin, expressing skepticism about Putin's intentions in Ukraine. Trump has suggested that harsher measures, such as new banking penalties or 'secondary sanctions,' might be necessary. In a separate incident, at least nine people were killed and several others were injured after a car rammed into a street festival in Vancouver. The driver, a 30-year-old Vancouver man, was taken into custody. Iceland is taking defense seriously, boosting its Coast Guard, tightening NATO ties, and considering a future military force. The country's approach to security includes protecting against cyber threats, safeguarding the environment, and boosting resilience against various threats.

**Anti satellite technology**
Anti-satellite (ASAT) technology is designed to incapacitate or destroy satellites for strategic or tactical purposes. ASATs can utilize physical or non-physical means to damage a satellite's operability. They are categorized into two types: Kinetic Energy ASATs (KE-ASATs), which destroy satellites by physically colliding with them, and Non-Kinetic ASATs, which disrupt, jam, or disable satellites without causing physical destruction. Examples of Non-Kinetic ASATs include Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs), which can 'dazzle' or permanently damage satellite sensors, and Cyber Weapons, which can disrupt or hijack satellite systems.

**Satellite killer, attack using rays, disable all space stations and systems, how prepared India is for next generation warfare with China?**
China's advanced laser weaponry and cyberattack capabilities have made it capable of winning a war without firing a single bullet. According to a Swarajya report, China can disable enemy satellites, plunge imaging systems into darkness, and disrupt navigation signals without using explosives. India is not yet fully prepared for this next-generation warfare scenario. However, India has conducted an anti-satellite (ASAT) test and established a Defence Space Agency in 2018. India's ASAT test demonstrated its capability to strike in space, but it cannot yet be considered a credible space deterrent. China's soft-kill technology, including lasers and cyberattacks, provides Beijing with a strategic advantage, allowing it to undermine India's space-based systems without open conflict. To give a befitting reply to China, India will need to enhance its capabilities, including responding to Chinese attacks on its satellites using non-kinetic means such as lasers, jammers, cyberattacks, or co-orbital manipulation. 'This is how next generation warfare will be fought and India is not yet fully prepared for this scenario,' said the report. 'However, it is not that India is unaware of these forces from China.'

**René Obermann Warns of Russian Attack on NATO and Recommends German Nuclear Weapons**
René Obermann, former CEO of Deutsche Telekom and current Airbus supervisory board chairman, warns that Russia may attack NATO before 2029. He believes that Russia is preparing for a war on the NATO's eastern flank and that Putin's aggressive behavior towards the West is a sign of this. Obermann suggests that Germany should acquire its own nuclear weapons to protect itself from Russia's 5580 nuclear warheads. He proposes that Europe should form a 'common shield' with shared governance and that the Ukraine should be supported 'with all available means'. Obermann also recommends that Europe should develop its own satellite constellation to reduce its dependence on the US. He criticizes the current EU satellite system, Iris, which will not be operational until 2030, as being 'too late' if Russia were to attack before then.

**War in Space is coming. Satellites will be armed with lasers and the MOON will be invaded. Sound far-fetched? The world's superpowers are already preparing for this catastrophe, reveals TIM MARSHALL | Daily Mail Online**
The world's superpowers are preparing for a potential war in space, where satellites will be armed with lasers and the Moon will be invaded. The Dynamic Meteorological Satellite (DMS) has warned that a 'first-come, first-served' approach to resources on the Moon could lead to conflict. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 prohibits nuclear weapons in space, but makes no mention of conventional weapons or laser technology. The treaty also lacks guidelines on how close one country's satellite can get to another's. The number of satellites in orbit is increasing, with over 11,000 currently in space and a projected 30,000 by 2030. This has led to concerns about space debris and the risk of collisions. The US has proposed the 'Artemis Accords', which sets guidelines for activity on the Moon, but it has not been signed by all countries. The economics of mining the Moon is complex, but it has not stopped countries from planning for it. The 'Holy Grail' of helium-3, a rare isotope that could be used to create non-radioactive energy, is also a potential resource on the Moon. However, the lack of regulations and agreements on how to deal with space debris and the use of laser technology has led to concerns about the potential for conflict in space. Nato has expanded its Article 5 mutual defence clause to include 'attacks to, from or within space', which could lead to the invocation of Article 5. The idea that space belongs to everyone is eroding, and the regulations we have are outdated and mostly drafted by major powers. Developing nations are at risk of being denied access to the resources and profits that may be found in space. There are many space-related issues that affect us all, including the risk of a major solar flare knocking out a large part of the world's electricity. A global system where emergency transfers of electricity across continents could mitigate the effects, as would a system of quick-launch satellites to reconnect communications.
