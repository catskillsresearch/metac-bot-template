**Aguinaldo Payment Date and Calculation: What You Need to Know**
This month, employees, retirees, and pensioners will receive the first installment of the Annual Complement Salary (SAC), also known as the aguinaldo. The payment date for the first half of the aguinaldo, corresponding to 2025, is in June. However, employers have a deadline to make the payment, and employees may receive their aguinaldo up to four business days after the deadline. For example, some employees may receive their aguinaldo as late as July 4. Retirees and pensioners from ANSES will receive their aguinaldo on the same date as their benefits, which can be in the second, third, or fourth week of the month, depending on their income level. To determine the exact payment date, it is necessary to consult the calendar published by ANSES at the beginning of each month and verify the date according to the type of benefit received. The aguinaldo is calculated simply, but it is essential to do it correctly to know the corresponding amount.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Tommy Paul Makes History as First American in Roland-Garros Quarterfinals Since 2003**
It's been 40 years since American tennis has seen this level of success at Roland-Garros. 40 years since they've had eight representatives in the round of 16. And it's not stopping there, as Tommy Paul advances to the quarterfinals after a dominant win over Australian Alex Popyrin (6-3, 6-3, 6-3) in 1h51. Paul's victory is a miracle, considering he was down 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 5-3 against Marton Fucsovics in his second round match before coming back to win. He also had to go five sets against Karen Khachanov, but it was much easier against Popyrin. Paul was very comfortable in return, exploiting Popyrin's second serves (63% of points on second serve) and was effective in the game (27 points won). He perfectly mastered the match to become the first American in the quarterfinals of Roland-Garros since Andre Agassi in 2003. 'It's a great feeling,' Paul said. 'I'm just happy to be in the quarterfinals.'

**Avoiding These Stocks Today Could Cost You Everything Tomorrow**
Investors are advised to be cautious in the current market, but not because of a potential bear market. Instead, they should be aware of the transformative opportunities that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will bring. AGI is expected to outperform humans in most knowledge tasks and robots will rapidly advance to handle physical labor, altering the course of the economy. Experts Eric Fry and Luke Lango believe that investing in AGI stocks is not optional and that those who position themselves correctly could witness the greatest moneymaking opportunity in human history. However, President Trump's tax bill, which contains language that would prohibit states from regulating AI for 10 years, could have a dramatic impact on the speed of reaching AGI and its consequences. The article concludes that AGI is coming and it's essential to prepare for its implications, both utopian and dystopian.

**The Emergence of AGI: Predictions and Concerns**
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic in recent months, with experts predicting the emergence of AGI (general artificial intelligence) within the next few years. AGI is expected to revolutionize various fields, including science, technology, and healthcare. However, there is no consensus on the timeline for AGI's arrival, with predictions ranging from 2027 to 2032. Some experts, such as Ben Goertzel, predict that AGI will emerge in 2027, while others, like Demis Hassabis, estimate it will take 5-10 years. The development of AGI is expected to be a gradual process, with AI systems becoming increasingly autonomous and capable of solving complex problems. However, there are also concerns about the potential risks and consequences of AGI, including the possibility of job displacement and the need for new forms of governance. The article also discusses the concept of ASI (artificial superintelligence), which is expected to surpass human intelligence and potentially lead to significant changes in human society. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for continued research and development in AI, as well as the importance of addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with AGI.

**The Turbulent History of the Aguilar Family: Scandals, Controversies, and Demands**
The Aguilar family, known for their talent and presence in the Mexican regional music scene, has been at the center of several scandals that have put their image under public scrutiny. In 2024, Ángela Aguilar and Christian Nodal confirmed their romantic relationship, but it quickly turned into a wave of infidelity accusations and boos at their concerts, particularly towards Ángela, who was seen as the 'third wheel'. The family was forced to launch their own press agency to manage the narrative and stop the rumors circulating on social media. In 2022, Ángela faced a crisis when intimate photos with composer Gussy Lau, 15 years her senior, were leaked online. Ángela felt 'violated' by the invasion of her privacy, while unofficial versions suggested her father, Pepe Aguilar, disapproved of the relationship. The scandal highlighted the intense scrutiny faced by young women in the entertainment industry, making Ángela's private life a public topic. In 2017, Emiliano Aguilar, Pepe's eldest son, was arrested in California for trying to cross the border with four Chinese migrants hidden in his vehicle. He was released on bail and spent 18 months in a federal prison. The incident strained his relationship with his father, who publicly distanced himself. Ángela's legacy has also been questioned due to a labor dispute with Ana Rosa Macías, the widow of violinist Miguel Ángel Hernández, who worked with them for over two decades and died in 2021 due to COVID-19. Macías claims the Aguilar family only offered 5% of the legally owed labor benefits and never provided medical security to the musician. In February 2025, Pepe and Ángela failed to attend a key hearing, leaving the case in the hands of a federal judge.

**AGIP Facilitates the Return of Surpluses in Favor of the Gross Income Tax**
The Administration of Public Income (AGIP) has made available to taxpayers the mechanism for the return of surpluses in favor of the Gross Income Tax. To be eligible for this rapid return of surpluses, taxpayers must meet certain conditions, including that the amounts do not exceed $2 million and that the taxpayer has no debt at the time of submitting the request. According to AGIP, since the launch of this mechanism in mid-January, 10,000 taxpayers who requested the return of a Surplus in Favor (SAF) originating from the Gross Income Tax have already recovered their money. AGIP notes that there has been a significant change in the times of reimbursement, with the new procedure resolving in just 48 hours, compared to the previous three months. 'This is a great improvement,' said an AGIP representative. 'It's a big change, and we're happy to see that taxpayers are benefiting from it.'

**50 Years of Socio-Political Predictions for the World**
The author predicts that the world will enter a chaotic phase over the next 25 years, with the emergence of artificial intelligence-powered robotic soldiers and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The author believes that AGI will be developed first by the U.S., China, or another country, and will eventually reach near-godlike power. The author argues that a free AGI would be preferable to one controlled by corporations or authoritarian regimes, but suggests that a collaborative AGI that works with humanity in a mutual partnership would be the best-case scenario. The author notes that the next 50 years will test the limits of human ingenuity, morality, and survival.

**AGI could now arrive as early as 2026  --  but not all scientists agree**
A new analysis of expert opinions predicts that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could arrive as early as 2026, 20 years earlier than previously predicted. The analysis, conducted by Cem Dilmegani, combed through 8,600 predictions from scientists, AI experts, and entrepreneurs between 2009 and 2023. According to the analysis, there's a 50% probability that we would achieve human-level intelligence in machines at some point between 2040 and 2061. However, some experts, like Dario Amodei, believe it may even happen as soon as 2026. Others, like Yann LeCun, Facebook's chief AI scientist, disagree, stating that current approaches to AI are incompatible with human-level intelligence and urging scientists to move away from the notion of AGI entirely.

**Don't Fight the Tape: Stick with What's Working in This Market**
Despite a challenging market environment, certain areas are showing strength. A rotation into defensive sectors such as consumer staples and health care has occurred, as well as a surge in mining companies due to historic highs in metals prices. Gold, in particular, is pressing up against $3,000 per ounce for the first time ever. Historically, precious metals have been viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, making them a great portfolio diversifier. Gold has made a stealthy move higher, outperforming the S&P 500 by 12.26% year-to-date. Mining stocks, such as Alamos Gold (AGI), are also expected to benefit from higher gold prices and have the potential for intrinsic value growth. Analysts covering AGI have raised 2025 EPS estimates by 13.16% in the past 60 days, with a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29/share, reflecting potential growth of 61.3% relative to last year.
