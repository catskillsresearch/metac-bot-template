**Global Crises Hinder Efforts to Reduce Tobacco Consumption**
A report supported by 57 organizations and groups has revealed that the global crises of COVID-19, climate change, and wars have hindered governments' efforts to reduce tobacco consumption and convince approximately 95 million people to quit smoking. The report states that the deadline for achieving the goal of reducing tobacco consumption by 30% among people over 15 years old by 2025 has been extended by five years due to other priorities diverting resources away from implementing the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, signed by 168 countries. The report warns that this delay has affected around 95 million additional tobacco consumers who were supposed to quit smoking by 2025. According to the report, despite the success of governments in reducing the number of smokers, there are still 1.207 billion and 800,000 people worldwide who smoke, compared to the target of 1.124 billion and 400,000. The report emphasizes the importance of addressing unhealthy habits such as smoking, excessive drinking, and lack of physical activity as soon as possible to promote healthy and happy lives.

**Global Efforts to Reduce Tobacco Consumption Halted by Pandemics and Wars**
The COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and wars have hindered global efforts to reduce tobacco consumption, thwarting plans to get 95 million people to quit smoking, according to a report backed by 57 organizations. Governments aimed to reduce tobacco use among people over 15 by 30% between 2010 and 2025 as part of a plan linked to the Sustainable Development Goals agreed upon in 2015. However, the deadline was extended by five years to 2024 due to other priorities, diverting resources from implementing a World Health Organization treaty on tobacco control signed by 168 countries. The report, presented to the UN Economic and Social Council, which oversees global sustainable development, states that 'this delay represents an additional 95 million tobacco consumers who would have otherwise quit smoking in 2025.' Although governments have reduced the number of smokers, failing to meet the 30% reduction goal means that 1.207 billion people still smoke worldwide, instead of the target 1.112 billion, according to a calculation based on tobacco use rates and population figures provided in the report. The report, published by Action on Smoking and Health Canada and backed by Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, Cancer Research UK, and other organizations, warned that continued delays could lead to millions of additional tobacco-related deaths. The UN has already acknowledged that funding shortages, geopolitical tensions, and pandemic-related issues have moved the world away from most of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to reduce poverty and hunger, increase access to healthcare and education, among other issues. The groups backing the ASH Canada report urged governments to redouble their efforts on tobacco control policies such as tax increases and smoking bans.

**Global Crises Hinder Efforts to Convince Millions to Quit Smoking**
A report supported by 57 organizations and groups has stated that the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and wars have hindered global efforts to reduce tobacco consumption and convince approximately 95 million people to quit smoking. According to the report, the timeline to achieve the goal of reducing tobacco consumption by 30% among people aged 15 and above by 2025 has been extended by five years due to other priorities diverting resources away from implementing the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, signed by 168 countries. The report, presented to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, responsible for overseeing the Sustainable Development Goals, stated that this delay has affected approximately 95 million additional tobacco consumers, who were supposed to quit by 2025. Despite governments' success in reducing the number of smokers, the failure to reduce the number by 30% means that 2.207 billion and 800 thousand people worldwide are still smoking, instead of the target of 1.124 billion and 400 thousand, based on a Reuters estimate using tobacco consumption rates and population numbers from the report.

**Is the Planet on the Brink of Collapse? Discover if the 6th Mass Extinction has Already Begun**
Scientists warn that the current rate of extinction is up to 1,000 times higher than natural levels and could lead to the loss of 75% of species in a few centuries. This could be a new mass extinction event, similar to the one that occurred 66 million years ago, which wiped out 75% of life on Earth. The main causes of this rapid decline in biodiversity are human activities such as hunting, environmental degradation, introduction of invasive species, and climate change. While there is no definitive proof of a mass extinction, experts like John Wiens and Gerardo Ceballos point out that the current rate of species loss is 'dezenas a centenas de vezes superior' to natural levels. Sarah Otto notes that many species considered extinct are still alive but with populations so reduced that extinction is almost certain. Despite the uncertainties, there is a consensus on the need for urgent action to stop the decline of biodiversity. International organizations warn that one in four species is threatened with extinction in the next decades, and the continued increase in global temperature could exacerbate the problem. The loss of biodiversity not only affects wildlife but also compromises essential services for humans, such as ecosystem stability and protection against natural disasters. However, experts like Stuart Pimm emphasize that extinction is not inevitable and that there are examples of species that have recovered thanks to effective conservation efforts.

**Heatwaves: A Growing Threat to Global Health and Infrastructure**
According to a recent international study, four million people, approximately 49% of the global population, experienced at least 30 days of extreme heat due to climate change caused by human activities. The report states, 'Over the course of 12 months, four million people -- around 49% of the global population --, experienced at least 30 days of additional heat by extreme heat (more heat than the 90% of temperatures observed in the area during 1991-2020), due to human-caused climate change.' The study highlights that each heatwave becomes more probable, intense, and long-lasting due to the burning of fossil fuels by humans. Countries in Latin America, particularly island nations, are the most affected. For example, Argentina experienced 55 days of extreme heat, while Brazil endured 57 days of high temperatures. In contrast, Caribbean islands such as Aruba, Dominica, and St. Vincent experienced over 180 days of extreme heat throughout the year. The study also found that people under one year and over 65 experienced a 187% and 220% increase in days of heat, respectively, compared to the period from 1986 to 2005. The study notes that the trend of heat-related mortality has been consistently increasing. The report also highlights indirect consequences of heat, such as the expansion of infectious diseases, including those transmitted by vectors like the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits dengue. The study warns that the stress caused by heat can impact agricultural productivity, reduce access to water, and overwhelm healthcare and electrical infrastructure systems. Cities are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures, as they generate an urban heat island effect that intensifies the impacts.

**What If We Could Shrink Humans? Can Shrinking Humans Save the Earth?**
The author proposes an idea of shrinking humans by 50% through genetic engineering, which could solve population issues and reduce environmental impact. However, this would require significant changes to infrastructure and societal norms. The author acknowledges that people would be hesitant to undergo such a transformation, and it could lead to conflict and a rift in society. The idea is presented as a thought-provoking concept, rather than a serious proposal, and the author invites feedback and discussion. The author notes that reducing human size would raise ethical issues, such as changes to human identity, and emphasizes that this is a personal idea and not necessarily factual.

**The Ragweed Menace: A Growing Public Health Concern**
The ragweed plant is considered the most damaging plant to human health worldwide, affecting 120 million people globally, according to biologist and professor Marc Lavoie. The plant's pollen is particularly problematic, but it also has an impact on agriculture and biodiversity. Lavoie believes that the current approach to controlling ragweed is not effective and that a new strategy is needed. He suggests that better mowing and planting competitive plants like the melilot could help contain the plant's spread. In agriculture, Lavoie recommends revising practices to prevent ragweed from thriving, such as maintaining a year-round vegetative cover and implementing better crop rotations. He also notes that the plant is highly resistant to herbicides and that its weaknesses, such as its intolerance to shade and frost, are becoming less relevant due to human activities like deforestation and climate change. Lavoie warns that if left unchecked, ragweed could become a major public health issue, with one in five people expected to be allergic by 2050. He argues that a change in mentality is needed to address this problem effectively.

**Decline of Insects: 75% of Global Insect Population Lost**
Scientists are increasingly clear about the causes of the 'biological apocalypse' threatening humanity, which has led to a 75% decline in global insect populations. According to a 2017 study, the main reasons for this decline are intensive agriculture, with its associated soil modification and massive pesticide use. A new investigation has compiled 175 previously published reports on this topic, finding that intensive agriculture and climate change are the most cited factors. Additionally, Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of Biological Sciences, noted that 'conservation actions that we could implement to support pollinators, such as planting more wildflowers, would only benefit them in their adult stage, and we must consider their needs at other stages of their life, as well as those of other insects that are not studied as frequently.'

**Study Reveals Alarming Fertility Rates Required to Ensure Human Species Continuation**
A recent study in the field of human demography has revealed alarming results, showing that ensuring the continuation of the human species requires fertility rates higher than previously estimated. Using advanced mathematical models that take into account random fluctuations in births and deaths, the research team found that the actual required fertility rate to ensure the continuation of the human species is approximately 2.7 children, rather than the traditional estimate of 2.1 children per woman. This result comes at a critical time when many developed countries, particularly in East Asia such as Japan and South Korea, are experiencing a sharp decline in fertility rates, threatening a 31% population decline per generation. What makes this study unique is its focus on the impact of 'demographic randomness' that is evident in small communities, where natural fluctuations in birth rates can lead to the extinction of entire family lineages over generations. The researchers used complex mathematical models to simulate the evolution of human societies over time and concluded that the previous rate of 2.1 children, considered sufficient to replace generations, actually provides no guarantee against the gradual risk of extinction, especially when considering that some individuals may not reproduce at all. One of the fascinating findings is that the bias in sex ratio towards females can significantly reduce the required fertility rate to ensure the continuation of the society. This discovery may provide a scientific explanation for the phenomenon known as the 'Trivers-Willard effect', where an increase in female births has been observed during times of crises and catastrophes, suggesting an evolutionary mechanism that protects human societies from extinction in difficult conditions, as an increase in females increases the likelihood of reproduction and the continuation of lineages. This provides a convincing scientific explanation for previous observations of an increase in female births during times of war, famine, and environmental disasters. The statistical simulation conducted by the researchers showed that communities with fertility rates 'below the critical threshold' - i.e., less than 2.7 children in ideal conditions - face a virtually certain risk of extinction within 20 generations, with rare exceptions. Although the study reassures that the immediate risk of extinction does not threaten large human societies, it warns that most family lineages are exposed to gradual extinction over the long term under current fertility rates. These results open the door to a fundamental re-evaluation of population policies worldwide, particularly in developed countries experiencing rapid aging and a sharp decline in fertility rates.

**The Alarming Question of Jordi Wild: 'We are too dependent' on a Hypothetical Global Blackout**
Streamer Jordi Wild recently discussed a hypothetical global blackout with survival expert Basquecraft, asking what would happen to society if the power grid collapsed. Basquecraft responded, 'If the electrical system collapses, civilization would likely collapse completely, and there would be a huge extermination of humans, with around 80% to 90% of the population not surviving.' Basquecraft also highlighted the importance of being prepared, stating, 'Many people are not aware that gasoline expires within a year, unlike in movies.' He recommended that in a situation like this, people should seek refuge in a village where they can rely on neighbors and family for support and resources. 'We are too dependent,' Wild said, echoing Basquecraft's concerns about the consequences of a global blackout.

**Iran on the Brink: A Potential War with the US and Israel**
The situation on the Middle East is nearing a critical point, with ongoing conflicts in Syria, Turkey, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. The 'Iranian question' is a concern for the US administration, with some sources suggesting that Washington and Tel Aviv are planning a massive strike against Tehran. If this happens, the region will be plunged into chaos, according to some analysts. A senior official in the White House has stated that the US plans to complete a military operation in Iran by the fall, if Tehran does not begin dismantling its nuclear program. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has warned that 'war with Iran is almost inevitable' if a nuclear deal is not reached soon. Israel, which has been given a free hand by Trump, is adding fuel to the fire. Iran's military has reportedly warned potential opponents that it will retaliate with a pre-emptive strike against a joint US-British base in the Chagos Islands if necessary. This would be an attempt to keep Trump from launching a military attack on Iran. The US is seriously considering nuclear talks with Iran, according to Axios. For Russia, which has Iran as its main strategic partner in the region, a war between its ally and the West would be a 'catastrophic' event. Russia has warned that such a conflict would lead to 'irreversible catastrophe', according to The Sun. Political analyst Dmitry Rodionov believes that the situation is on the brink of disaster, with Iran's well-developed system of bunkers making it difficult for the US to inflict significant damage. Rodionov warns that Iran could retaliate with a serious attack, potentially reaching as far as the US base in San Diego. He also believes that a war would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy, including a sharp increase in oil prices and a global financial crisis. This would be a 'true Ragnarök', a scenario in which the world is plunged into chaos and destruction. Rodionov is skeptical about Trump's willingness to risk such a conflict, but believes that it is a real possibility. 'This will be a test not only for the US, but for the whole world, which will face serious shocks in politics and economics. It's hard to imagine that Trump or his team, which advocates for war, are so confident. It's unclear if they are willing to take the risk. In the current circumstances, this war will drain the US of all its strength,' Rodionov said. 'It's possible that Trump will become the one who organizes Ragnarök.'

**The Path to Apocalypse: Top 3 Most Likely Catastrophes That Could Wipe Out Humanity**
According to The Infographics Show, the top three most likely apocalyptic scenarios that could wipe out humanity are a pandemic, a nuclear war, and a massive asteroid collision. A global epidemic of a new, unknown disease would be the most painful and long-term path to extinction, as it would spread rapidly and be difficult to contain. The world would likely cease to exist not from explosions and destruction, but in the silence of empty cities, overwhelmed by disease. A nuclear war, the second most likely scenario, would be characterized by its rapid and devastating speed. A conflict between nuclear powers would not be limited to pinpoint attacks, but would trigger a chain reaction, leading to the total destruction of infrastructure, the death of hundreds of millions of people, and subsequent climate catastrophes. The atmosphere would be filled with soot and ash, blocking sunlight and causing a global cooling, or 'nuclear winter.' Survivors would face radiation, hunger, mutations, and a planet devoid of resources. The third scenario, with the most immediate effect, is the collision of a massive asteroid with Earth. The consequences of the impact would be catastrophic: a massive explosion, comparable to thousands of nuclear bombs, followed by tsunami waves crashing onto continents, and tectonic shifts. Volcanic activity and dust emissions would cause prolonged atmospheric darkness, rapid cooling, and the disappearance of photosynthesis. Life, as we know it today, would become impossible almost instantly. Scientists have long considered and discussed other, less likely but no less frightening scenarios, such as an out-of-control artificial intelligence, an ecological collapse, or a solar superflare. However, a pandemic, nuclear escalation, and asteroid threats remain at the top of scientific assessments, historical analogies, and global risk levels. In the long term, life on the planet is doomed, even without external blows, according to researchers from NASA and the University of Tohoku. Their calculations, based on 400,000 simulations, predict that oxygen will disappear from the atmosphere in about a billion years, and biological life in its current form will cease to exist. This date, 1,000,002,021, seems infinitely far away, but current threats suggest that the end of the world may not be waiting in the future, but could start at any moment.

**Humanity came close to extinction 800000 years ago. Only 1280 of our ancestors survived.**
A recent study published in Science suggests that 800,000 years ago, a catastrophic 'ancestral bottleneck' reduced the global human population to just 1,280 breeding individuals, wiping out 98.7% of the early human lineage. This population crash, lasting around 117,000 years, was likely caused by extreme climate shifts, prolonged droughts, and dwindling food sources. Despite the near-extinction, scientists believe that this bottleneck may have played a crucial role in shaping modern humans, contributing to a key evolutionary event called chromosome fusion, which may have set Homo sapiens apart from earlier hominin species. The study raises intriguing questions about how this small population survived, possibly through early fire use and adaptive intelligence.

**Humanity on the Brink of Extinction 900,000 Years Ago**
A study has revealed that humanity was on the brink of extinction 900,000 years ago, with only 1,280 reproductive individuals remaining. The researchers believe that the bottleneck in the population could have limited the expansion of human settlements and restricted their geographical dispersal. The lack of fossils and the breaching of the fossil record may be due to the reduced population, which decreased the chances of their remains being preserved. The researchers also suggest that environmental stress and the struggle for survival may have altered the social dynamics of human groups, forcing them to reorganize and adapt their strategies for survival. However, as the climate became more favorable and the threat of extinction decreased, the human population experienced a significant recovery, approximately 813,000 years ago. The control of fire is believed to have played a crucial role in this recovery, allowing humans to cook food, warm themselves, and protect themselves from predators. This technological innovation may have been key to the subsequent population growth and expansion of the species. The study's findings have implications for the evolution of the human species, with researchers suggesting that the selective pressures derived from the bottleneck may have accelerated the development of fundamental characteristics in Homo sapiens. One of the most fascinating aspects of this study is the possibility that environmental pressure and reduced genetic diversity may have facilitated the selection of traits that promoted intelligence and adaptability. The researchers propose that this period of crisis may have influenced the development of the human brain, favoring individuals with greater cognitive ability and problem-solving skills. Additionally, the study suggests that the bottleneck may have contributed to the divergence of human lineages, including the ancestors of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Homo sapiens. The discovery of this genetic bottleneck offers a new perspective on the fragility of the human species in its early stages. Although humanity was on the brink of extinction, a small group of individuals managed to survive and lay the foundations for the evolution of Homo sapiens. This study not only answers key questions about the breaching of the fossil record but also raises new questions about how these events influenced our biology and evolution.

**Scientists Warn of Three Hidden Threats to Humanity**
Scientists have identified three potential causes of a global catastrophe that seem unlikely but could lead to the extinction of the human species. The first threat is a demographic crisis, with the United Nations predicting that the global population will exceed 10 billion by 2050, leading to a severe resource shortage, famine, and subsequent collapse of civilization. The second danger lies in the development of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, which, although promising significant breakthroughs, may get out of control. As John Skelton and Craig Wheeler from the University of Texas point out, powerful gamma-ray emissions from supernovae explosions could cause significant damage to the Earth's biosphere. If such a burst were directed towards Earth, the consequences would be catastrophic. Researchers from the University of Otago have also considered the worst-case scenario of a global catastrophe - a possible nuclear winter. They believe that only five countries would be able to survive in such conditions. 'We should consider not only obvious risks but also less predictable factors to ensure our future,' says the 'MediaPotok' news outlet.

**The Mystery of Genetics and War: Why More Boys Are Born After Global Conflicts**
After global conflicts, there is a statistically significant increase in the number of male births, a phenomenon known as the 'effect of the returning soldier.' This trend has been observed throughout history, with the first recorded instance in the 1950s by researchers McMahon and Pye. However, it was particularly evident after World War II, when the percentage of male births in the US increased from 51.406% to 51.48%. Although the increase was small, it was observed in many countries, suggesting the presence of a broader biological mechanism underlying this phenomenon. One theory suggests that higher soldiers had a greater chance of surviving in battle and that high parents are statistically more likely to have sons. Research published in the journal Human Reproduction found that the average height of those who survived was slightly higher (168.63 cm) than those who died (166.26 cm). Another theory, known as the 'hypothesis of maternal dominance,' focuses on women who remained during wartime. When men went to war, women often took on traditionally male roles, performing physically demanding work on factories or even participating in resistance. Some believe that these changes could have led to an increase in testosterone levels in their bodies, which could have affected the likelihood of conceiving a male child. However, scientific support for the idea that such changes in lifestyle can significantly alter the hormonal balance or affect the sex ratio during conception is limited. The most plausible explanation is related to the timing of conception in relation to the menstrual cycle. The post-war increase in sexual activity, historically confirmed and named the 'baby boom,' may mean that more pregnancies occur at the beginning of the cycle. At this stage, higher levels of estrogen and gonadotropins, as well as slightly increased pH of the cervix, may slightly favor male sperm. Although this effect will be insignificant for individual couples, at the population level, it may explain the observed shift in the sex ratio. As the modern society observes a decrease in fertility and a change in reproductive models, it remains unclear whether the 'effect of the returning soldier' will be preserved in future conflicts. Since the facts show that modern people lead a less active sex life than previous generations, the biological forces that once finely regulated the sex ratio may no longer function as they did before. Whether this will lead to long-term changes in the dynamics of the world's population - the question is open, and the answer will only be given by time and long-term research.
