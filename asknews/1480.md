**Vienna calling: Strauss's 'Blue Danube' waltzes into outer space**
The European Space Agency (ESA) broadcast a live performance of Johann Strauss II's 'The Blue Danube' waltz into space to celebrate the composer's 200th birthday. The Vienna Symphony Orchestra played the concert in Vienna, which was also streamed online and shown in public screenings in Vienna, New York, and Spain. Josef Aschbacher, ESA's director general, said the digitized sound will be transmitted to a satellite dish in Spain and then into space. Norbert Kettner, director of the Vienna tourist board, called 'The Blue Danube' a 'true unofficial space anthem' due to its association with Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The waltz will eventually reach NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, the most distant man-made object in the universe, in approximately 23 hours and 3 minutes. This marks a significant moment for Austria, which seeks to right a perceived wrong by including Strauss's famous waltz in the selection of music pieces on the 'Golden Records' carried by the Voyager spacecraft. 'Music is a language which touches many people and has the universal power to convey hope and joy,' said Jan Nast, director of the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. 'The Blue Danube' evokes the elegance of 19th-century Vienna, which lives on in the city's roaring ball season, and is 'typical of space', according to Kettner.

**Voyager 1 Carries 'Donauwalzer' to the Stars**
To rectify a historical oversight, Tourism Director Norbert Kettner said, 'We wanted to give a gift to the universe.' In 1977, the Voyager 1 spacecraft carried a gold-plated copper record with sounds, greetings, images, and 27 musical works, including pieces by Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, for any extraterrestrial civilizations that might encounter it. However, the 'Donauwalzer' (Danube Waltz), considered the unofficial anthem of space, was missing. The song is meant to serve as wake-up music for astronauts and has a connection to Stanley Kubrick, who used it as the soundtrack for his iconic science fiction film '2001: A Space Odyssey.' The campaign by Wien Tourismus is part of the events celebrating the 200th birthday of Johann Strauss. The European Space Agency (ESA), which involves 23 countries, is also celebrating its 50th anniversary on May 31. The Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, launched in 1977, have traveled 25 billion kilometers from Earth and are now outside the solar system. Whether the signal can still be read due to its decreasing intensity depends on the technical capabilities of other civilizations, according to an organizer's spokesperson.

**The 'Donauwalzer' Embarks on a Journey to the Voyager 1**
The famous waltz 'An der schönen blauen Donau' by Johann Strauss is on a journey through space, heading to the Voyager 1 spacecraft, approximately 25 billion kilometers away. The Vienna Philharmonic performed the piece live at the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, and the signal was transmitted to the spacecraft via a 'Deep-Space-Antenna' of the European Space Agency in Spain. It will take around 23 hours for the signal to reach the Voyager 1. This is an attempt to correct a historical oversight, as when the spacecraft was launched in 1977, it included a copper record with 27 musical works, including those by Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, but not the 'Donauwalzer'. The waltz is considered the unofficial anthem of space and is intended to serve as wake-up music for astronauts. The idea of connecting the song to space originated from Stanley Kubrick, who used it as the soundtrack for his iconic science fiction film '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. This campaign is part of the events celebrating the 200th birthday of Johann Strauss and the 50th anniversary of the European Space Agency.

**ESA to Launch 'El Danubio Azul' into Space**
The European Space Agency (ESA) will launch 'El Danubio Azul' into space on Saturday, May 31, to 'host' Johann Strauss II's famous waltz on the Voyager 1 spacecraft, the farthest human-made object from Earth. The piece will travel at the speed of light, passing through Spain, specifically the Cebreros Station in Ávila, where the ESA's 35-meter-diameter deep space antenna will transmit the signal to the stars. The concert will be performed live at the MAK (Museo de Artes Aplicadas) in Vienna by the renowned Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Petr Popelka. The signal will be sent via electromagnetic waves to the Voyager's exact location, about 25 billion kilometers from Earth. Once converted to a digital file, the recording will travel to the vastness of space using radio waves, taking about 23 hours to reach the Voyager. This initiative, 'Waltz into Space,' is a symbolic act, but one filled with beauty, as the waltz will be played. The concert will be projected on screens in various locations around the world, including New York and the Cebreros Station. The Planetarium in Madrid will also open its projection room to the public to follow this historic event live, starting at 8 pm. The coincidence of several anniversaries (200 years of Johann Strauss' birth, 50 years of the ESA's founding, and 20 years of the Cebreros Station) has justified the programming of this initiative. 'Music connects us all through time and space in a very particular way,' said ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher in a statement. 'The European Space Agency is pleased to share the stage with Johann Strauss II and open the imagination of future scientists and space explorers who may one day travel to the tune of the space hymn.' The Cebreros Station, which participates in 'Waltz into Space,' has supported other notable missions such as Rosetta, Mars Express, and the NASA's Perseverance rover over the past two decades. In a normal month, this base offers over 500 hours of connection with spacecraft. The famous waltz has been associated with space adventures since Stanley Kubrick's film '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) made it the space hymn. However, the piece was surprisingly left out of the 'Golden Record of the Voyager' when the spacecraft was launched in 1977. This omission is considered a 'cosmic error' by the ESA, which now wants to rectify it with this curious initiative. At the time, the NASA committee, led by Carl Sagan, did not include 'El Danubio Azul' among the 27 works, despite the film having been released nine years earlier.

**This waltz is the unofficial soundtrack of floating through space. Soon it will beam through the cosmos**
To celebrate the 200th anniversary of Johann Strauss II's birth, the European Space Agency (ESA) will transmit his famous waltz, 'Blue Danube', into space on Saturday. The Vienna Symphony Orchestra will perform the piece, which will be relayed to the cosmos via a pre-recorded version. The live performance will provide the accompaniment. The radio signals will travel at the speed of light, passing the moon in 1 ½ seconds, Mars in 4 ½ minutes, Jupiter in 37 minutes, and Neptune in four hours. Within 23 hours, the signals will be as far from Earth as NASA's Voyager 1, the world's most distant spacecraft. This is not the first time music has been transmitted into space; NASA has done so in the past with songs by the Beatles and Missy Elliott. ESA's director general, Josef Aschbacher, said, 'Music connects us all through time and space in a very particular way.' The 'Blue Danube' was previously skipped for the Voyager Golden Records, but the tourist board in Vienna aims to correct this 'cosmic mistake' by sending the waltz to its destined home among the stars.

**Wichita Falls man saves historic music at antique 78 RPM shop**
Justin Goode, owner of Antique 78 RPM Record Shop in Wichita Falls, is dedicated to preserving historic music from over a century ago. With a collection of nearly 10,000 78 RPM records, Goode is making sure that these old tunes aren't lost forever. He said, 'What I essentially opened up here is a time travel agency because it's the easiest and the quickest and the most reliable way to travel back in time.' Goode's shop is a haven for musical history, and he hopes it will be a place of education for people to learn about and listen to these old records. He noted that the loss of over 500,000 song titles in a 2008 fire at Universal Recording Studios in Los Angeles means that these records are often the only version that still exists. Goode's favorite record is 'Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground' by Blind Willie Johnson, which was recorded in 1927 and is one of the 27 songs chosen by NASA to be included on the Voyager spacecraft.

**The Mexican Song 'El Cascabel' on the NASA's Golden Record**
The NASA's 'Golden Record' (Disco de Oro), a collection of sounds and images representing the diversity of life and culture on Earth, was included in the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1977. The record contains 'El Cascabel', a traditional Mexican huapango song, performed by Antonio Maciel and Las Aguilillas with the Mariachi México de Pepe Villa. The song was chosen for its vibrant and lively rhythm, characteristic of the huapango veracruzano style, and its ability to represent the richness of traditional Mexican music. Timothy Ferris, a member of the selection committee, described the song as a fusion of Mediterranean and African influences, with an intense energy that made it stand out. The inclusion of 'El Cascabel' in the Golden Record is a testament to the value of traditional Mexican music in the cultural heritage of humanity, and its ability to transcend borders and time.

**The Golden Record in Voyager 1 : A Message to the Cosmos**
The Golden Record, a 12-inch gold-plated copper phonograph record, was sent aboard Voyager 1 in 1977 as a message to any extraterrestrial intelligence that might encounter it in the distant future. Conceived by Carl Sagan and his team, the record contains 115 analog-encoded images and natural sounds of Earth, as well as greetings in 55 languages and a selection of music from different cultures and eras. The record is designed to be universal and is expected to survive in space for billions of years. It represents humanity's optimism and desire to connect with the unknown, and raises profound questions about interstellar communication and the limitations of human perspective. As astronomer Carl Sagan said, 'The Golden Record is a message of hope, a beacon of curiosity, and a testament to the boundless spirit of exploration that defines us as a species.'

**The Mexican Song That Has Been Traveling Through Space for Over 40 Years with the Voyager Spacecraft**
In 1977, NASA launched the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft with the mission to explore the outer reaches of the solar system and beyond. Along with their scientific mission, they carry a unique cultural legacy: a message for potential extraterrestrial civilizations. Each Voyager contains a gold-plated 12-inch record, designed as an intergalactic time capsule, featuring a collection of sounds, images, and music that represent the diversity of life on Earth. The record includes 115 images and a selection of audio that ranges from wind and wave sounds to whale and bird songs. The curator of this content was a committee led by astronomer Carl Sagan. The record also includes messages of peace from then-US President Jimmy Carter and UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. Mexico is represented on the record with the traditional huapango song 'El cascabel,' performed by Lorenzo Barcelata and the Mariachi México. The NASA estimates that the Voyager spacecraft will take around 40,000 years to reach another star system. If an advanced alien civilization were to find these mechanical messengers, they could listen to our music, see our images, and perhaps gain a better understanding of the species that once inhabited a small blue planet called Earth.

**How Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Fell in Love While Creating a Message for Extraterrestres**
Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan, the creative director of the Voyager project, fell in love while working on the project to create a message for extraterrestres. Druyan, who was not a scientist, was chosen by Sagan to be the director of the project due to her passion for music and her ability to think creatively. Together, they selected the sounds that would be included on the Voyager Golden Records, including music from around the world, sounds of nature, and even the sound of a human heartbeat. It was a song from China, 'Liu Shui' (Corrientes de agua), that brought Sagan and Druyan closer together. Sagan called Druyan after hearing the song and proposed to her, and they got married in 1981. They had two children together and Druyan continued to work on the Voyager project, even after Sagan's death in 1996. Druyan has since revived the series 'Cosmos' with Neil deGrasse Tyson, and the Voyager Golden Records continue to travel through space, carrying a message of humanity's existence to the universe.

**The Voyager Golden Record: Earth's Greatest Hits | WFMT**
The Voyager Golden Record, a collection of images, sounds, and music, was created by a team led by astrophysicist Carl Sagan. The team, which included Timothy Ferris, Frank Drake, and others, aimed to assemble a diverse array of music that would represent humanity. Ferris explained that they had to physically assemble the music, a challenge in the 1970s, and had listening sessions to select the pieces. They included classical music by Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, as well as folk and world music from various cultures. The final playlist is 90 minutes long and includes sounds from planet Earth, such as laughter, thunder, and animal sounds. Ferris said, 'I can guarantee the outer side of the Voyager Golden records for at least a billion years and the inner side, which is more protected from cosmic rays, at least two billion years.' The Voyager Golden Record is a representation of the diversity of humans and the quality of their work, and Ferris believes they managed to create a record that captures this essence.
