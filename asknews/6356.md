**ITV Sticker Still Mandatory in 2025: What You Need to Know**
Contrary to rumors, the ITV sticker, also known as the 'V-19', is still mandatory in 2025 and not carrying it can cost up to 100 euros. According to the Asociación Española de Entidades Colaboradoras de la Administración en la Inspección Técnica de Vehículos (AECA-ITV), the sticker will continue to be obligatory for at least the rest of 2025. The AECA-ITV states that the regulation of the sticker is contained in the Reglamento General de Vehículos, approved by the Real Decreto 2822/1998, and any modification would require a change in the same or higher legal rank, which is not currently planned. The sticker must be placed in a visible location, and in vehicles with windshields, it should be placed in the upper right corner of the interior zone. The sticker can be yellow, red, or green, with the color indicating the year in which the ITV expires. For example, green stickers correspond to ITVs that expire in 2025, 2028, and 2031. AECA-ITV advises that it is essential to only carry the current ITV sticker and remove the previous ones, as this makes it easier for authorities to identify if the sticker is expired or not. Additionally, accumulating many stickers can obstruct the driver's visibility and may result in a fine if deemed necessary by traffic agents.

**Feneval Supports Baleval's Decision to File Appeal Against Ibiza Vehicle Limitation**
The National Federation of Vehicle Rental Companies with and without drivers (Feneval) has publicly supported the decision of the Balearic Association of Vehicle Rental Companies without Driver (Baleval) to file a contentious-administrative appeal against the decision of the Consell of Ibiza to limit the entry and circulation of vehicles on the island. Feneval considers that the limitation will directly harm the companies in the sector, which will suffer a maximum limitation of 600 vehicles per company. The president of Feneval, Juan Luis Barahona, stated that this regulation 'breaks the equity of the market, limits competition, and generates a clear legal insecurity', adding that 'public administrations must assume their patrimonial responsibility for the economic consequences that this decision may cause, especially after the Aena bankruptcy, where companies were awarded places under conditions that are now in the air'. Barahona also explained that the companies are being pointed out as the main culprits of the saturation 'and we are forgetting that the industry does not generate demand on its own, but rather attends to tourists who decide to come to our borders for other reasons. We are attacking the consequence and not the cause', he insisted. Feneval has stated that the decision of the Consell of Ibiza is 'an attack on fundamental principles of citizenship: freedom of circulation, market unity, and free competition'. Therefore, they support Baleval's decision to request the suspension of the application of the norm this summer and to collect data in 2025 to implement an effective strategy to ensure the sustainability of transportation. 'Otherwise, this action could be an attack not only on the fundamental rights of citizens, but also a serious harm to the economy of Ibiza', declared the patronal, which stated that, among the most immediate effects, there will be a decrease in the quality of service from some companies, as well as an increase in prices due to the reduction in the offer of vehicles. A decision that will also harm the image of the island as a tourist destination.

**India Set For Rs 32 Trillion Defence Budget... In 2047**
India's defence budget is expected to rise to Rs 31.7 trillion in 2047, a five-fold increase from Rs 6.81 trillion in 2025-2026. Defence production is expected to increase six-fold to Rs 8.8 trillion, with defence exports rising to Rs 2.8 trillion, a twelve-fold increase from Rs 24,000 crore in 2025. The report highlights three conditions that need to be met to achieve this vision: budgetary constraints, regulatory red tape, and a shortage of skilled manpower. The report calls for fostering robust public-private partnerships, addressing intellectual property rights and technology-transfer issues, and streamlining procedures to achieve self-reliance. India's defence production has reached an all-time high of Rs 1.46 trillion in 2024-2025, with defence exports also hitting a record high. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the role of indigenous defence capabilities in enabling decisive action, saying 'Make-in-India is an essential component in our national security and it played a key role in India's effective action against terrorism during Operation Sindoor.' Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh assured the private sector that the government would extend it the same support it had historically provided to the public sector, saying 'I will be striving to improve the ease of doing business, to create a level playing field, and hopefully even bury you under orders.'

**The usage of a transformer based and artificial intelligence driven multidimensional feedback system in english writing instruction - Scientific Reports**
A Transformer-based multidimensional feedback system was developed to assist English writing instruction. The system's performance was evaluated through a multi-dimensional performance assessment, including grammar accuracy, sentence structure diversity, content coherence, and vocabulary richness. The results showed that the system excelled at grammar correction, with an average improvement rate of approximately 79%. The system also enhanced sentence structure diversity, increased the number of unique sentence structures, and improved content coherence. The user satisfaction evaluation showed a significant increase in overall satisfaction, with an average increase of approximately 1.45 points. The system's ability to generalize stylistically was tested across different domains, and it maintained stable performance across academic papers, business emails, and creative writing. However, the Lexical Optimization module had more limited applicability in creative writing. The system outperformed both Grammarly Commercial Version and the GPT-3.5 fine-tuned model in detecting common error types among English as a Second Language learners. The system demonstrated an impressive precision rate of 96.3% in subject-verb agreement detection for complex sentences using hierarchical dependency parsing. The false positive rate was controlled at just 3.1%, a quarter of that seen in traditional rule-based engines. The system also supports offline deployment for localized use. The study emphasizes ethical standards, particularly in data privacy and user rights protection. The system strictly adheres to anonymization principles, ensuring that all user texts are stripped of personal identifiers upon input and transmitted and stored using the AES-256 encryption protocol. The system also adheres to open science principles and plans to release the core system module code, including preprocessing tools and model fine-tuning scripts, on GitHub, along with non-sensitive datasets under a Creative Commons License (CC BY-NC 4.0).

**France to Ban Smoking in Public Spaces Where Children Are Present**
France will make it illegal to smoke in public spaces where children are present, starting from July 1. The law aims to create a tobacco-free society by 2032. Those who break the law will face a fine of 135 euros. According to Health and Families Minister Catherine Vautrin, 'where there are children, tobacco must disappear.' The law does not apply to smoking in cafes' terraces or the use of e-cigarettes, but new measures are expected to reduce vaping. Tobacco causes 75,000 deaths per year in France, representing 13% of all deaths. The law is part of a National Program to Combat Tobacco, which started in 2023 and will end in 2027, with the goal of creating a tobacco-free generation by 2032. Yves Martinet, president of the National Committee against Tobacco, said that this law is also positive for non-smokers, as it protects them from 'passive smoking, which also kills.' Martinet added that the law 'desnormalizes tobacco consumption and leads smokers to think about quitting gradually.' The law has been shown to be effective, with many local governments in France already having similar measures in place.

**Bitcoin at Risk: How Quantum Computers Could Compromise Its Encryption**
A team of researchers from the University of Shanghai, led by Professor Wang Chao, has successfully breached the SPN (Substitution-Permutation Network) encryption algorithm using a D-Wave quantum computer. This algorithm is fundamental to standards like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), widely used for protecting information. According to the researchers, this breakthrough marks a milestone in the ability of quantum computers to compromise encryption systems previously considered secure. The attack was carried out through two main strategies: combining optimization and search problems, where quantum computers excel in efficiency, and integrating the Schnorr algorithm, Babai's rounding, and a quantum optimization method. As a result, scientists concluded that military-grade encryption algorithms, such as AES-256, are closer to being vulnerable than previously thought. Juan José García Ripoll, researcher at the Institute of Fundamental Physics of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), explained that quantum computers have the potential to make current encryption algorithms vulnerable. Ripoll warned about this possibility in 2019 and emphasized the importance of developing quantum-resistant cryptography as an alternative. Google recently expressed its concerns about the future of cryptography, stating that an RSA integer of 2,048 bits could be factorized in less than a week using a quantum computer with less than a million qubits. Although current processors, such as IBM's Condor chip with 1,121 superconducting qubits, do not yet reach this capacity, the progress in quantum technology suggests that these machines may be available sooner than expected. The potential impact of these advances is not limited to traditional algorithms like RSA. Modern cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, use elliptic curve cryptography, considered more robust and efficient. However, the mathematical foundations of this technique are similar to those of RSA, making it vulnerable to future quantum computers. According to Google's scientists, if quantum computers can break RSA faster than expected, elliptic curve cryptography could also be compromised with relative ease. Despite these risks, solutions are being developed. A research group from the University of Kent claims that Bitcoin could update its encryption across its entire network in approximately ten months without interrupting its operation. These types of adaptations will be crucial to protect systems based on cryptography from the advances of quantum computing.

**It Might Actually Be 20 Times Easier for Quantum Computers to Break Bitcoin, Google Says - Decrypt**
Google's quantum research team has found that breaking the RSA encryption protecting Bitcoin and other sensitive information may require 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. According to Google researcher Craig Gidney, a 2048-bit RSA integer could be factored in less than a week by a quantum computer with less than a million noisy qubits, a 20-fold decrease from the previous estimate. This breakthrough comes from improved algorithms and smarter error correction. However, the timeline for a quantum computer to break Bitcoin's 256-bit encryption is still uncertain, but experts are working on quantum-resistant solutions. Google has already started encrypting traffic using standardized post-quantum cryptography, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends phasing out vulnerable systems after 2030. The findings suggest that the timeline for this transition may need to be accelerated.

**Post-Quantum Cryptography for Modern Email**
The development of quantum computers poses a threat to modern cryptography, as some operations on quantum computers are performed exponentially faster than in binary logic. To address this issue, new quantum-resistant encryption algorithms have been developed. In 2025, the first email providers began to implement post-quantum cryptography in their encryption pipelines. The classical asymmetric encryption (RSA-2048) is replaced by the post-quantum key encryption mechanism (CRYSTALS-KYBER) and the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol on elliptic curves, ECDH (x25519). For symmetric encryption, AES 256 is sufficient, but in email, asymmetric encryption is required. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has chosen the CRYSTALS-KYBER algorithm for the key creation mechanism (ML-KEM) and the CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithm for the digital signature mechanism (ML-DSA). These two standards are known as FIPS 203 and FIPS 204. The TutaCrypt provider is not only implementing post-quantum systems in email (protocol called TutaCrypt), but also in other cloud services, including cloud storage and file sharing, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Wuppertal. This demonstrates the importance of post-quantum cryptography at the government level. In TutaCrypt, classical asymmetric encryption (RSA-2048) is replaced by the key encryption mechanism (CRYSTALS-KYBER) and the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol on elliptic curves, ECDH (x25519).

**Preparing for the Impact of Quantum Computing on Cloud Security | HackerNoon**
The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses a significant threat to cloud security, particularly to public-key cryptography and AES encryption algorithms. Shor's algorithm, which runs on a quantum computer, can break RSA and ECC encryption standards, making 2048-bit RSA keys vulnerable to being broken within minutes. Experts recommend moving to AES-256 encryption to maintain security. Attackers can gather encrypted data with plans to decrypt it later, putting long-term confidential datasets at risk. To prepare for post-quantum cloud security, organizations should create cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum computing, adopt hybrid cryptography, and work with cloud vendors to transition to quantum-safe encryption methods.

**Cybersecurity in the Post-Quantum Era**
Current digital systems can be effectively protected against cyber threats using methods such as AES-256 or RSA-2048 encryption, as well as various cybersecurity solutions like antivirus software and firewalls. However, with the advent of quantum computing, traditional security measures are under increasing pressure. Post-quantum cryptography is needed to protect digital infrastructure from future cyber threats. According to studies, there is a 2-9% chance that conventional encryption methods will be cracked via quantum computing in the next five years, and a 17-33% chance in the next ten years. Uwe Gries, Country Manager DACH at Stormshield, emphasizes the need for countermeasures in sensitive areas with high data volumes: 'In the banking sector, cybercriminals will always be interested in data on conditions and amounts of strategic transactions. In the defense sector, details about submarines are valid for decades. But also in the energy sector, in the automotive industry, in company secrets ... In the medical sector, the question also arises, as the law requires a German healthcare facility (public or private) to store patient records for at least ten years. Of course, in a secure manner.' Stormshield has already begun to implement proof-of-concept procedures for post-quantum algorithms, which have been recommended by the French Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) since 2022. By using Stormshield's solutions, systems and infrastructures can be protected with post-quantum cryptography in the future, making them resistant to attack scenarios such as the 'store-now-decrypt-later' attack. This involves collecting large amounts of classically encrypted data, which can be decrypted via quantum computing in years or decades. Stormshield's cybersecurity solutions will use a hybrid encryption approach, combining conventional methods like AES or RSA with post-quantum-safe algorithms like Crystals-Kyber or FrodoKEM. The flexible IKEv2 protocol will also ensure a reliable key exchange, protected from unauthorized access. This hybrid approach is recommended by the French ANSSI and the German BSI until post-quantum cryptography is mature enough to be used as a universal solution.

**Quantum Computing Threats: What's at Stake and How to Prepare**
According to recent studies, the probability of traditional cryptography methods being breached by quantum computing is between 2-9% in the next five years, increasing to 17-33% in the next ten years. To address these emerging threats, Stormshield's security solutions will rely on a hybrid approach to cryptography. On one hand, data and systems will continue to be protected using traditional encryption protocols like AES or RSA, while on the other hand, they will also benefit from an additional layer of security using post-quantum algorithms like Crystals-Kyber or FrodoKEM. As ACN notes, with Stormshield by their side, authorities, companies, and institutions can rely on cutting-edge security solutions that are regularly updated to counter the emerging threats of quantum computing, as said by Stormshield, 'La sicurezza informatica nell’era post-quantistica crittografia AES a 256 bit RSA a 2048 bit La crittografia post-quantistica contro le minacce legate all’informatica quantistica'.

**Preparing for Post-Quantum Cryptography**
The rapid development of quantum computers raises legitimate concerns among security teams. The supposed ability of these technologies to break encryption keys is alarming. To prepare for the arrival of this technology in our daily lives, we must take action now. Quantum computers are progressing rapidly, working with qubits rather than classical memories and processors. Currently, the most advanced machines have around 1200 qubits. However, breaking a 2048-bit RSA or Diffie-Hellman key, the current industry standard, would require approximately 1 million qubits. This capability is not expected to be reached before 2040, according to current projections. However, progress in reducing the 'noise' of qubits - i.e., the errors caused by unpredictable quantum phenomena - could accelerate this timeline. If these efforts are successful, it may become possible to break these keys as early as 2030. That's why modern data protection actors are adopting 4096-bit RSA keys, which would require approximately 1.3 billion qubits to be broken. According to our estimates, this capability will not be reached before 2047, providing a strengthened and durable protection against emerging threats. Not all cryptographies are equal in the face of quantum computers. For example, symmetric algorithms like AES are much less vulnerable. A 256-bit AES key, used for data at rest encryption, retains an effective strength of 128 bits against quantum attacks, which remains sufficient to resist current threats. However, 'in-flight' encryption, used to secure communications via TLS/SSL or SSH, relies on asymmetric algorithms like RSA, Diffie-Hellman, or ECC, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. That's why data protection actors favor the use of 4096-bit RSA keys to extend the useful life of current encryption while preparing for a gradual transition to post-quantum solutions. Although we can gain time with current cryptographies, it is clear that this solution will not be permanent. The ANSSI recommends a gradual transition to post-quantum cryptography, prioritizing a hybrid approach that combines new quantum-resistant algorithms with proven classical solutions. This hybridization is essential to ensure robust security and limit the risks associated with potential flaws discovered in young post-quantum algorithms. The ANSSI recommends using CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and CRYSTALS-Dilithium or Falcon for digital signatures. These algorithms, selected as part of the NIST standardization process, are currently the most promising. However, the ANSSI emphasizes the need for a thorough analysis of their implementation before massive adoption. The adoption of these new cryptographies must be gradual and methodical. Organizations must begin now to integrate these algorithms into their infrastructure to limit the risks associated with 'Harvest Now Decrypt Later' (HNDL) attacks, where data encrypted today could be decrypted in the future by quantum computers. Quantum cryptography represents the pinnacle of security, as it is fundamentally unbreakable according to the laws of physics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that any attempt to measure a protected message will destroy that message and reveal the presence of the attacker. Although this technology is promising, it is not yet ready for large-scale adoption. In the face of these challenges, organizations must act now. The NIST recommends a precise schedule: adoption of new cryptography methods by 2030 and completion of the transition by 2035. This deadline may seem long, but the complexity of modern information systems makes these changes particularly delicate. The threat of quantum computers to our current security systems is real, even if it is not immediate. Organizations that anticipate this evolution and prepare their transition now will be best positioned to protect their critical data in the world of tomorrow.

**CICC warns public over claims election results may be altered**
The Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC) has warned the public about individuals claiming they can alter the election results in exchange for a large sum of money. CICC Executive Director Alexander Ramos said that the automated election system (AES) has three independent systems to ensure results are secure, including a machine application that cannot be altered once programmed, a transmission system with seven-layer security, and a consolidation server that only receives encrypted files. Ramos stated, 'It has SHA 256 encryption whose hash codes are published and cannot be duplicated. Any attempt to alter files or change in process, the hash codes will automatically change alerting the system.' The CICC has urged candidates to report individuals offering to alter the election results to the CICC Hotline 1326. This warning comes after the Commission on Elections (Comelec) filed a cybercrime complaint against Isabela vice mayoral bet Jeryll Harold Respicio for claiming he can manipulate the results of Eleksyon 2025.

**Microsoft wants you on AES as Windows 11 24H2, Server 2025 ditches ancient DES encryption**
Microsoft has announced that it will be removing the DES (Data Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm from Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025 due to its age and lack of security. The company recommends switching to AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead, which uses longer key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Microsoft writes, 'IT admins: Prepare for removal of Data Encryption Standard (DES) in Kerberos for Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11, version 24H2. While it's an optional component that isn't installed by default, it's important to detect and disable your DES use to avoid potential disruption before taking the September 2025 security update. Consider adopting the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm as a stronger encryption method.' The removal of DES will occur in two phases: Compatibility Mode and Disabled Mode.
