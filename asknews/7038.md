**US LNG output declines in May from April's record**
US liquefied natural gas (LNG) output declined in May due to plant outages and maintenance at the country's largest export facility, according to preliminary LSEG ship tracking data. The US exported 8.9 million metric tons of LNG in May, down from a record 9.3 MT in April. Cheniere Energy confirmed that its Sabine Pass facility, the biggest in the nation, was undergoing maintenance work, resulting in lower gas flows. Europe remained the favored market for US LNG exports, with 6.05 MT or 68% of total exports going to the continent. Exports to Asia remained relatively low, with 1.88 MT or 21% of total exports. The US is poised to remain the world's largest LNG exporter with an expected 6 projects getting the financial go ahead in 2025, adding another 90 million metric tons per annum of LNG to the US output by 2030.

**Marubeni, Exxonmobil Enter into Offtake Agreement for Low-Carbon Ammonia**
Exxonmobil and Marubeni have entered into a long-term offtake agreement for low-carbon ammonia. Under the agreement, Exxonmobil will supply approximately 250,000 tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year from its facility in Baytown, Texas to Marubeni. The facility, expected to be the world's largest of its kind, will produce up to 1 billion cubic feet of low-carbon hydrogen and over 1 million tons of low-carbon ammonia per year. According to Barry Engle, president of Exxonmobil Low Carbon Solutions, 'By using American-produced natural gas we can boost global energy supply, support Japan's decarbonization goals and create jobs at home.' Marubeni aims to establish a global low-carbon ammonia supply chain for Japan and collaborate with Exxonmobil to decarbonize power projects in Japan and Southeast Asia.

**Indian Oil to Build India’s Largest Green Hydrogen Plant at Panipat Refinery - Energy News**
Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) plans to build the country's largest green hydrogen plant at its Panipat refinery in Haryana, targeting 10,000 tonnes per year by 2027. The project, valued at approximately USD 4.75 per kilogram, will use electrolysis powered by renewable energy to produce green hydrogen, replacing fossil-derived hydrogen in hydrocracking and desulfurization processes. This move is expected to significantly reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions at the refinery. The plant will supply a continuous stream of low-carbon hydrogen for core refinery operations, a feat few industrial projects in India have attempted at scale. IOCL's green hydrogen investment is part of a broader infrastructure and policy ecosystem, with India's Green Hydrogen Mission aiming to produce 5 MMT per annum by 2030. The Panipat refinery alone consumes tens of thousands of tonnes of hydrogen per year, and IOCL is also ramping up upstream generation capacity through its subsidiary Terra Clean, which has committed INR 1,086 crore to develop 4.3 GW of renewable assets.

**India's Largest Green Hydrogen Plant to be Built in Panipat**
The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is building the country's largest green hydrogen plant in Panipat, near Delhi. The plant is expected to be operational by December 2027 and will produce 10,000 tons of green hydrogen per year. This will lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions and pollution. The company has said, 'This marks the entry of Indian Oil Corporation into the green hydrogen sector with what will be India's largest green hydrogen project to date.' The plant will replace fossil fuel-based hydrogen, resulting in a substantial decrease in carbon emissions. Green hydrogen is a clean fuel that can be used in various industries, including refineries, steel plants, and transportation. It is produced by splitting water using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. The IOC has stated that the Panipat project is aligned with the government's national green hydrogen mission and is a strategic initiative under the company's decarbonization roadmap. It is also a significant milestone towards achieving the company's goal of zero-carbon emissions, which will contribute to India's sustainable energy future.

**Bryansk Meat Processing Plant on the Verge of Bankruptcy**
The largest meat processing plant in Bryansk, OOO 'Bryansk Meat Processing Plant' (BMPP), is on the verge of bankruptcy due to the actions of its owner, Muhhtar Badyrkhanov. The plant's new owner, AO 'New Height', has accused Badyrkhanov of attempting to declare bankruptcy to avoid paying off debts of 2.7 billion rubles. According to Oleg Sheykin, a representative of the new owner, Badyrkhanov has been trying to bankrupt the plant for over a year, but there are no real grounds for bankruptcy. The financial situation at the plant is worse than at similar enterprises in the industry, but it can be saved with investments promised by the new owner. 'New Height' is willing to invest 500-1 billion rubles in the plant's renovation and equipment, as well as increase employee salaries by 30-40%. Sheykin believes that Badyrkhanov's actions are driven by his ambition and a desire to control the plant's finances for as long as possible. The plant's production capacity allows it to produce over 500 tons of sausage products, 80 tons of semi-finished products, and tens of thousands of meat cans per month. In the past, the plant was one of the most financially significant in the region, but its financial situation has deteriorated significantly. According to independent experts, the plant's financial situation is worse than that of similar enterprises in the industry. 'New Height' has offered Badyrkhanov a settlement agreement, but he has refused, citing no counter-proposals. Sheykin believes that Badyrkhanov's behavior is a 'typical example of abuse of power' and that a civilized court would reject his claim for fictitious bankruptcy.

**Study: Plant-Based Meat Alternatives Could Create Up to 250,000 New Jobs**
A study by Systemiq, commissioned by the Good Food Institute (GFI), suggests that plant-based meat alternatives could create up to 250,000 new jobs in the next 20 years, mainly in the machinery industry. The study estimates that the industry could contribute up to €65 billion to Germany's GDP by 2045. The domestic market is expected to contribute up to €23 billion, while exports, such as production equipment like extruders and fermenters, could generate up to €35 billion. Germany is in a unique position to become a leading player in the alternative protein sector, according to the study. The GFI also believes that increasing the production of plant-based products can help the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 4.8 million tons and reducing the land required for food production by up to 1.2 million hectares. The water requirements for plant-based products are also significantly lower. In 2023, the industry generated €2.2 billion in revenue, a new record high, and solidified Germany's position as the largest market for plant-based alternatives in Europe. To unlock the potential of the industry, the GFI is calling for increased government funding and support, including a boost in public research funding from €13 million to €140 million per year. They also recommend that canteens in kindergartens, schools, and hospitals prioritize plant-based products.
