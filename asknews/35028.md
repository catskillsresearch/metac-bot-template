**Global Emotions Report**
Gallup's 2024 Global Emotions Report found that the world was in a better place emotionally in 2023, with negative emotions dropping for the first time in a decade and positive emotions completing their rebound. However, 23% of adults worldwide reported experiencing loneliness during a lot of the previous day, with 54% of those who felt lonely also experiencing sadness. The report highlights the importance of emotions in our daily lives and notes that positive experiences rose overall, but negative experiences remained at a record high set in 2021. According to the report, El Salvador had the highest Positive Experience Index score, but worldwide negative experiences reached record highs in 2020.

**Electric Vehicles Continue to Break Records Despite Uncertainty**
Despite uncertainty in 2024, the market share of electric vehicles is becoming increasingly affordable and is expected to exceed 40% by 2030. Global electric vehicle sales are expected to reach 20 million in 2025, accounting for more than a quarter of the world's total vehicle sales. Despite economic downturns affecting the automotive sector, electric vehicles have continued to break records as they become more affordable. In 2024, global sales exceeded 17 million, with electric vehicles accounting for over 20% of the global market for the first time. In the first three months of 2025, electric vehicle sales increased by 35% compared to the previous year. All major markets and many other markets set new records in their first-quarter sales. China, which accounted for nearly half of all vehicle sales in 2024, remains the leader in the electric vehicle market. In 2023, over 11 million electric vehicles were sold in China, while Asia and Latin America's emerging markets have become new growth centers, with total electric vehicle sales in these regions increasing by over 60% in 2024. In the US, electric vehicle sales increased by around 10% annually, reaching one in ten vehicles sold. In Europe, sales were sluggish, but electric vehicles accounted for around 20% of the market. Despite uncertainty, electric vehicles are showing strong growth globally, with sales continuing to break new records. By 2025, it is expected that more than a quarter of all vehicles sold worldwide will be electric, and as electric vehicles become increasingly affordable, it is expected that more than half will be electric. Emerging markets in Asia and Latin America have become new growth centers, with total electric vehicle sales in these regions increasing by over 60% in 2024 and market share increasing from 2.5% to 4%. In these regions, total electric vehicle sales increased by over 400,000 in 2024, with a 40% increase over 2023. Despite global economic growth and trade and industrial policy uncertainties, the global average price of an electric vehicle decreased in 2024 due to increased competition and falling battery costs. In China, over two-thirds of all electric vehicles sold in 2024 were cheaper than their traditional equivalents without purchase incentives, while in many other markets, the price difference between traditional and electric vehicles continued. However, charging costs and today's home electricity prices still make traditional vehicles significantly more advantageous.

**Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' Benefits the Rich, Hurts the Poor**
The 'Big Beautiful Bill' proposed by Donald Trump aims to reduce taxes for the wealthy and cut social programs. According to Oxfam, the 10 richest people in America have seen their wealth increase by $365 billion in the last year, which would take 10 average workers 726,000 years to earn. The bill would benefit the top 10% of earners, who would receive 65% of the bill's value, while the bottom 20% would lose $1,035 per year by 2026 due to cuts to Medicaid and Snap. 'The wealth of the billionaires has increased astronomically, while many ordinary people struggle to make ends meet,' said Rebecca Riddell, Oxfam America's economic and racial justice policy director. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and a close friend of Trump, would benefit the most, with his wealth increasing by $186 billion in 2024. If the trend continues, Musk could become the first trillionaire in history by 2027. The bill would also cut social programs, including Medicaid and Snap, to finance tax cuts for the wealthy. 'It's a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich,' said Riddell. 'A 3% tax on fortunes over $1 billion would generate over $50 billion per year, enough to cover the entire federal budget for housing assistance or provide a year of food assistance for over 22 million Americans.'

**Top 10 Richest Americans See $365 Billion Increase in Wealth**
The combined wealth of the top 10 richest Americans has grown by $365 billion in 2024, according to Oxfam. This would take an average American worker 726,000 years to earn. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the world's richest person, saw the largest increase, with a gain of $186 billion, more than half of the total increase. Analysts predict that Musk may become the world's first trillionaire. Other billionaires who saw significant gains include Mark Zuckerberg ($38.7 billion), Rob Walton ($38.7 billion), Jim Walton ($36.5 billion), and Warren Buffett ($34.8 billion). Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google) lost some of their wealth. The growth of the top 10 billionaires is equivalent to $1 billion per day, while the average American worker earned around $50,000 in 2024. This comes as a new law proposal in the US, supported by Donald Trump and Republicans, is being discussed. Critics argue that it will exacerbate inequality, with 65% of the benefits going to the top 10% of Americans, and the poorest 20% potentially losing around $1,000 in 2026 due to reduced social programs, as stated by Oxfam. 'The growth of wealth among the top 10 billionaires is a stark reminder of the widening wealth gap in the US,' said Oxfam. 'It would take an average worker 726,000 years to earn the same amount of money that these billionaires have gained in just one year.'

**US's Richest 10 People Increase Fortunes by $365 Billion in 2024, Says Oxfam**
According to a new analysis by Oxfam, the 10 richest people in the US increased their fortunes by $365 billion in 2024, equivalent to a daily gain of around $1 billion. In contrast, the median worker in the US earned around $50,000 in 2023. It would take 726,000 years for 10 workers with median income to reach the same value. 'We are seeing a wealth increase that is astronomical while many ordinary people struggle to survive,' said Rebecca Riddell, senior leader of economic and racial justice policy at Oxfam America. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, accumulated $186 billion in this period, making him the richest person in the world. A recent study suggests that Musk is on track to become the first trillionaire on the planet. Other billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg and Rob Walton saw their wealth grow by $38.7 billion each, while Warren Buffett and Jim Walton accumulated $34.8 billion and $36.5 billion, respectively. However, the cofounders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, saw a reduction in their wealth: $27.2 billion and $25.4 billion, respectively. Oxfam warns that the proposed tax cuts will benefit the rich and cut almost $1 trillion from essential social programs. 'We are seeing a tax code being developed that will result in the first trillionaire in the world,' said Rebecca Riddell. To combat inequality, some progressive politicians advocate for a wealth tax on ultra-millionaires and billionaires. Oxfam estimates that a 3% tax on wealth above $1 billion would raise $50 billion from the 10 richest Americans, enough to provide food assistance for 22.5 million people for a year.

**Summer vacations are being hit by a growing wealth divide**
A recent survey by Bankrate found that only 53% of Americans plan to take a summer vacation, citing cost as the main factor. However, high-income Americans are still traveling and spending, with luxury travel outpacing every other segment. According to Deloitte, nearly half of respondents who said they planned to travel this summer made over $100,000, up from 35% in 2023. Middle-income Americans are cutting back on travel spending, with Las Vegas seeing a major drop-off. Companies like airlines, hotels, and home rentals are still seeing 'some pretty healthy bottom lines' due to rising prices and wealthy people's strong appetite for travel. The growing divergence between budget and luxury travel is leaving a massive middle ground of people who can't afford steep prices. However, some companies are starting to tap into this market and win back cash-strapped middle-income travelers.

**Krankenkassenprämien: Comparis predicts 4% increase in 2026**
Comparis, a comparison service, predicts that health insurance premiums will rise by an average of 4% in 2026. The increase is attributed to three factors: the growth of overall healthcare costs, which are expected to rise by 4.4% in 2024, 3.7% in 2025, and 3.4% in 2026. Additionally, hospitals are seeking higher tariffs due to losses in recent years, and the implementation of the care initiative will also incur costs. The actual increase in premiums will be announced by the Federal Council in the fall. In recent years, premiums have risen by 6% in the current year, 8.7% in 2024, and 6.6% in 2023.

**The US Debt Problem: A Deep-Rooted Issue**
The Moody's rating agency downgraded the US sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1 on May 16, citing increased government debt and interest payments. This has significant implications for US government bonds, the US dollar, the US economy, and government economic policies. The loss of the AAA rating is a manifestation of the US economic problems. The US has been experiencing a 'double deficit' of fiscal and trade deficits for a long time. The fiscal deficit has been increasing, with a peak in 2020 and 2021, and a decline in 2022, but an increase again in 2023. The interest payments on the debt have also increased significantly, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.07% in 2022 and 2.97% in 2023. The trade deficit has also been a major issue, with the US becoming a net debtor country in 1985 and increasing its net foreign debt in recent years. The US has the largest net foreign debt in the world, with a net foreign debt of $26.23 trillion in 2024, equivalent to 89.89% of its nominal GDP. The US government's assets and liabilities show that it has a net debt of $20.82 trillion, which is a technical bankruptcy. The US government's debt has increased significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic, with a net increase of $22.91 trillion. The US government's overseas net debt has also increased, with a net foreign debt of $26.23 trillion in 2024. The US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has said that the US has lost $20 trillion in national wealth over the past 20 years due to globalization, and that the US has become a net debtor country. The US needs to change its approach to globalization and focus on rebuilding its manufacturing industry and reducing its trade deficit. The US also needs to restore its traditional values and avoid debt, as the country's founders warned against the dangers of debt. The US needs to have a strong will and a sense of responsibility to overcome its debt problem, which is a difficult and painful process.

**Billionaires' Wealth Surges by $365 Billion, Leaving Ordinary Americans Behind**
The wealth of the top 10 richest Americans has increased by $365 billion in the past year, despite a brief market panic, according to a new analysis by the British non-profit organization Oxfam. This increase, described by CNN as 'astronomical', translates to a daily gain of approximately $1 billion for these billionaires. In contrast, the average annual income of an American worker is around $50,000. Oxfam found that it would take 726,000 years for 10 average-income workers to earn the same amount. 'The increase is astronomical while many ordinary people struggle to make ends meet,' said Rebecca Riddell, Oxfam America's senior policy advisor for economic and racial justice. Elon Musk alone saw his wealth increase by $186.1 billion. Musk, the world's richest man and CEO of Tesla, represents more than half of the total wealth gain. According to CNN, an analysis last fall found that Musk is on track to become the world's first trillionaire. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, and Rob Walton, Walmart's heir, each saw their net worth increase by $38.7 billion. Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, gained $34.8 billion, while Jim Walton, Walmart's heir, gained $36.5 billion. Some billionaires, such as Larry Page and Sergey Brin, co-founders of Google, lost wealth during this period. Oxfam has called for measures to address income inequality in the US, including a 3% wealth tax on those with over $1 billion in net worth, which would raise $50 billion from the top 10 richest Americans alone, enough to provide food aid for 22.5 million people for a year. However, CNN notes that imposing a wealth tax would be extremely difficult due to the complexity of valuing net worth.

**US Wealth Concentration Reaches New Heights in 2024**
According to JPMorgan Chase's predictions, the number of billionaires in the US increased from 1,370 in 2021 to 1,990 in 2024, a 45% increase in three years. The top 19 richest families in the US created $1 trillion in new wealth in 2024, exceeding the value of the entire Swiss economy. Economist Gabriel Zakman, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Paris School of Economics, analyzed the data and stated, 'We are seeing a gradual increase in the share of wealth held by the super elite, and a very rapid acceleration in recent times.' The total wealth of US households is expected to reach $148 trillion by the end of 2024, according to Zakman's methodology. The wealth of the super rich has outpaced the growth of other social groups, with the average net wealth of all groups increasing due to the growth of the US economy since 1990. Zakman noted, 'We are seeing a gradual increase in the share of wealth held by the super elite, and a very rapid acceleration in recent times.' The number of American billionaires also increased from 975 in 2021 to 1,150 in 2023, with a total wealth of approximately $4.9 trillion.

**Generation Z's Wealth to Surpass Any Other Generation by 2040, Says Bank of America**
According to Bank of America, the wealth of Generation Z will surpass that of any other generation by 2040. By 2030, this generation, composed of people born after 1995, will accumulate global income of $36 trillion, and this figure will almost double to $74 trillion by 2040. In 2023, this amount was only $9 trillion, representing unprecedented growth in intergenerational terms. Beyond income, consumption is a key driver of this change. Generation Z already shows more dynamic spending patterns than the rest of the population, both in basic and discretionary products. According to internal Bank of America data, the group's spending on entertainment increased 25.5% year-over-year in February 2025, while travel spending grew 13.8% in the same comparison. These figures far exceed those of the rest of the population, indicating that young adults are defining new economic priorities. However, this growth has structural consequences. Although their income increases, savings levels do not follow the same pace. The Bank of America Institute report indicates that the Generation Z spending-to-savings ratio reached 1.93 in February 2025, implying that they are spending almost twice as much as they have saved. Although deposit balances have improved compared to the previous year, the high cost of living continues to affect their finances. The strong increase in income has not guaranteed a stable labor insertion for all. According to Bank of America Institute data, the number of Gen Z households receiving unemployment benefits grew 32% year-over-year in February. This is added to a 9.3% increase in unemployment among new entrants to the labor market, suggesting a more complex labor environment for young people, despite having higher educational levels than previous generations. However, the growth in wages offers a relative respite. In the same month, Gen Z's net salary grew 8% year-over-year, leading all generations. This trend reflects, in part, that many young people are accessing their first jobs, which can inflate the percentage growth compared to generations with more consolidated labor trajectories. The financial behavior of Gen Z is volatile. Although they recognize the importance of saving, many cannot save enough. A survey cited by Bank of America in its Better Money Habits 2024 report states that 52% of respondents do not earn enough to maintain the lifestyle they desire. And 32% say they feel behind what their parents had achieved at their age in terms of financial goals. This gap forces many to adjust their habits. Two-thirds of respondents reported reducing their spending on leisure, such as dining out or social gatherings, in an attempt to contain the imbalance between income and expenses. Nevertheless, according to Bank of America, Gen Z's total participation in US consumption remains below 20%, although it is expected to increase significantly in the next decade. The impact of Generation Z goes beyond volume. According to Bank of America Global Research, their preferences mark a shift towards digital consumption, sustainable products, and a greater interest in experiences over goods. This change affects industries such as entertainment, retail, transportation, and food, where companies seek to adapt to their values and habits. Additionally, it is expected that this generation will be at the center of a massive wealth transfer in the coming years. As Baby Boomers transfer assets to their descendants, Gen Z and Millennials will inherit a significant portion of global private capital, consolidating their position as a determining force in markets.

**Women's Increased Presence in the Workforce Could Add Up to 20% to Global GDP**
A Bank of America Institute study found that the gap in annual income growth between men and women is decreasing, from 6.5% in 2022 to 4% in 2024. The study estimates that closing the employment gap between men and women could add $1.1 trillion to the US GDP. If there were also equal pay, the annual impact would be $866 billion. In an ideal scenario, where both inequalities are eliminated, the economic growth could reach $2.1 trillion, a 7.5% increase in GDP. The study also found that achieving parity in employment and salaries could add up to 20% to the global GDP per capita. The study highlights the 'Great Transfer of Wealth', where $124 trillion in wealth will be transferred in the US by 2048, surpassing the 2023 global GDP. $54 trillion will be inherited by widows, and $47 trillion will go to younger women. This phenomenon will transform the economy, as women will have more control over investments and consumption patterns. They are also more financially literate and investing in long-term assets, such as real estate and companies. The study notes that the increase in female wealth has already modified various economic sectors, such as sports, travel, and health. As women have more disposable income, the demand for previously undervalued products increases. 'However, these expenses do not need to come at the expense of men. As women become richer, it helps to 'increase the pie' of total affluence, expanding opportunities for everyone,' say the Bank of America Institute researchers.

**Worldwide, 57% Expect The Next Generation To Be Worse Off Financially - What Drives This Economic Pessimism?**
A 2024 Pew Research Center survey found that 57% of adults worldwide believe that children today will be financially worse off than their parents. This concern is more prevalent in higher-income countries, where at least 75% of people share this view. The widening wealth gap, rising cost of housing, stagnant wages, and pressures from inflation are major factors contributing to this uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic has also played a significant role in shaping public opinion on economic concerns, with 15 of the 31 countries surveyed showing an increase in pessimism. For example, Germany saw a 19-percentage-point increase in pessimism between 2019 and 2024. The research also shows that people who are dissatisfied with their country's economic circumstances and democracy are more likely to express pessimism about the next generation's future. However, countries in South and Southeast Asia, such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, are more optimistic about the financial future of children, driven by rapid economic growth, expanding middle classes, and technological advancements.

**The Growing Wealth Gap: A Wake-Up Call for the Normal People**
The Oxfam report on global wealth distribution reveals that the number of people living in poverty is increasing, while the number of billionaires is also growing. The report highlights the increasing speed at which global inequality is worsening. The five richest individuals on the planet have a combined wealth that exceeds that of hundreds of countries. They earn in two minutes or less the average annual salary of a person in the Western world. The report also states that the richest 12 individuals emit as much CO2 as two million households. The Oxfam director, Amitabh Behar, says, 'We ask you to see this report as a wake-up call for the normal people who are being crushed by the wealth of a tiny minority.' The report warns that we will see our first billionaire in the next 10 years and that by 2035, there will be five billionaires. The report concludes that the wealth of the richest is growing at a rate three times faster than in 2023, with nearly four new billionaires added per week. Meanwhile, 3.6 billion people still live below the poverty line of $6.85 per day.

**The Wealth of the Super-Rich Grows Exponentially, Leaving Millions in Poverty**
The combined wealth of the world's super-rich, those with economic, financial, or asset portfolios worth over $1 billion, increased by $2 trillion in 2024, equivalent to a daily growth of $7.7 billion. This growth rate tripled that of 2023, according to a report by the global organization Oxfam. The number of super-rich individuals rose from 2,565 to 2,769 between 2023 and 2024, and their combined wealth increased from $13 trillion to $15 trillion in just one year. Even the combined wealth of the world's top 10 richest men increased, on average, by nearly $100 million per day. Oxfam notes that 'they are so rich that even if they lost 99% of their wealth overnight, they would still be millionaires.' The report highlights that the increase in wealth concentration is linked to the growing power of the market, which allows the super-rich to exert greater control over the economy and public opinion. However, the number of people living in poverty has barely changed since 1990, with 44% of the world's population living on less than $6.85 per day, according to the World Bank. The report also notes that 60% of the super-rich's wealth is inherited or marked by clientelism and corruption linked to monopolistic market power. 'A small, privileged elite has captured the world economy to unprecedented or even unimaginable levels,' said Oxfam International Executive Director Amitabh Behar. 'Not only are the super-rich becoming more numerous and their wealth greater, but they also have more power.' The report emphasizes that the concentration of wealth is linked to the growing power of the market, which allows the super-rich to exert greater control over the economy and public opinion. In contrast, many countries are struggling with public debt and do not have sufficient resources to combat inequality. The report concludes that it is time to tax those who have the means to do so.

**10 Shocking Facts About Wealth in 2024**
A recent study by Oxfam found that the wealth of the world's billionaires has seen an unprecedented surge, with the wealth of the top 1% of the world's population tripling in just 2024. The study showed that the majority of financial gains are concentrated in the hands of this elite group, while poverty continues to affect half of the world's population. Oxfam highlighted ten shocking facts about wealth in 2024, revealing the vast gap between the rich and the poor. Some of the key points include: The wealth of the world's top 10 billionaires has grown by approximately $100 million per day on average. Even if someone saved $1,000 per day since the beginning of creation, they would not be able to accumulate the wealth of any of the world's top 10 billionaires. If one of the world's top 10 billionaires lost 99% of their wealth, they would still be a billionaire. The total wealth of billionaires increased by $1 trillion in 2024. 204 new billionaires were discovered, equivalent to 4 new billionaires per week. The top 1% of the world's population owns 45% of the world's wealth. The number of poor people has increased to 3.6 billion, representing 44% of the world's population. $30 million in wealth is transferred from the global south to the top 1% of the world's population every hour. It is predicted that 5 trillionaires will emerge in the next decade, with Elon Musk being one of them. One in ten women in the world lives in extreme poverty, with a daily income of less than $2.15. 'Oxfam's report highlights the extreme inequality that exists in the world,' said Oxfam. 'The wealth of the richest 1% has grown by $1 trillion in 2024, while the number of people living in poverty has increased by 100 million. This is a stark reminder of the need for urgent action to address the root causes of poverty and inequality.'

**Insanity: Billionaire wealth has risen three times faster in 2024 than 2023 – Five trillionaires are now expected within a decade**
The wealth of billionaires has increased three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, with five trillionaires expected within a decade. However, the number of people living in poverty has remained largely unchanged since 1990. According to a report, 60% of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, cronyism, corruption, or monopoly power. The current economic system perpetuates colonialism, with the richest people benefiting from the exploitation of marginalized groups. The World Bank's voting system, for example, gives the average Belgian 180 times more power than the average Ethiopian. The report calls for reparations to be made to those who were enslaved and colonized, and for the economic system to be made more equal to end poverty. The cost should be borne by the richest people who benefit the most, according to the report.

**Billionaires' Wealth Doubles in 2024, Study Reveals**
A new study by 'Oxfam International' reveals a significant increase in the wealth of billionaires worldwide, with a three-fold increase in the rate of growth compared to last year. The study, released during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, expects at least 5 trillionaires to emerge in the next decade, up from the previous estimate of one trillionaire. The study also found that the wealth of billionaires increased by $5.7 billion per day last year, a rate three times faster than in 2023. 'The world's richest 1% have seen their wealth increase by $5.7 billion every day last year, while the 3.8 billion people who make up the rest of the world have seen their wealth decline by 11% since the pandemic,' said the study. 'This is a stark reminder of the widening gap between the rich and the poor.'

**Billionaires' Wealth Increases by $2 Trillion in 2024, According to Oxfam Report**
According to a report by Oxfam, titled 'Takers, not Makers', the wealth of the world's billionaires increased by $2 trillion in 2024, a growth rate three times higher than in 2023. The report found that the accumulation of wealth averaged $5.7 billion per day during 2024, and the number of billionaires grew by 204 people, totaling 2,769 worldwide. Their combined wealth increased from $13 trillion to $15 trillion in a year, making it the second-largest annual increase on record. Oxfam noted that 60% of this wealth comes from factors such as inheritance, cronyism, corruption, or monopolistic power. The report highlights that progress in reducing extreme poverty has stalled, with 3.6 billion people living on less than $6.85 per day, accounting for 44% of the global population. Anna Marriott, Oxfam's inequality policy lead, stated, 'The exponential growth of wealth could accelerate the emergence of the world's first billionaires. Last year, we predicted that the first billionaire could emerge in a decade, but this surprising acceleration means that the world is on track to have at least five.' Oxfam is calling for higher taxes on billionaires and wealth redistribution policies to combat extreme poverty and strengthen public services globally.
