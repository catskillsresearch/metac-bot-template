**Prediction Markets Take Over $40 Million in Papal Bets**
Prediction market operators Polymarket and Kalshi took in over $40 million in wagers on the papal conclave's outcome, with only 416 of 33,000 bets correctly identifying the winner, Cardinal Robert Prevost of Chicago. Kalshi's biggest payout was $52,641 on an anonymous bettor's successful $526 prediction. The prediction market model has raised concerns about regulation, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) targeting Polymarket with a fine and settlement in 2022, while dropping a similar appeal against Kalshi. Despite these challenges, the model is proving successful, with global betting group Flutter reportedly investigating offering its own prediction markets.

**US Sports Betting Operators Report Decline in Profits Amid Successful Bets and Slowing Growth**
Major US sports betting operators, Flutter (owner of FanDuel) and DraftKings, have reported a decline in quarterly profits due to a series of successful bets from clients and signs of slowing growth in the industry. Both companies have revised their annual financial forecasts downward. DraftKings has reduced its revenue forecast by $200 million to $6.4 billion, and its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) forecast by $100 million to $900 million. Flutter has also reduced its adjusted EBITDA forecast for the US market by $180 million to $1.13 billion. The main blow to margins came from the March NCAA March Madness tournament, which CEO of Flutter Peter Jackson called 'historic', with all favorites winning in the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 rounds, a rare occurrence in the tournament's history. This significantly reduced the income of bookmakers after the February Super Bowl, which had worked in their favor. Since the legalization of sports betting in 2018, the US market has shown rapid growth, reaching $14 billion in revenue in 2023, according to the American Gaming Association. FanDuel and DraftKings have long held the lead, but in recent quarters have begun to lose market share. According to Barclays, Flutter's market share has fallen from 62% in the first quarter of 2023 to 48% in the first quarter of 2024, while DraftKings has fallen from 39% to 31%. Analysts note that competitors such as BetMGM, Bet365, and Fanatics are actively closing the gap with capital and an aggressive marketing strategy. Additionally, investors are beginning to pay more attention to the instability of margins in the sports betting segment rather than just revenue growth. As OBOZ.UA reported, March 2025 was a historic month for online casinos in the US, with a total gross revenue of $905.6 million in seven states where digital casino platforms are legalized, a 26.2% increase from the same period last year.

**Recession Odds Fall Below 50% On Polymarket As Crypto Bettors Digest US-China Trade Deal News**
The odds of a US recession in 2025 have fallen below 50% on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market, following the US-China trade deal announcement. The probability dropped from 52% to 49% over the last 24 hours, with over $5 million wagered on the bet. The outcome resolves to 'Yes' if the economy experiences another quarter of negative growth or if the National Bureau of Economic Research declares a recession before January 1, 2026. President Donald Trump said that 'great progress' was made during the talks and that a 'total reset' could be expected, which led to stock futures spiking and the Dow Jones Futures rallying over 400 points Sunday night.

**US Bookmakers Complain of Luck: More Wins, Less Money**
The largest US sports betting operators, Flutter (owner of FanDuel) and DraftKings, have reported a decline in quarterly profits due to a series of successful bets by clients and initial signs of slowing growth in the industry.

**Global iGaming Market to Grow 12% Through 2030**
The global online gambling market is projected to reach $154 billion by 2030, growing at an 11.9% compound annual rate over the next five years, according to Grand View Research, Inc.

The sports betting category dominated market share in 2024, accounting for more than 50% of global online gambling revenue. The mobile segment is expected to experience the highest CAGR during the forecast period, supported by the global growth of immersive online applications and the convenience of smartphones and tablets. Europe led the market last year with about 41% of total revenue share, followed by North America, which is expected to reach $32.95 billion by 2030.

**1% of Bets on New Pope Correct, Robert Francis Prevost Assumes Position**
Only 1% of bets on the Polymarket platform correctly predicted the new pope, Robert Francis Prevost. According to Ricardo Magri, an expert in iGaming business development at the Empresa Brasileira de Apoio ao Compulsivo (EBAC), this type of bet is prohibited in Brazil. 'This occurred after the regulation of the sector in the country, on January 1, 2025, which limited bets to two categories: real sports events and virtual games with random results,' he said. The platform showed that Prevost moved US$ 1.1 million (R$ 6.2 million) in bets just minutes after the announcement. A total of US$ 29 million (R$ 164.73 million) were bet on the Polymarket session about who would be the next pope, with almost US$ 9 million (R$ 51.12 million) between yesterday and today.

**A big threat to the gambling world was on full display at one of the industry's top conferences**
The US gambling industry is facing a threat from emerging formats like prediction markets, sweepstakes, and new daily fantasy models. These challenger brands are gaining traction and are regulated differently from sports betting and online gambling. Prediction markets, such as those offered by Crypto.com, Kalshi, and Polymarket, are legal in all 50 US states and are being reviewed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Chris Grove, cofounder and general partner of Acies Investments, said that prediction markets could 'upend' the dynamic between gambling operators and regulators. Grove also suggested that gambling operators could consider pushing into predictions, and that apps like Kalshi could evolve to offer full-game parlays, making them more like sports betting. AI, crypto gaming, M&A, and the impact of tariffs were also major themes at the Next.io's Next Summit in New York. Despite tensions and economic uncertainty, the broader outlook among gambling companies was relatively rosy, with investors predicting an uptick in M&A in the next 12 to 24 months.

**Polymarket: A Platform for Problematic Bets and Election Interference**
Polymarket, a US-based prediction market platform, has been criticized for a recent bet on the death of Pope Francis in 2025. This is not the first time the platform, which uses cryptocurrencies, has been under fire for problematic bets. The platform has been known to host controversial bets, and is banned in the US but easily accessible with a VPN. In France, its use is blocked by the National Gaming Authority since November 2024. Polymarket has been accused of facilitating election interference by allowing large investments without limits, potentially influencing election results. A French user made $155 million betting on Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election. The platform has been criticized for its lack of regulation and has been accused of being used for election manipulation. Despite this, Polymarket has not suspended election-related bets, and has instead relocated to avoid federal regulation threats.

**Want to bet on the future of Canada? A gambling firm operating in Ontario mulled such an offer**
PowerPlay.com, an online gambling brand operating in Ontario, initially considered offering odds on whether the United States would annex Canada by the end of Donald Trump's second term. However, the proposed bet was called down due to 'compliance' concerns. Stephen Murdoch of Enterprise Canada stated, 'This market was never live in Ontario.' The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) regulates the market and considers such bets as 'novelty events.' The AGCO has criteria for determining what constitutes a 'novelty event,' including requirements for documentation and verification. The regulator did not comment on whether a bet on the future of Canada would be considered 'reasonably objectionable.' Meanwhile, the U.S.-based Polymarket website is allowing users to place money on various scenarios in Canada, including whether Canada will become the 51st U.S. state by July 2025.

**Singapore, Thailand authorities move to block crypto betting site Polymarket - report - TNGlobal**
Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority blocked access to Polymarket in December, as it was deemed to be providing unlawful gambling, according to a spokesperson. Users reported losing access to the site over the weekend. In Thailand, law enforcement is preparing to propose a similar ban, citing that Polymarket uses cryptocurrency for trades and bets, making it an illegal online gambling platform. The platform's popularity peaked during the US election, with nearly $5 billion in volume recorded across October and November, but volumes and open interest have since fallen significantly. Regulatory scrutiny has mounted, including restrictions in France and Taiwan, and an ongoing inquiry by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

**Singapore Blocks Access to Polymarket Amid Strengthened Gambling Enforcement**
Singapore has blocked access to Polymarket, a platform where cryptocurrency enthusiasts can place bets, due to the Gambling Control Act 2022, which prohibits gambling through unlicensed providers. As of January 1, 2025, Singapore has strengthened enforcement of illegal gambling, blocking over 3,800 websites and freezing transactions worth $27 million. Users attempting to access Polymarket from Singapore will receive a warning. The only authorized online gaming provider in Singapore is Singapore Pools, with other providers risking fines up to $500,000 and up to 7 years in prison. At Polymarket, users can place bets on various outcomes using the USD Coin (USDC).
