**Danish PM Warns NATO Allies: 2% Defense Spending Goal 'Very Late'**
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned her regional allies on Monday that NATO's goal of increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2032 will be 'very late'. Frederiksen, who is attending a NATO meeting in Lithuania, commented on the proposal to increase defense and security spending to 5% of GDP by 2032, as demanded by US President Donald Trump. She said, 'I hope we can agree on 3.5% for the military and 1.5% for broader defense spending at the NATO summit in The Hague (June 24-26)'. She added, 'The question now is whether we will achieve that before 2032? In my opinion, this is very late'. Trump has demanded that European countries, as well as Canada, allocate at least 5% of their GDP for defense spending within the alliance. In response, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg proposed a 3.5% of GDP for direct defense spending by 2034, and 1.5% for broader security spending. Frederiksen has significantly increased Denmark's defense spending since taking office in 2019, especially since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. She said, 'When I became Prime Minister, I allocated 1.3% of the total for defense'. She continued, 'Now we spend more than 3%, but this is not enough. We need to increase defense spending in the coming years'.

**'World has changed': Starmer plans UK army ready to fight in Europe to give message to Putin, Trump**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced plans to increase military spending to 3% of national income by 2034, with a focus on building new nuclear-powered attack submarines, preparing the army to fight a war in Europe, and becoming a 'battle-ready, armor-clad nation.' The move is intended to send a message to Moscow and Washington, and follows a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer. The review recommends increasing production of submarines and weapons, establishing a cyber command to counter Russia-linked attacks, and investing 15 billion pounds in Britain's nuclear arsenal. Starmer said the plans would create a 'defense dividend' of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs, but it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The UK's defense spending is currently on track to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027, but some leaders in Nato think 3.5% is needed to deter Russia from future attacks.

**UK Prepares for War Amid Rising Tensions in Europe**
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's predecessor, Keir Starmer, announced that the UK is increasing its defense investments to prepare its armed forces for combat amid rising tensions in Europe. Starmer stated, 'We are moving to a [regime] of readiness for combat as the primary goal of our armed forces.' He emphasized that the country's security will be based on partnership with NATO allies, and the UK will never fight alone: 'Our defense policy will always be primarily focused on NATO.' Starmer highlighted that the alliance is 'a fundamental source of strategic power' for the UK, and the country aims to implement innovations in its armed forces 'at the speed of war.' He plans to make British forces 'ten times more lethal by 2035.'

**Britain to get defence boost to send message to Moscow  --  and possibly Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with the UK building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would 'transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment' and that the 3% goal is 'on track' to be met. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks. The UK will also invest £15 billion in its nuclear arsenal and increase its conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons. Mr. Starmer said re-arming would create a 'defence dividend' of well-paid jobs, and the move is also a message to President Donald Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defence.

**'Threat of Russia cannot be ignored' Starmer tells BBC as he unveils defence spending plans**
Keir Starmer has stated that the threat of Russia cannot be ignored, emphasizing the need for increased defence spending to 3% of GDP. Lord Dannatt, former head of the British Army, agrees that this should be accelerated, suggesting it should be achieved by the end of the current Parliament in 2029, rather than 2034. He warns that if the UK waits until 2034, it would be equivalent to telling Hitler to wait until 1946 to attack, which would be 'daft'. Military experts believe there is a possibility of a Russian attack on Europe within two to four years, and Lord Dannatt urges the UK to rapidly increase the capability of its armed forces to address this threat.

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**We are at War: The Fragmentation of Reality and the European Union's Military Plans**
In a world of increasing geopolitical polarization, the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will be a reflection of the fragmentation of our reality, which we will witness as spectators over the next two decades, looking towards the Far East. The author, a professor, has announced to their students that we are at war, just like they did in February 2022, when the drums of war were first heard. This time, the European Union is taking steps towards a possible war in five years, as announced in the Joint White Paper 'Rearm Europe 2030', which aims to prepare the European defense. The plan will cost an additional 800 billion euros over the next four years, on top of the general budget. As the author says, 'we are giving the enemy day and hour'.

**Germany Calls for Increased Bundeswehr Strength, Aims to Create Strongest Army in Europe**
The head of the German Bundeswehr Association, Andre Wuestner, has called for an increase in the number of German soldiers from approximately 180,000 to 260,000. 'The Bundeswehr must be bigger,' he said, adding that he cannot imagine a new military service without a mandatory element. Hans Christoph Atzpodien, head of the Federal Association for Industrial Security and Defense, believes that creating the 'strongest army in Europe' is possible, but notes that certain prerequisites must be met. 'Although money is available in principle, we still lack a real federal budget for specific investments,' he explained. The German military is set to be fully equipped with weapons by 2029, as ordered by the Inspector General of the German Armed Forces, Carsten Breuer. The Bundeswehr will conduct large-scale exercises in Hamburg in September 2025 to practice responses to a potential Russian attack on NATO countries. According to General-Major Vadim Skibitsky, Russia is considering 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045, six of which involve Northern Europe and four involve Poland. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has stated that NATO will respond 'with full force' in the event of a Russian attack on a member country. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has also warned of the possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2029-2030, emphasizing the importance of strengthening the alliance's defenses before then.

**Germany Announces Plan to Build 'Strongest Conventional Army in Europe' by 2031**
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced a major defense policy: Germany will build the 'strongest conventional army in Europe' by 2031, significantly strengthening its military capabilities to counter the current Russian-Ukrainian war and regional security challenges. According to internal documents and government statements, the military reform focuses on increasing the defense budget to 5% of GDP (currently 2.1%), expanding the active military force to 240,000, upgrading the air force, navy, and army, and deploying 4,000 troops to Lithuania to strengthen NATO's eastern flank. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht emphasized that the military must be fully equipped by 2029, with two key priorities: strengthening air defense, especially drone intercept capabilities, and establishing a long-range precision strike system, including missiles with a range of over 500 kilometers. This move has sparked speculation that Germany may lift its restrictions on providing Ukraine with weapons, including the Taurus missile with a range of over 500 kilometers. Scholz has stated that Berlin 'no longer limits the type of weapons provided to Kiev', indicating a more positive attitude.

**Germany eyes strongest EU army by 2031**
Germany's new Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, plans to make the Bundeswehr the 'strongest conventional army in Europe' by 2031. This comes after the government accepted the US President's demand to invest 5% of GDP in defense, a historic turnaround in security policy. The Bundeswehr currently has around 182,000 soldiers and plans to increase this number to at least 203,000 by 2031. Other EU countries, such as France, Poland, and the UK, also have ambitious plans for their armed forces. France aims to nearly double its defense spending, while Poland plans to expand its ranks to 500,000 troops. The UK will focus on high-tech equipment, including drones and artificial intelligence. Despite these multibillion euro rearmament programs, little is likely to change in the global ranking of military strength in the medium term.

**EU Prepares for War with Russia: 'Readiness 2030' Document Reveals Plans**
The European Union is preparing for war with Russia, according to a document called 'Readiness 2030'. This was stated by Rusalan Kossygin, a deputy in the National Assembly and a retired general major, in a program called 'PRO Army' on 'SB TV'. Kossygin noted that the document outlines plans to spend up to 800 billion euros on military expenses. He stated that the EU is aware of its current military weakness and is taking steps to address it, including rearming its military and improving logistics. Kossygin emphasized that the EU's preparations for war are a serious threat that could pose a military danger in the future. 'We cannot afford to be complacent,' he said. 'This is a real threat that could become a military danger for us in the future.'

**Rearming Europe Requires Time and Caution, Not Haste**
European Union President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that by 2030, the EU should have a 'credible' military deterrence. However, the author of the article argues that this goal should be approached with caution and not rushed. The author suggests that before creating a unified European defense, a federal union should be established, with a single country or federal basis, to provide a solid foundation for a European army. The author also questions the need to create a defense structure that is divided among states, saying 'we are buying furniture while the house is still under construction.' The author also notes that the threat of Russia is often exaggerated in the media, stating 'Russia will never attack Europe.'

**EU Faces Military Recruitment Challenges Amid 'Russian Threat'**
The European Union is facing a significant challenge in terms of military recruitment, particularly in the face of the 'Russian threat'. The EU's ability to wage war in the future is uncertain, and it is unclear whether it will be able to build enough tanks and aircraft. Additionally, there is a question of whether the EU will be able to reintroduce conscription, and if so, whether there will be enough recruits to fill the ranks. Currently, only a few EU countries, such as Austria, Greece, and Denmark, have mandatory military service. However, some countries, like Lithuania and Latvia, have reintroduced conscription in recent years. France, for example, has a significant shortage of recruits, with over 2,000 soldiers missing from the ranks in 2023. The French army is trying to recruit 4,200 young people per year, but those who want to enlist often lack the physical abilities required. The army is trying to create 6,000 new positions by 2030. In Germany, the Bundeswehr has 181,600 soldiers, but there is a shortage of recruits. The German government is considering reintroducing conscription, but it is unclear whether this will be possible. In Spain, the military service was abolished in 2001, and in Italy, it was abolished in 2005. Poland has a significant military presence, with 202,100 individuals, but the country is also facing a demographic crisis. The EU's military recruitment challenges are significant, and it is unclear whether the bloc will be able to meet its military needs in the future.

**Europe's military personnel shortfalls exposed**
NATO leaders approved a set of military plans in 2022 to defend Europe against an invasion, but the plans are now being questioned due to a lack of European troops. The plans called for up to 300,000 troops to be deployed within 30 days, with many being American. However, the Trump administration has warned that the US priorities lie elsewhere, and Europe must take care of its own security. Mustering 30,000 European troops to police any future peace in Ukraine is proving to be a challenge. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned that Russian forces could be capable of launching an attack on European territory in 2030. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wants to introduce large-scale military training for every adult male and double the size of Poland's army to about 500,000 soldiers. 'If Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice or capitulation... then, without a doubt -- and we can all agree on that -- Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,' Tusk warned lawmakers recently. The Brussels-based Bruegel think tank estimates that an increase in European capacities equivalent to the fighting capacity of 300,000 U.S. troops is needed. 'Europe faces a choice: either increase troop numbers significantly by more than 300,000 to make up for the fragmented nature of national militaries, or find ways to rapidly enhance military coordination,' Bruegel said.

**Europe's military personnel shortfalls exposed as Trump alters U.S. priorities**
NATO leaders approved a set of military plans in 2022 to defend Europe against an invasion, but the Trump administration has since shifted U.S. priorities, leaving Europe to take care of its own security. The plans called for up to 300,000 troops to be deployed within 30 days, but the current number of European troops available for policing in Ukraine is only 30,000. European countries are struggling to increase their military budgets and production in their defense industries. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has warned that Russian forces could be capable of launching an attack on European territory in 2030. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wants to introduce large-scale military training and double the size of Poland's army to about 500,000 soldiers. 'If Ukraine loses the war or if it accepts the terms of peace, armistice or capitulation... then, without a doubt -- and we can all agree on that -- Poland will find itself in a much more difficult geopolitical situation,' Tusk warned lawmakers. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that Europe has almost 1.5 million active-duty personnel, but many can't be deployed on a battlefield, and those who can are hard to use effectively without a centralized command system. Analysts say that in the event of a Russian attack, NATO's top military officer would probably dispatch around 200,000 U.S. troops to Europe to build on the 100,000 U.S. military personnel already based there. 'Europe faces a choice: either increase troop numbers significantly by more than 300,000 to make up for the fragmented nature of national militaries, or find ways to rapidly enhance military coordination,' the Bruegel think tank estimates.

**Zelensky's call for new European Army is plainly wrong**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a new European Army, but this idea is 'plainly wrong', according to the article. Europe does not need its own defense force, but rather individual leaders who are aware of the reality of their military spending. The article criticizes the UK's defense spending, stating that it will not increase until 2032, and that £250 billion in frozen Russian assets have not been released for use in the defense of Ukraine. The article also mentions a 'once-in-a-generation moment for our national security' and the need for the UK to act fast in response to the crisis in Ukraine. Additionally, the article criticizes Attorney General Lord Hermer for his admiration of eco-zealots and climate extremists.
