**Spanish Ministry Imposes Electronic Identification System for Cattle, Outrages Farmers**
The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) has imposed a new electronic identification system for cattle, which has been met with outrage from the farming sector. José Manuel Roca, responsible for Livestock in Asaja Sevilla, stated that the decision was 'unilateral' and 'adopted without consulting the producers', and that it will impose an 'unjustified additional cost' on farmers. The new decree, which comes into effect on July 1, 2025, requires all cattle born after that date to be identified electronically. Roca explained that this is 'like imposing a chip without anyone asking for it', and that the decision is driven by the 'cebo sector', which will benefit from the measure while the farmers will bear the cost. Asaja Sevilla considers that this regulation is not a response to a European requirement, but rather a 'desire to be more papist than the Pope' by the Ministry. Roca emphasized that only five European countries have adopted similar measures, and that 'European legislation does not require it. This is a voluntary decision taken by the Ministry on its own'. The main criticisms of the sector are the lack of a prior impact study and the absence of technical support. Roca stated that 'we don't know if the new crotales will get stuck in the mountains, or how they will affect the animals. Nobody explains anything. This is not administrative simplification, it's an added burden'. The cost of the new devices, their installation, and the necessary equipment to read them will fall entirely on the producers. Roca warned that 'a reader can be manageable for a large feedlot, but not for a small farmer with ten cows in extensive farming'. Additionally, the loss of the electronic crotal could prevent the movement of the animal, affecting especially those farms that export or depend on immediate traceability. 'If they lose the electronic crotal, the animal is visually identified, but it cannot move. That can mean the loss of a sale', warned Roca. Asaja laments that the Ministry has not wanted to sit down with farmers or conduct pilot tests to anticipate technical or logistical problems. 'Once again, decisions are taken from a desk without stepping into the field. This will benefit the entire chain, but it will only be paid by one: the extensive farmer'. 'This decision benefits the feedlot sector, which will receive animals already digitally identified, but those who will have to bear the cost are the extensive farmers', point out from the field. They also warn that the loss of the electronic crotal could prevent the movement of animals, affecting especially those who export. The lack of information, prior tests, or technical support is another criticism. 'We don't know how it will affect the animals in the mountains or if there will be availability of readers, which we will also have to pay for'. The sector demands dialogue and a consensual implantation: 'A technological improvement cannot be imposed without preparing the one who pays for it'. The agricultural organization insists that it does not oppose technological progress, but rather demands that it be done in a consensual and clear manner with support for the sector.

**World coming up short on promised marine sanctuaries**
A global target of having 30% of the oceans protected by 2030 is at risk of not being met, with only 8.4% of the oceans currently protected. Conservationists say that countries like the US are reversing course and abandoning efforts to protect marine areas. 'With less than 10% of the ocean designated as MPAs and only 2.7% fully or highly protected, it is going to be difficult to reach the 30% target,' said Lance Morgan, head of the Marine Conservation Institute. The institute's research shows that many MPAs are not effective in protecting fish populations, with only a third of them having levels of protection that would yield proper benefits. Daniel Pauly, a professor of fisheries science, said that MPAs have not been proposed for the protection of biodiversity, but rather to increase fish catches. He emphasized the importance of fishing bans in MPAs, but noted that such restrictions account for only 2.7% of the ocean's area. The NGO Oceana is calling for a ban on bottom trawling, a technique that involves towing a heavy net along the sea floor, churning it up. A recent WWF report said that just 2% of European Union waters were covered by MPAs with management plans, highlighting the need for governments to back their words with action.

**Important Guidelines for Ensuring the Safety of Sacrificial Meat**
As Eid al-Adha approaches, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Water Resources has issued important guidelines for citizens and residents to ensure the safety of sacrificial meat. The guidelines aim to promote safety and hygiene standards when purchasing and slaughtering animals, to ensure high-quality products free from any health risks. The ministry emphasized the need to check the animals for diseases before purchasing, noting that diseased animals can pose a risk to human health. It also called for slaughtering animals in approved municipal slaughterhouses, which plays a vital role in maintaining public health and ensuring the implementation of healthy standards. The guidelines include a set of preventive measures to be taken before, during, and after the slaughtering process: 'Inspecting the animals: checking for external parasites such as ticks. Ensuring the slaughterman's health: the slaughterman must be in good health and free from any wounds or injuries, and must wear appropriate protective clothing. Proper disposal of waste: after completing the slaughtering process, waste must be disposed of in a healthy and safe manner, and not thrown in open areas to prevent the spread of disease.' The ministry warned of the dangers of zoonotic diseases, which can be transmitted during the slaughtering process. For example, it mentioned the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, a deadly viral disease transmitted by ticks, with a mortality rate of around 40% in humans. The ministry explained that zoonotic diseases are a group of diseases that affect animals and can be transmitted to humans and vice versa, directly or indirectly, through the respiratory, digestive, or eye systems, or through bites from insects such as ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, and lice.

**20 Tons of Unfit Meat and Poultry Seized in Eastern Governorate**
The Eastern Governorate's security agencies, in coordination with the Veterinary Medicine Directorate, launched a series of inspection campaigns to monitor the sale of meat, poultry, and fish, as well as restaurants, meat markets, and factories. The campaigns aimed to control prices, ensure the quality and safety of products, and supervise government-owned slaughterhouses and poultry farms to maintain public health and safety. According to Dr. Ibrahim Metwali, Director of the Veterinary Medicine Directorate, the inspection campaigns resulted in the issuance of 4 violation reports and the seizure of 20 tons of 200 pounds of improperly slaughtered meat and poultry, as well as frozen meat and liver, and unidentified meat factories, and other products unfit for human consumption. The necessary reports were issued, and all necessary legal actions were taken against the violators.

**Kurban Bayramı Et Tavsiyeleri: Kasaplar Odası Başkanı Yalçındağ'in Açıklaması**
Yalçındağ, in a written statement, emphasized that the slaughter and processing of meat, especially after the slaughter, must be done by a professional butcher. He stated that in Turkey, 800-900 thousand head of cattle and 2-2.5 million head of small cattle are slaughtered every year for Kurban Bayramı, resulting in 200 thousand tons of meat production. Yalçındağ noted that even if all the slaughterhouses in Europe were to be gathered and sent to Turkey, it would not be possible to organize such an event in one day. He emphasized that 'our sacrifice must be slaughtered and processed by the right people and stored in the right way. The right address is the butchers in everyone's neighborhood. This would greatly reduce the number of accidents. The tools used during slaughter must be sharp and clean, and everyone must be trained every year. Appearing every year and saying 'I am a butcher' and providing mincing service with the machine taken out of the coal yard is a threat to public health. Our goal is not to make money, but to provide the safest and most hygienic service and product.' Yalçındağ also warned that cutting the meat into pieces and storing it in plastic containers without letting it cool down is not safe. He emphasized that the biggest mistake is to store the meat in this way, as it will produce bacteria within an hour and spoil. He recommended that the meat be transported in trays, cooled down for at least 2 hours, and then stored in the refrigerator. He also advised that the meat be frozen and consumed within 3-4 months.

**Río Grande Strengthens Local Production and Consolidates New Alternatives**
The Secretary of Productive Development, Facundo Armas, highlighted that food production has become one of the pillars of local economic development: 'Six years ago, we started to strengthen food sovereignty, to reduce our dependence on food from the continent. And we have demonstrated that it is possible.' Armas noted that the production scale has shifted from almost family-based to semi-industrial schemes. For example, poultry production began in 2022 with a batch of 1,500 grilled chickens and now reaches 60,000 units per year. 'We are supplying butcher shops in Tolhuin and Ushuaia. The product we are offering does not exist in Patagonia, so there is demand and a highly valued quality differential,' explained Armas. The development of RGA Alimentos, initially articulated with La Misión Salesiana, has been the core from which other production lines such as tomatoes, potatoes, garlic, and vegetables have been strengthened. Currently, more than 1.5 tons of tomatoes are produced per season, even in months like May and June, extending the historical seasonal period. In this process, companies from the technology sector based in the city have also begun to participate. 'In addition to electronics, Río Grande demonstrates that it can develop food and there are companies like Mirgor that are starting to participate in this,' said Armas, highlighting the synergy between sectors. The possibility of developing trout production is also being explored, reusing municipal facilities in disuse such as the old water treatment plant. 'Río Grande identifies with trout, but few riograndenses have tried it. We want to make it a local, accessible, and sustainable product,' proposed Armas. Significant advances have also been made in the strengthening of pig production, which already has more than 55 registered producers in the municipal program. In 2023, around 8,000 pigs and 6,000 cattle were slaughtered. The Municipal Abattoir was completely refurbished and now works in conjunction with the private plant Los Jazmines. Additionally, local butcher shops were accompanied to improve their conditions of traceability and ensure the local supply of meat in the domestic market. Another highlighted policy is the support for the artisanal fishing sector, historically marginalized. The Municipality implemented a registry of fishermen, delivered nets and work clothing, and articulated commercialization through the Paseo Canto del Viento, ensuring the supply of fresh fish throughout the year. The development of the sector also includes the production of fresh eggs, with over 100 active poultry producers in the city. In the near future, the Avícola Seal, a certification of good practices promoted together with INTA and SENASA, will be implemented, which aims to add value and security to these products. This entire strategy is linked to employment and training programs. From the Employment Department, courses related to food production were added as a concrete labor outlet. 'The idea is that those who are trained can have a profitable business and generate a sustained income,' emphasized Armas. Finally, the official recognized that some projects cannot advance due to lack of financing and change in national government priorities. 'There were projects related to feedlots, production of forage, four-season greenhouses, and a refrigerator with BID financing for almost $8 million. Unfortunately, they did not prosper due to lack of provincial support to take on the debt,' lamented.

**Latvian Smoked Products Under Threat from EU PAH Standards**
Latvian smoked fish, meat, and cheese are under threat due to the European Commission's plans to change the PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) standards in smoked products. According to Minister of Agriculture Armands Krauze, this could be disastrous for the industry, which is already struggling due to inflation and rising energy costs. Krauze has called for the changes to be postponed until the European Food Safety Authority completes its scientific evaluation of the safety of traditional smoking methods. The EU wants to ban eight specific smoke flavorings and reduce the PAH content in traditionally smoked products to 13.3%. This would require Latvian producers to reformulate their products, change their labeling, and potentially even overhaul their production processes, which would be a significant investment. As a result, the traditional taste of Latvian smoked products, which are popular both domestically and internationally, may be lost. 'These proposed changes threaten Latvian producers of traditional products and may kill off the industry, which is already struggling,' Krauze said. 'I urge the European Commission to postpone the review of PAH standards until the European Food Safety Authority completes its scientific evaluation of the safety of traditional smoking methods.'

**EU Fishing System Needs Revision to Combat Overfishing**
The current fishing system in the EU is flawed and needs to be revised to combat overfishing. The system is complex and requires multiple steps, making it vulnerable to distortions. According to researchers at GEOMAR, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) regularly overestimates fish populations, leading to excessive quotas. This is because the ICES makes predictions based on a theoretical 100% recovery of fish populations, which never occurs in reality. As a result, the quotas set by the EU's fisheries management system are often unrealistic and lead to overfishing. The authors suggest that the system should be based on the actual state of fish populations, rather than theoretical calculations. They also propose ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) as a solution to address the issue of overfishing. EBFM would give authority to local fishing communities and incentivize the consumption of less commercialized fish species. However, the current system is dominated by large fishing companies, which can lead to overfishing and the depletion of fish populations. As one commenter noted, 'Overfishing, and giving license to enter protected areas like the Arctic, the North Sea, and coastal zones, using any type of illegal fishing gear: bottom trawls, seismic testing, sonar, and dredging. The power is in the hands of lobbies that control the seas with advanced fishing vessels that are invisible to controls called dark-vessels or they do it openly as if everything was allowed. A depletion of marine life with no protection, no possibility of reproduction, just think of the tons of fish caught for industrial fishing, which for decades has led to the destruction of the marine ecosystem, what was once visible, now is almost gone or near extinction, for an exploitation that no longer looks at anything, or word is fine or it will be the end of many fish species, hidden under many unkept promises, the seas must live, because they are the greatest resource that Nature has given us and we must preserve them, not remain still in front of a slaughter wanted by the fishing lobbies, it would certainly be a one-way road.'

**BBC Radio 4 - Farming Today, 24/05/25 - Farming Today This Week: The EU-UK Summit**
The UK and EU have agreed on a new trade deal, which could simplify agri-food trade, fishing, and border control. The deal aims to reduce paperwork and border checks for exporting foods like fish, meat, and dairy products. Some previously banned exports, such as farmed mussels and oysters, sausages, and seed potatoes, could now resume. However, the future of Border Control Posts is uncertain, with some facilities potentially being decommissioned. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation has criticized the deal, calling it 'a horror show', while the DEFRA Secretary described it as 'reasonably good' for UK fishing.

**UK and EU Reach Agreement on Fishing Rights and Trade**
The UK and the European Union (EU) have reached an agreement on fishing rights, food, and agricultural products after negotiations on controls. The agreement, made before the high-level UK-EU Summit in London, gives the EU access to UK waters for fishing until June 2038. According to UK media reports, this is an extension of the current agreement by 12 years. In return, Brussels has agreed to a permanent agreement on simplifying controls on food, animal, and other agricultural products. The agreement was made ahead of the summit, which aims to restart relations between the two sides more than 5 years after the UK's departure from the EU. UK Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said, 'A historic day. After months of negotiations, I can announce that the government has reached a new agreement with the EU. This is good for jobs, bills, borders, and many other things. With this government, which serves the people, the UK is back on the world stage.'

**UK and EU Reach Fishing Agreement Until 2038**
The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached a fishing agreement that will allow European boats to access British waters for 12 years, until 2038, as part of a broader pact between the two powers, according to community sources and British media. The agreement includes a commitment to improve youth mobility and streamline commercial exchanges with standardized food production and veterinary controls at the border. It also involves cooperation in security and defense matters. Details of the fishing agreement are still unknown, and it is unclear how it differs from the previous agreement, which was closed in 2020 after Brexit and was set to expire next year. This major pact comes as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosts the leaders of European institutions in Lancaster House, London, in the first bilateral summit since Brexit. 'This is a significant step forward in our relationship with the EU,' said Starmer, 'and we look forward to working together on a range of issues.'

**Humans are on pace to slaughter 6 trillion animals per year by 2033**
Humans are on track to slaughter 6 trillion animals per year by 2033. However, most people are unaware that fish and shrimp are farmed on an even larger scale, with trillions of animals caught or farmed annually, compared to 76 billion chickens. If people's compassion for animals extends to marine life, they may advocate for sea creatures. Furthermore, the emerging industry of insect farming, which involves confining and killing large numbers of insects for use as animal feed or human consumption, is also worth considering.

**METRO Italia Pioneers Fish Welfare Policy in Italy**
METRO Italia has introduced a new policy to improve the welfare of farmed fish, responding to the 'Anche i Pesci' campaign. The policy includes the effective stunning of fish before slaughter, a first in Italy. This move follows the campaign's calls for a radical revision of fish farming standards, which aim to reduce the suffering of fish during slaughter, often lasting up to 40 minutes. METRO's new policy sets two key points: pre-stunning to ensure a painless death and lower stocking densities to improve living conditions in intensive farms. Elisa Bianco, corporate engagement manager at Essere Animali, said, 'This is the first time an Italian company has publicly addressed these issues. It shows that an ethical and sustainable alternative is possible, even in the food sector.' METRO has a history of making responsible choices, with 85% of the fish it distributes already certified as sustainable, and aims to reach 95% by 2025.

**Foodwatch Demands Sales Ban on Norwegian Farmed Salmon**
Foodwatch, a consumer protection organization, is calling for a sales ban on Norwegian farmed salmon due to concerns over animal welfare and environmental damage. The organization reports that 100 million fish die before slaughter due to infections, and that the industry is 'out of control'. Many supermarkets, including Rewe, Edeka, Aldi, and Lidl, sell Norwegian farmed salmon, with 50% of salmon sold in German supermarkets coming from Norway. Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd have responded to the criticism, stating that their salmon products meet high quality standards and are certified by international organizations such as Global GAP and ASC. Lidl also claims to prioritize animal welfare and sustainability, and has set a goal to have 100% of its listed seafood and fish products certified by organizations such as MSC, ASC, or GLOBALG.A.P. However, Foodwatch argues that these certifications do not guarantee that the fish come from farms with good conditions, and that consumers should be able to track the origin of the fish. The organization is calling for clear guidelines for animal welfare, strict monitoring, and harsh penalties for non-compliance.

**Police: Large quantities of farmed fish are being handled inadequately and illegally**
According to the police threat assessment, large quantities of farmed fish are being handled inadequately and illegally during the slaughtering process. As a result, the fish are not dying immediately and are therefore subjected to suffering during this phase, as stated in the police's latest threat assessment for 2025. The police note that larger batches of fish in some cases need to be slaughtered due to animal welfare reasons, such as fish with wounds or deformities that cannot be transported to the slaughterhouse normally.

**Egyptian Fish Shipment Arrives in EU After 3-Year Hiatus**
The National Organization for Food Safety announced the export and arrival of the first shipment of Egyptian fish to the European Union, specifically to 'Italy', after a three-year hiatus. The shipment met all requirements and was accompanied by a certificate of validity issued by the National Organization for Food Safety. This was mentioned in the weekly report issued today, covering the period from February 8-14, 2025, which included various activities. The General Administration for Fish and Aquatic Products Control conducted 14 inspection visits on fishing boats, factories, and fish suppliers, and renewed the registration of 6 fish factories. In the context of the National Organization for Food Safety's responsibility for implementing the release under supervision procedures starting from the new year 2025 and applying the new mechanism that requires all food establishments to register with the organization, a total of 165 establishments registered, bringing the total number of establishments to 934. Additionally, 2006 certificates of storage capacity were issued, and 3071 requests for the transfer and storage of food shipments were issued since the beginning of the year 2025.

**EU's Plan for Large-Scale Pig Farming: A Path to Happy Farms?**
According to Miguel Ángel Higuera, president of the Animal Health and Welfare Group of the Copa-Cogeca Committee, consumers do not want to pay more for products that ensure animal welfare in farms. Higuera considers that advancing in the transition without EU support is a 'huge problem'. The ONG 'Compassion in World Farming' suggests that the EU should provide support to farmers through a combination of funds from the Common Agricultural Policy (PAC), regional aid, and the proposed agricultural transition fund. A 2023 Eurobarometer survey found that 60% of Europeans are willing to pay more for products from animal-friendly farming systems. The same survey states that over 90% of Europeans believe that agricultural practices and animal breeding should meet 'basic ethical requirements', such as providing animals with enough space, food, and water, and adapting their environment to their needs. The European Commission has proposed a set of proposals for animal protection in transportation and other animal welfare regulations, but some proposals, including those related to animals in captivity, sacrifice, and labeling, are still pending and do not have a concrete timeline. The EU has a new commissioner specifically responsible for Health and Animal Welfare, Olivér Várhelyi, who plans to unveil his work program soon. The EU's pork production showed a recovery in 2024 after two years of decline, with 146 million pigs slaughtered between January and August, a 0.7% increase from 2023. The production in tons increased by 1.9%, driven by a higher weight of the carcasses. This growth reverses the 8.1% contraction in 2023 and the 3.1% contraction in 2022, according to a provisional report from the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
