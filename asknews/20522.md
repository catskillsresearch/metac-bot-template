**Inside U.S. nuclear energy landscape as Trump seeks to fast-track...**
U.S. President Donald Trump has directed the country's nuclear regulator to ease rules and accelerate approvals for new reactors and power plants, aiming to cut the licensing timeline from several years to 18 months. This move is part of a series of executive orders to boost domestic nuclear energy production, which has seen a surge in demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. The U.S. nuclear energy landscape is also seeing growth, with total uranium concentrate production tripling to 676,939 pounds of U3O8 in 2024. Additionally, U.S. monthly nuclear power generation peaked at over 71 million megawatt-hours in January 2025, a 4% increase from the previous year. However, U.S. civilian nuclear reactors remain heavily reliant on uranium imports, with foreign sources dominating deliveries in 2023.

**US House Passes 10-Year Moratorium on State AI Laws**
The 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill' (H.R.1) proposed by former US President Trump, which includes a 10-year moratorium on state AI laws, has passed the House of Representatives. The bill aims to prohibit states and local governments from regulating 'AI models', 'AI systems', and 'automated decision systems' for 10 years. According to the White House, 'This bill is a major step forward for American innovation and competitiveness.' However, some critics argue that the bill would undermine the regulation of AI and potentially harm the country's leadership in AI development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated, 'If government approval is required for AI to be released, it would be a catastrophic blow to America's competitiveness.'

**Trump's Video Suggests He'll Be President 'For Evigt'**
Donald Trump has posted a video on his social media platform, Truth Social, showing him as president for many years to come. The video starts with the 2024 election slogan 'Trump 2024' and then zooms in on signs with future years, including 2028, 2032, 2034, and all the way to 9000. The video ends with the text 'Trump 4eva', meaning 'Trump forever'. Trump has not commented on the video, but has only shared it. This comes after rumors in recent months that Trump was considering running for a third term in 2029. However, in an interview in May, Trump stated that he has no plans to run for a third term, saying 'I have plans for four good years and then to give the presidency to another person, ideally a great Republican.' Trump acknowledged that there is no legal possibility for him to run again, and mentioned Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance as potential successors.

**Trump Posts Humorous Video Hinting at Eternal Presidency**
US President Donald Trump posted a humorous video on his social media platform Truth Social, hinting at his potential eternal presidency. The video shows a Time magazine cover from 2018 with a series of tabs displaying the dates of Trump's presidency, starting from 2024 and ending with 2044. The last tab continuously increases in year, ending with the phrase '4eva' (forever). The video is set to the climax of Edvard Grieg's 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' from 'Peer Gynt'. Trump has previously stated that he would run for a third term if his opponent was former President Barack Obama, and that 'there are methods' to stay in office beyond the two-term limit, but has not seriously considered it. Trump has been elected president twice, in 2016 and 2024, and participated in the 2020 election, but lost to Joe Biden. The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits a president from being elected more than twice, and can only be changed through a constitutional amendment, which is extremely difficult to achieve. 'It's a very difficult process,' said Trump, 'but I think we can do it.'

**Interrogating the Future of AI Ethics and Governance with the "Take It Down Act**
The 'Take It Down Act' is a landmark federal law signed by President Donald Trump on May 19, 2025, to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content, such as deepfakes and voice cloning. The law criminalizes the publication of non-consensual intimate images and requires platforms to remove such content within 48 hours of a victim's request. Violators face penalties of up to three years in prison. The Act marks a significant step in responsible AI governance by addressing the ethical challenges posed by synthetic media and reinforcing principles of transparency, accountability, and data protection. It also places responsibility on platforms to implement robust data governance and takedown procedures, emphasizing victim empowerment and privacy rights.

**Trump Exploits Jewish Students as Unwitting Pawns in Administration's Attacks on Higher Education**
The Heritage Foundation's 'Project 2025' is a 900-page book outlining a conservative agenda for the next Republican President, aiming to establish a government based on 'biblical principles' with sweeping executive powers. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts warns that the Left is threatening the tax-exempt status of churches and charities that reject 'woke progressivism.' Roberts advocates for deleting terms such as 'sexual orientation and gender identity' and 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' from federal rules and regulations, claiming it will protect First Amendment rights. Despite Trump's initial denial of knowledge about 'Project 2025,' he has hired several of its writers as department heads and advisors following his re-election in 2024.

**Trump Hints at Becoming 'Permanent' President, But Constitutional Experts Say He's Not Eligible for Third Term**
US President Donald Trump shared a video on his Truth Social platform, hinting that he will become a 'permanent' leader of the United States. However, according to the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, no person can be elected president more than twice. This means that Trump, who was elected president in 2016 and 2024, is not eligible to run for a third term in 2028. Constitutional experts consider any attempts to circumvent the 22nd Amendment, such as running for vice president and then taking over as president, to be legally questionable and likely unconstitutional. A proposed amendment to the Constitution, introduced by Republican congressman Andy Ogles in January 2025, would have allowed presidents who served two non-consecutive terms to run for a third term, but it requires the support of two-thirds of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states, making its passage unlikely.

**Pro-AI, pro-pollution, pro-surveillance: what you should know about Trump's budget**
The House version of Trump's budget package would strip states of their power to enforce laws regulating artificial intelligence models and 'automated decision systems' for 10 years. This would likely preempt hundreds of AI-related bills being considered in 2025, as well as dozens that have passed into law. The broad 'automated decision' language could also nix regulating all kinds of computer systems not frequently classed as AI. According to the budget package, states would be unable to enforce laws regulating AI for a decade, effectively giving the federal government control over AI regulations.

**First Federal Crackdown on Deepfakes: TAKE IT DOWN Act Signed**
On May 19, 2025, President Donald Trump signed the bipartisan TAKE IT DOWN Act into law, marking a significant federal initiative to combat the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. The law requires online platforms to remove reported non-consensual intimate images within 48 hours and take reasonable steps to prevent re-uploading. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will enforce compliance, and knowingly publishing or threatening to publish intimate images without consent is a federal offense, punishable by up to two years in prison for adult content and up to three years for content involving minors. The law aims to address the growing concerns over digital exploitation and the misuse of artificial intelligence in creating harmful content.

**AI Data Center Build-Out Raises Concerns About America's Future Power Needs**
The United States is preparing to invest billions of dollars in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, but public officials, grid operators, and utility companies are concerned about how the nation's electricity grid will handle the expected surge in power usage. According to a recent S&P Global Market Intelligence report, annual electricity demand for U.S. data centers is expected to reach 280 TWh in 2024 and nearly double to 530 TWh by 2028. Bank of America sustainability analyst Dimple Gosai said, 'The push for 24/7 firm power has intensified as AI-driven data center growth amplifies grid stability and curtailment concerns, accelerating demand for dispatchable power.' To address these concerns, President Donald Trump's executive order called for a multi-billion dollar build-out in AI and data center capacity, and the National Science Foundation issued a request for information on federal policy recommendations to sustain America's AI dominance. However, energy expert Maksim Sonin said power generation, grid infrastructure construction, and regulatory barriers are among the substantial obstacles facing data center development at scale. Arkansas Governor Sarah Sanders is working to pass legislation allowing public and private partners to get speedier approval for financing and strategic investments to upgrade and build utility-scale power projects. Despite this, Silicon Valley tech giants Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and OpenAI have announced plans for hyperscaler data centers in surrounding states that consume massive amounts of power.

**Agency AI use case inventories must stay, groups tell Trump officials**
More than a dozen civil society organizations, led by the Federation of American Scientists, are urging the Trump administration to keep in place guidance requiring federal agencies to maintain and update their artificial intelligence use case inventories. The groups argue that keeping agency use case inventories current 'is key in promoting transparent, efficient, and trustworthy AI adoption across the federal government and encouraging a robust and competitive ecosystem of public innovation.' They note that the AI use case initiative began during President Donald Trump's first term in office and that subsequent White House guidance and President Joe Biden's October 2023 AI executive order aimed to address shortcomings in the tracking system. The organizations urge the Trump administration to 'support the continuation of existing agency reporting guidance for federal AI Use Case Inventories,' citing the importance of transparency, tracking outcomes, and informing innovation in the industry.

**AI: Biden is Still President in 2025**
A user tested the capabilities of the GPT AI model by asking it to provide information on the current state of AI trends. However, the model provided outdated information from 2021-2022, and when asked to update its knowledge, it provided a hypothetical scenario of Donald Trump becoming president again in 2025, which led to false and humorous results. The user then switched to the 4o model, which provided more accurate and up-to-date information on AI trends. The incident highlights the importance of choosing the right AI model for research and the limitations of the o1 model's 'advanced reasoning' capabilities.

**President Trump's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan Takes Shape as NSF, OSTP Seek Comments**
President Trump has signed Executive Order 14179, 'Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,' which rescinds Executive Order 14110, the Biden AI EO. The new EO gives the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs 180 days to prepare an AI Action Plan. The National Science Foundation's Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) National Coordination Office has issued a Request for Information (RFI) on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan, with comments due by March 15, 2025. The RFI seeks input on the highest priority policy actions that should be in the new AI Action Plan, including topics such as AI regulation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and national security.

**AI Under Donald Trump: What the New Executive Order Tells Us About America's Policy Approach**
President Donald Trump's new Executive Order (EO) on 'Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence' signals a departure from Biden's regulatory framework, prioritizing innovation and national competitiveness over responsible AI principles. The EO removes barriers for private sector growth, but concerns remain about reduced oversight on bias, misinformation, and civil rights protections. Trump's EO aims to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security by removing certain AI policies that hinder American AI innovation. An action plan will be prepared within 180 days by White House tech and science officials, which includes a new special advisor for AI and Crypto. The EO does not explicitly mention the need for protection of civil rights, unlike Trump's first administration's EO in 2019. While some experts are dismayed by the sweeping revocation of well-established AI policies and protections, many are not surprised, given Trump's criticism of Biden's AI agenda during his election campaigns and the 2024 Republican Party Platform. The EO is a blueprint for future action and does not suggest a radical shift from the core pillars of the previous administration. However, the broad wording of Trump's latest EO signals a more flexible approach to AI infrastructure and innovation, giving more headroom for US companies to train and build AI models with less regulatory bottlenecks. This flexibility will give AI companies room to innovate without burdensome regulatory hindrances, but the obvious challenge will be whether the principles of responsible AI can be maintained through such flexibility without intensifying concerns about discrimination, misinformation, and hate speech.

**Trump doesn't endorse Vance for 2028 - Washington Examiner**
During an interview with Fox News's Brett Baier, President Trump expressed his thoughts on Ohio Senator J.D. Vance's potential as his successor in 2028. Trump stated, 'No, but he's very capable,' when asked if he views Vance as his successor. He also praised Vance's performance, saying, 'I think you have a lot of very capable people. So far I think he's doing a fantastic job. It's too early. We're just starting.' However, Trump did not explicitly endorse Vance for the position. When asked about the possibility of endorsing Vance in the future, Trump changed the subject. Vance, who is currently leading a U.S. delegation to an artificial intelligence conference in France, is nearly 40 years younger than Trump and was widely floated as a potential successor after the 2024 election.

**US Needs to Double Down on AI Supremacy**
President Trump emphasizes the need for the United States to win the AI supremacy race with China, which he believes is crucial for achieving a 'golden age' in the country. He has taken three key actions to position the U.S. for AI victory: attracting investments in AI research and energy centers, getting the government out of AI development, and pushing back against European Union regulations that target American tech companies. Trump's approach is in contrast to that of the Biden administration, which has imposed regulations and merger guidelines that have had a chilling effect on AI development. According to Bain & Company, annual strategic deal value in the technology sector was down 40 percent in 2024 from the average from 2015-2022. Trump believes that the U.S. must remain vigilant to maintain its AI lead over China and ensure that American values, such as individual liberty and freedom to achieve, are at the heart of future AI technology.

On January 20, 2025, President Trump rescinded the Biden administration's AI executive order, which focused on regulating AI and included safety and transparency requirements for developers. This move immediately terminates the implementation of key requirements. Additionally, President Trump announced the launch of Stargate, a joint venture with SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over four years. President Trump has reiterated his plans to keep AI 'in America' and flagged China as a key rival in the AI arms race. On January 23, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order, 'Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,' which aims to sustain and enhance America's global AI dominance. We believe that the Trump administration will take a more hands-off approach to regulating AI, except in critical areas, and that AI-specific regulation may pivot back to US states in the absence of federal regulation.

**Trump's AI Model: A New Order to Favor Big Tech and Eliminate 'AI Woke'**
US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to cancel the AI policies introduced by Joe Biden in 2023. The new order aims to invest $500 billion in developing data centers, chips, and electrical networks, while eliminating what Elon Musk calls 'AI woke', or AI influenced by liberal biases. Trump has appointed a group of experts to oversee the implementation of this plan, which must be completed within 180 days. The order does not provide specific details on which policies are being targeted, but it aims to identify and revise all policies, directives, and regulations introduced by the previous administration. According to Domenico Talia, a professor of information processing systems, 'This order seems to favor large American technology companies, freeing their interests in the field of AI dissemination. In the past, Biden had tried to follow some principles established by the European Commission in the AI Act. Now, Trump is canceling these provisions.' Talia adds that 'Biden had imposed constraints on the use of AI systems, limiting the influence of large tech billionaires, many of whom are his allies. The new president seems to be moving in the opposite direction, supporting the idea that AI should be 'Free From Ideological Bias'. In my opinion, with this phrase, one means an AI that is not restricted, which does not protect neither the rights nor the security of individuals, with all the dangers that follow.'

**2024 U.S. Election Boosts Accelerationism in AI, Favoring Rapid Innovation with Minimal Regulation**
The 2024 U.S. election has inadvertently shifted the focus of AI policy towards accelerationism, favoring rapid innovation with minimal regulation. President-elect Donald Trump's pro-business stance suggests that his administration will likely support the development and commercialization of AI technologies, with a focus on promoting free speech and human flourishing. This shift is consistent with the broader Republican philosophy of reducing government intervention in markets. The appointment of David Sacks, a technology entrepreneur and outspoken critic of AI regulation, as the 'AI czar' reflects the incoming administration's stance that AI development should be driven by the private sector, with minimal regulation from the federal government. This shift towards self-regulation and deregulation suggests that rapid innovation in AI will take precedence, but also increases the risk of unintended consequences. The ongoing debate between accelerationists and those advocating for caution will continue to shape the future of AI, and the need for informed oversight and public discourse becomes even more critical to ensure that the benefits of AI are realized without leading to catastrophic consequences.
