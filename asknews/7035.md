Damate Group, a leading producer of duck and turkey meat in Russia, reported a 18% increase in revenue to 72 billion rubles in 2024. The company's EBITDA, adjusted for one-time factors, rose by 22% to 15 billion rubles. The growth in revenue was driven by an increase in production volumes of all types of products, including duck, turkey, and lamb meat. The company also saw a significant increase in exports, with 10% of total revenue coming from export operations. Damate's production of turkey meat increased by 2% to 241.5 thousand tons, while duck meat production rose by 30% to 18 thousand tons. The company also expanded its production capacity for lamb meat, with a 24% increase to 4.5 thousand tons.

The company's assets are located in Penza, Rostov, and Tyumen regions, as well as in the North Caucasus Federal District, with a land fund of around 100 thousand hectares. 'The growth in revenue is a result of the increase in production volumes of all types of products, including duck, turkey, and lamb meat. The additional effect on the growth in revenue was the increase in the structure of sales of high-value-added products, namely deep-processed products from turkey', - said the company. 'The growth in production volumes was achieved due to the growing demand for duck among the population, the increase in the range of products due to the installation of new equipment, and the expansion of the geography of export sales', - added the company. 'The transition to full capacity of the turkey breeder in the Tyumen region allowed Damate to fully switch to the use of its own turkey incubation eggs', - said the company. 'The company continued to implement the project to expand the capacity in the Penza region to 264 thousand tons per year and put into operation the first of two poultry blocks for 64 fattening and breeding turkey farms', - said the company. 'The deal to acquire the assets of OOO 'Evrodon' for the production of turkey meat in the Rostov region has been completed', - said the company. 'The production of lamb meat in 2024 increased by 24% and reached 4.5 thousand tons', - said the company.

'The company also put into operation the first stage of the selection and genetic center of the sheep breeding in the Stavropol region', - said the company. 'The center will allow creating the best gene pool of Russian sheep and reducing dependence on imported breeding products', - said the company. 'The production of canned meat products from turkey and lamb on the plant in Chechnya (KCR) increased 3.5 times to 2.7 thousand tons', - said the company. 'Such growth became possible due to the increase in the capacity of the canning line to 2 million cans per month', - said the company. 'The Tumen livestock complex of Damate produced 59 thousand tons of raw milk in 2024, which corresponds to the full loading of the enterprise', - said the company. '99% of the produced milk belongs to the highest grade', - said the company. 'The company's assets are located in the Penza, Rostov, and Tyumen regions, as well as in the North Caucasus Federal District', - said the company.

**New toolkit launched to help Scottish beef farmers grow the herd**
Scotland's beef farmers are being encouraged to grow the national herd to meet the rising demand for domestic beef. A new support programme, developed by Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) and the Scottish Red Meat Resilience Group (SRMRG), offers guidance to help boost cattle numbers and confidence across the sector. According to QMS chair Kate Rowell, 'Our goal is to increase Scotland’s beef production by adding a couple more cows per herd each year.' The programme aims to increase Scotland's beef production by 22,000 tonnes by 2030, which could deliver an estimated £281 million in output and £76 million in gross value added (GVA) to the Scottish economy.

**DRV lowers forecast for 2025 rapeseed and grain harvest**
The German Raiffeisen Association (DRV) has adjusted its forecast for the 2025 rapeseed and grain harvest downwards due to weather conditions. However, the revised estimates are still higher than the very weak results of the previous year. The DRV expects a total grain harvest of 40.71 million tons this summer, which is 4.2% more than last year. The association attributes the correction to yield losses due to late frosts, which partially froze the rapeseed and grain ears. Lack of rain is developing into a persistent problem, despite recent rainfall providing some relief. The predicted growth in grain production compared to the previous year is due to an expansion of cultivated land by 3.1% to 5.9 million hectares and an increase in yield per hectare to 69.0 decitons, which is about 1.0% higher than in 2024. Wheat is the main driver of the expected production increase, with the DRV forecasting a harvest of 21.02 million tons, which is 13.6% more than in 2024. The production of rye and oats is also expected to increase, by 1.1% to 2.61 million tons and by 10.5% to 768,800 tons, respectively. In contrast, the DRV expects a decline in barley production of 5.7% to 10 million tons and a decline in maize production of 6.2% to 4.60 million tons. Guido Seedler, the DRV's grain market expert, emphasized the importance of exports, saying, 'We must sustainably produce more agricultural raw materials.' He believes that the increasing global population poses a risk of wars over water and food, and that exports can provide additional income for agriculture and contribute to global food security.

**New Valley Governor: 533,301 Tons of Wheat Delivered to Silos and Stores**
The Governor of New Valley, Mohamed El-Zamli, stated that 533,301 tons and 552 kilograms of wheat have been delivered to silos and stores so far. He emphasized the continued monitoring of the harvest season, as the cultivated area of wheat this season reached 343,112 feddans and 13 qirats. El-Zamli added that the delivery of wheat is being received at centers within the governorate instead of being transported outside, following the completion of the storage capacity of the Sohag silo. He explained that this is facilitated for farmers and small producers, as quantities of wheat are being received at a collection center at the Sohag silo headquarters, which will then be delivered to the nearest silo in Asyut by the Ministry of Supply. This comes as the silos in Sohag have been filled and their storage capacity has been completed, which is 45,000 tons. The Governor pointed out that the delivery is being carried out through specialized committees, including representatives from the supply, agriculture, and food safety departments, to ensure the quality of the wheat delivered, in line with the state's directions and to enhance coordination between all parties involved, in light of the strategic importance of the wheat crop as a basic element in supporting food security, and working to overcome any obstacles that may face delivery operations.

**Brazil April beef exports to the US soar despite new tariffs, beef lobby says**
Brazilian meat exporters sold 48,000 metric tons of beef to the US in April, a 'big surprise' according to Roberto Perosa, head of Brazilian beef lobby Abiec, despite a new 10% tariff imposed by Washington. This is a significant increase from the 8,000 tons sold in the same month last year. Perosa noted that Brazil could become the world's biggest beef producer in 2026, replacing the US, due to a severe shortage of cattle in the US. Brazil is already the world's biggest beef exporter. The annual quota of 65,000 tons was filled in January, and Brazilian beef sales outside this quota are now subject to a 36.4% tariff. Perosa also mentioned that China imported 12% more Brazilian beef so far this year, and that Brazilian beef-packers will accompany President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on a visit to China next week to promote Brazilian beef products.

**Chinese agricultural science, technology innovation lauded**
China's agricultural science and technology innovation has reached the world's highest levels, according to Yan Jianbing, president of Huazhong Agricultural University. With the increasing demand for meat, eggs, and dairy products, Yan's team has developed high-protein corn that can serve as both an 'energy pack' and a 'protein tank'. The team has successfully cultivated multiple new corn varieties with protein content exceeding 10 percent, which are being promoted across over 10 million mu. Yan estimates that increasing the protein content of corn by 1 percentage point could yield an additional 2.9 million tons of protein, reducing soybean imports by over 7 million tons. China's total corn production reached 290 million tons last year, and the country's total grain output surpassed 700 million metric tons for the first time in 2024, with per capita grain availability exceeding 500 kilograms. Yan expressed his optimism in maintaining control over the country's food security, highlighting the dedication of agricultural science and technology workers.

**Cultivated Meat: A 85,000 Million Euro Business Opportunity**
Cultivated meat could be a 85,000 million euro business. To reach this point, the industry needs to improve technology, reduce costs, and adapt legislation. According to a study by Systemiq, cultivated meat could bring between 20,000 and 85,000 million euros to the European economy annually. It could also create up to 90,000 highly qualified jobs by 2050. Ana Torrejón, responsible for Microbiology and Industrial Biotechnology at the technological institute Ainia, explains that the main challenge is the medium of cultivation, which accounts for 90% of production costs. She also notes that scaling up the bioreactors is crucial, as it is estimated that a 5,000-liter bioreactor is needed to produce one kilogram of protein. The study suggests that the tipping point for prices could be reached in 2040, making cultivated meat competitive with traditional meat. However, the industry still faces regulatory hurdles, and the study calls for legislation to support the production of cultivated meat in key regions. The European Union's regulatory framework is one of the most stringent in the world, and the approval process can take at least 18 months. Once approved, cultivated meat can be sold in the 27 EU countries, including Spain. The company Gourmey was the first to request approval from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in July 2024 to commercialize its cultivated foie gras.
