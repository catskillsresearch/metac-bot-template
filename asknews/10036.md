**If Third World War breaks out, which countries will choose Russia, India and China will choose...**
The world has seen several deadly conflicts in recent times, including the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Gaza conflict, and the India-Pakistan tensions. Media reports have speculated that a world war may follow if these conflicts do not end in the years to come. If a war-like scenario arises, possible blocks may form, with countries aligning with Russia, India, and China. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas to accept the Gaza ceasefire deal proposed by US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, 'or be destroyed.' The proposal includes the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 bodies in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza. Ukraine launched Operation Spider Web against Russia, carrying out massive drone attacks targeting several airfields deep across the Russian territories. This military action came against the backdrop of scheduled peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul.

**Multiple Threats Loom: China-Taiwan Tensions, Russian-Ukrainian Conflict, and Iran's Nuclear Ambitions**
According to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a military action by China against Taiwan 'may be imminent', which could happen before 2027, the year President Xi Jinping allegedly ordered the Chinese army to be ready to attack. Meanwhile, despite new peace talks scheduled for today in Istanbul involving Germany, France, the UK, Turkey, and the US, multiple sources say a new large-scale Russian ground offensive against Ukraine is 'imminent', and the US may be 'on the verge of abandoning Ukraine'. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) states that Iran now has over 408 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium, nearly doubling its stockpile from three months ago, and is on the verge of producing up to 10 nuclear weapons. This could lead to a 'preventive strike' by the US and/or Israel if a deal is not reached quickly. The greatest danger is that these threats become a reality simultaneously.

**The End of 'Golden Decades': US-China Relations Deteriorate and a New Cold War Begins**
The relationship between the US and China has deteriorated, marking the end of 'golden decades' and the beginning of a new Cold War. The number of Chinese students studying in the US has decreased, from over 370,000 in 2019 to a smaller number in 2023. This phenomenon, where two rival powers built bridges in education, science, and innovation, has come to an end. The Chinese government has become a major power with geopolitical ambitions, making a multipolar world more unstable. The tension between the two countries is inevitable. The US has imposed new tariffs, restricted technological exports, and adopted a hostile stance towards Chinese students, threatening to cancel the visas of many Chinese students in the US. The China has restricted the export of strategic minerals and developed alternative supply chains. The mistrust between the two countries has reduced the exchange of ideas, hindered scientific cooperation, and impoverished their understanding of each other. As new generations take power in Washington and Beijing, the risk of conflict increases. The relationship between the two countries is likely to worsen, and the world will become more volatile, making it difficult and costly to maintain neutrality. The 'golden era' of low geopolitical risk has come to an end.

**US-China Trade War: Who Will Be the Dominant Power?**
The trade war between the US and China has raised questions about who will be the dominant power in the future. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, but China has retaliated with its own tariffs. The situation has led to a decline in trade between the two countries, with the US experiencing a trade deficit of $700 billion in 2025. In contrast, China has a trade surplus of $700 billion, with a focus on exporting electronics and other goods. The US has a large national debt of $35 trillion, while China's debt is $15 trillion, but its total debt is 300% of its GDP. According to the IMF, China is expected to become the largest contributor to global growth in the next five years, with a 23% share. The US is still expected to be a major contributor, but its share is expected to decline. The two countries have different economic systems, with the US relying heavily on services, while China relies on industry. The US has a strong military, with over 6,100 tanks and 40,000 armored vehicles, while China has a large military with over 3.3 million soldiers and 3,260 aircraft. The US has a strong navy, with 490 ships, including 11 aircraft carriers, while China has a large navy with 777 ships. The US has a strong defense budget, with $740 billion in 2025, while China's defense budget is $178 billion. According to a report by the Telegraph, China has surpassed the US in terms of military strength, with over 1 million soldiers and a larger navy. The US is concerned about China's rapid military modernization, including its nuclear capabilities. The trade war between the US and China is not just about tariffs, but also about the future of the global economy and the balance of power between the two countries.

**'Unacceptable': China slams Macron for comparing Taiwan issue to Ukraine war**
China has condemned French President Emmanuel Macron's comments comparing the Taiwan issue to the Ukraine war, calling them 'unacceptable'. Macron warned that unchecked Russian aggression in Ukraine could set a precedent in Asia, and questioned what would happen if Russia took Ukrainian territory without restrictions. China's embassy in Singapore responded, saying the two issues are 'different in nature and not comparable at all'. Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that a threat from China in Asia could be 'imminent', and that any Chinese military move on Taiwan would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. Macron also criticized Europe's credibility for giving Israel a 'free pass' on its actions in Gaza, which has led to the death of over 50,000 civilians since October 2023.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had stated that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is currently on track to reach defence spending levels of 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is optimistic about the progress of the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine deal.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**Aakar Patel | If China Overtakes US As World's Most Powerful Economy, Will Shift Hit India?**
The great contest of our time is between the United States and China, with the rest of the world being a sideshow. Historian Max Hastings described the Second World War as a death grapple between two powers, and similarly, the current contest is between Donald Trump's United States and Xi Jinping's China. China needs time to grow, and in the next decade, it will likely eclipse the US as the world's largest economy. The US has tried to stall and block China's economic progress, but this has failed. China has now won time, and it is enough to see it through. The Chinese have prepared for a trade war, removing state support from floundering real estate businesses and consolidating their supply chains. The US is only the third biggest trading partner for China now, and they have accelerated their lead in future-facing technologies. If things continue as they are, for the first time in 200 years, the largest economic power in the world will not be Western but Asian.

**US-China: The clash of the titans  - Economy - The Jakarta Post**
The trade war between the United States and China is escalating, with both countries vying for economic supremacy. The US has a gross domestic product of over $29 trillion, while China's is over $18 trillion. China is the world's biggest exporter of goods, with the US being the biggest importer. The US has a significant trade deficit with China, reaching $355 billion in 2024. The two countries have also clashed over climate change, with the US withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and China committing to carbon neutrality by 2060. In the tech sector, the US has its 'GAFAM' group of giants, while China has its 'BATX' group. The rise of artificial intelligence has opened a new front in Sino-American tech rivalry, with China's DeepSeek start-up shaking up the AI world with its R1 chatbot. The two sides have also clashed over TikTok, with the US threatening to ban the app due to national security fears. The US is the world's biggest spender on defense, earmarking $916 billion in 2023, while China ranked second with $296 billion. China has invested heavily in its space program, with plans to send a manned mission to the Moon by 2030 and build a lunar base. NASA's Artemis space program is planning to return astronauts to the Moon in 2027 and future missions to Mars.

**US-China Trade War Escalates Amid Competition in Tech, Space, and Nuclear Arms**
The trade war between the United States and China has intensified since President Donald Trump's return to power in January 2021, with the US imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports and China responding with similar measures. The US and China are among the world's largest economies, with the US having a GDP of over $29 trillion in 2024 and China's GDP exceeding $18 trillion. China is the world's largest exporter of goods, with a value of $3.58 trillion, while the US is the largest importer of goods, with a value of $3.36 trillion, according to the World Trade Organization. The US has a significant trade deficit with China, totaling $355 billion in 2024, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Trump has imposed a cumulative tariff of 145% on many Chinese imports, in addition to tariffs imposed by previous administrations, while China has imposed tariffs of 125% on US imports. China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, followed by the US. Despite Washington's commitment to reducing its emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to 2005, Trump's return to power has reignited environmental concerns, with his administration announcing the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement for the second time, threatening efforts to combat climate change. China has committed to peaking its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. The US has seen the emergence of tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, while China has seen the growth of companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Xiaomi. The competition extends to the field of artificial intelligence, with the US launching 'Chat GPT' in November 2022, followed by Chinese companies such as 'DeepSight' which was established in 2023 and launched the 'R-1' chatbot in January 2024, which has performed well and is cheaper than US models. The US Congress passed a law in 2024 requiring Chinese company ByteDance, owner of TikTok, to either surrender control of its US operations or face a ban, amid allegations that the app allows Chinese authorities to collect data from US users. Trump has delayed the deadline for implementing the decision to June 19. The US remains the world's largest military spender, with a budget of over $916 billion in 2023, three times that of China ($296 billion), according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The US and Russia possess around 90% of the world's nuclear warheads, with over 5,000 nuclear warheads each, including those in storage and those being dismantled. China has a significantly smaller nuclear arsenal. China has invested billions of dollars in its space program, which began by sending its first astronaut in 2003, with the goal of catching up with the US and Russia. In 2019, China became the first country to land a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, and in 2021, it sent a robot to Mars. By 2030, China aims to send a manned mission to the moon and establish a permanent base there. In contrast, NASA's Artemis program is preparing to return astronauts to the moon in 2027, followed by a trip to Mars. The agency is also contracting private companies to transport equipment and technology to space in an effort to reduce costs.

**Redrawing Boundaries in a Multipolar World: A New Phase of World War 3 - Russia News Now**
The world is entering a new phase of World War 3, a multipolar world where global powers compete for influence. The boundaries of various spheres of influence will be redrawn, and a formal agreement will be needed to end the war. The US, Russia, and China will continue to engage in proxy wars, economic conflicts, and cyber attacks until an agreement is reached. The Middle East, Europe, Africa, and East Asia will be key regions in this emerging world order. The US and China must agree on the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence in East Asia, but this seems unlikely. The Middle East is volatile, and the potential for a regional conflict escalating into a global confrontation remains a real possibility. The fate of Western and Central Europe remains uncertain, and NATO may be headed for a major restructuring or dissolution. Africa's role in a multipolar world remains undefined, and the continent could become a major theater for economic, financial, and military competition between global powers. Redrawing borders is a possibility, and this could happen across various regions. A lot remains unresolved before World War 3 can be said to be over, and key flashpoints include the Middle East, Western and Central Europe, Africa, and East Asia. Until a formal agreement is reached, World War 3 will persist, bringing massive global consequences.

**Third World War to Start in Late 2024, Predicts Author**
The author believes that the third world war will start at the end of 2024. The war will be triggered by a conflict between Israel and Hamas, which will escalate into a larger Middle Eastern war between the US and Iran. The author also predicts that China will launch a military operation on Taiwan between November 6, 2024, and January 6, 2025, when the US will be in a state of civil war and unable to consolidate its efforts. The author notes that the recent election in Taiwan, where the Democratic Progressive Party won, which advocates for Taiwan's independence from China, has increased the likelihood of a Chinese invasion. The author believes that the war will start with a conflict between North and South Korea, which will divert US resources and lead to a full-scale third world war. The author predicts that the US will lose its global dominance and become a regional power, and the world will become a multipolar one with regional wars. The author warns that the world is entering a zone of strong turbulence and that the third world war is inevitable, with the only question being whether it will be conventional or nuclear, which would lead to the end of civilization.

**What Would Happen if the US and China Went to War? This is What the AI Says**
According to Chat GPT, a war between the United States and China would have devastating economic consequences worldwide. The global supply chains would be massively disrupted, leading to shortages of basic and technological products, as well as a significant increase in prices around the world. The IA does not identify a clear winner, as both nations have extensive military capabilities and economic resources. A prolonged conflict is the most realistic possibility, leaving deep human and material losses for both sides. The US currently has a significant military advantage, especially in terms of air and naval power, but China has rapidly advanced in military modernization, reducing the initial technological and strategic gap with the US. Both nations have sufficient nuclear arsenals to cause catastrophic damage. The scenario of nuclear escalation is a concerning possibility. The war could also involve strategic allies such as Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, and could affect European countries, forcing them to take clear positions and face significant economic and diplomatic pressures. The IA emphasizes the need for international cooperation, diplomacy, and dialogue over confrontation to avoid catastrophic scenarios. In conclusion, according to the IA, a war between the US and China would have devastating consequences, highlighting the urgent need to maintain global stability and peace.

**US Think Tank Survey: Experts Fear Third World War in Next Ten Years**
A recent survey by the US think tank Atlantic Council has raised concerns about the possibility of a third world war in the next ten years. The survey, which polled experts from 47 countries, found that 40% of respondents believe a world war is likely to occur by 2035. The majority, 59.5%, disagreed, but the Atlantic Council still considers the findings 'alarming'. The survey, titled 'Global Foresight 2025', highlights the conflict between China and Taiwan as a particularly significant threat. As one expert noted, 'The conflict between China and Taiwan is a ticking time bomb that could lead to a global catastrophe.'

**China's War Preparations: A Threat to Global Security**
China is preparing for a large-scale war, including the possibility of using nuclear warheads, according to Colonel Philip Ingram, a retired British Army officer. China is building a new military command center near Beijing, which is ten times larger than the Pentagon, and is increasing its military presence in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Ingram stated that China is preparing its military, increasing its armed forces, and building up its naval and air forces. China is also stockpiling food, oil, gas, precious minerals, iron, and steel, in preparation for a potential conflict. Ingram emphasized that China is preparing for war, without any 'ifs' or 'buts'. He warned that a conflict between China and the US would have a global impact, and that the world would be at risk of a nuclear war. China is increasing its nuclear arsenal, with 100 new warheads added in 2024, and potentially over 1,000 by 2030. The US is reviewing its nuclear policy towards China in response. 'China is preparing for war, full stop, without any 'ifs' or 'buts', said Ingram. 'This is a very dangerous game for China, as it would lead to a mutually assured destruction, which has prevented nuclear war since 1945.'

**60% Americans favor defending Taiwan when the time comes: Report - The Taiwan Times**
A recent survey titled 'Order and Disorder' found that 60% of Americans support the US defending Taiwan against a possible Chinese invasion. The survey, conducted by YouGov from August 28 to September 6, gathered responses from 1,000 adult US citizens. According to the results, 18% strongly supported intervention, 42% somewhat supported intervention, 27% were somewhat opposed, and 13% were strongly opposed. Republicans were more likely to support taking military action than Democrats or Independents. The survey's findings suggest that the US may be willing to commit troops to defend Taiwan, which could potentially lead to a global conflict, including the possibility of World War III.
