**Why Elon Musk and Donald Trump Drifted Apart**
The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump began to deteriorate after Musk's involvement in Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, where he invested around $200 million in support of the Republican candidate, using his platform X to promote his candidacy. Musk was appointed as co-director of the DOGE, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, with the mission of reducing public spending and restructuring federal agencies. However, Musk's management of the DOGE caused friction both within and outside the Trump administration, particularly due to his proposals for drastic cuts, including mass layoffs of federal employees and the closure of iconic agencies. Musk's austerity measures were perceived as chaotic, contributing to a decline in the popularity of the Trump administration. Additionally, controversies such as Musk's alleged Nazi salute at Trump's inauguration and his support for policies like the H-1B visas, which favor tech companies but contradict Trump's 'America First' agenda, eroded the confidence between the two. Musk's statement at the Qatar Economic Forum, where he said, 'I think I've done enough' in relation to his political involvement, marked a significant change, as he announced that he would significantly reduce his spending on US political campaigns. This decision reflected a need to focus on his businesses, particularly Tesla, which was facing criticism for its financial performance and the politicization of its brand. Musk eventually announced his progressive withdrawal from the DOGE in May 2025, reducing his participation to one or two days a week before abandoning the role completely. According to reports, this exit was agreed upon by mutual consent with Trump, who informed his inner circle that Musk would leave his role as 'special government employee' in the following weeks. The White House, through spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, described Musk's work in the DOGE as 'extraordinary,' but stated that it was always intended to have an expiration date. The distancing between the two was also influenced by internal tensions within the Trump administration, with some advisors considering Musk an 'unmanageable' figure due to his tendency to unveil initiatives without prior approval, causing confusion and unease.

**US Secretary of State Warns of Potential Visa Challenges During 2026 World Cup**
US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, warned on Wednesday of potential difficulties in granting visas to enter the United States during the 2026 World Cup finals, promising to do everything in his power to address the issue, as the Trump administration tightens its immigration policies. Rubio said before a committee in the House of Representatives: 'We are looking for ways to double the number of employees in some of our embassies around the world due to the requirements for obtaining a visa.' He added: 'For example, if you have not yet applied for a visa from Colombia, it is likely that you will not arrive in time for the World Cup unless we form a reinforced team.' The 2026 World Cup finals will take place from June 11 to July 19 in Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The United States will also host the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The US Secretary of State confirmed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is exploring ways to recall experienced diplomats 'to provide a 24-hour presence in some of our embassies and consulates around the world to deal with the large increase in visa applications for the World Cup and the Club World Cup, and then the Olympics.' He explained that the embassies will also try to use artificial intelligence in some cases. About the tourism resulting from hosting such sporting events, he said: 'We want this event to be successful. It is a priority for President Donald Trump.' Officials have expressed concern about the decline in tourism in the United States since the Trump administration tightened immigration restrictions. The US tourism sector may lose $12.5 billion in international visitor spending this year, according to a study conducted by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), which includes the world's largest tourism boosters.

**Why is Trump no longer mentioning Elon Musk on Truth Social?**
President Trump has significantly decreased his public mentions of Elon Musk on Truth Social posts in recent weeks. According to analysis, Trump used to mention Musk every few days, but hasn't posted about him in over a month. Musk's involvement with DOGE has also decreased, as he announced his intention to reduce his involvement to focus on Tesla. Musk's Neuralink and SpaceX secured business deals in the Persian Gulf, but his last post about DOGE was on April 21, and he has since diverted his efforts back to Tesla. 'The president, who used to mention Musk every few days on Truth Social, hasn’t posted about him in more than a month,' the analysis wrote. 'Once a staple of White House briefings, Musk now hardly gets mentioned at all.'

**Greens sue to force disclosure of Trump layoff plans**
The Center for Biological Diversity is suing the Trump administration to force the release of plans to lay off government workers and reorganize agencies. The environmental group filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, citing the Freedom of Information Act, after the Office of Personnel Management failed to respond to FOIA requests submitted in March and April. Environmentalists argue that it's urgent for the administration to release its plans, which have been a top priority for President Donald Trump and the 'Department of Government Efficiency' operation led by Elon Musk. 'It's urgent for the administration to release its plans for slashing the size of the government,' said the CBD. 'The public has a right to know what the Trump team is planning to do to the federal workforce.'

**'Political kryptonite': Why Trump might be (finally) done with billionaire Elon Musk**
Tech billionaire Elon Musk is 'political kryptonite' according to CNN data guru Harry Enten. Musk has been shying away from the national spotlight as President Donald Trump has stopped posting about him on Truth Social. Enten attributes this to poor polling numbers for Musk and his company Tesla, with Musk's net favorability rating dropping from plus 24 points in 2017 to minus 19 points in 2025. Musk's involvement in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race and his role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have faced widespread backlash, leading to protests and a decline in Tesla's stock price. Enten notes that Tesla's net favorability rating has plummeted to minus 20 points, making it difficult to sell cars. Trump's decision to stop posting about Musk on Truth Social suggests that he believes Musk's political brand has run its course.

**Elon Musk Confirms 'Silent Test' of Trump's $5 Million Gold Visa**
Elon Musk stated on Twitter that the government is conducting a 'silent test' of the Trump Gold visa, a $5 million card announced by President Donald Trump earlier this year. Musk said, 'We are conducting a discreet test to ensure the system works correctly. Once it is fully tested, it will be launched to the public with a presidential announcement.' However, Musk did not provide details on what the 'silent test' entails or how the card is being tested. According to Wired, some permanent residents and foreign visitors were asked if they had applied for the 'Trump Card Visa' while accessing an online application for Global Entry. The Trump administration first presented the idea of the gold card in February, saying it would replace the EB-5 program, which allows immigrants to obtain a green card if they have a business in the US and plan to create at least 10 full-time permanent jobs. It is unclear when the public launch will take place, as Trump initially said it would be within two weeks, but it has not been released yet. The Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, stated that the administration plans to launch the card 'in a week and a half,' but it has not been confirmed. Trump initially said the card would cost $5 million and would provide the same benefits as a green card holder, including permanent residence and work authorization, but not the right to vote or run for public office. He also claimed that wealthy individuals who purchase the card would invest in the US by 'spending a lot of money, paying a lot of taxes, and giving a lot of people jobs.' The revenue generated from the sale of the Trump card would be used to pay off the national debt, according to Trump. Lutnick stated that there would be a rigorous selection process to ensure that those who receive the cards are 'great world citizens.'

**El Salvador Prez Nayib Bukele's apparent dig at Europe ahead of Trump meeting, Musk reacts - Hindustan Times**
El Salvador President Nayib Bukele is set to meet President Donald Trump on Monday to discuss the deportation of hundreds of illegal immigrants to the Central American country. Ahead of the meeting, Bukele posted a photo of an open bottle on social media, which Elon Musk responded to with a laughing emoji. The post is seen as an apparent dig at the European Union, which has been in a trade war with Trump since he announced his 'Liberation Day' reciprocal tariffs. The 'uncapped' bottle could be seen as mocking the EU's 2019 Single-Use Plastics Directive, which mandated tethered bottle caps starting July 2024 to reduce plastic waste. Bukele has previously slammed Europe, saying the continent is 'no longer free and is declining.' Trump and Bukele will discuss El Salvador's partnership on using their supermax prison for gang members and how El Salvador's cooperation with the United States has become a model for others to work with this administration.

**El Salvador Prez Nayib Bukele's apparent dig at Europe ahead of Trump meeting, Musk reacts**
El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted a photo of an uncapped bottle on X, saying 'It's real. This ain't a drill!' which some speculate is a dig at the European Union's Single-Use Plastics Directive. The directive, which starts in July 2024, requires tethered bottle caps to reduce plastic waste. Bukele's post comes after he agreed to accept migrants deported from the US, who will be kept in Salvadoran prisons. Trump posted on Truth Social that the two countries are 'working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.' Musk responded to the tweet with a laughing emoji. The meeting between Trump and Bukele will discuss El Salvador's partnership on using their supermax prison for gang members and how El Salvador's cooperation with the US has become a model for others. 'The future of deported migrants is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!' Trump said. Bukele has previously slammed Europe, saying it is 'no longer free and is declining.' 'You can't claim the title free world if your people are not even free to walk down the streets,' he said.

**Trump vows to end 'woke' culture in US, promises radical reforms**
US President Donald Trump stated in a speech to the US Congress that he has ended the 'tyranny' of diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government. Trump said, 'Our country will not be more woke.' He emphasized that the 'American dream is unstoppable,' after six weeks of tension with neighboring countries, Canada and Mexico. Trump's close advisor, Elon Musk, was present at the speech, which was delivered during peak viewing hours. Trump praised his administration's accomplishments in the past six weeks and promised to continue his efforts to radically reform the US government and end the war in Ukraine, no matter the cost. He said, 'We have achieved more in 43 days than most administrations achieve in four or eight years, and we are just getting started.' Trump also announced plans to request funds to implement his policy of deporting irregular migrants. The White House considers these migrants to be criminals for entering the country without a visa, and Trump has ordered raids and deportations, including at the US military base in Guantanamo, Cuba.

**Trump's Arrival in the White House Causes Uncertainty in the US Job Market**
The arrival of Donald Trump in the White House has caused a stir in the US job market. Thousands of public employees have been fired or will soon lose their contracts, and international workers and students with visas are facing uncertain futures. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, over 1,000 employees were fired, mostly with less than two years of experience. The Department of Energy and the Forest Service also terminated contracts of over 5,000 employees. Trump has appointed Elon Musk to restructure government agencies and departments, and it is unclear how many more employees will be fired. 'There is a sense of uncertainty among professionals with experience. Nobody knows what will happen and they are already looking for alternatives,' said a professor of Public Affairs. The job market is not looking promising, with many students and graduates facing a tough time finding employment. 'Unfortunately, this year's graduates will have a harder time finding their first job opportunity,' said a career advisor. Even those with an MBA from top universities are struggling to find employment. The Economist reported that in the last decade, 82% of students from elite universities had accepted a job offer before graduation, but in 2024, that number dropped to 62%. It is expected to decrease even further in 2025. 'I invested in my education and have good credentials, but I am aware that I will have to compete with hundreds of people with years of experience who are looking to change sectors or fields,' said Sarah, an MBA student in New York. 'I have stopped applying to public sector or consulting jobs, I think finance is the only stable field for us now,' added Arnold, who will graduate in May and applies to 'a dozen jobs' every week, but sees no progress. International students who come to the US to study and have the right to a one-year work permit in the case of social sciences or three years in STEM fields are also feeling the uncertainty. The elimination of diversity plans in the public sector and private companies like Meta has cancelled the competitive advantage that some of these students had to enter the US job market, which is already difficult due to the limited possibilities of maintaining a job once the student visa expires. The most direct way is to obtain a H-1B work visa, which requires the employer to justify the hiring of a non-citizen based on their skills or talents. However, this also has limitations, as the candidate supported by the company must participate in a lottery where the cap is 85,000 permits per year. 'For now, this practice is maintained, but it is true that there is some noise about it and many recruitment departments are being cautious when considering international candidates,' admitted a recruiter from a consulting firm. Trump has said in previous occasions that he is 'a believer in the H-1B visa' and that he 'has many foreign workers with H-1B visas in my properties.' Other voices from the Republican Party criticize the program, arguing that it takes jobs away from US citizens. Trump's actions on immigration have focused on deporting undocumented immigrants and have not touched the visa system, which is also defended by Elon Musk and other tech moguls in Silicon Valley, who argue that the US should be a magnet for talent -Musk himself arrived with a student visa to attend Stanford-. It was expected that something would be said about this issue after Trump's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as India is the country with the most recipients of work visas, but there was no mention of it, leaving international students and employees with the same uncertainties as public employees.

**Trump Administration Opens Registration Period for H-1B Visas**
The Trump administration has opened up the registration period for a type of visa that is supported by Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, which would allow foreign workers to legally work in the United States while potentially paving the way for a change in their immigration status. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will receive and process the applications. The registration period for the H-1B visa for the 2026 fiscal year will begin on March 7, 2025, at 12:00 PM EST and will last until March 24, 2025. Applicants can register electronically for each beneficiary and pay the corresponding registration fee of $215 per beneficiary. USCIS will update the maximum number of H-1B visas available for the 2026 fiscal year in the coming weeks. According to USCIS, they have made 'multiple improvements to the customer experience for organization and representative accounts for H-1B petition submissions.'

**Elon Musk's Aide Resigns Amid Racist Tweets Scandal**
Marko Elez, a 25-year-old engineer and key figure in Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has resigned after racist tweets surfaced on his X account. The tweets, which included messages such as 'I was a racist before it was cool' and 'I wouldn't mind if Gaza and Israel were erased from the face of the earth', were discovered by The Wall Street Journal. Elez, who worked on intelligence AI and was a SpaceX and Starlink employee, had been monitoring Treasury Department expenditures, one of only two DOGE members authorized to do so. The tweets were posted on an account that was later deleted, but The Wall Street Journal was able to connect it to Elez. 'I wouldn't marry someone from a different ethnicity even for all the gold in the world', he tweeted in September. 'Normalizing hate towards Indians', he wrote the same month, referencing a post about the prevalence of people of Indian descent in Silicon Valley. He appeared to have a particular disdain for Indian software engineers. In one message, he celebrated the idea that 99% of Indian programmers with specialized work visas would be replaced by AI language models, forcing them to return to their country. The tweet 'I was a racist before it was cool' was posted in July. 'I wouldn't mind at all if Gaza and Israel were erased from the face of the earth', he wrote in June. The resignation comes after the DOGE was tasked with reforming the US administration by President Donald Trump. 'This is methodical and will generate great savings', said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who defended the training of the two DOGE employees, including Elez, in a Bloomberg interview. 'They are highly trained professionals, not a traveling band doing things', he said.

**Fact Check: Elon Musk Did NOT Tweet 'Anyone Protesting The Trump Administration Will Be Suspended From X'**
A claim that Elon Musk tweeted 'Anyone protesting the Trump Administration will be suspended from X' is false. According to a search of Musk's official X account, there is no record of him making such a statement. News outlets would have covered his decision if he had made it. The claim originated from a post on X on February 3, 2025, but it was not made by Musk. The post lacked a date and time, and there were no replies to it. A Google search also did not find any results for the phrase, indicating that Google did not recently index such a post. The screenshots of the supposed post showed the same background, suggesting that it was fabricated.

**Yes, Musk Once Posted It Would Take Airplane Crash To End 'Crazy' DEI Hiring Policy**
Elon Musk posted on X in January 2024 that it would take an airplane crash to end the 'crazy' diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring policy in the aviation industry. This statement resurfaced after a deadly midair collision between an American Airlines plane and an Army helicopter in January 2025, which President Donald Trump and his administration baselessly blamed on diversity hiring and DEI. Trump signed an executive order to end federal programs associated with DEI and equity on January 20, 2025. Investigators are still examining the cause of the crash, and the National Transportation Safety Board website states that investigations typically take 12-24 months to complete. Musk's companies were contacted for comment, but no response has been received yet.
