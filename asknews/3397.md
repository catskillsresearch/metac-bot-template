**Saudi Arabia Achieves 87.5% Reduction in Infectious Diseases**
According to the 2024 Annual Report on the Transformation of the Health Sector, Saudi Arabia has made significant progress in enhancing public health and community prevention through a comprehensive system that focuses on early detection, vaccination, and awareness expansion. The report highlights a notable decrease in targeted infectious diseases, including a 87.5% reduction in rates of hepatitis B, dengue fever, tuberculosis, malaria, measles, German measles, and congenital syphilis, as well as an increase in the rate of HIV/AIDS prevention among those infected. The report attributes this success to the expansion of vaccination programs and nationwide campaigns targeting all age groups and geographic areas. The report also mentions the launch of the Public Health Academy as a national training platform to build preventive capacities, enhance the readiness of public health professionals, and promote applied research in areas related to epidemics, environmental health, chronic and infectious diseases. Additionally, the report highlights initiatives aimed at early detection of newborns for genetic diseases and nutritional deficiencies, as well as blood disorders that can be transmitted through generations. The report also mentions the launch of the national strategy to combat drowning, which aims to prevent one of the leading causes of death among children and adolescents through awareness campaigns, practical training, and cooperation with the Ministries of Education and Sports to integrate awareness into curricula and summer activities. The report also highlights efforts to localize the healthcare industry, which has seen numerous services and efforts contributing to achieving health security and self-sufficiency in the Kingdom through providing local industrial needs. The report also mentions the center's efforts to promote mental health, including initiatives to train community members, teachers, and healthcare professionals on basic support skills and rapid intervention in mental health crises, as well as developing specialized training packages and accredited certificates to expand community awareness and reduce the stigma of mental illness. These efforts are part of the Vision 2030 goals to enhance prevention against health risks, improve public health, and focus on early detection of diseases that threaten human health, solidifying the transformation of the health sector in the Kingdom from a treatment-focused system to a preventive and proactive model. This has contributed to raising the average life expectancy in the Kingdom to 78.8 years, with a target of reaching 80 years by 2030, enabling a vibrant and healthy community.

**European Climate Change Advisory Council Recommends 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Change Advisory Council recommends that the European Union set a new, ambitious intermediate goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 90-95% by 2040. This is the only value that keeps the EU on a 'solid', 'viable', and 'credible' path to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, as required by the Climate Law. 'We must reduce emissions significantly and quickly. It's the only way to stop and reduce global warming,' said Ottmar Edenhofer, president of the European Climate Change Advisory Council. The council's report, released on Monday, reiterates that the legally binding goal of zero emissions by 2050 can only be realistically achieved with a 90-95% reduction in internal CO2 emissions relative to 1990 levels. This conclusion was reached after analyzing 1,000 possible scenarios of climate impacts and risks caused by increasing greenhouse gas levels. Only five scenarios survived the exhaustive evaluation of compliance with European climate goals and the Paris Agreement targets by 2040, precisely those that predicted a cut above 90% in emissions. According to Edenhofer, the models 'highlight the urgent need for a deep and sustained reduction in emissions and a significant increase in CO2 removal.' The council recommends that the European Commission send a signal to member states to intensify their efforts and establish the 'national emissions reduction target of 90-95% by 2040.' 'The uneven progress between sectors and member states requires a renewed political commitment. What's at stake is the credibility of climate neutrality,' emphasized Edenhofer, when asked about the pressure from European Parliament lawmakers to lower the cut to 85% to avoid compromising the continent's reindustrialization strategy. The scientists consider that defining a more ambitious goal provides greater security and predictability for economic agents, to reduce fossil fuel use and accelerate investment in clean technologies, modernization, and expansion of infrastructure, and electrification. 'The good news is that the EU has made progress in reducing emissions over the past five years, driven by the energy sector transition and the rapid deployment of renewable energies, such as wind and solar. This means that the goal of reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 is within reach, and that the EU is largely aligned with the scenarios that support the recommended interval for 2040,' points out Edenhofer. The Advisory Council also opposes the suggestion from MEPs to include international carbon credits in the calculation of the EU's effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 'We discourage the use of international carbon credits to meet the 2040 target, as they risk diverting resources from national investments and may compromise environmental integrity,' says the report published on Monday. In addition to the new 2040 intermediate goal, the panel of experts recommends establishing three separate objectives for the reduction of raw emissions and for temporary and permanent CO2 removals. Two additional recommendations aim at the bet on cooperation and partnerships for promoting climate action beyond EU borders - not to replace but to complement national efforts -; and the reinforcement of the EU's adaptation policy to climate change, namely through the approval of new legal instruments and measurable objectives. 'The coordination and political action at the EU level are not commensurate with the growing scale of climate threats. Therefore, we recommend strengthening the EU's adaptation framework, not only through the Climate Law but also through future legislation aligned with global objectives for preparation, adaptation, and mitigation,' referred Ottmar Edenhofer, recalling that Europe is the continent that records the fastest warming on the planet. 'Climate change is already affecting Europe. Rising temperatures threaten public health and cause avoidable losses of life and economic damage. And all scientific literature consistently shows that limiting global warming produces global social and economic benefits far superior to the costs of mitigation,' observed.

**OECD warns against repatriating international supply chains**
The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) warns that repatriating international supply chains, a goal of Donald Trump's trade war, would lead to less global activity and make the production system more vulnerable to shocks and less stable. According to the OECD, the dependence on China has grown significantly in 25 years, but they argue that this has a limited scope and that the solution is not to retreat within national borders, but to seek greater diversification in the international market. The OECD concludes that 'certain measures to bring value chains closer to national territory (relocation) could prove costly and would not necessarily ensure greater stability in the face of shocks.' In fact, they warn that repatriation could lead to a decline of more than 18% in global trade and a reduction of more than 5% in the world's GDP, with losses ranging from 1.1% to 12.2%, depending on the degree and nature of each country's integration into value chains. They argue that, in more than half of the cases studied, a localized regime has led to 'a decrease in the stability of GDP', which they believe highlights the importance of 'opening and geographical diversification' of sources of supply for the economy and exports, offering 'important possibilities for adaptation' in the face of perturbations and shocks. The authors of the study admit that recent events, such as the COVID-19 crisis and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have made people aware of the risks of dependence on international supply. They note that 70% of global exports are well diversified and 'only around 30% of products' show 'high levels of concentration', i.e., with at least twice the concentration possible in the global market. Between the late 1990s and the early 2010s, the proportion of heavily concentrated products increased by an average of 50% in global imports, while the increase was slightly higher in exports. The most notable aspect of these developments is that concentration has mainly affected low-income countries and emerging economies, but barely those of the OECD. However, above all, China explains this trend, as its share in the rest of the world's imports rose from 5% to 30% over the 25-year period under review, while the previous major exporting powers, the United States, Germany, and Japan, saw their combined weight fall from 30% to 15%. The Asian giant is the main commercial partner in 30% of the cases where there is a high level of concentration in imports, compared to 5% at the end of the last century. However, China's dependence on China is much lower in the case of exports (6%, compared to 2% 25 years ago). The dependence on China is particularly marked for other major emerging economies, such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, Russia, and South Africa, as it was the main commercial partner in 60% of the cases of excessively concentrated imports in 2020, compared to 9% at the end of the 1990s. In OECD countries, China accounted for 22% of imports of products with high dependence on imports at the beginning of this decade, when 25 years earlier the percentage was limited to 5%. Within the OECD, there are also significant differences between Chile, Mexico, South Korea, and Colombia, for which more than 400 products they import have an origin that is excessively undiversified, while in Poland, Spain, Italy, France, or Germany, it does not reach 150.

**OECD Warns of Potential 18% Reduction in Global Trade with Relocalization Policies**
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned that policies aimed at relocalizing supply chains could reduce global trade by over 18% and the world's GDP by over 5%, without consistently improving resilience to disruptions. According to the OECD's 'Study on the Resilience of the Supply Chain', a relocalization policy 'could be costly and not necessarily offer more stability in the face of disruptions'. The study found that in comparison to an interconnected regime, relocalization could reduce global trade by over 18% and the world's real GDP by over 5%, with variations between countries ranging from a 1.1% to a 12.2% loss of GDP, depending on the degree and nature of their integration in global value chains. 'In fact, the stability of the GDP would decrease by more than half of the economies analyzed, which contradicts the claims that relocalization is inherently more stable,' the OECD states. However, the study concludes that most trade flows remain relatively diversified, although the concentration of imports is increasing, as countries increasingly rely on fewer suppliers than possible globally. 'The number of products from a limited range of suppliers is 50% higher at the beginning of the 2020s compared to the end of the 1990s, a trend that could increase vulnerability to external disruptions,' the OECD notes. However, it highlights that this trend is driven almost entirely by non-OECD countries, as the level of significant import concentration in OECD countries has remained stable during the observed period. 'The contribution of China to the level of significant import concentration has increased from 5% to 30% over the past 25 years, while the combined contribution of the United States, Germany, and Japan has decreased from 30% to 15%,' the OECD states. In the presentation of the report, the OECD Secretary-General, Mathias Cormann, warned that responses to concerns about supply chain security and market concentration, as well as the long-term transformation of trade flows, 'risk generating undesirable distortions.' Cormann urged that when addressing the future of trade, we should always remember its contribution to improving living standards worldwide and that we need 'balanced approaches' to mitigate the risks of supply chains without compromising the benefits that global trade brings to competition, innovation, productivity, efficiency, and ultimately growth. 'So that trade continues to be the basis of our shared prosperity and to ensure that it meets the expectations of our citizens, we must work together to improve the reliability and resilience of our supply chains,' Cormann said.

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**Editorial: Shifting the scales requires bold action**
The government's proposal to offer free weight-loss drugs for those with a body mass index of over 35 has been met with criticism, with Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela describing the drugs as a 'quick fix'. However, experts agree that a multifaceted approach is necessary to tackle the obesity epidemic, which has failed to make significant progress despite decades of initiatives. The World Health Organisation predicts that the number of people with obesity will double by 2035. Research has shown that obesity is a complex, costly, and chronic disease caused by factors beyond an individual's control, including the addictive effects of ultra-processed food. Abela has proposed a 'multifaceted approach' that includes policy decisions to shape the food environment, addressing social and economic factors, and increasing collaboration with the private sector and professionals on the ground. He has also floated the introduction of a sugar tax and announced a research programme on food labelling, supply, and promotion. Abela's efforts are seen as a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to make obesity a national priority and safeguard future generations from the long-term health and economic consequences of the disease.

**80% of People with Obesity are Women, Says Nutritionist**
According to Daisy Rivas, a nutritionist at the Teófilo Dávila hospital, there is a high percentage of obesity in the country, with at least 10-13 out of 15 patients she sees per week suffering from obesity, and the majority of them are women. Rivas emphasizes that this problem affects people of all ages, from children to adults and the elderly, with around 80-90% of patients presenting with obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1 billion people (1 in 8) worldwide suffer from obesity, a figure that was expected to reach 2030 but has already become a reality in 2024. Rivas highlights the importance of education in preventing obesity, suggesting that parents, especially mothers, learn and teach their children how to eat a balanced diet. She also warns against the dangers of processed and ultra-processed foods, as well as fast food, which can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Rivas recommends consulting a nutritionist for a personalized treatment plan, rather than following 'miracle diets' that can cause imbalances and harm. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) promotes strategic lines of action through public policies and intersectoral interventions to address obesity as a national problem.

**Filatova: Excess weight has a negative impact on the Russian economy**
Deputy of the State Duma Irina Filatova stated that people with excess weight have a very negative impact on the Russian economy. According to her, obesity is directly linked to the growth of diabetes cases, which have doubled in the last 15 years. Filatova noted that over 60% of Russians have excess weight, which leads to increased blood sugar levels, loss of productivity, and increased healthcare costs. Filatova's statement was unexpected, but experts warn that the global problem of obesity may reduce the world's GDP by 2.9% by 2035, equivalent to $4 trillion.

**Turkey sees sharp rise in obesity**
Turkey is experiencing a sharp rise in obesity, with 66.8% of its population affected, according to a 2022 WHO report. By 2030, it's estimated that 27 million people in Turkey will be obese, or one in three. Experts attribute this trend to insufficient nutrition, social inequality, unhealthy food supplies, and a lack of coherent policy strategies. Hacer Foggo, a Turkish poverty researcher, said the growing number of obese children can be linked to extreme poverty, while Bulent Sik, a food researcher, sees a direct link between the rise in child obesity and the widespread consumption of highly processed foods with low nutritional value and a high sugar content. Sik also warned of the use of toxic chemicals in food production, such as pesticides and certain additives that are related to hormonal imbalances and weight gain. Turkey's Health Ministry has launched a national public health campaign to combat obesity, but experts say the effort has drawn criticism for stigmatizing overweight individuals and overlooking the country's broader economic struggles. 'Political decision-makers are responsible for creating solutions,' said Sik. Both Sik and Foggo support a nationwide free school meal program, citing the need for adequate guidelines for healthy eating and restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods.

**Turkey's Obesity Pandemic: A Growing Concern**
Turkey is at the top of the list of countries with the fastest-growing obesity rates among OECD countries, with a rate of 66.8%. According to the World Health Organization, 16 million women and 11 million men in Turkey are expected to be obese by 2030. The main reasons for this are economic conditions, education levels, food systems, and lifestyle. Many people are forced to buy high-calorie and low-nutrient foods due to economic reasons, which can lead to obesity. To combat this, it is necessary to change the current situation by improving access to high-quality food, increasing food literacy, and implementing supportive policies. Additionally, physical activity has decreased due to the increasing screen time and the pressure of modern life. The 'Ideal Kilonu Öğren Sağlıklı Yaşa' (Learn Your Ideal Weight for a Healthy Life) application, launched by the Ministry of Health, aims to measure the body weight and height of citizens in public areas, raising awareness about the importance of a healthy lifestyle. However, it is also necessary to understand the root causes of obesity, such as the quality of food, the presence of pesticides, and the impact of artificial intelligence on dieting.

**Obesity: A Growing Health and Economic Crisis**
According to a report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), approximately half of the world's population is at risk of obesity, with 1.9 billion people expected to be affected by 2035. The report highlights the economic impact of obesity, with estimated costs ranging from 0.05% to 2.24% of a country's GDP. The World Obesity Federation predicts that the global economic impact of obesity will exceed $4 trillion by 2035. The report also notes that one in four people in most countries suffer from obesity, and that the prevalence of obesity is expected to increase by 100% among children between 2020 and 2033. Dr. Hussein Abdulrahman Al-Randi, Assistant Undersecretary for Public Health at the Ministry of Health and Prevention, emphasized that combating obesity is a strategic priority in the country's national health initiatives. He highlighted the importance of promoting healthy lifestyles and raising awareness about the risks of obesity. Dr. Ayoub Al-Jawaldeh, Regional Advisor for Nutrition at the World Health Organization's Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, stressed the need for further research to understand the economic impact of obesity. He also emphasized the importance of providing comprehensive care for obesity, including a range of treatment options. Dr. Ahmed Lamei, a consultant for bariatric and cosmetic surgery, noted that obesity is not just a cosmetic issue, but a medical problem that increases the risk of many other health problems. Dr. Mohammed Al-Haddad, a consultant for bariatric surgery, explained that the diagnosis of obesity begins with measuring the patient's body mass index (BMI) through weight and height measurements. He noted that the severity of obesity can be classified into four stages, with the most severe stage being the most critical. He also emphasized the importance of taking preventive measures, such as promoting healthy lifestyles and regular physical activity, to prevent obesity. The report highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing obesity, including education, prevention, and treatment. It also emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about the risks of obesity and promoting healthy lifestyles.

**China's National Health Commission Launches 'Body Weight Management Year' Initiative**
China's National Health Commission has released the 'Guidelines for Body Weight Management (2024 Edition)', which predicts that by 2030, the country's adult and child obesity rates will reach 70.5% and 31.8%, respectively. In response, the commission has launched the 'Body Weight Management Year' initiative, aiming to curb the country's growing obesity trend through a three-year effort. The initiative includes the release of the 'Adult Obesity Food Guide', which provides detailed dietary recommendations and energy intake guidelines for different regions. Obesity is not just a cosmetic issue, but also a major health and economic problem, with significant social costs. The commission has started to address the core causes of obesity, which may be due to the high costs associated with it. According to a recent study, China has the highest number of obese individuals in the world, with 4.02 billion adults aged 25 and above being overweight or obese in 2021. Obesity is defined by the World Health Organization as a 'chronic metabolic disease' characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the body, leading to weight gain and negative health effects. Research has shown that obesity is linked to over 200 diseases, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, fatty liver, and sleep apnea. The commission has also highlighted the growing trend of abdominal obesity in China, which increases the risk of metabolic diseases. The country's obesity problem is also becoming increasingly prevalent among young people, with a recent survey showing that the prevalence of overweight and obesity among students has increased from 17.14% in 2010 to 26.2% in 2019. The commission has emphasized the importance of preventing obesity, which is a major contributor to healthcare costs. Research has shown that every dollar invested in obesity prevention can save 3-5 dollars in future healthcare costs. The commission has also highlighted the need to control healthcare costs, which have been increasing faster than income growth. By reducing obesity rates, the commission aims to reduce the 'disease base' and lower healthcare costs. This is not a unique approach, as other countries have also implemented measures to address obesity, such as the 'sugar tax' in the UK and the 'child obesity plan' in Spain. Japan has taken a more stringent approach, with a 'whole nation weight loss plan' that includes strict waist circumference measurements for employees. The commission has emphasized the need to manage obesity to address the country's aging population and increasing healthcare costs. By reducing obesity rates, the commission aims to save billions of dollars in healthcare costs and improve the overall health and well-being of the population.

**Obesity: A Major Public Health Concern**
According to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), obesity is a major public health concern, with over 1.9 billion people expected to be obese by 2035. The report highlights the economic burden of obesity, with estimated costs ranging from 0.05% to 2.24% of a country's GDP. The World Obesity Federation estimates that the global economic impact of obesity will exceed $4 trillion by 2035. The report also notes that obesity is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Dr. Hussein Abdulrahman Al-Randi, Assistant Undersecretary for Public Health at the Ministry of Health and Prevention, emphasized the importance of combating obesity as a strategic priority in the country's national health initiatives. He noted that the ministry is working to implement a comprehensive approach to address the issue, including promoting healthy lifestyles, increasing physical activity, and reducing sugar consumption. Dr. Ayoub Al-Jawaldeh, Regional Advisor for Nutrition at the World Health Organization's Eastern Mediterranean Office, stressed the need for further research to understand the economic impact of obesity. He also emphasized the importance of providing comprehensive care for obesity, including a range of treatment options, and prioritizing the human aspect of obesity by focusing on quality of life and health improvement for patients. Dr. Ahmed Lamei, Consultant Surgeon for Obesity and Aesthetic Surgery, highlighted the importance of addressing the root causes of obesity, including unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity. He also emphasized the need for early detection and treatment of obesity, and the importance of promoting healthy lifestyles and reducing sugar consumption. Dr. Mohammed Al-Haddad, Consultant Surgeon for Obesity, noted that the beginning of obesity diagnosis starts with knowing the patient's condition through body mass index (BMI) measurement, and based on this, he is considered to be from 20 to 24.9 kg/m2 as a normal weight, from 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 as overweight, from 30 to 34.9 kg/m2 as obese, from 35 to 39.5 kg/m2 as severely obese, and 40 kg/m2 or more as the highest degree of obesity, which is the most dangerous. He also emphasized the importance of promoting healthy lifestyles, reducing sugar consumption, and increasing physical activity to prevent obesity.

**Mexico on Track to Reduce Obesity by 6% by 2030, Expert Says**
According to Ricardo Luna, founder of the Mexican Society of Obesity (SMO), Mexico has managed to stop the increase in obesity rates in recent years, and if this trend continues, the prevalence of obesity in the country could decrease by 6% by 2030. Luna attributed this success to policies such as food labeling and medical education for healthcare professionals. The National Institute of Public Health (INSP) also recommends measures such as physical activity, healthy eating, and reducing the consumption of sugary drinks to reduce obesity rates. Luna emphasized the importance of addressing obesity as a preventable and treatable condition, rather than blaming individuals for their weight. He also highlighted the need for a high level of commitment from society and the healthcare sector to tackle this issue. 'Mexico is one of the few countries that is stopping the increase in obesity rates. I believe we are on the right track because we have worked a lot with governments and also with the continuous medical education of healthcare professionals,' Luna said. 'It is essential that we, as a population, are more educated about making healthy choices and avoiding the excessive consumption of ultra-processed foods, which has caused significant damage to our country's health,' he added.

**Mexico's Obesity Crisis: A National Plan to Stop Obesity 2030**
According to the World Obesity Federation, over 1 billion people worldwide suffer from obesity, which is a major public health challenge in the 21st century. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2022, over 1.9 billion adults had overweight and 650 million had obesity. The trend is alarming, not only as a health crisis but also as a socio-economic problem. Obesity is associated with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and various types of cancer, which generate a high demand for healthcare services. The estimated global cost of obesity is $4.3 trillion annually, equivalent to 3% of the world's GDP. In Mexico, the medical expenses associated with obesity and its comorbidities have a significant impact on the healthcare budget. Dr. Simón Barquera Cervera, leader of the National Institute of Public Health's Center for Research in Nutrition and Health, emphasized the need to act, saying, 'We are off track regarding the Sustainable Development Goals proposed in 2030. Obesity is considered a risk factor, not a disease.' He insisted that it is essential to prioritize this problem in the political and public agenda. The National Plan to Stop Obesity 2030 aims to reduce the prevalence of obesity in adults to less than 38% by 2030. The plan includes proposals for fiscal measures, warning labels, school environment regulation, nutrition guides, and other measures. 'With a reduction of 40 kilocalories per day per person, we can achieve the goal,' Barquera explained. The plan is based on scientific evidence and seeks to reduce obesity through effective public policies, aligning with international recommendations from the WHO and the Pan American Health Organization.

**World Obesity Rates to Reach Alarming Levels by 2035**
According to the Atlas Mundial de Obesidad 2023, it is estimated that by 2035, 51% of the world's population, or more than 4 billion people, will suffer from obesity or overweight, a alarming increase from 2.6 billion in 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as an abnormal or excessive accumulation of fat that can be harmful to health, increasing the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes type 2, hypertension, heart disease, and cancer. Dr. José Sergio Verboonen, president of the Colegio Mexicano de Cirugía para la Obesidad y Enfermedades Metabólicas (CMCOEM), emphasizes that 'obesity is not just a cosmetic issue, but a chronic disease with serious physical and mental health consequences.' He stresses that 'it is not enough to have prevention programs for nutrition and physical activity, but rather it is necessary to establish integral strategies that combine education, clinical care, and effective public policies.' The CMCOEM is promoting evidence-based information and certifying specialists in the treatment of this disease. In Mexico, the prevalence of obesity is particularly high, with 76.2% of the adult population suffering from overweight or obesity, surpassing the average of the American continent by more than 14 points. The OECD estimates that obesity has a profound impact on the quality of life in Mexico, reducing life expectancy by 4.2 years. The economic burden of obesity and related diseases is also significant, with a cost of $360 per person per year, equivalent to over $7,200 pesos.

**Silent Epidemic: More Than Half of Adults Will Have Obesity by 2050**
A recent study warns that if no urgent measures are taken, by 2050 more than 3.8 billion adults and 746 million children and adolescents will live with obesity. The study, published in The Lancet, is the most comprehensive to date on the evolution and projections of obesity worldwide. According to the study, the prevalence of obesity in adults and young people has doubled over the past three decades. In 2021, 2.11 billion adults and 493 million children and adolescents lived with obesity. By 2050, 60% of adults and 31% of young people will live with obesity. The growth is particularly concerning among children and adolescents, where this condition is projected to be a greater problem than overweight in boys aged 5-14. The highest rates of obesity will be recorded in regions such as Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa, where in 2050 a third of young people will live with obesity. Eight countries already concentrate more than half of the adults with obesity: China, India, USA, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and Egypt. According to the World Obesity Atlas 2025, by 2030, 3,000 million adults in the world will live with obesity, representing 50% of the total population. The study highlights that obesity is a complex problem with multiple causes, including a combination of increased calorie intake and decreased physical activity, as well as other environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to the rapid increase in obesity worldwide. The study also emphasizes the need for coordinated and multi-sectoral strategies to address the multiple causes of obesity. The World Obesity Atlas 2025 also warns that obesity is responsible for around 4 million deaths per year worldwide. In Argentina, in 2021, 10,524 premature deaths were linked to an elevated BMI, while 381,366 people presented health deterioration due to associated diseases. The study published in The Lancet emphasizes that the crisis of obesity will not be resolved with isolated actions, but with coordinated and multi-sectoral strategies that address its multiple causes. The study proposes the implementation of five-year action plans (2025-2030) to stop the accelerated growth of obesity and establish new goals within the post-2030 agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study also highlights the need to strengthen the regulation of the food industry, limiting the commercialization of ultra-processed products, and to invest in public health policies that include nutritional education, promotion of physical activity and access to healthy foods. The researchers warn that time is running out and that, without a firm and global political commitment, obesity will continue to increase, with devastating consequences for global health and economy. 'It is urgent to commit to transforming the diets of all children and adolescents, in particular, but ideally of the entire population, within sustainable global food systems,' said Emmanuela Gakidou, co-author of the study. The study also emphasizes that two-thirds of countries (126 of 194) have not implemented key measures to combat obesity. Among the recommended strategies are taxes on sugary drinks and high-fat, high-sugar, and high-salt foods, subsidies for healthier foods, restrictions on advertising to children, and policies to promote physical activity. In regions such as the Pacific, where overweight affects more than 90% of adults in some countries, the lack of effective regulations exacerbates the crisis and makes it difficult to contain the problem in the long term. The study concludes that obesity is a public health crisis of epidemic proportions, with impacts on health, economy, and healthcare systems worldwide. The projections for 2050, whether from this work or from the World Obesity Atlas 2025, are alarming, but there is still room to reverse the trend with integrated and urgent policies. As Gakidou concludes: 'This is the time to act. If we do not implement strong and coordinated policies at the global level, we will face a public health crisis without precedent that will affect entire generations.'

**Italy's Obesity Epidemic: A Growing Concern for Public Health**
According to the World Health Organization, 1 in 8 adults worldwide suffer from obesity, with 2.5 billion adults over 18 years old being overweight, and 890 million living with obesity. In Italy, nearly half of the population (27 million) is overweight, with 1 in 2 adults (47%) and 3 in 10 children or adolescents (27%) being overweight. The Italian children are among the most at-risk in Europe, with a prevalence of overweight children reaching over 43% in the South. Valter Longo, Professor of Biogerontology and Director of the Longevity Institute at USC, comments, 'The obesity epidemic affects both adults and children, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancer. It's not just excess calories, but also the consumption of food that accelerates aging and contributes to these diseases.' The World Obesity Atlas 2023 predicts that the global economic impact of overweight and obesity will reach $4.32 trillion by 2035 if prevention and treatment measures do not improve. The economic impact of obesity is comparable to that of COVID-19 in 2020, and is expected to account for 8.4% of total healthcare spending in OECD countries by 2050.

**More than ever, we need to focus on prevention**
Associate Professor Lesley Russell emphasizes the need for a focus on prevention in healthcare, citing the importance of addressing social and economic determinants of health. Australia lags behind OECD countries in spending on preventive health, with less than 2% of health expenditure dedicated to prevention over the past 10 years. The National Preventive Health Strategy 2021-2030 aims to increase this to 5% by 2030, but funding has been limited. Russell argues that ideology is beating evidence, with politicians hesitant to implement policies to address obesity, alcohol, and other lifestyle-related diseases due to concerns about being seen as a 'nanny-state'. A recent survey found that 55.4% of respondents believe the government has not gone far enough in regulating and implementing policies to reduce these diseases. As Australia heads into a federal election, Russell calls for a focus on prevention and investment in initiatives such as the Australian Centre for Disease Control.
