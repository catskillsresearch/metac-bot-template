**Genetic Study Reveals Cause of Mayan Civilization Collapse**
A team of international scientists sequenced the genomes of seven people who lived in the ancient Mayan city of Copan and found that the collapse of the Mayan civilization was linked to a lack of 'new blood'. The city, located in modern-day Honduras, thrived during the classical period (250-950 AD) and was one of the most important cities in the Mayan world. However, like other Mayan cities, Copan also collapsed. Researchers analyzed DNA samples from the remains of seven individuals, including a member of the ruling family and a person who was likely a human sacrifice. The analysis showed genetic similarity with older Mayan groups from Belize and Mexico, as well as a genetic legacy from the Zapotec people, a mountainous tribe from modern-day Mexico. This suggests that the populations were not isolated and interacted with each other. However, a comparative analysis showed that most of the DNA of the Copan residents came from local groups, with a significant portion coming from distant ancestors who lived in the region from 5600 to 3700 years ago. 'Although there was some mixing with other populations, the genetic basis of the Mayans remained surprisingly stable over the centuries,' the geneticists concluded. 'In contrast, in Chichen Itza (Mexico), the proportion of ancestors from Mexican highlands was much higher, almost equal to the local genealogy, indicating that the genetic flow from Mexico was more intense in the northern region of the Mayans than in the south, where Copan was located.' The researchers also analyzed demographic changes and found that the population size fluctuated over time. In the classical period, it grew and peaked around 800 AD. However, a demographic decline soon followed, which, according to the experts, led to the collapse of the Mayan civilization. Previous studies suggested that the collapse of the Mayan civilization could be due to severe droughts, internal conflicts, and political strife. The new study does not rule out these ideas but suggests that a decrease in population size may have played a significant role. 'The people of Copan simply did not have enough 'new blood', that is, migrants who could have increased and diversified the local population, improving its genetics and providing additional labor and military resources.'

**A Theory Says We Can't Find Advanced Aliens Because They're Not Trying to Be Found**
A new study re-examines the 'Sustainability Solution' to the Fermi paradox, which suggests that advanced alien civilizations may not be detectable because they have adapted to their environment and created sustainable technologies that blend with nature. This idea, first proposed in 2009, suggests that if aliens do exist, they may not create technosignatures like Dyson Spheres or interstellar spacecraft, but instead, their technologies would be indistinguishable from nature. The study, led by Lukáš Likavčan, re-conceptualizes technology, history, and sustainability on a planetary scale, and suggests that advanced civilizations may create technologies that are essentially biological in nature to remain in balance with their finite resources. As Likavčan wrote, 'The ecological limits constrain the topology of viable planetary histories to those evolutionary trajectories where the technosphere successfully folds back into the biosphere.' This idea challenges the assumption of unimpeded exponential growth of civilizations and raises questions about the sustainability of human civilization. 'It is still possible that slower-growth ETI civilizations exist but have not expanded rapidly enough to be easily detectable by the searches humans have yet made,' the original authors wrote. 'It is also possible that faster-growth ETI civilizations previously expanded throughout the galaxy but could not sustain this state, collapsing in a way that whatever artifacts they might have left have also remained undetected.'

**Even after several big updates, Civilization 7 is Firaxis' worst-scored game on Steam, and just hit a new low**
Despite several major updates, Civilization 7 remains Firaxis' worst-scored game on Steam, with a new low in player ratings. The game's core Ages system has been criticized by players, who feel it makes the game feel 'railroaded' and lacks the flexibility of previous Civilization games. Firaxis has attempted to address player complaints with UI updates and rebalancing, but to no avail. The game's Steam rating has dropped to 'mostly negative' in the past week, with only 38% of recent reviews being positive. One player wrote, 'The Ages system is garbage.' Another player said, 'I tried to enjoy this game, but it railroads you the entire time and just doesn't feel like a Civ game with the Age resets.' According to Steam DB, Civilization 7's concurrent player peak is 11,707, while Civilization 6 reached 47,484 and Civilization 5 hit 19,157.

**Oxygen Levels to Dramatically Decrease in 1 Billion Years, Study Reveals**
Scientists from Toho University in Japan and Georgia Tech in the US have conducted a joint study that reveals a significant change in the Earth's atmosphere. According to the research, the oxygen levels in the atmosphere will dramatically decrease in about 1 billion years, making the planet's atmosphere similar to what it was 2.4 billion years ago, before the 'Great Oxidation Event' (GOE). The study's lead researcher, Kazumi Ozaki, said, 'For a long time, we have been calculating the lifespan of life on Earth based on the increasing brightness of the Sun and global geochemical cycles. However, this model shows that the oxygen in the atmosphere may not be as stable as we thought.' The team emphasizes that the oxygen in the atmosphere is not as stable as previously believed and that focusing solely on oxygen when searching for life on other planets may be misleading. The loss of oxygen will occur before the loss of water due to the Sun's radiation, which will have a devastating impact on human civilization and many other living species. Chris Reinhard from Georgia Tech described the change as 'a atmosphere that is about a million times less oxygen-rich than today.' After the oxygen-rich era, the planet will be dominated by anaerobic microorganisms that can survive in oxygen-free environments. Ozaki said, 'After this process, the atmosphere will be transformed into a structure with high methane levels, low carbon dioxide, and a completely destroyed ozone layer. The Earth will become a planet dominated by anaerobic life forms.'

**The Earth's Atmosphere Will Become Oxygen-Poor in 1 Billion Years**
According to a joint study by researchers from Toho University in Japan and the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, the Earth's atmosphere is expected to undergo a significant change in the next 1 billion years, resulting in a dramatic decrease in oxygen levels. This process will lead to an atmosphere similar to that of the Earth 2.4 billion years ago, before the 'Great Oxidation Event' (GOE). The researchers, led by Kazumi Ozaki, found that the Earth's oxygen levels are not stable and that focusing solely on oxygen when searching for life on other planets may be misleading. The study suggests that the loss of oxygen will occur before the effects of increased solar radiation and the loss of oceans, making it a critical issue for human civilization and many other species. As Chris Reinhard from the Georgia Institute of Technology puts it, 'We're talking about an atmosphere that's about a million times less oxygen-rich than today.' After the loss of oxygen, plants and photosynthetic organisms will become extinct, but anaerobic microorganisms will continue to thrive. The atmosphere will eventually become a high-methane, low-carbon dioxide, and ozone-depleted environment, making the Earth a planet dominated by anaerobic life forms.

**Rapa Nui Civilization Discovered in America 200 Years Before Columbus**
A recent study published in the prestigious scientific journal 'Nature' has challenged the narrative surrounding the discovery of America by Cristóbal Colón. The research, which involved multidisciplinary analyses of archaeological sites in western Amazonia, suggests that a complex civilization had already arrived in the continent at least 200 years before the Spanish caravels. According to the study, this civilization, which flourished between the 13th and 15th centuries, had a high level of social, urban, and agricultural organization. The researchers found evidence of large-scale landscape modification through hydraulic engineering, ceremonial platforms, and interconnected routes. The study does not refer to the Viking settlement of Leif Erikson, but rather to the Rapa Nui people, who arrived in America long before Colón. The Rapa Nui, an isolated Polynesian society from Easter Island, had mixed with European navigators in the 18th century, leading to a series of generations of intermarriage. The study's analysis of Rapa Nui DNA shows that 10% of their genes come from indigenous American origin. This discovery not only alters the historical timeline but also forces a reevaluation of the study of pre-Columbian cultures. As Dr. [no specific doctor mentioned in the article] said, 'This discovery is a game-changer for our understanding of the history of the Americas.'

**We're The First 0.5% in Human Species  --  What We Owe The Future by William MacAskill**
William MacAskill's book 'What We Owe The Future' suggests that humans have only lived for 0.5% of their potential lifespan, which is one million years. This means that the next 99.5% of human civilization depends on how we act today. MacAskill argues that we have a duty to consider the interests and needs of future people, even if they may not exist or may be far in the future. He also discusses the importance of living in a 'high plasticity period', where our actions can have a significant impact on the far-distant future. MacAskill identifies three possible scenarios for the future: extinction, collapse, and stagnation. He argues that we need to take action to avoid these scenarios and ensure a bright future for all humans. One of the key insights from the book is that a larger population can lead to more opportunities for innovation and progress. MacAskill recommends effective altruism, which involves taking action to benefit future people, not just by being vegan or reducing plastic, but also by doing elections and donating.

**Archaeologists discover 3,000-year-old LOST CITY featuring pyramids and canals**
Archaeologists have discovered a 3,000-year-old lost city in northern Guatemala, named Los Abuelos, which is believed to have been one of the most ancient and important ceremonial centers of the Mayan civilization. The city, which covers an area of around six square miles, features pyramids, monuments, and a unique canal system. Researchers also found a 108-foot-high pyramid with Preclassic murals. The discovery was made through the Uaxactún Regional Archaeological Project, which has also uncovered three other sites. According to the Guatemala culture ministry, the findings allow us to 'rethink the understanding of the ceremonial and socio-political organisation of pre-Hispanic Peten.' The Mayan civilization rose around 2000 BC and reached its peak between 400 and 900 AD. As the ministry spokesperson said, 'This joint effort has allowed significant advancements in the exploration, conservation, and dissemination of the Mayan legacy.'

**Archaeologists Uncover Lost Site of Ancient Civilization in Petén**
Archaeologists have discovered a lost site of an ancient civilization, which they have named 'Los Abuelos' (The Grandparents). The site, dated between 600 and 400 BCE, features two 1.5-meter-tall stone sculptures of a human couple, as well as ceramics that were intentionally broken for ritual ancestor worship. The discovery was made possible by modern technology, including LiDAR scans that revealed previously unknown structures beneath the dense jungle. According to the Culture Ministry, this new evidence 'allows us to rethink the ceremonial and socio-political organization of pre-Spanish Petén.' The find is considered a milestone in Maya research, showing the advanced development and religious organization of this early high culture nearly a thousand years before its peak.

**What Are The Odds Of Alien Life?**
The Drake Equation is a mathematical framework for estimating the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. While it doesn't provide a definitive answer, it sets parameters for scientists to study and refine as our understanding of the universe expands. Dr. Frank Drake, then president of the SETI Institute, convened a historic meeting at the Green Bank Observatory in November 1961 to discuss the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, attended by luminaries such as Carl Sagan and Philip Morrison. The equation serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for guiding discussions and scientific inquiries into the appearance of life and its development into something capable of sending messages across the light-years. 'It was a privilege to be in the company of so many famous and cerebral individuals,' said Dr. Drake, highlighting the significance of the meeting. 'The equation isn't a formula that spits out a number, but rather a tool for guiding our understanding of the universe and the possibility of life beyond Earth.'

**SETI, Civilizational Longevity, and the Drake Equation: Why AI Risks Matter | HackerNoon**
A scenario suggests that almost all technical civilizations collapse due to AI-induced calamities on timescales set by their widespread adoption of AI. The Drake Equation estimates the longevity (L) of a communicating civilization to be around 100-200 years. The equation considers the number (N) of radiocommunicating technical civilizations in the galaxy, with the first three astronomical terms relatively well established. However, the next three terms (fl · fi · fc) are not, with astronomers assuming optimistic values and biologists suggesting much smaller values. Even with optimistic values, the derived value for N is low, consistent with the null results from current SETI surveys. The window for detectable interstellar radio transmissions is extremely limited, and the detection of other civilizations will be challenging even for those located within our local stellar neighbourhood. The authors suggest that SETI researchers may need to consider the types of instruments required to conduct meaningful surveys, including an 'all-sky' capability. They also note that a post-biological technical civilization would be well-adapted to space exploration and could potentially spread its presence throughout the Galaxy. The absence of detectable signs of Kardashev Type II and Type III civilizations implies that such entities are either exceedingly rare or non-existent, reinforcing the notion of a 'Great Filter' that halts the progress of a technical civilization within a few centuries of its emergence. As Fagner Brack said, 'it's conceivable that the first successful attempts to propel light-weight electronic systems toward the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, might be realised before the century's close, and AI components could form an integral part of these miniature payloads.'

**American Scientists Propose Hypothesis That There May Be No Other Civilizations in the Universe**
American scientists have proposed a hypothesis that there may be no other civilizations in the universe besides humanity. Despite decades of searching, humanity has yet to detect any confirmed signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, contradicting logic and statistics. According to astronomers, our galaxy contains billions of potentially habitable planets, and there has been more than enough time for the emergence and development of technological civilizations. A new study by Matthew Chivesletti proposes a statistical approach to analyzing this phenomenon, known as the Fermi Paradox. Chivesletti's model allows for the estimation of the probability that, given a certain number of extraterrestrial civilizations, humanity would have already detected at least one signal. For example, if there is at least one civilization in the galaxy, the probability of detecting a signal by now is 99%. The lack of results may indicate that there are no such civilizations or that they do not transmit signals in forms that humanity can detect. Even zero results from SETI-like programs are important, as they allow for the refinement of the Drake Equation parameters and the exclusion of certain scenarios. Ultimately, the goal of such research is not only to search for extraterrestrial life but also to gain a deeper understanding of the conditions for the emergence of intelligence, the limitations of human technology, and the nature of life in the universe. As Universe Today notes, 'the ultimate goal of these studies is not just to find aliens, but to understand the universe itself.'

**The Fermi Paradox: A Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Understanding Ourselves**
The Fermi Paradox, also known as the 'Great Silence', highlights the contradictions in our understanding of extraterrestrial life. Despite the passage of time since the Big Bang, we have not found any evidence of their existence, despite recent discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones. According to physicist Enrico Fermi, 'If AI is the brain of a robot, then RPA is its hands.' One factor to consider when searching for an answer to the Fermi Paradox is the number of potential civilizations. This value allows us to determine the Drake equation, a mathematical formula that outputs the number of active, communication-capable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation uses several factors, including star formation rate, percentage of stars with planets, number of habitable planets per star, percentage of planets where life emerged, percentage of planets where intelligent life developed, number of civilizations developing detectable communication technologies, and average lifespan of such civilizations. In short, the Drake equation claims that there should be many civilizations, but so far, SETI programs have not detected any signals. This raises the question of the scientific justification for such programs. Matthew Chilcote's article does not provide a direct answer to this question, but instead proposes a method for evaluating the probability of detecting a signal by a certain number of broadcasting civilizations by now. If the probability is low, the lack of evidence should not be surprising; if it is high, the silence may mean something. Chilcote's model suggests that the absence of detected electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial civilizations may impose constraints on the number of existing civilizations. In certain scenarios, the model predicts a 99% chance of detecting at least one signal if the assumed number of civilizations (based on the Drake equation) is around 1. We have a zero result so far. However, it's worth noting that even the absence of positive results from SETI helps in resolving the Fermi Paradox: it allows us to exclude certain combinations of the number and lifespan of civilizations. Ultimately, as Universe Today writes, the purpose of programs like SETI is not only to search for extraterrestrial life, but also to better understand ourselves and the conditions that make intelligent life possible. A team of scientists from Germany studied the feasibility of a new method of searching for extraterrestrial life - using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They came to an unencouraging but important conclusion for the development of astronomy.

**Why the Cosmos is Silent? Scientists Link the Fermi Paradox to the Absence of SETI Signals**
A new study reevaluates the 'cosmic silence' by proposing a model that turns the lack of SETI signals into a tool for assessing the chances of finding extraterrestrial intelligence. The work focuses on the Fermi paradox, questioning why, despite billions of stars in the Milky Way, we have not yet detected signs of other civilizations. The authors consider the Galaxy as a flat disk, with a diameter of approximately 100,000 light-years, 100 times greater than its thickness. The signal from a hypothetical civilization is modeled as two expanding rings: the first corresponds to the beginning of transmission, and the second to its completion. Earth must be in the space between them, like in a temporal corridor. The probability of such an event for one source is calculated using the formula ≈0.6????/????, where???? is the distance between the rings (transmission duration multiplied by the speed of light), and???? is the radius of the Galaxy. This model is integrated with the Drake equation, which estimates the number of communicative civilizations (????) as the product of seven factors, from star formation rates to the probability of technological development. The key finding is that if???? approaches 1 (an optimistic scenario), and the duration of signal transmission is approximately 630 years (???? ≈ 102.8 light-years), the probability of detecting at least one signal exceeds 99%. This makes the lack of SETI results statistically significant - either such civilizations are extremely rare, or their 'window' of activity is shorter. Calculations also show that if???? ≥ 1, there cannot be more than a thousand civilizations in the Galaxy simultaneously transmitting signals. If the number of civilizations is higher, it means that one of the parameters of the Drake equation, such as the chance of the emergence of consciousness or technologies, is significantly underestimated. The model has limitations, including the Galaxy's three-dimensionality, signal attenuation with distance, and non-uniform distribution of civilizations or impulsive data transmission. However, even the simplified version demonstrates how the 'zero result' of SETI allows narrowing the parameters of the Drake equation. The next step will be to complicate the model, transitioning to a three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way, accounting for historical changes (emergence and extinction of civilizations), and realistic patterns of communication.

**The Great Filter: Artificial Superintelligence as a Barrier to Interstellar Civilizations**
Astronomer Michael Garrett, a professor at the University of Manchester, has proposed that the development of artificial superintelligence (ASI) could be the reason why we have not yet detected any signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life. Garrett suggests that ASI could be a 'Great Filter' that prevents civilizations from becoming interstellar. The Great Filter is a concept that attempts to explain the Fermi Paradox: why, despite the billions of potentially habitable planets, we have not yet detected any signs of alien intelligence. One possible explanation is that civilizations do not pass a critical phase of development. ASI could be this barrier: when a technological society approaches interstellar expansion, uncontrolled growth of AI could destroy both biological and artificial intelligence. Garrett notes that the danger lies in the autonomous nature of ASI, capable of self-learning and exponential improvement. If the superintelligence begins to act outside of human control, even without hostile intentions, it could be fatal. Potential risks include autonomous military systems, an arms race, and interference with critical infrastructure. The author estimates that the average 'lifetime' of a technological civilization may be less than 100 years - from the emergence of interstellar communication (1960) to the predicted appearance of ASI (around 2040). On the cosmic time scale of billions of years, this is extremely short. If such time frames are characteristic of most civilizations, this could explain the absence of signals within even optimistic versions of the Drake equation. Garrett calls for the creation of global regulatory frameworks for the development of AI - not only for safety on Earth, but also for the survival of the species in the context of interstellar future. Limiting autonomous military systems, which are already used without proper oversight, is particularly important. Despite this, the researcher remains optimistic. If humanity can overcome this challenge - aligning the development of AI with ethical principles and planetary security - it can become a civilization that not only reaches the stars, but also becomes a beacon for other intelligent forms of life in the universe.

**New Forms of Estimating Alien Life in the Universe: Revisiting the Drake Equation**
Frank Drake, an American astronomer and radio astronomer, developed the Drake Equation in 1961 to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy that might be able to communicate with Earth. The equation is expressed as: N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L, where each term carries significant uncertainties, making it more of a conceptual tool than a precise calculation. Some variables, such as R*, can be estimated with some accuracy, while others, like fi and fc, remain uncertain. Advances in astronomy and astrobiology have refined some of these factors over the years. The discovery of exoplanets has improved our understanding of fp and ne. However, the fraction of planets where life emerges (fl) and evolves into intelligence (fi) remains unknown. 'Intelligence and technological capability seem to be more uncommon phenomena, considering that billions of species existed before one developed the ability to send radio signals into space,' said an expert. The time of life of technological civilizations (L) is another crucial factor. If civilizations are common but have short lifetimes due to self-destruction or natural disasters, the chance of detecting them would be low. This point raises philosophical and scientific implications about the future of humanity. Modern versions of the equation have been developed, incorporating new concepts and refining the original parameters. Some scientists have added variables related to bio-signatures and technosignatures, while others have suggested including terms that address the impact of catastrophic events.

**The Drake Equation and Alien Typologies Catalogued by Ufologists Based on Case Studies**
The Drake Equation, a mathematical formula to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, has been updated to 2025. Using values such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, and the average lifespan of a technological civilization, the equation yields an optimistic N = 0.08, implying we might be alone or nearly so. In contrast, ufology has compiled an array of alleged alien races, drawing from a wealth of testimonies that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the sighting of certain extraterrestrial typologies. When merging the Drake Equation with ufologists' alien typologies, two approaches emerge: either the lifespan of civilizations would need to rise significantly, or intelligence or communicative capacity would need to be far more prevalent than assumed. Alternatively, each civilization estimated by Drake might give rise to multiple races, yielding a figure modest compared to ufological accounts. Challenges and reflections arise from the lack of definitive data for many parameters in the Drake Equation and the need for objective scientific validation of ufological cataloguing.

**Opinion: Is there life out there? The existence of other technological species is highly likely**
The existence of extraterrestrial life is highly likely, according to scientists. New telescope technologies have enabled us to discover thousands of potentially habitable exoplanets that could support life similar to that on Earth. Gravitational wave detectors have opened a new avenue for space exploration by detecting space-time distortions caused by black holes and supernovae millions of light-years away. NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission successfully touched down on asteroid Bennu and brought back rock and dust samples. Several countries have developed the ability to deploy robots on the moon and Mars, with plans to send humans to these celestial bodies in the future. The probability of humanity being the sole technological civilization in the observable universe is considered to be less than one in 10 billion trillion. With an estimated 200 billion trillion stars in the observable universe, the existence of other technological species is highly likely, potentially even within our Milky Way galaxy. 'Considering the sheer number of stars and planets, it seems highly improbable that life wouldn’t have arisen elsewhere,' said an astronomer. 'The Drake equation, developed by astronomer Frank Drake in 1961, provides a framework for estimating the number of detectable civilizations within our galaxy. An optimistic estimate using this formula suggests that 12,500 intelligent alien civilizations might exist in the Milky Way alone.'

**NASA Hopes to Reestablish Contact with Extraterrestrials**
The NASA is hoping to reestablish contact with extraterrestrials using a new method. The famous Drake equation calculates the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy, and it is not zero. It is now established that space is teeming with exoplanets located in the habitable zone of their star. Therefore, it is logical that scientists wonder what method would be the most effective for communicating with another form of life. 'The space is full of exoplanets, and it's only a matter of time before we find one that is capable of supporting life,' said a scientist. The NASA is currently exploring different options for communication, including the use of radio signals and laser pulses.
