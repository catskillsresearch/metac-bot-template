**US crude oil storage demand surges as traders brace for OPEC+ price war | BOE Report**
OPEC+ has agreed to accelerate oil output hikes for a second consecutive month in June, with the potential to bring back 2.2 million barrels-per-day (bpd) of supply to the market by November. This move aims to punish over-producing members and win back market share from U.S. producers. As a result, crude oil storage demand has surged, with The Tank Tiger's platform seeing a nearly doubling of demand from May to 3 million barrels for June. Steven Barsamian, chief operating officer at The Tank Tiger, stated, 'We have not seen this kind of an uptick in crude storage demand since the COVID-19 pandemic.' U.S. crude oil inventories have risen to 443.2 million barrels, the highest since July 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

**OPEC+ mulls super-sized output surge of 4,11,000 bpd for July -- triple of initial plan: How it risks crude prices? | Stock Market News**
OPEC members are discussing a potential oil production surge of 411,000 barrels a day for July, triple the initial plan, according to delegates. This would be the third consecutive output hike, following similar increases in May and June. The move aims to satisfy demand, but officials have also cited motives such as punishing over-producing members and recouping market share. Saudi Arabia has warned errant members, including Kazakhstan and Iraq, to fall in line with their quotas, or face further production increases. If approved, this would mark the third month in a row that OPEC has agreed to boost supplies by triple the initially scheduled amount, which could further impact crude prices.

**Oil Prices Dip On Report Of Another Potential OPEC+ Supply Boost**
OPEC+ is considering a third consecutive monthly output hike, potentially increasing oil supply by 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July. This would mirror supply increases in May and June, and could lead to a breakdown in Brent crude's $60-per-barrel price floor. Brent crude fell to $63 a barrel, down about 1.7%, following the news. According to Harry Tchiliguirian at Onyx Capital Group, 'We're seeing the market reacting to evidence that OPEC is letting go of a strategy to defend price in favour of market share.' RBC Capital analyst Helima Croft noted that a 411,000 bpd increase in July is the 'most likely outcome,' mainly from Saudi Arabia. However, rising U.S. 10-year Treasury yields may signal a warning, as higher yields reflect tightening financial conditions and slower growth expectations. Lower prices could be derailed if Israel launches a preemptive attack on Iran's nuclear sites.

**Shell's Stock Drops Amid Oil Sector Decline and Rumors of BP Acquisition**
Shell's stock is losing ground in Amsterdam as the oil sector is affected by declining sales due to increased production from OPEC+ countries. Bloomberg reported over the weekend that Shell is considering acquiring its rival BP, a move that could transform the sector. Shell's spokesperson said, 'We are strongly focused on capturing Shell's value by continuing to concentrate on performance, discipline, and simplification.' The entire sector is feeling the impact of the new drop in oil prices after OPEC+ decided to increase production for June above expectations. The eight member countries of the cartel (including Saudi Arabia and Russia) confirmed the increase in daily oil extractions by 411,000 barrels, which was higher than the initial plan of 137,000 barrels. This development is expected to further penalize oil prices on international markets, with WTI June futures losing 4% and Brent July futures losing 1.93%.
