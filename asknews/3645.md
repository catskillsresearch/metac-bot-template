**IATA Sets Priorities for Future of Aviation: Safety, Affordability, and Sustainability**
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has established three key priorities for the future of aviation: improving safety, making flights more affordable, and advancing towards a more sustainable aviation industry. According to IATA Director General Willie Walsh, these priorities were determined by asking passengers what they expect from the future of aviation, and their responses were clear: more safety, affordability, and sustainability. In 2024, there were seven fatal accidents among 40.6 million flights and 244 deaths among 4.8 billion passengers, according to Walsh. The IATA has emphasized the importance of initiatives such as the Global Aviation Data Management (GADM) and 'Turbulence Aware', which collected data from over 8 million flights in 2024, highlighting the need for data management and artificial intelligence in aviation safety. The IATA has also called for increased government investigation of accidents and protection of civilian aircraft in conflict zones, where two aircraft were shot down this year. Walsh noted that the real cost of flying today is 40% lower than a decade ago, despite increased costs and taxes, and that the market's competitiveness will continue to trend in this direction. However, the IATA has identified a lack of transparency and efficiency in the component market as a major obstacle to accessibility, with a 26% decrease in demand in 2025 compared to last year's projections. Walsh has also criticized European policies, such as those in the Netherlands, which he says undermine competitiveness under the guise of reducing noise pollution. He emphasized the need for collaboration between governments, airports, and airlines to understand the industry's real needs and to achieve sustainability goals, including a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, the IATA has denounced the lack of effective policies and clear regulatory frameworks as a major obstacle to progress, and has criticized the insufficient production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which currently meets only 1% of the industry's needs.

**Flight path shake-up promises quicker flights and fewer delays**
The UK government plans to modernize the country's flight paths through the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS), which aims to reduce journey times, delays, and emissions. The initial focus will be on London's airspace, with changes expected to come into effect in the 2030s. However, some changes outside of London could be implemented before then. Aviation Minister Mike Kane said, 'Modernising our airspace is also one of the simplest ways to help reduce pollution from flying and will set the industry up for a long-term, sustainable future.' But some residents, like Dr. Alan Lafferty, who lives near Heathrow, are concerned that new flight paths will make the situation worse for them. Tim Alderslade, head of Airlines UK, said the changes were 'long overdue' and called for swift action. Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2, also welcomed the announcement, saying it was 'excellent news' that would help achieve CO2 reductions. Finlay Asher, an aerospace engineer, emphasized the need to prioritize environmental impacts and community well-being. 'Using these changes to simply increase the number of polluting flights would send emissions soaring in the wrong direction,' he said.

**Lufthansa Plane Flies 10 Minutes Without Pilot in Cockpit**
A Lufthansa Airbus A321, carrying 199 passengers, flew for 10 minutes without a pilot in the cockpit on February 17. The incident, revealed by a report from the Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes e Incidentes de Aviación Civil (CIAIAC), has raised concerns about current safety protocols. The co-pilot fainted and the captain was outside the cockpit, leaving the plane under the control of the autopilot. The captain finally accessed the cockpit when the co-pilot partially regained consciousness and opened the door. The flight was diverted to Madrid, where it landed safely. This incident has reignited the debate on safety in commercial aviation, particularly regarding the continuous presence of at least two people in the cockpit. The report also reveals that the co-pilot had known medical conditions, including a possible neurological disorder, which has sparked a discussion about the adequacy of current medical exams and their long-term follow-up. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has recommended a thorough review of medical aptitude protocols for pilots. 'This is not a system failure, it's a human oversight failure. We cannot rely solely on machines,' said the pilots' union. Lufthansa has confirmed that it is aware of the CIAIAC report and has conducted its own internal investigation, but has not made the results public or announced any specific changes to its operational protocols.

**Experts Predict Humans Will Live Up to 1000 Years or Become Immortal by 2050**
Experts predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as genetic engineering, brain-computer interfaces, and virtual reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever by uploading their consciousness into computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs are not just about living longer, but about a complete transformation of humanity. Dr. Pearson believes that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through advanced technologies, such as genetic engineering and brain-computer interfaces. He predicts that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Dr. Kurzweil predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. de Grey thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. He believes that the first person to achieve this will already be born. His approach, 'integrative rejuvenation,' uses a comprehensive treatment to remove cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we will be able to achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will increase faster than time passes. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will help significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' that cause inflammation in the body. 'We already understand the processes of aging well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, Dr. de Grey's vision may transform death from aging into a rare event, opening a medical path to eternal life. As a reminder, we previously wrote about some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, which can stop aging or even turn back time.

**Concerns over plans to replace human co-pilots with artificial intelligence**
There are concerns about plans to replace human co-pilots with artificial intelligence in commercial aircraft. By the 2030s, the number of pilots on commercial flights could be reduced by half, with AI taking over their roles. This could make flying much less safe, as instead of having a captain and co-pilot on board, as is the case with large commercial planes today, flights would rely on a single pilot and AI designed to perform the difficult and critical role of ensuring safety. Airlines argue that this would address a pilot shortage that has become economically unsustainable for the industry. However, Single Pilot Operations (SPO) face strong resistance from global pilots' unions, who see it as a cost-cutting measure. Critics argue that replacing human co-pilots with AI could eliminate important human interactions, such as monitoring each other's behavior during flight and calming each other down in stressful situations. They also question how AI would handle unexpected events, such as a sudden loss of data, which could impact safe operation. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has put plans for SPO on hold, pending further study, and will re-examine the idea after 2027.

**EU's Plan to Replace Human Pilots with AI in Commercial Aircraft Sparks Safety Concerns**
A project aims to replace human pilots with AI systems in commercial aircraft, sparking concerns about safety. According to engineer Izan González, 'it's an attack on air security' because AI lacks the 'instinct and a capacity for reaction' to respond to unexpected situations. The current system relies on redundancy and the expertise of two pilots, which is essential for ensuring the safety of passengers. González notes that 'no innovation should be implemented if it doesn't increase safety.' He cites the example of US Airways Flight 1549, where the crew's 'pericia and situational awareness' allowed them to land the plane safely on the Hudson River, a feat that an AI system would not have been able to accomplish. The European Union has set a deadline of 2030 for making a decision on this issue. 'Currently, the date of the decision is set for 2030,' González says. 'It's a threat to the security of passengers.'

**Zero-emissions flights will become a reality, Bertrand Piccard says**
Bertrand Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, aviator, and global explorer, is leading the Climate Impulse project, which aims to complete the first non-stop flight around the world on a green hydrogen plane. Piccard predicts that the first commercial flight with passengers in a hydrogen-powered aeroplane will be possible by 2035. He believes that hydrogen, a colourless and highly inflammable gas, is the key to making aviation greener. The Climate Impulse project is currently building a green hydrogen-powered aeroplane in France, with the goal of completing a non-stop, zero-emission circumnavigation of the globe by 2028. According to Piccard, the challenge is to have the propulsion chain with the hydrogen cell, electric motors, all working together. He argues that innovators can show a project is possible, but then industries need to invest in it to increase adoption and decrease the price of the new technology. 'I want to use the purest and cleanest hydrogen...it's a new business that has to be made, a new industry, we need to create everything from scratch,' he said. 'Each time people think of problems, they think it's difficult. If you say it's a challenge, people will say Wow that's interesting,' the explorer added.

**The Wild West of the Skies: Challenges and Opportunities in Air Traffic Control**
The increasing number of vehicles flying in the skies, including drones, eVTOLs, and space debris, poses a critical challenge to air traffic control and safety. According to a study by Oliver Wyman, the number of passenger aircraft is expected to increase by 33% to over 36,000 by 2034. Meanwhile, thousands of eVTOLs and space launches are expected to share the skies with these aircraft. Experts in aviation believe that a new approach to managing air traffic is needed. 'There are more users and more vehicles that want to use the airspace... The way we provide our services will likely have to change significantly,' says Eduardo García, senior manager of future skies at Canso, the organization that represents the air traffic management industry. 'It's a key issue and it won't be easy. Our industry is critical to safety,' he adds. The study also warns that the risk of space debris colliding with an aircraft is increasing due to the growing number of reentries and flights. 'Even a small piece of debris could be devastating for an aircraft,' the study says. In the lower levels of airspace, small drones are causing problems for airlines. The London Gatwick airport was closed for 36 hours in December 2019 due to reports of drone sightings, affecting over 140,000 passengers. However, larger eVTOLs for passenger transport, powered by batteries and taking off and landing like helicopters, are expected to enter commercial use in the next decade. 'The industry has been overly optimistic about when these aircraft will be approved for passenger transport, but many companies are flying prototypes, and industry experts believe that their conversion into a significant part of the transportation network is only a matter of time,' says the study. The study suggests that commercial air taxi services could start in the next two or three years and take around a decade to 'scale up.' These air taxis, which are ultimately expected to be pilotless, will need to be integrated safely into the airspace below approximately 1,500 meters. Regulators and air traffic management agencies in Europe and the US are competing to prepare for the new era, combining space vehicles and air taxis with the air traffic control network. With time, as the technology becomes better understood, disruptions are expected to decrease. The Federal Aviation Administration, the agency that regulates civil aviation, says it has reduced the closures of airspace due to space vehicles to 'more than two hours' per launch from 'more than four hours.' However, if the traditional air traffic control system is unable to handle the growing number of vehicles, the likely response will be automation. 'Human cognitive capacity to manage vehicles with different speeds and capabilities, and in more crowded airspace, has a limit,' says García. 'We will need more automation and artificial intelligence to help and support our way of doing things.'
