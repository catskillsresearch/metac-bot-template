**Daily on Energy, presented by CRES Forum: Legislative text - Washington Examiner**
The House Ways and Means Republicans have released a reconciliation text that aims to cut clean energy tax credits established by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. The proposal would terminate the $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicles, commercial clean vehicle tax credits, and the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit. The bill would also phase out the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits and the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is set to mark up its portion of the budget reconciliation package, which would cancel up to $6.5 billion in unspent funding from the IRA. The Department of Energy is also moving forward with the president's deregulatory agenda by walking back 47 different climate and energy-related regulations. Oil prices surged after the US and China announced a temporary trade agreement to lower tariffs. Chinese battery company CATL plans to raise at least $4 billion to expand overseas. The European Union is asking the Czech Republic to delay signing a nuclear contract with South Korea amid an investigation into foreign subsidies.

**House GOP unveils bill text for slashing Biden energy tax credits**
The House GOP has unveiled a bill that would terminate and modify clean energy and manufacturing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was passed by Democrats in 2022. The bill would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, terminate the Clean Hydrogen Production 45V tax credit, and block wind energy from the Advanced Manufacturing Production tax. The legislation also subjects the Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits to a phase-out period and restrictions related to prohibited foreign entities. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) criticized the bill, saying it would 'jack up prices on American families,' 'kill jobs,' and 'create chaos in the business community.'

**What the House GOP is proposing in its first draft of Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package**
House Republicans have released details of their sweeping tax and spending cuts package, which includes proposals to slash Medicaid spending, add work requirements for recipients, and cut funding for clean energy programs. The package also includes tax changes, such as a boost to the child tax credit and a permanent increase in the estate tax exemption. Additionally, the plan would make significant investments in border security, including the construction of new detention facilities and the hiring of thousands of new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Other proposals include changes to the student loan program, the creation of a 'Promise' program to provide colleges with performance-based grants, and the elimination of seven green programs authorized by the Democrats' 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The plan aims to extend the GOP's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and fulfill several of President Trump's campaign promises, with a total of at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts and trillions of dollars in tax reductions over a decade.

**The Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are at risk**
The Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are at risk due to the high cost of the legislation, estimated to be around $1.16 trillion over the next 10 years. The Joint Committee on Taxation's initial estimate of $366 billion was challenged by Goldman Sachs, the Cato Institute, and the Treasury Department. The Republicans are struggling to make the math of tax reform work, with not enough votes to put all tax reform preferences on the credit card. They have three choices: reduce spending on Medicaid, increase the debt, or cannibalize the Inflation Reduction Act to pay for additional tax and spending reductions. It is likely that the tax credits will be at risk, as voters and members of Congress may prioritize preservation of Medicaid over tax credits for a small group of companies and rich individuals. The competition for tax reform includes provisions that benefit the donor base of the majority party, making the climb more difficult.

**In Defense of the Consumer: A Call for Action**
Many people are struggling with the rising cost of living, including increased energy prices. According to the Federal Government, prices of goods and services will increase by 5.4% this year, while inflation will remain at least 3%. Energy prices are expected to rise by 7%. For Latinos, the situation is even more concerning, as a study by the University of Indiana found that two out of five Latinos have struggled to pay their electricity bills, and 18% have had their electricity disconnected at least once. However, solutions and benefits exist to help make life and finances brighter. Unfortunately, the administration is trying to end funding for the Home Appliance and Home Efficiency Rebate Project, but funds seem to be flowing again, benefiting low-income families. In Congress, important tax credits, such as the Home Energy Efficiency Improvement Credit (25C), are also under threat. These initiatives are part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which dedicates billions to help consumers save money on their energy bills. Despite political attacks on this law, there is growing Republican support to preserve tax credits in the manufacturing sector, which is creating good jobs for making batteries and electric vehicles. These savings initiatives should not be politicized because they benefit everyone in a non-partisan way. The 50 states, excluding South Dakota, have received approval to launch these rebate programs. Twelve states, including several with high Latino populations, have already launched their rebate programs, and 15 others have been granted funds after the November elections. These programs are extremely popular, with over 3.4 million families benefiting from the IRA in 2023, receiving $8.4 billion in tax credits to electrify and make their homes more efficient. Additionally, they promoted the creation of 142,000 jobs in the clean energy economy. In summary, rebate programs achieve: Reducing energy inflation costs. Creating local jobs. Boosting the manufacturing sector. And strengthening the national electrical grid and energy security. Consumers face significant inflationary pressure, labor market uncertainty, and the rigors of the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act and its historic aid and benefits approved by Congress constitute a well-deserved relief, especially for low- and moderate-income families.

**Trump Must Bury Biden's Subsidies for Russian and Chinese Minerals**
The US is heavily reliant on mineral imports from China, which is using its control of supply chains to exert leverage. To break China's hold, the US needs to increase the competitiveness of its mining industry and strengthen incentives for domestic production. However, Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, has failed to achieve its goal due to loopholes that allow foreign-mined minerals to be processed in the US and receive tax credits. This hands subsidies to refiners who import minerals from China and Russia while denying access to US-based mining operations. The author argues that Congress should fix 45X to support American production at every level of the supply chain, close loopholes, and expand eligibility to include domestic mining operations. This would strengthen US competitiveness, take on China, and keep American tax policy focused on supporting domestic investment, jobs, and national security.

**Consigned CLT Credit Adds 0.9 Points to GDP by 2026**
Despite facing the highest interest rates in two decades, the Brazilian economy is expected to grow above 2% this year and another 2% next year, thanks to the positive impacts of the consigned CLT credit and the expansion of the income tax exemption. Economists believe that the stimuli will gain traction as 2026 approaches, an election year that will erode part of the efforts of the monetary authority to cool the economy and control inflation, leaving the Central Bank rowing against the tide. Sergio Vale, chief economist at MB Associados, estimates that the consigned credit for the private sector with FGTS guarantee, launched in March this year, will have a positive impact of at least 0.9 percentage points on the GDP until 2026. Vale projects that the activity will grow almost 1 percentage point more until December 2026, with 0.4% this year and 0.5% next year. Another significant benefit is the expansion of the income tax exemption to R$ 5,000, which could add another 0.5 percentage points to the GDP next year. 'A 1% GDP is transformed into 2% with two significant measures. It's counterproductive. The government stimulates growth and the BC, on the other hand, tries to combat it,' says Vale. Fabio Kanczuk, a former director of monetary policy at the Central Bank, notes that measures like the consigned credit or the expansion of the income tax exemption keep the neutral interest rate high, which is a reference for the BC to decide the Selic rate. 'The account is: if the Selic minus the expected inflation is above the neutral interest rate, it contracts the activity, and the inflation falls. And vice versa. But when you make fiscal expansion, you're acting in the opposite direction, and the neutral interest rate rises. If the government raises the neutral interest rate through benefits, the Central Bank needs to raise the Selic even more,' explains Kanczuk. He estimates that the neutral interest rate today is 8%, not 5% as seen by the Central Bank. 'If the neutral interest rate were at 5%, the economy would be sinking, we should be in a deep recession. And we're not, because of the stimuli,' he says. Ivo Chermont, chief economist at Quantitas, notes that the stimuli may delay a potential drop in the basic interest rate. 'The government Lula 3 clearly used fiscal policy to prevent the economy from having any deceleration. There was a cursed inheritance from the Bolsonaro government, 2022 was a disaster in terms of spending. But the remedy for this wastefulness was to spend more,' he says.

**House Ways and Means Releases Partial Tax Bill Text**
The House Ways and Means Committee has released partial text for the tax portion of a reconciliation bill, which aims to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and make other tax reforms. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the provisions would add over $4.9 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. The committee is expected to release additional text before a markup on May 13. The draft still lacks provisions on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Inflation Reduction Act energy credits, and more. Checkpoint invites comments from the tax community on how these proposals may affect tax practice and the federal budget.

**House Republicans look to rollback energy tax credits benefiting Utah businesses, municipalities**
House Republicans are considering rolling back energy tax credits that benefit Utah businesses and municipalities, which could impact projects like Perennial Favorites, a wholesale plant nursery in Layton, and Logan City's plans for a 15-megawatt solar-energy facility. The tax credits have helped businesses like Perennial Favorites install on-site solar power generation, reducing their energy costs and creating jobs. Utah Rep. Blake Moore said the goal is to find a 'happy medium' between respecting existing investments and avoiding deficit-inducing tax credits. However, critics argue that the tax credits have delivered lower energy costs and created good jobs across Utah, with over $400 million in investments made possible through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act.

**Here's How the US's Solar Tax Credits Work**
The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a generous tax credit for citizens looking to install rooftop solar panels on their homes. The residential clean energy credit covers up to 30% of the cost of new, qualified clean energy improvements in your home, made between now and 2033. This includes projects like solar, water heaters, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, fuel cells, and battery storage technology. According to Gilbert Michaud, an assistant professor in the School of Environmental Sustainability at Loyola University Chicago, 'It actually had been scaling down prior to the passing of the IRA, and as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, they just said, 'We're going to mitigate all the risk and the changes and uncertainty'' and bump it back up. In 2023, more than 752,000 American taxpayers claimed the credit for solar systems, with an average credit of $27,355.

**Snag Those Rebates for Home Energy Upgrades Before the GOP Kills Them | The New Republic**
Homeowners who are eligible for rebates for home energy upgrades under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may need to act quickly as the GOP threatens to repeal the program. According to Friedman, 'It’s going to take an act of Congress to change that,' and even if Congress were to repeal the program, it would likely be done ahead of schedule, possibly by 2026. In the meantime, homeowners can take advantage of the existing tax credits to upgrade their homes and save on energy bills. Additionally, some communities are finding creative ways to reduce energy consumption, such as using windcatchers, solar-powered water heaters, and efficient air conditioners. As Friedman noted, 'Typically when changes are made to tax law, it’s going forward, not present or going back.'

**Federal energy tax credits will cost more than $4 trillion. Lawmakers might not cut them.**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, has been projected to cost taxpayers $936 billion to $1.97 trillion in 10 years and between $2.04 trillion and $4.67 trillion by 2050. The Congressional Budget Office initially estimated the cost to be $370 billion over 10 years. The IRA's tax credits and subsidies have largely benefited wealthy households and large corporations. Sen. Lindsey Graham called the House's plan to identify $880 billion in spending cuts 'woefully inadequate.' A repeal of IRA spending is unlikely, despite the bill's ballooning costs and inefficient greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. Rep. Bob Latta stated that 'a lot of the dollars had already been pushed out by the Biden administration,' which could reduce the amount available for cuts.

**Strange bedfellows unite to kill carbon capture credit**
Reps. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) have introduced legislation to repeal the 45Q tax credit, which incentivizes energy and polluting companies to capture and store carbon dioxide. The move comes as Republicans consider the fate of climate-friendly energy incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. According to the lawmakers, the goal is to 'kill' the carbon capture credit, with Perry stating, 'It was a great day' to announce the legislation, although the context of this quote is unclear. The 45Q allowances are considered among the least imperiled of the climate-friendly incentives.

**Energy Tax Credits in the Eye of the Storm (for Now)**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) expanded energy tax credits in August 2022, but their future is uncertain due to President Trump's shift away from clean energy initiatives. Although President Trump cannot repeal the IRA's tax credits unilaterally, a leaked internal House memorandum suggests that repealing the green energy tax credits is under consideration. Additionally, President Trump has paused new regulations and can limit the impact of the credits by withdrawing existing guidance, putting many projects at risk. The IRA's tax credits are also a target for potential cuts through the Congressional budget reconciliation process, with a proposed $4.5 trillion budget package set to reach the House floor soon. As President Trump said, 'the question isn't whether energy tax credits will be affected, but how they will be affected and how soon.'

**Maximize Your Section 45X Tax Credit Ahead of Tax Season**
The section 45X tax credit, introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, aims to incentivize domestic clean energy manufacturing by rewarding manufacturers for producing qualifying advanced energy components. The credit is calculated based on specific metrics, such as production volume, electrical capacity, or cost, and is fully transferable, allowing manufacturers to sell unused credits for immediate cash benefits. The program offers full credit benefits through 2029, with a phased reduction beginning in 2030. To claim the credit, manufacturers must meet the IRS's definition of 'substantial transformation,' which requires significant processing of raw materials or components to become a new and distinct product. The credit is also subject to eligibility and domestic manufacturing requirements, including the sale of manufactured products to unrelated third-parties. The IRS has emphasized rigorous oversight of tax credits like section 45X to prevent misuse, and manufacturers should carefully evaluate their processes and maintain meticulous documentation to validate their eligibility.

**Clean energy tax credit could save taxpayers $1 trillion**
The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) life cycle analysis (LCA) tax credits for clean hydrogen production and clean electricity generation have raised concerns about effectiveness and unintended consequences. The tax credits, which are uncapped and projected to cost trillions of dollars, hinge on how key benchmarks, such as carbon intensity (CI), are defined and calculated. Critics argue that LCA is not a straightforward calculator of environmental costs, but rather a tool that reflects normative assumptions about environmental trade-offs. Without standardized methodologies, different stakeholders may reach divergent conclusions about the same project's environmental impact, fueling controversy and debate. The U.S. Treasury Department has finalized regulations addressing these concerns, but researchers emphasize the need for further safeguards, including ensuring only activities that actively remove atmospheric carbon receive negative CI scores and reclaiming tax credits if facilities revert to polluting practices post-subsidy.

**Homeowners Rush to Install Solar Panels Before Trump Cuts Tax Credits**
Homeowners are rushing to install solar panels before the potential elimination of federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The solar tax credit, which allows a deduction of up to 30% of qualified system costs, is set to expire at the end of 2032. However, uncertainty surrounding the credit's future has caused some homeowners to accelerate their solar installation plans. According to a recent NPR report, a Boston-area resident expedited his home solar panel project to complete it before the end of last year, citing concern that the new administration might reduce or eliminate the solar tax credit. The report suggests this could be part of a broader trend as consumers and solar companies brace for potential policy shifts that could significantly impact the renewable energy landscape.

**Opportunities For Business Owners In The Inflation Reduction Act**
The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022, offers various benefits for business owners, including tax credits for clean energy investments, such as up to $2,000 for electric heat pumps and 30% off the cost of installing rooftop solar, geothermal, or battery storage. Additionally, families can receive tax credits worth up to $500 for doors, $600 for windows, and $150 for home energy audits. The law also provides up to $4,000 in consumer tax credits for lower- and middle-income individuals to buy used electric vehicles. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that these clean energy provisions will cut electricity rates by as much as 9% by 2030. The U.S. Department of Treasury has prepared a one-stop shop webpage with materials on the law, but it is uncertain how long it will be available after the next Administration takes office.

**What happened to the Inflation Reduction Act?**
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law by President Biden in 2022, is the US's largest investment in climate and clean energy. Since its passage, the Treasury Department has been implementing the law, which includes 20 tax incentives, including technology-neutral tax credits. These credits have led to almost $500 billion in clean energy investments, a 70% increase from the two years prior to the IRA. The Treasury is still finalizing rules and guidance for the tax credits, which could take another couple of years. While a new administration could change the regulations, the tax credits themselves are law and can only be changed by Congress. Many of the tax credits have bipartisan support, and the majority of new investment in clean energy has been in Republican districts. The Treasury is working to finalize as much guidance as possible before the end of Biden's term.
