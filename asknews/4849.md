**Almuzara Presents 'El enigma que brotó del fuego', a Historical Thriller by Jerónimo Farré**
Almuzara has published 'El enigma que brotó del fuego', a historical thriller by cardiologist Jerónimo Farré. The book weaves together real events, post-Franco costumbrismo, intrigue, and scientific discoveries, including the discovery of 'la succión diastólica ventricular' by Miguel Servet in the 16th century. Although Servet's findings were ignored for centuries, they were rediscovered in 1975 by John Farrell, an English cardiologist. Farré's novel follows the story of Farrell and his friends, who become embroiled in a complex tale that spans the Reformation, the Spanish Civil War, and the Transition period in Spain. Farré, a renowned cardiologist and professor, has written over 100 chapters in medical books and over 150 scientific articles, and has given over 300 conferences in Europe and America. 'El enigma que brotó del fuego' is Farré's first foray into fiction, and it promises to be a thrilling read, capable of 'provoking a turn of the heart' in its readers, as Farré himself has said. 'It's a story that will take you on a journey through time and space, and will leave you breathless,' Farré said, 'I hope that readers will be able to experience the thrill of discovery, just as I did when I first read about Servet's discovery.'

**Richard Ford's 'Granada, escritos con dibujos inéditos del autor' Selected as Book of the Month**
The Editorial Universidad de Granada (EUG) has selected Richard Ford's book 'Granada, escritos con dibujos inéditos del autor' as the book of the month for June 2025. The publication, co-edited with the Patronato de la Alhambra and the Generalife, is a facsimile edition of the original 1955 book. The bilingual edition (Spanish and English) includes a translation and notes by Alfonso Gámir Sandoval, and a preliminary study by professor Juan Manuel Barrios Rozúa. The book can be purchased at a special price of 10 euros. Ford, a 19th-century English traveler, contributed significantly to the spread of the image of Spain in Europe. The volume includes a valuable collection of unpublished drawings by Ford, which are a significant archaeological and artistic document. Additionally, the book includes a biography of the author written by his friend and Hispanist William Stirling. According to professor Barrios Rozúa, his study aims to 'offer a biography of the author, focusing on his relationship with Granada; evaluate his historical interpretation of Spanish customs; establish the clearly romantic character of a writer and draftsman whose membership in this complex current has been debated; and provide a documentary approach to the Granada and Alhambra that Ford knew.' The book is a unique opportunity for researchers, art lovers, historians, and romantics.
