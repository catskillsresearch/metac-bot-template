**Disney's 'Elio' Opening Cause Of Concern? - Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS)**
Disney's latest Pixar film, 'Elio', has struggled in its box office debut, ranking third behind '28 Years Later' and 'How to Train Your Dragon'. The film grossed $21 million domestically and $35 million worldwide, which is the worst opening for a Pixar film in modern history. Despite this, Disney has a strong lineup of films set for release in 2025, including 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps', 'Tron: Ares', 'Zootopia 2', and 'Avatar: Fire and Ash'. Disney has already hit $2 billion at the domestic box office in 2025 and is expected to have a strong second half of the year. 'How to Train Your Dragon' topped the box office for the weekend with $37 million, adding to its impressive $83 million debut from last week. Five of the top 10 grossing films in 2025 are kid-friendly, including several from Disney, such as 'A Minecraft Movie' and 'Lilo & Stitch'.

**Pixar's Elio Sets a Tragic Box Office Record**
Pixar's latest film, Elio, has had a disappointing box office opening in North America, earning only $21 million in the US and Canada. This is the worst opening for a Pixar film, surpassing the previous record held by Elemental, which earned $30 million in its opening week in 2023. Elio's production and marketing budget was $250 million. The film has also struggled in France, where it earned 28,403 entries on its first day. The film's poor opening is due in part to the strong competition from other films targeting the same audience, such as Dragons and Lilo & Stitch, which are live-action adaptations of original animated films. Pixar will rely on positive reviews to attract more viewers in the coming days, but it will be a challenge to stay in theaters with the return of Jurassic World, the new Superman film, and other big releases. 'It's a difficult context for Elio, which has very good opinions from spectators,' said the article. 'The studio must count on these positive reviews to attract more curious people in the coming days.'

**Pixar's New Original Movie Sets Unwanted Record Despite Its 91% RT Score**
Pixar's new original movie, Elio, has set an unwanted record as one of the lowest-grossing debuts of all time, despite receiving a 91% RT score. The film made only $21 million in the US and Canada and $14 million internationally, for a global total of $35 million against a $150 million production budget. However, the film's blueprint is similar to Elemental, which also had a slow start but went on to make $496.4 million globally. Using the formula that a movie needs to make 2.5 times its production budget to break even, Elio needs to make $375 million to break even. If Elio can hold strong from weekend to weekend like Elemental did, it may be able to turn things around and avoid a massive loss. However, it will face stiff competition from other summer 2025 releases, including Superman and The Fantastic Four: First Steps.

**Pixar's Newest Movie Falls Short at the Global Box Office Despite 91% Audience Score**
Disney and Pixar's newest animated film, Elio, has earned just $35 million worldwide during its opening weekend, making it Pixar's worst-ever debut behind films like Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Finding Nemo. Despite having a 'Certified Fresh' score of 84% on Rotten Tomatoes from 137 critical reviews and a 91% audience score, the film's box office performance is surprising. Elio's budget was $150 million, and it will have a long way to go to make a profit. However, Disney's live-action Lilo & Stitch is doing well, grossing $910 million worldwide after five weeks in theaters and on track to be the first movie to earn $1 billion in 2025.

**Pixar's Elio Suffers Worst Opening Weekend in Studio History**
Pixar's new film, Elio, has had the worst opening weekend in the studio's history, earning only $35 million worldwide, with $21 million of that coming from the US domestic market and a mere $14 million from international markets. This is the lowest three-day gross in Pixar's history, even worse than the 2023 film Elemental, which started with $44.5 million. In comparison, last year's hit Inside Out 2 earned an impressive $295 million in its first weekend. However, Pixar and its parent company Disney are hopeful that Elio will follow the path of Elemental, which, despite a slow start, went on to earn nearly $500 million worldwide. Elio's chances are also boosted by the fact that it has not yet been released in China, Japan, or Spain, and will be hitting theaters during the summer holidays. Additionally, critics have received the film positively, which adds to the optimism. Elio's poor start may have been exacerbated by the success of another family film, How to Train Your Dragon, which has already earned $350 million worldwide in its second weekend and remains number one in the US. Elio also faces competition from Disney's live-action remake of Lilo & Stitch, which has earned $910.3 million worldwide after five weekends and is on track to become the first film of 2025 to reach $1 billion.

**Pixar's 'Elio' Records Worst Opening Weekend in Studio History**
Pixar's latest film, 'Elio', has recorded the worst opening weekend in the studio's history, with a worldwide box office of just $35 million ($21 million in the US). This surpasses the previous record held by 'Elemental' (2023), which earned $44.5 million ($29.5 million in the US).

In contrast, 'Inside Out 2' was the highest-grossing film of 2024, earning $1.698 billion. It is the most successful film in Pixar's history and the only one in the Top 10 of all-time box office grosses, with four other titles surpassing $1 billion: 'Incredibles 2', 'Toy Story 4', 'Toy Story 3', and 'Finding Nemo'.

James Gunn's Superman is expected to have a higher opening weekend than Man of Steel, with early projections estimating a domestic gross of around $135 million over its first three days. This would be the second-highest opening for a Superman film, behind only Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. However, estimates vary widely, with some predicting a range of $125-145 million and Warner Bros. being more conservative with a range of $90-125 million. Gunn has downplayed the pressure on the film, saying he will be happy as long as it makes back its budget. Warner Bros. is excited about the film's prospects and has put together a sizable marketing campaign. Ticket pre-sales for early access screenings were a hit, indicating that Superman will be a significant box office draw.

The report predicts that the July 8 viewings will amount to around $22 million, with Fandango revealing that this presale opportunity was the site's best first-day ticket pre-seller to date.

Analysts predict that the new Superman movie will open with a domestic box office gross of $154-175 million, which would be the biggest Superman opening of all time and the biggest DC opening of all time. This is higher than the previous highest-grossing Superman movie, which was produced by Zack Snyder. However, the outcome could go either way, as The Flash was also projected to open with huge numbers but ultimately dropped off. Analysts also predict that Superman's final box office gross will be $392-510 million, with a pinpoint of $477 million, making it the biggest box office gross of the Summer. As the movie's plot, Superman must reconcile his alien Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as reporter Clark Kent.

Discovery's highest-grossing opener, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, has $169 million. Gunn's previous work on Peacemaker, The Suicide Squad, and Guardians of the Galaxy has proven his ability to deliver a visual effects spectacle with heart and fan-pleasing moments. The first full trailer for Superman delivered over 250 million views, the most of any Warner Bros. movie ever. David Zaslav described the four iconic superheroes as 'big asset builders and big differentiators,' suggesting a bright future for the DC franchise.

James Gunn's Superman reboot is expected to have a massive opening weekend, potentially reaching $175 million in North America, according to insider Jeff Sneider. However, test screenings have yielded mixed results, with some viewers expressing disappointment, saying 'Superman stinks.' Despite this, the overall tone of the screenings has been strong, and the general audience seems ready to embrace Gunn's more hopeful take on the character. The film's performance will be crucial for DC Studios and Warner Bros. Discovery, as it could impact the leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. The movie is expected to earn between $650 million and $850 million worldwide, potentially matching or surpassing the earnings of Man of Steel and Justice League.

**Superman's Projected Opening Weekend Would Break a Box Office Record, Topping This 9-Year-Old DCEU Blockbuster**
James Gunn's new Superman movie is on track to break a box office record held by Batman v Superman, which pulled in $166 million on its opening weekend. Industry insider Jeff Sneider predicts that the film could pull in $175 million on its opening weekend in North America, although he is skeptical that it will go much higher or break the $200 million threshold. The film is scheduled to hit theaters on July 11, 2025, and will be the first theatrical movie in Gunn's new DC Universe. The film will feature a united continuity across film and television, with Superman and other entries in the first 'chapter' all cohesive and interwoven with one another's stories. The movie will also see the return of iconic characters like Lois Lane and Lex Luthor, as well as the introduction of new characters like Mister Terrific, Metamorpho, Guy Gardner, and Hawkgirl. According to Gunn, the film is still in the process of finalizing the sound mix and VFX. Sneider's prediction should be taken with a grain of salt, as it is still early in the film's production and more proper box office tracking will take place before the release date. 'It's a big movie, and it's going to be a big opening weekend,' Sneider said on The Hot Mic podcast. 'But I don't think it's going to be a $200 million opening weekend. I think it's going to be a $175 million opening weekend, and that's still a great number.'
