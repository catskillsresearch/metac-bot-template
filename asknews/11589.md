**UK Invests Billions in Military and Defense Amid Ongoing Ukraine Conflict**
The UK has announced significant investments in its military and defense, with a focus on achieving 'war-readiness' and strengthening the NATO alliance. According to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the central task is to make the armed forces ready for war, and to contribute to the strength of the western military alliance with a 'Nato-first' approach. Starmer stated, 'The front line, if you will, is here' in reference to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. The government plans to invest £15 billion (approximately €18 billion) in programs related to the production of nuclear warheads, which is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs across the country. The UK's armed forces are expected to be ten times more capable by 2035, according to Starmer. He emphasized that being prepared to secure 'peace through strength' is the most effective way to deter states that directly threaten the UK. The Ministry of Defense had previously announced a £1.5 billion investment in the production of munitions, with plans to build at least six new factories. The armed forces will also receive more advanced weapons with greater range. As Defense Minister John Healey noted, 'Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine has starkly shown that a military is only as strong as the industry behind it.'

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**Germany's Chief of Staff Warns of Possible Russian Attack in 2029**
Germany's Chief of the General Staff, General Carsten Breuer, has stated that Russia is likely to attack in four years. According to him, Russia produces around 1,500 main battle tanks per year and significantly increases its military forces. 'Not all tanks are sent to war in Ukraine, but they also go to reserves and new military structures that are always directed against the West,' he said. Breuer also mentioned that in 2024, Russia produced 4 million 152mm artillery shells, not all of which are intended for the front in Ukraine. 'There is an intention and accumulation of reserves for a possible future attack on the Baltic countries,' he added. Breuer estimated that the attack could happen in 2029, but warned that it could happen earlier. 'This is what the analysts estimate - in 2029. So we must be ready for 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029? I would say no, it's not. So we must be ready for battle today,' he emphasized. Breuer named the Suwalki Gap - a section on the border of Poland, Lithuania, Russia, and Belarus - as one of the most vulnerable zones in case of aggression. 'The Baltic states are indeed vulnerable to the Russians, aren't they? And when you're there, you really feel it... during the negotiations we conduct there,' he said. According to him, Estonians compare their situation to feeling heat, seeing flames, and smelling smoke, while in Germany 'you probably see only a little smoke on the horizon.' Breuer also stated that Russia sees the war in Ukraine as 'a continuation' of a broader conflict with NATO and 'tries to find ways to penetrate our defensive lines and test them.' As examples of such actions, he mentioned attacks on underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, cyberattacks on public transportation, and the appearance of drones over critical infrastructure in Germany. Breuer called on NATO allies to urgently increase their defense potential. 'What we need to do now is really take action and say to everyone: 'Hey, increase... invest more in this, because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves, and therefore to increase the deterrent potential,' he emphasized.

**NATO Warned of Possible Russian Attack Within 4 Years**
General Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the Inspector General of the German Armed Forces, has warned that NATO member states should prepare for a possible Russian attack, which could happen within the next 4 years. According to him, Russia is increasing its military forces in 'enormous scales', producing approximately 1,500 main battle tanks per year. Not all tanks are sent to the front for the war in Ukraine, but rather remain in storage and in new military structures, always focused on the West. 'This is an assessment of analysts - (the attack can happen in 2029 - 24 Channel) in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, whether this is a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029, I would say no, it is not. Therefore, we must be able to fight today,' he said. The Minister also mentioned the Suwałki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable points for an attack by an aggressor country. 'The Baltic countries are indeed very vulnerable to the Russians, aren't they? And as soon as you're there, you really feel it... in the negotiations we conduct there,' he said. General zu Guttenberg compared the possible war to being near a forest fire, where one 'feels the heat, sees the flames, and smells the smoke', while in Germany 'one probably only sees a bit of smoke on the horizon, and no more.' He emphasized that this demonstrates different views among European countries on the threat of a possible Russian attack. According to him, Russia's view of the war in Ukraine differs from that of the West, where Moscow sees the war as 'a continuum' in a larger conflict with NATO, and therefore 'tries to find ways to our defense lines and test them.' Therefore, zu Guttenberg believes that NATO members should again increase their military forces. Responding to a question about the unity of NATO, given the closer relations between Hungary and Slovakia with Moscow, the German general insisted that the Alliance is still united. 'I have never seen such unity as now among countries and military leaders. All of them understand the threat that is approaching NATO, all understand that we must develop in the direction of deterrence, in the direction of collective defense. This is clear to all. All see the urgency,' he said.

**Portnikov Predicts War to Continue Until 2032**
According to political observer Vasily Portnikov, the hot phase of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which typically lasts 7-10 years, may continue until 2032. After that, a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings may begin. Portnikov emphasized the need to prepare for a peaceful next phase of the conflict, which could last at least 10-15 years, by receiving help from the Americans and Europeans, improving Ukrainian policy and mobilization, and enhancing Ukraine's military-industrial complex. 'We need to prepare and prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective grounds for the war to end in the near future, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic situation and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he stressed.

**Russia Prepares for Potential War with Europe by 2030, Says Security Council Secretary**
Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu stated that European countries are preparing for a potential war with Russia by 2030. According to Shoigu, 'On different levels, possible timelines for such a confrontation are being mentioned - from three to five years. Already by 2030, European politicians and military want to be ready to fight with us,' he said in an interview with TASS. Shoigu also claimed that the Ukrainian authorities are trying to prolong the conflict and sell Europe Ukraine's natural resources, territory, and future at a higher price in exchange for funding and arms supplies. However, he noted that Ukraine's military, economic, and mobilization potential have significantly weakened. In contrast, Russia's representative, Dmitry Peskov, stated that Russia does not intend to attack anyone, and the Kremlin has no potential for starting a conflict. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, also mentioned that the Euro-Atlantic community is preparing for a new war, with Germany, France, and the UK at the forefront of this process. Lavrov added that the only thing they have achieved is fueling tensions and re-militarizing Europe, while their economic and social situation is rapidly deteriorating.

**Germany Warns of Possible Russian Attack on NATO by 2030**
According to a report by the German Federal Intelligence Service, Russia views its relations with the West as a 'systemic conflict' and is willing to use force to achieve its goals. The report suggests that by 2030, Russia may create the necessary conditions for a 'large-scale war with conventional weapons' against NATO. Currently, three-quarters of Russian troops and equipment from border regions with Baltic countries are involved in the war against Ukraine. However, after the end of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russian units may be redeployed back to the Baltic region. The German intelligence service also expects Russia to replenish its losses on the front and increase its defense industry production. By 2026, the Russian army's strength may reach 1.5 million personnel, and its military presence on the border with NATO may increase by 30-50%. Russia's military spending in 2025 may reach 120 billion euros, accounting for over 6% of the country's GDP. This is a significant increase from 2021, when Russia's military budget was nearly quadrupled. As President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda, stated, 'We are preparing for a possible Russian attack on NATO countries by 2030.' Lithuania's military is preparing to create a national unit with necessary infrastructure to counter this threat.

According to a report by the German Federal Intelligence Service, Russia views its relations with the West as a 'systemic conflict' and is willing to use force to achieve its goals. The report suggests that by 2030, Russia may create the necessary conditions for a 'large-scale war using conventional arms' with NATO. Currently, three-quarters of Russian troops and equipment from the Baltic region are involved in the war against Ukraine. However, after the end of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russian units may be redeployed back to the Baltic region. The German intelligence service also expects Russia to replenish its losses on the front and for its defense industry to produce more than is currently needed. By 2026, the number of Russian troops is expected to increase to 1.5 million, and the scope of military presence on the border with NATO is expected to increase by 30-50%. Russia's military spending in 2025 is expected to reach 120 billion euros, which is over 6% of the country's GDP. In comparison to 2021, Russia's military budget has increased almost fourfold. As Lituanian President Gitanas Nausėda stated, 'Lithuania is preparing for a possible Russian attack on NATO countries by 2030.' The Lithuanian army is preparing to create a national unit with necessary infrastructure to counter this.

**Russia Prepares for Large-Scale War with NATO by End of Decade, German Intelligence Warns**
According to a new assessment by the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and the German Armed Forces, Russia is likely to create conditions for 'large-scale military operations' against Western countries by the end of the decade. The BND reports that Russia sees itself in a systemic conflict with the West and is 'prepared to realize its imperialistic goals through military force.' The Lithuanian intelligence service (VSD) believes that Russia is not yet capable of waging a large-scale war against NATO in the medium term, but 'limited military actions' against one or more Western countries are not ruled out. Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to test how seriously NATO countries take their commitment to provide assistance under Article 5. The BND report notes that three-quarters of Russian soldiers and military equipment are currently stationed in border regions with the Baltic states and Ukraine, but Russia's air and naval forces are 'fully capable of action.' If the war in Ukraine ends, Russian units will be redeployed back to the region, according to Bild. The BND also estimates that Russia's military economy is currently producing more than needed for the war in Ukraine. By 2026, Moscow plans to increase the number of troops to 1.5 million and increase the number of weapons and military equipment in the NATO border zone by 30-50%. In 2025, Russia's defense spending will reach around 120 billion euros, accounting for over 6% of GDP. This is nearly four times the country's military budget in 2021. In January, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated that, given the growth of the Russian army, there is a likelihood of an attempt by Russia to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. In response, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the defense capabilities of the Alliance by that time. General-Major Vadim Skibitsky, deputy head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, stated on March 25 that Russia is considering 15 possible scenarios for military conflicts by 2045, six of which relate to Northern Europe and four to Poland. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, commenting on the information from the Ukrainian intelligence, stated that NATO will respond 'with full force' in the event of a Russian attack on one of its member countries.

**Germany's Intelligence Warns of Russia's Plans for a Large-Scale War Against NATO**
According to German intelligence, Russia is preparing for a large-scale war against NATO by 2030. The Federal Intelligence Service of Germany and the Bundeswehr believe that the Kremlin views relations with the West as a 'systemic problem' and intends to resolve them through military action. German intelligence estimates that Russia will be ready for a 'large-scale conventional war' against NATO member states by the end of the current decade. Meanwhile, Lithuanian intelligence believes that Russia may attempt to test the eastern borders of NATO with limited military operations before 2030. The report notes that Russia's current aggression against Ukraine is being held back only by Ukraine's resilience. However, if the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is suspended or terminated, Putin may quickly redeploy troops to the borders of the Baltic states or Poland. The German intelligence report also notes that Russia's defense industry is producing more weapons than needed for the current conflict, and that the country's military spending has reached a record 6% of GDP, approximately €120 billion, which is four times the 2021 pre-war level. Russia plans to increase its army to 1.5 million personnel, and boost the volume of equipment and weapons on the border with NATO countries by 30-50%.

**Germany's BND Warns of Russia's Plans for Large-Scale War with NATO**
According to the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), Russia is preparing for a large-scale war with NATO. The BND report states that the Kremlin views its relations with the West as a systemic conflict and is willing to use force to achieve its goals. The BND estimates that by the end of the current decade (2030), Russia may be fully prepared for a 'large-scale conventional war'. The Lithuanian intelligence service believes that while Russia is not yet ready to attack the entire alliance, it may 'test NATO' by launching military operations against one or more member countries to understand how the alliance will react to a threat. The BND report notes that despite the full-scale war with Ukraine, Russia's air force and navy remain combat-ready. If the war in Ukraine ends, Russian troops may be redeployed to the borders of Baltic countries. The report also states that Russia is replenishing its losses in the war against Ukraine and the Russian defense industry is producing more weapons than needed for the current war. Russia's military spending is growing at a record pace, reaching nearly €120 billion in 2025, which is 6% of its GDP. The Kremlin also plans to increase the size of its army to 1.5 million personnel and increase the amount of equipment and technology on its borders with NATO by 30-50%. As a reminder, Russia has already predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045. About half of these scenarios relate to Northern Europe. 'Russia will try to resolve the Ukrainian issue by 2026,' said Vadim Skibitsky, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, during a roundtable discussion 'New contours of European security'. 'If the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up with the US and China,' Skibitsky added. The Kremlin's geopolitical calculations relate to the period 2026-2035, with consequences extending to 2045. Countries in the Baltic region and Poland are at particular risk, according to Skibitsky.

**Russia Prepares for Large-Scale War with NATO, Warns German Intelligence**
According to a new report by the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr), Russia is accumulating forces for a large-scale conflict. The report states that Russia views its relations with the West as a systemic conflict and is preparing for a large war with NATO. The Kremlin is willing to use force to achieve its goals and may be fully prepared for a 'large-scale conventional war' by the end of the decade. The report also notes that while Russia is not yet capable of attacking the entire alliance, it may 'test NATO' by conducting a limited military operation against one or more member countries to determine how seriously NATO will take its commitments. The report emphasizes that despite the concentration of Russian troops in Ukraine, Russia's air force and navy remain combat-ready. In the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine, Russian forces could be quickly redeployed to the borders of Baltic countries. The report also notes that 'Russian losses are being restored,' and the country's defense industry is producing more than needed for the current conflict. 'Russia's military spending is growing at a record rate - in 2025 it will reach around 120 billion euros, which is over 6% of GDP. Compared to 2021, the military budget has effectively quadrupled. According to the Kremlin's plans, the army's strength is to increase to 1.5 million people, and the quantities of arms and equipment on the border with NATO are to increase by 30-50%,' the report warns. Earlier, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda stated that his country is preparing for a possible Russian attack on NATO countries by 2030. Military expert and historian Zenke Nachtigall believes that a Russian attack on Lithuania is possible as early as this fall. Meanwhile, the head of the Polish National Security Bureau, General Dariusz Łukaszewski, estimates that in the event of a war with Russia, Poland will be able to withstand for only one to two weeks before running out of ammunition. Some types of ammunition will last only five days. 'It was a great day,' said Elin, but the situation with Russia is not so optimistic. 'Russia's military spending is growing at a record rate,' the report warns. 'In 2025 it will reach around 120 billion euros, which is over 6% of GDP.

**Russia Predicts 15 Possible Scenarios of Military Conflicts Until 2045**
The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (GUR) has revealed that Russia has predicted 15 possible scenarios of military conflicts until 2045, six of which are related to Northern Europe. According to GUR's Deputy Head, Vadim Skibitsky, 'Out of these 6, related to Northern Europe, and... Northern Europe understands, the Baltic countries understand, Poland understands. Poland now understands that this is a direct threat.' He added that Russia has a clear understanding of its role and position in the modern world and global leadership. Skibitsky also stated that Russia had previously predicted four scenarios for 2026-2035 with a perspective until 2045, and that they had identified four possible scenarios: absolute US leadership, growing Chinese role, a multipolar world where Russia sees itself as well, and regionalization. He emphasized that Russia has clearly defined that the Ukrainian issue must be resolved by 2026, as if the war continues for another 5-10 years, Russia will never be able to catch up with the US and China and will remain a regional player in Eastern Europe. Additionally, Skibitsky noted that Russia's aggression against Ukraine has been ongoing since immediately after the collapse of the USSR, not just since 2014.

**Russia Predicts 15 Possible Military Conflict Scenarios by 2045, Direct Threat to Poland**
Russia has predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045, with six of them affecting Northern Europe. According to General-Major Vadim Skibitsky, deputy head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, countries in Northern Europe, particularly the Baltic states and Poland, are aware of the potential threat. Skibitsky stated that Poland is directly threatened by four possible military conflict scenarios. 'For Poland, there are only four scenarios of a possible military conflict. Poland now understands that this is a direct threat,' he said. Russia has previously prepared a forecast of events from 2026 to 2035 with a perspective to 2045, identifying four possible scenarios of the world order. The first scenario involves the absolute dominance of the US, the second the strengthening of China's role, the third a multipolar world where Russia aims to become one of the key players, and the fourth regionalization, or the division of influence into separate regions. Skibitsky noted that Russia's strategic documents clearly state the intention to complete the 'Ukrainian question' by 2026. He believes this is because a prolonged war for 5-10 years would prevent Russia from reaching the level of the US and China, leaving it a regional player in Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius previously stated that, considering the growth of the Russian army, there is a possibility of Russia attempting to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. In response, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the Alliance's defense capabilities before then.
