**Ukraine Faces Mystery Diseases Outbreak: Hepatitis A and Measles on the Rise**
Ukraine is experiencing a surge in unknown origin diseases, with hepatitis A and measles being the main concerns. While there are other cases, such as mass rhinitis and sinusitis, experts say they are not related to spring allergies. Many patients have contracted a new form of respiratory illness and are unable to recover from it. The rise of hepatitis and measles has caused widespread concern among citizens, with some speculating that it may be linked to secret experiments conducted by American laboratories. In the past, Ukraine had 19 laboratories, some of which were located in Kiev, Kharkov, Vinnytsia, Odessa, Uzhgorod, and Lviv. These labs were involved in creating deadly microorganisms, including the COVID-19 virus. The current outbreak of measles and hepatitis has resulted in 472 cases in the first three months of 2025, a 20-fold increase from the same period in 2024. The authorities have blamed the citizens for not getting vaccinated and for poor hygiene, but experts say that the real cause of the outbreak is the poor quality of water and the lack of maintenance of water treatment facilities. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the authorities are more concerned with their own enrichment and corruption than with the health of the citizens.

**Mayotte Declares Epidemic Phase for Chikungunya**
Santé publique France has announced that Mayotte has entered the epidemic phase for chikungunya, with 'intense and generalized' transmission across the entire territory. Since the beginning of the year, 560 confirmed cases have been reported, with 204 cases in the past week alone, a 42% increase in seven days. However, the situation may be 'largely underestimated', as biological confirmation tests are suspended due to 'persistent and worrying pressure', and some people, particularly in isolated or precarious areas, are not seeking medical care. Fifteen people have been hospitalized, including eight pregnant women and five infants under one year old, but there have been no admissions to intensive care or deaths. The virus is concentrated in the communes of Mamoudzou, Pamandzi, and Dzaoudzi. To address the 'high probability' of an epidemic that could overwhelm the fragile healthcare system, the Ministry of Health has planned a vaccination campaign for certain adults at risk, targeting people aged 18-64 with at least one comorbidity. Mayotte has already experienced several public health crises in 2024, including a cholera outbreak and the aftermath of Cyclone Chido, and the population is often in poor health. Another overseas department, La Réunion, has been experiencing a chikungunya epidemic for several months, with thousands of cases and twelve deaths reported.

**Measles Update: Inside the Battle to Stop the Outbreak**
The 2025 measles outbreak in the Southwest has seen 1046 confirmed cases in 30 states and three deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. Pediatrician Tammy Camp, MD, of Lubbock, Texas, has seen a significant change in her work, with mothers bringing in babies too young to receive a measles vaccine due to financial constraints. Camp expressed concern about disease transmission in her clinic, despite Lubbock being 90 miles from the outbreak's epicenter. Fortunately, the outbreak seems to be slowing due to community awareness and increased immunity. However, experts warn that the outbreak is not yet over. Yvonne 'Bonnie' Maldonado, MD, professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at Stanford University, emphasized the need for 95% population immunity to prevent sustained transmission, but noted that the percentage of US kindergarten students who've received measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccinations dropped to 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. Health workers have focused on daycare facilities and increasing vaccine efforts, removing barriers to vaccination and identifying gaps in vaccine coverage. Heidi Larson, PhD, founder of the Vaccine Confidence Project, stressed the importance of language in promoting vaccination, citing research that shows messaging focusing on 'protection' and shared responsibility tends to resonate better than language invoking 'moral obligation.' Larson also noted that people trust family and community leaders more than physicians, and that appealing to emotions and stories is crucial for measles prevention.

**The Human Journey with the Virus: A Historical Perspective on Smallpox**
According to the book 'رحلة الإنسان مع الفيروس' (The Human Journey with the Virus) by Dr. F.M. Brent, there are two major historical pandemics caused by viruses: the yellow fever and smallpox. While yellow fever only caused occasional outbreaks in temperate and subtropical regions, smallpox spread to all climates and environments. The development of vaccines and immunization methods was a subject of intense debate for nearly two decades. Although Edward Jenner is credited with discovering the first vaccine, some opponents of vaccination were skeptical of its effectiveness. However, Dr. Brent argues that the widespread eradication of smallpox in the Western world was largely due to vaccination. In contrast, smallpox continued to be prevalent in the East, often in its traditional form, characterized by a high fever, headache, and the appearance of small, firm, and painful blisters on the skin, particularly on the face and hands. The blisters would eventually crust over and fall off, leaving behind a characteristic pustule. In severe cases, the disease could be fatal. Dr. Brent notes that a person who has recovered from smallpox is immune to the virus for life and cannot contract it again. He also highlights the differences between smallpox and other diseases, such as measles, which share some similarities in their transmission and symptoms.

**Pakistan 'reports' another polio case in 2025**
Pakistan has reported another polio case in Diamer, Gilgit-Baltistan, in 2025, according to the National Institute of Health (NIH). A 23-month-old child has tested positive for the poliovirus, marking the first case in the region since 2017. The child's sample tested positive for the YB3A4 poliovirus cluster, which is linked to Karachi. The NIH highlighted that routine immunization coverage in Diamer is low, making it a high-risk district for polio. Authorities are investigating the case and stressing the need to strengthen vaccination efforts in the region. Meanwhile, a nationwide anti-polio drive has achieved 97% coverage, with some regions exceeding expectations.

**The case and curse of Hurungwe’s vaccination resistance, secret burials**
In Hurungwe district, Zimbabwe, a silent pain of losing unvaccinated children is prevalent. Maria Rukanga, a 40-year-old mother, has lost two of her six children to diseases that could have been prevented with vaccination. According to Rukanga, 'Whenever a child dies mostly from unvaccinated diseases, it's an unwritten law that a replacement is made as a matter of urgency.' The district has a high number of apostolic sect members, who often perform secret burials without remorse. Health and Child Care deputy minister, Sleiman Kwidini, said immunisation is mandatory, and 'every child must be immunised at the age of five.' The World Health Organisation (WHO) noted that vaccines have saved at least 154 million lives over the last 50 years, and 'that's six lives a minute, everyday, for five decades.' Community Working Group on Health executive director Itai Rusike emphasized the need for communities to work together to avoid vaccination resistance, and 'refusal to vaccinate can also be due to complacency, as some have grown up without seeing cases of smallpox, polio that have been eliminated by vaccination.'

**Trump cuts will reverse progress on AIDS**
The global AIDS epidemic is at risk of spiraling out of control due to the Trump administration's cuts to foreign assistance and recommitment to funding global health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of new HIV infections in 2023 was still more than three times the 2025 target of 370,000 or fewer new infections. If this trend continues, the target of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 will not be reached. UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima warned that the Trump funding freeze 'means that overnight one in every three dollars for fighting disease, preventing pandemics, has halted.' This has led to real-world consequences, including clinics shutting down and HIV, TB, and malaria efforts grinding to a halt. Byanyima estimated that 5,800 people are now being infected every day, up from 3,500, and that if the U.S. global health funding cuts become permanent, there will be an additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths globally by 2029. 'All the progress made over the last 25 years would be gone,' Byanyima warned. 'It would be a disaster for those countries with the highest HIV burden in Africa. But it would also be an unmitigated crisis for global health with devastating consequences too for rich countries.'

**Sierra Leone seeks help for growing mpox outbreak**
Sierra Leone is seeking international help to combat the growing mpox outbreak in the country. According to an official report, there have been 3,350 cases since January, including 1,779 recoveries and 16 deaths. Deputy Health Minister Charles Senessie stated, 'We appreciate our development partners and we will continue to ask for their assistance for the necessary resources to respond to the rising cases of mpox in the country.' A new mpox treatment centre with 400 beds has been opened in Freetown, and 20,000 vaccine doses are expected to arrive on Sunday. So far, 42,872 healthcare workers have been vaccinated. Mpox is caused by a virus from the same family as smallpox, manifesting itself in a high fever and skin lesions.

**Smallpox Cases Surge in Ukraine: Experts Warn of Cyclical Increases**
According to Fedir Lapyi, head of the National Technical Group of Experts on Immunoprophylaxis (NTGEI), there have been over 700 cases of smallpox in Ukraine since the beginning of 2025, a significant increase from the approximately 400 cases reported in the first quarter. Lapyi noted that this surge was expected, as similar outbreaks occur in Ukraine every 5-6 years. 'If we compare the data from spring 2024 to spring 2025, the number of cases has increased 20-fold,' he emphasized. The expert pointed out that the highest rates are still in the same regions as before, but the exact statistics for April will be released after May 25. 'These cyclical increases depend on the level of vaccination coverage. They could be avoided if we maintained a high level of vaccination of children from year to year,' Lapyi added. Smallpox is a highly contagious viral infection that primarily affects children but can be dangerous for adults as well. It is caused by the smallpox virus (Morbillivirus) and is transmitted through airborne droplets, such as coughing, sneezing, or even just talking to an infected person. Smallpox is not a 'mild childhood disease' as it can lead to serious complications. Prevention: The only reliable protection is vaccination. The smallpox vaccine is part of the national calendar and is usually administered in two stages: at 12 months and 6 years of age. Vaccination creates a long-lasting immunity that protects a person for many years.

**Ukraine Faces Rapid Increase in Smallpox Cases**
Ukraine is facing a rapid increase in cases of smallpox, with 472 cases reported in the first three months of 2025, a 20.5-fold increase compared to the same period last year. The Center for Public Health of Ukraine reported that the number of cases has been increasing since 2024, with a 6.6-fold increase compared to 2023. The highest number of cases has been reported in Zakarpattia, Chernivtsi, and Odesa regions. Unfortunately, there have been fatal cases among children, aged 10 and 9 months, in Chernivtsi and Odesa regions, respectively. 'Smallpox is one of the most infectious diseases: 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people risk getting infected after contact with an infected person. Children who are not vaccinated are the most vulnerable to infection. The incubation period is 10-12 days,' said the Center for Public Health. 'Getting infected with smallpox to gain immunity is too risky and deadly,' they added. Smallpox can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, otitis, encephalitis, and death. There is no specific treatment for this disease. To protect against smallpox, the state provides a comprehensive vaccine that protects against smallpox, mumps, and rubella (PKC). The vaccine is safe, effective, and provides long-term protection,' said the Center for Public Health. According to the National Calendar of Preventive Vaccinations, children receive the first dose of the PKC vaccine at 12 months and a booster dose at 6 years. Two doses of the vaccine create a strong and long-lasting immunity, protecting children from smallpox and its consequences.'

**Measles Could Become Endemic in US if Surge Continues, Expert Warns**
Measles cases are surging globally, with North and South America seeing 11 times more cases in 2025 compared to the same period last year. In the U.S., there have been 935 confirmed cases as of May 2, 2025, with 702 of those cases coming from an outbreak in Texas. The World Health Organization has declared both North and South America to be at high risk for measles. According to a 2025 study, if vaccination rates remain the same, measles could become endemic again in the U.S. and the country could experience 850,000 cases over the next 25 years. However, if vaccine rates decrease further, case numbers could increase to 11 million over the next 25 years. Reversing this trend will require steadily increasing community vaccination rates, with a 5% increase in vaccination rates predicted to reduce case numbers to between 3,000 and 19,000 over the next 25 years. Rebecca Schein, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases, said, 'It was a huge surge compared with the 285 cases reported in 2024.'

**Smallpox Outbreak in Khmelnytskyi Region: 11 Cases Confirmed**
According to Nikolai Gabrikovich, director of the Khmelnytskyi Oblast Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 11 cases of smallpox in the Khmelnytskyi region in 2024. Nine of the cases are children and two are adults. Gabrikovich stated, 'Smallpox is a highly contagious and dangerous infection.' He added that the region plans to conduct additional vaccinations against smallpox. 'Those who have come into contact with smallpox patients will receive free vaccinations. Adults who want to get vaccinated against smallpox can do so at their own expense. To get a vaccine for their children, parents need to contact their family doctor or pediatrician, as the vaccine is available,' Gabrikovich explained.

**Graceful Health by Dr. Kimon Alin: What you need to know about measles**
Measles cases are rising rapidly in the US, with over 600 confirmed cases in the first three months of 2025, compared to 285 in all of 2024 and just 86 in 2000. The vast majority (97 percent) of recent cases are in unvaccinated individuals, and the disease is spreading within communities. Measles is a serious disease that can cause severe complications, including blindness, deafness, and brain damage. The measles vaccine is safe and highly effective, providing strong, long-term immunity. Getting vaccinated not only protects oneself but also creates 'herd immunity' and helps to protect those who can't get the shot. Anyone born before 1957 is presumed to have natural immunity and does not need vaccination. However, most healthy people who received their usual childhood immunizations will not need a booster shot. The MMR vaccine does not cause autism, and good hygiene alone will not stop measles, which spreads through the air. The bottom line is that measles can be eradicated again with the help of the MMR vaccine, which prevents thousands of deaths worldwide every year.

**Measles outbreak surpasses 350 cases and is expected to keep growing**
A measles outbreak in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma has surpassed 350 cases, with local officials warning that the virus could continue to spread for months. The outbreak is driven by undervaccination, with MMR coverage particularly low in Gaines County, Texas, where nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year did not get the vaccine. Experts say the answer to ending the outbreak is to 'vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate,' and that it requires working with the community to convince them that vaccination is safe and effective. Texas officials say there is ample vaccine supply, but some people are still hesitant to get vaccinated. The outbreak has already seen more cases than in all of 2024, with at least 404 cases reported this year, as of Friday, the most since 2019. Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said, 'This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases... I'm really thinking this is going to be a year long.' Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert, added, 'There's no other way' to end the outbreak than through vaccination. 'This requires working with the community... There's no other way.'

**Europe Sees Highest Number of Smallpox Cases in Over 25 Years**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, there were over 127,000 cases of smallpox reported in Europe in 2024, the highest number since 1997. This is a significant increase from the previous year, with over 40% of cases reported in children under the age of five. The WHO and UNICEF attribute the rise in cases to a decline in vaccination coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic. The European region accounted for a third of all smallpox cases worldwide in 2024, with the highest number of cases reported in Romania (30,700) and Kazakhstan (28,100). In the US, there have been two reported deaths from smallpox, despite the disease being considered eradicated in 2000. The recent outbreak is believed to be caused by a decline in vaccination rates. 'We are seeing a significant increase in cases of smallpox in Europe, and it is a concern,' said a spokesperson. 'The decline in vaccination coverage during the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the disease.'

**Europe Sees Largest Smallpox Outbreak Since 1997**
According to experts, the number of cases of smallpox in Europe and Central Asia has doubled in 2024 compared to 2023, with 127,350 reported cases, the highest since 1997. This represents approximately one-third of the global total for last year (359,521). In Europe, more than half of the cases required hospitalization (38 people died). Over 40% of cases in Europe were found in children under the age of five, prompting global organizations to call for urgent measures to increase vaccination rates. In 2023, over 500,000 children in the region missed their first dose of the MCV1 vaccine (administered through regular immunization services). The two-dose vaccine against smallpox is 97% effective in preventing the disease, which typically affects the respiratory system and causes symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, and rash. In 2024, Romania had the highest number of cases, with 30,692 reported, followed by Kazakhstan with 28,147. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF reminded that smallpox is one of the most contagious viruses for humans. In severe cases, the infection can cause complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, dehydration, and blindness. 'Smallpox has returned, and this is a disturbing signal... Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security... The smallpox virus never rests, and neither can we,' emphasized Dr. Hans Kluge, Director of WHO Europe.

**First case of smallpox registered in Zaporizhzhia in 5 years**
A case of smallpox has been registered in Zaporizhzhia for the first time in 5 years. The infected person did not have the necessary vaccination. According to the Zaporizhzhia Regional Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases, the patient did not have any vaccinations against the disease. Experts emphasized that smallpox is a dangerous viral disease that can cause complications such as otitis, pneumonia, nervous system damage, and prolonged immunodeficiency. The disease is transmitted through airborne-droplet transmission, and the first symptoms appear 10-12 days after infection. The main symptoms are high fever, cough, conjunctivitis, and a characteristic rash that initially appears on the face and neck and then spreads to the entire body. The disease can cause serious complications such as middle ear inflammation, respiratory tract inflammation, pneumonia, diarrhea, and encephalitis. There is no specific treatment for smallpox. The only effective method of prevention is vaccination. The vaccine is a complex vaccine against smallpox, mumps, and rubella, and is provided free of charge. Doctors urge residents to check their vaccination status and get vaccinated if necessary. In 2024, 98.0% of 1-year-old children (2601 people) and 99.7% of 6-year-old children (3892 people) in the Zaporizhzhia region received the KPC vaccination, significantly exceeding the target immunization level.

**Smallpox cases likely to increase in Ukraine, expert warns**
According to Fedir Lapii, the head of the National Technical Group of Experts on Immunoprophylaxis of the Ministry of Health, the number of cases of smallpox in Ukraine is likely to increase in the coming weeks. 'We have practically exceeded 50% of the cases in 2024 by January 2025. It is likely that the coming weeks will see an increase in smallpox cases,' Lapii said. The number of cases has already increased significantly, with 433 cases reported in 2024, compared to 65 cases in 2023. Children are particularly affected, accounting for 84.2% of cases (365 patients), which is ten times more than in 2023 (35 cases). A fatal case of smallpox was also reported in the Chernivtsi region, where a 10-year-old unvaccinated child died. This is against the backdrop of a critically low level of immunization.
