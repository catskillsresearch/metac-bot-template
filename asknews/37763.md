**Launch Roundup: ULA to launch Kuiper's second batch of satellites, SpaceX to launch Axiom crew to ISS - NASASpaceFlight.com**
This week, SpaceX will launch Axiom Space's fourth private crewed mission to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard the Crew Dragon capsule C213. The mission will feature a record-breaking 60 scientific studies and activities for multiple countries, including technology demonstrations from Axiom Space, ISRO, and ESA. Peggy Whitson, a former NASA astronaut, will command the mission, which will also set a record for the most research activities conducted during an Axiom Space mission to date. Additionally, SpaceX will launch three Starlink missions, while Rocket Lab will launch a small high-performance QPS-SAR satellite for its Japan-based customer. United Launch Alliance (ULA) will launch the second batch of 27 Kuiper satellites to LEO on Friday, June 13, aboard an Atlas V 551 rocket.

**Scientists Warn Of Space Jam As Satellite Numbers Hit Critical Levels**
As of May 2025, there are over 11,700 active satellites in Earth's orbit, with more than 2,800 launched in 2024 alone. Private space companies, led by Elon Musk's SpaceX, are driving the surge, with the Starlink program accounting for nearly 60% of operational satellites. While these projects aim to bridge digital divides, they're also raising concerns about space sustainability. Scientists warn that low-Earth orbit (LEO) has a 'carrying capacity' of around 1,00,000 active satellites, and at the current rate of launches, we may hit that ceiling before 2050. Astronomer Jonathan McDowell estimates the total satellite population, including inactive units, has reached approximately 14,900, and is expected to explode as more commercial players enter the space race.

**14-Day Space Odyssey, 60 Experiments: All You Need To Know About Axiom-4 Mission**
The Axiom-4 mission, scheduled to launch on June 11, 2025, via SpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket, will take four astronauts, including Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla, to the International Space Station (ISS) for a 14-day stay. The mission will conduct around 60 experiments, ranging from life science to technology demonstrations to diabetes research. According to Peggy Whitson, director of human spaceflight at Axiom Space, 'This historic mission highlights how Axiom Space is redefining the pathway to low-Earth orbit and elevating national space programs globally.' Shukla will be the second Indian in space after Rakesh Sharma, and the mission marks the first government-sponsored flight for India, Poland, and Hungary in over 40 years.

**SpaceX just called off Wednesday's crewed launch to the ISS**
SpaceX has called off its crewed launch to the International Space Station (ISS) scheduled for June 11 due to a liquid oxygen leak identified during booster inspections. The new target launch date has yet to be announced. The Ax-4 crew, comprising four astronauts from India, Poland, Hungary, and the US, are currently in isolation at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Jared Isaacman, a private space mission veteran, commented on the delay, saying, 'An inconvenience for the guests and families expecting a launch, but hopefully the Axiom Space's Ax-4 crew is having a fun time in quarantine. Won't be long before the big moment. All the best on the mission.' The Ax-4 crew will spend about two weeks aboard the ISS, living and working alongside the seven members already there.

**Why was Axiom-4 launch with Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla postponed?**
The Axiom-4 mission, which will carry Indian astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla to the International Space Station (ISS), has been rescheduled to June 11, 2025, due to 'unfavourable weather.' The mission, which marks India's second government-sponsored human spaceflight mission in over four decades, will feature astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary, all of whom will be making their first mission to the ISS. According to Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, 'The team that I'm flying with on this mission...it is fantastic. I do feel that I have exceptional crewmates.' The mission will conduct approximately 60 scientific studies and activities representing 31 countries, making it the largest volume of research and science-focused activities conducted on any Axiom Space mission to the ISS.

**SpaceX sends 27 Starlink satellites into orbit from California - UPI.com**
SpaceX launched 27 Starlink satellites into low-Earth orbit from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on June 4, marking the 500th orbital launch of a Falcon rocket. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off at 4:40 p.m. PDT and successfully landed the first stage on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship in the Pacific Ocean. This was the 26th flight for the first stage booster, which included 18 Starlink missions. SpaceX is also planning a launch of the fourth private astronaut mission to the International Space Station, Axiom Mission 4, on June 11. The mission will be commanded by Peggy Whitson, a former NASA astronaut and director of human spaceflight at Axiom Space. The crew includes pilot Shubhanshu Shukla with the Indian Space Research Organization, and mission specialists with the European Space Agency, Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland and Tibor Kapu of Hungary. This will be the first time ISRA will send an astronaut to the space station as well as ESA astronauts from Hungary and Poland.

**June 2025: Earth to Experience Increased Solar Activity and Magnetic Storms**
In June 2025, the Earth is expected to experience a significant increase in solar activity, including powerful magnetic storms. According to experts, this will be a 'real hit' from space. The solar activity will be measured by the Kp-index, which ranges from 0 (complete calm) to 9 (extreme storm). Even a Kp-index of 5 is considered a magnetic storm that can affect people's health and communication and electronics. The most intense days of the month are expected to be June 2, with a Kp-index of 8, and June 13 and 25, with a Kp-index of 6. These days will be marked by moderate storms that can cause physical discomfort and affect power grids. Other days with increased activity are June 3, 14, and 26, with small storms (Kp-index of 5), and June 4-5, 10-11, 15-17, 23-24, and 27, with moderate geomagnetic activity (Kp-index of 4). As a result, people may experience headaches, insomnia, weakness, and other health issues. It is also recommended to avoid excessive physical and emotional stress during these days, drink more water, and get enough sleep. Additionally, it is advised to update GPS navigators and check electronic devices that rely on satellite signals. 'It's not just the stars that have an impact, but also the Sun, which will be particularly active this month,' say astronomers. 'This month will be a busy one in terms of space weather,' they add.

**Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore Return to Earth After Prolonged Space Travel**
Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, two astronauts from NASA, are returning to Earth on March 18, 2025, after spending months in space. They will land in the ocean in a SpaceX Crew Capsule and will be taken out on a stretcher. This is a safety protocol to prevent them from suddenly being unable to walk due to the effects of prolonged space travel on their bodies. In space, the lack of gravity causes changes in the body, including a loss of balance and muscle mass. When they return to Earth, they will be taken out on a stretcher to help them adjust to the gravitational forces. According to experts, the lack of gravity weakens the balance system, causing problems such as dizziness, weakness, and space motion sickness. Although astronauts exercise to maintain muscle and bone strength, they still experience muscle and bone loss. Sunita Williams and Wilmore left Earth on June 5, 2024, and their stay on the ISS was supposed to be short-term. However, due to a helium leak and propulsion system failure in the Starliner, their return was delayed. In August 2024, NASA accepted the delay and announced that they would plan their return in early 2025 via a SpaceX mission. In September 2024, the Starliner returned to Earth without astronauts, freeing up the docking port for other spacecraft. Finally, NASA chose the SpaceX Dragon Crew Capsule to bring Sunita Williams back to Earth. The Dragon Capsule has launched 49 times since its creation and has made 44 trips to the ISS and 29 re-flights.
