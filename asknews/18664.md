**6 In 10 Americans Fear Social Security Will Vanish Before They Retire, As 2033 Insolvency Clock Ticks Louder - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)**
A recent survey by DepositAccounts found that 59% of working-age Americans fear that Social Security will not exist by the time they retire, with 70% of Generation X sharing this concern. The anxiety is driven by the program's main trust fund's depletion in 2033, which would leave incoming payroll taxes covering only 79% of promised checks. Jaime Eckels, a certified-financial-planner, warned that the countdown has moved from abstract to immediate for many savers, saying, 'It's not that far away. We're creeping up on it.' However, not all gauges are as bleak, with the 2025 Retirement Confidence Survey finding that about half of workers remain at least 'somewhat confident' that the government will pay benefits of equal value to today's. Despite this, 60% of workers worry about cuts to Social Security benefits. Analysts stress that insolvency does not equal disappearance, with LendingTree's Matt Schulz saying, 'The truth is that it's highly, highly unlikely Social Security 'won't be available.'

**Fed Director Sees Inflation from Trump's Tariffs with More Intensity in Second Half of 2025**
Federal Reserve Director Christopher Waller stated that he expects the inflation caused by tariffs to be felt more intensely in the second half of 2025. Waller pointed out that the expectation is that tariffs will result in a temporary increase in prices, with a risk of a decline in the economy and the labor market, with unemployment likely to persist. He estimated a 'tariff-weighted average' of 15% on US imports, which falls between his scenarios of higher and lower rates. Waller also defended further interest rate cuts this year, provided that tariffs remain low, inflation continues to move towards the 2% target, and the labor market remains solid. He expressed skepticism that a 10% tariff would increase inflation to 3%.

**Sell in May and Go Away: A Warning for 2026**
The author believes that the stock market will decline and that the economy will experience a recession in 2026. They predict a 0.1-0.2% growth rate for this year, but a 0.7% growth rate is expected by the government. The author notes that the economy will face significant challenges, including a decline in car sales, a stagnant airline industry, and a crisis in the steel industry. They also predict that the unemployment rate will rise to 8% by the end of the year and 9-10% in 2026. The author is concerned about the increasing public deficit and the impact of trade tariffs on the global economy. They believe that the economy is heading for a 'crash' and that banks will become more selective in lending and will liquidate their 'bad assets.' The author concludes that they have never been more worried about the economy in 2026, with no room for maneuver. 'Effort budgétaire de 20 milliards cette année ça va encore mais 40 à 50 milliards sur 2026 et là on va le sentir passer' ('A budget effort of 20 billion this year will still be manageable, but 40-50 billion in 2026 will be felt').

**AI CEO Warns of 50% White-Collar Job Loss and Mass Unemployment**
Dario Modig, CEO of Anthropik, has warned that AI technology could lead to a massive unemployment crisis. He stated, 'AI is becoming better than humans in almost all intellectual tasks, and we, as a society, are going to struggle with this.' Modig believes that the AI tools being developed by companies like Anthropik could lead to the loss of 50% of entry-level, white-collar jobs and increase unemployment by 20% in the next one to five years. This could potentially lead to a five-fold increase in the unemployment rate in the US, which was last seen during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts in education and economics have also warned that AI could replace some jobs or tasks in the coming years. A survey by the World Economic Forum earlier this year found that 41% of employers plan to reduce their workforce due to AI automation by 2030.

**Gold Prices $10,000 by 2030? - Live Trading News**
Analysts predict that gold prices could reach $10,000 per ounce by 2030, driven by historical trends, the declining value of the U.S. dollar, and rising geopolitical tensions. According to InvestingHaven, gold could exceed $3,275 in 2025 and reach $4,000 by 2026. Incrementum's Stoeferle projects gold could hit $4,800 by 2030, citing central bank buying and the erosion of purchasing power. Knightsbridge Gold's current trajectory and market sentiment also support a significant revaluation of gold. As CEO A says, 'The establishment often downplays gold's potential, focusing on short-term price corrections or the allure of cryptocurrencies.' However, this narrative overlooks the fundamental drivers of gold's value, including the structural shift driven by decades of monetary mismanagement and the fragility of fiat systems. Gold prices are poised for a significant upward move, potentially surpassing $10,000 per ounce by 2030.

**South African rand flat before local jobs data**
The South African rand was stable in early trade on Tuesday, ahead of local jobs data that is expected to show a slight increase in unemployment. According to economists, the unemployment rate could rise from 31.9% in the previous quarter, due to sluggish economic growth. Investec and Nedbank economists forecast an increase in unemployment, while the government is preparing for a meeting with US President Donald Trump to mend diplomatic and trade ties. The South African benchmark 2030 government bond was also flat, with a yield of 8.89%.

**Fertility Rate Decline to Affect Contribution of Work to GDP: Negative Effect to Begin in 2035**
A recent study by Soledad Hormazábal, titled 'Efecto de la caída en la tasa de fertilidad sobre el crecimiento económico', has found that the decline in fertility rate in Chile will have a negative impact on the country's economic growth. The study projects that the contribution of work to the country's GDP will be negative from 2035, reaching a maximum of -0.8% in 2085. Hormazábal recommends four measures to avoid this situation: increasing the participation of women in the workforce, reducing structural unemployment, improving human capital, and increasing the fertility rate. According to the study, if the fertility rate were to increase to the level of Israel, the number of births would double, reaching 360,000 per year, and the negative trend of the contribution of work to growth would be reversed until at least 2100. 'The population in the working age group grew in our country at rates that bordered on 10% every five years (approximately 2% per year) during the second half of the last century. Since the beginning of this century, the growth rate of the working-age population has begun to decline, with the exception of the quinquennium of 2020, which was marked by a significant migratory flow. Later, from the quinquennium of 2025, a sharp decline in the growth rate was observed, and the working-age population will begin to decline from the quinquennium of 2040', the report states.

**Government rolls out 10-year job creation program**
The Philippine government has launched the Trabaho Para Sa Bayan (TPB) Plan 2025 to 2034, a 10-year job creation program aimed at reducing the unemployment rate and increasing the labor force participation rate (LFPR) by 2034. The plan aims to increase the LFPR to 68.2 percent, the female LFPR to 59 percent, and lower the unemployment rate to three percent by 2034. The government also targets to improve labor productivity to 6.8 percent, rank 30th or better in domestic industry diversification, and 25th or better in production and export complexity by 2034. According to DEPDev Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon, 'This is actually a big task, especially since by 2035, a majority of the workforce will be coming from Gen Z and Gen Alpha. So actually, we really need policy reform here.' The plan also identifies legislative measures that need to be passed, including the Open Access in Data Transmission Bill and the Freelancers' Protection Act, to future-proof the labor market.

**Saudi Arabia Achieves Record Low Unemployment Rate Among Saudis**
Saudi Vision 2030 has successfully achieved its goal of reducing unemployment among Saudis to 7%, the lowest level in history, six years ahead of schedule. This achievement is attributed to three key factors: empowering women and integrating them into the workforce, continued government spending, and programs to encourage companies to hire Saudis. The unemployment rate among Saudi women decreased from 34.5% to 11.9% in 2024, while the private sector created 733,000 new jobs, with 494,000 of those going to Saudi women. The participation of Saudi women in the workforce increased to 36% in 2024, up from 17% in 2016. The government's efforts to empower women have included policies such as equal pay, flexible work arrangements, and childcare services, as well as programs to encourage companies to hire women. The participation of Saudi women in the workforce is expected to reach 40% by 2030, 10 years ahead of schedule.

**Spain's Working-Age Population to Decline by 2030, Aging Population to Reach 30% of Workforce**
According to the Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal, the working-age population in Spain will decline to 33 million 600 thousand people by 2030, and will continue to shrink until 2050. By 2030, people over 60 will make up 30% of the workforce, up from 20% currently. The population of dependents (those under 16 and over 66) will increase from 48% to nearly 70% in 25 years. The median age will rise by 4 years to 49. The worst period is expected to be the 2040s, with a potential decline in economic growth of 0.4%. However, the aging population will also lead to a decrease in unemployment, reaching 7% by 2070. The Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal notes that Spain's situation is similar to that of Europe, but does not rule out the need for additional measures. Productivity will be the main driver of economic growth, contributing 1.1 percentage points, while the labor factor will contribute 0.2 percentage points.

**The future of jobs too uncertain to make wrong bets**
The future of jobs is uncertain, with technological advancements, economic headwinds, and demographic shifts creating a complex landscape. According to the International Labour Organization's 'World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2025' report, the global unemployment rate remains steady at 5 percent, but youth unemployment stands at 12.6 percent. The report highlights the need for education and skills development to address the growing mismatch between worker skills and employer demands. The digital revolution is expected to be the most significant trend by 2030, but its benefits are unevenly distributed, deepening existing inequalities. The ongoing shift toward a greener economy presents opportunities for resource-rich countries, but the concentration of green jobs in certain regions highlights the need for fair global distribution of opportunities. Addressing the skills gap, gender disparities, and the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields is critical to harnessing the region's demographic dividend. Ultimately, the future of work requires adaptability, resilience, and bold policies to prepare workers for the careers of tomorrow.

**Agenda 2030: 'Quo Vadis', ODS?**
As the world approaches two-thirds of the time allocated to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set in Agenda 2030, uncertainty looms. From a scientific perspective, a thorough analysis of the sustainability of processes, products, and services generates economic, environmental, and social benefits. However, the progress towards achieving the SDGs has lost momentum. According to Gumersindo Feijoo Costa, 'the true challenge lies in fostering a greater social awareness of the importance of protecting our planet.' Only 15% of the goals are progressing satisfactorily, and only one in six countries will meet the target of completing secondary education by 2030. The unemployment rate among women is directly linked to the poverty rate among women, and a high level of female unemployment can even increase the risk of child poverty. The proportion of women in national parliaments worldwide reached 26.5% in early 2023, a slight improvement of 4.2% since 2015. The risk of extinction of species of mammals, birds, amphibians, corals, and cycads increased by approximately 5% for the period 2013-2023. The index of the rule of law (-2.5 weak; 2.5 strong) evaluates various factors such as the absence of corruption, civil and penal justice, and limits on government power. Since 2018, it has been declining, with a global average of -0.04 points in 2023 (Finland's highest value is 1.97, and Somalia's lowest is -2.21).

**Government Unveils New Plan to Reduce Unemployment to 9% by 2030**
The government has announced a new plan to reduce unemployment to 9% by 2030, through the creation of 1.45 million job opportunities. This plan includes eight main initiatives, such as supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, promoting active employment policies, and implementing a professional ladder system. The government has also allocated 15 billion dirhams to support employment, including 12 billion dirhams to encourage investment, 1 billion dirhams to preserve jobs in rural areas, and 2 billion dirhams to enhance the effectiveness of employment stimulation programs. According to the Ministry of Planning, the number of unemployed individuals has increased by 58,000 between 2023 and 2024, reaching 1.63 million, with a 4% increase. The unemployment rate has risen from 13% in 2023 to 13.3% in 2024, with varying rates between urban and rural areas. The unemployment rate remains high among youth (36.7%), holders of certificates (19.6%), and women (19.4%). The government aims to address these challenges through its new plan, which includes measures to reduce school dropout rates, improve the education system, and promote women's participation in the labor market.

**Golikova: Over 10 Million Workers to be Replaced by 2030 in Russia**
Russian Vice-Premier Tatyana Golikova stated in the State Duma that more than 10 million workers will need to be replaced by 2030 due to retirement. According to Golikova, 'By 2030, compared to 2022, this is important for understanding, so you can further evaluate the situation using these numbers. Practically, this means that we need to involve an additional 800,000 people in the economy by 2030.' However, she noted that this is not all, as 'due to demographic trends, we will need to replace 10.1 million people who will retire by 2030. Therefore, the total assessment of replacement and involvement in the economy today is 10.9 million people.' Golikova also pointed out the unprecedentedly low unemployment rate.

**Economists Predict Bumpy Road in 2025 With Hope for Stability**
Economists predict a bumpy road in 2025, with some factors bringing significant changes or making the market stronger, while others may keep it lagging. The main challenges remain the same as in previous years: inflation, interest rates, labor productivity, profit margins, and persistent labor shortages. According to Jeff Krumpelman, chief investment strategist and stock manager at Mariner Wealth Advisors, the S&P 500 index is expected to reach 6,600 points by the end of 2025, with a possible optimistic scenario of 7,000 points. However, the journey may not be smooth. The biggest factor contributing to labor shortages is the aging population, with the baby boomer generation retiring and not being replaced by younger workers. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the number of workers aged 55 and above will increase by 2.7 million from 2022 to 2032, a 7.1% increase. In contrast, the population of workers aged 25-54 is expected to grow by only 5.2% during the same period. This means that older workers will become an increasingly important part of the labor force. Despite this, many industries in the US are currently facing recruitment challenges. Joseph Von Nessen, a research economist at the University of South Carolina's Darla Moore School of Business, notes that the state's unemployment rate has risen from 3% in 2024 to 4.8%, but the average unemployment rate during previous economic expansions was 6%. 'This is good news for workers, but it also means that businesses may continue to face recruitment challenges in 2025, which could limit their expansion capacity and, in turn, limit the potential for economic growth in South Carolina and the US as a whole.'
