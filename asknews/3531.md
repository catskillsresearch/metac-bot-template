**Supermassive Black Hole Destroys Star in Rare Cosmic Event**
Astronomers have observed a rare event in which a supermassive black hole destroyed a star while its galaxy merged with another. The event, classified as AT 2022wtn, occurred about 700 million light-years away in a small galaxy that is in the process of merging with a larger one. The black hole, with a mass of approximately one million suns, caused the star to undergo a process called spaghettification, where the tidal forces deformed and eventually disintegrated the star. Part of the star's remains formed a disk of incandescent plasma around the black hole, while another fraction was expelled at high speed, creating a visible gas bubble in various wavelengths. The data collected show an unusual luminosity behavior: the event maintained a constant brightness for about 30 days, followed by a rapid temperature drop. The spectra also revealed very defined emission lines of helium and nitrogen, which is rare in this type of event and has sparked great interest in the scientific community. 'Thanks to our follow-up campaign, we were able to propose an interpretation of the origin of the observed radiation: AT 2022wtn led to the rapid formation of the disk around the black hole and the subsequent ejection of part of the stellar material,' said Francesca Onori, from the National Institute of Astrophysics, to Space.com. The ejection of material was confirmed through the analysis of certain spectral lines that showed rapid propagation towards the outside. This dynamics reinforces the idea that the event not only generated an accretion disk, but also an expanding gas envelope that can contribute to modifying the immediate environment of the black hole. The study's results have been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and highlight their value in understanding how tidal disruption events are generated and evolve.

**NASA's Photo of the Day: The Remains of a Star in the Milky Way**
A spiral shape, like the one shown, is all that remains visible of a star in the Milky Way galaxy. Approximately 7,000 years ago, the star exploded in a supernova, leaving behind the Veil Nebula. At the time, the expanding cloud was as bright as a crescent moon and remained visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history. Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is only visible through a small telescope pointed towards the Cygnus constellation. However, the remaining Veil Nebula is physically enormous, covering over five times the size of a full moon, despite being 1,400 light-years away. The featured image, taken in Kuwait in mid-2024, shows light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue. Even in deep images of the complete Veil Nebula, such as this one, readers may struggle to identify the iconic filaments.

**Mysterious Celestial Object Emitted X-rays and Radio Waves Every 44 Minutes**
A mysterious celestial object, located at the heart of the Milky Way, has been discovered by astronomers. The object, named ASKAP J1832-091, emits X-rays and radio waves every 44 minutes, but its origin and nature remain unknown. According to Ziteng Andy Wang, researcher at the University of Curtin in Australia, the object could be a neutron star or a highly magnetized white dwarf, but it's also possible that it's something entirely new. The discovery was made possible by a chance observation by the Chandra telescope, which was originally observing the remnants of a supernova. The exact distance of the object is still uncertain, making it difficult to determine if it's related to the supernova or if it's evolving independently in a dense region of stars, gas, and dust. 'Our discovery doesn't solve the mystery, it deepens it,' said Wang. The discovery opens up two major avenues of research: either they're dealing with a completely unknown phenomenon, or they're observing an object that's already cataloged, but from a new angle.

**Britain is getting a defense boost aimed at sending a message to...**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with Starmer saying 'we have to recognize the world has changed' and 'with greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.' The government will also build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send 'a message to Moscow' and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment. Healey also stated that plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 are 'on track' and that there's 'no doubt' it will hit 3% before 2034. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks.

**Elon Musk say it's '50/50' he'll land on Mars next year and he needs to 'get lucky' - Daily Star**
Elon Musk says there is a '50/50 chance' of landing a spaceship on Mars next year, and he needs to 'get lucky'. Despite recent test flight failures, Musk remains optimistic about progress towards establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. He believes reusable rockets will enable more than a million people to live on Mars within 30 years. Musk hopes to send 20 ships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with the goal of building a self-sufficient city that could survive even if cut off from Earth. He is scouting possible sites for a Mars city, with Arcadia Planitia being the leading candidate. Musk aims to fly 100 ships to Mars between 2030 and 2031 and 500 more in 2033. He said, 'This is, like, an incredible thing to have - this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet and a new world.'

**The Death of Stars Could Give Birth to the Universe's Most Powerful Accelerators**
Research suggests that supernovae, or star explosions, could be the source of the high-energy cosmic particles that have been puzzling scientists for years. These particles, which travel at nearly the speed of light, have been detected coming from all directions in the universe. A new study, conducted by researchers from Germany, Spain, and Ireland, suggests that supernovae could be the key to understanding the PeVatron phenomenon, which refers to cosmic accelerators that produce particles with energies of PeV (peta-electronvolt) levels. The key to this phenomenon is timing. According to scientists, the first 10 to 20 years after a supernova explosion create a dense gas shell and strong magnetic turbulence around the star, which can accelerate particles to incredible speeds. However, this window is short-lived, and the environment becomes too sparse to produce such massive energies. Perhaps a future supernova will provide scientists with the opportunity to fully understand the PeVatron mystery. 'Belki de gelecekte patlayacak bir başka yıldız, bilim insanlarına PeVatron'ların gizemini tamamen çözmek için aradıkları fırsatı sunacak.'

**6 Nights You Won't Miss: June Sky Showcases Breathtaking Celestial Events**
In June 2025, the sky will be filled with a series of celestial events that can be observed with the naked eye, offering a unique opportunity for stargazers to enjoy breathtaking astronomical displays without the need for advanced equipment. According to NASA, on June 1, the moon will appear close to a bright red point in the sky, which is Mars, known for its reddish hue due to the presence of iron on its surface, specifically the mineral 'hematite'. On June 2, the moon will move to be next to the star 'Heart of the Lion', the brightest star in the constellation Leo, which is about 79 light-years away from Earth and ranks 21st among the brightest stars in the sky. On June 6, the moon will settle next to the star 'The Scorpion's Tail', the brightest star in the constellation Virgo. Despite its vast distance from Earth, which is about 250,000 light-years, it shines brightly in the sky due to its massive size, which is more than 7 times the diameter of the sun, making its light 20,000 times brighter if it were in the position of the sun. On June 11, the moon will meet the star 'Heart of the Scorpion', which is the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius and one of the most prominent features of the summer sky, classified as a massive star in an advanced stage of its life, and is believed to be a candidate for a supernova explosion in a few million years. On June 19, the moon will meet Saturn, which will be visible with its yellowish color, and using a simple telescope, its famous rings can be easily distinguished. A few days later, on June 22, the moon will appear next to Venus, the brightest planet in the morning sky, which will be in its best viewing conditions due to its maximum elongation. As the month comes to a close, the moon will return on June 29 to be next to Mars again, just like at the beginning of the month, in a scene that concludes a series of lunar alignments that characterized June 2025.

**Astronomers Discover Almost Perfectly Spherical Supernova Remnant in the Milky Way**
Astronomers led by Miroslav Filipović from the University of Western Sydney have discovered a unique object in the Milky Way - a supernova remnant (SNR) with almost perfect spherical shape. The object, named 'Teleios' (meaning 'perfect' in Greek), has an official designation of G305.4-2.2. It is one of the most symmetrical SNR ever observed, with a roundness of 95.4%. Teleios has a diameter of 46 to 157 light-years, depending on the estimated distance to Earth - 7,175 or 25,114 light-years. Its unique shape, rare for SNR, may be explained by its location 2.2° below the galactic plane, where the interstellar medium is less dense. 'Typical supernova remnants are asymmetric due to the inhomogeneity of the explosion or the environment, but Teleios looks like it expanded in ideal conditions,' Filipović explained. Another mystery of the object is its 'invisibility' in most frequency ranges. Teleios emits only in radio waves with the presence of hydrogen lines (H-alpha), contradicting standard models. Most SNR are visible in optical, infrared, or X-ray ranges. Scientists suggest that this may be related to the object's age or low temperature of its material. The origin of Teleios remains unclear. Main hypotheses include a Type Ia supernova explosion in a binary system or a less destructive Type Iax supernova that leaves a 'zombie star'. However, the data do not match any model fully. Further studies are planned using new radio telescopes such as ASKAP and MeerKAT, which Filipović calls 'the golden age of radio astronomy'.

**Musk retains plan to fly Starship to Mars in 2026 despite setbacks**
Elon Musk has reaffirmed his plan to send Starship to Mars in 2026, despite recent setbacks in test flights. Musk stated that the success of this mission depends on Starship's ability to accomplish several challenging technical feats, including a post-launch refueling manoeuvre in earth orbit. He gave SpaceX a 50% chance of meeting the deadline. If not, the company will wait two years before trying again. Musk envisions launching 1,000 to 2,000 ships to Mars every two years to establish a self-sustaining human settlement. NASA plans to return humans to the moon aboard Starship in 2027, with the goal of launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Musk has previously aimed to send an uncrewed vehicle to Mars by 2018 and a crewed mission by 2024, but has since pushed back the timeline.

**The search is on for Betel-buddy**
Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star located 640 light years from Earth, has been exhibiting unpredictable brightness and has sparked speculation about its potential to explode as a supernova. Recent research suggests that Betelgeuse may not be alone, but rather has a low-mass companion star orbiting it every 2,100 days. This theory is supported by the star's unusual rotation, brightness cycles, and radial velocity patterns. While no clear signals were detected in a targeted search using the Hubble Space Telescope, the existence of a companion is still possible and could be confirmed in future UV or X-ray observations. The discovery of a companion would provide new insights into Betelgeuse's behavior and its eventual supernova explosion, and could help our understanding of massive star formation and evolution. As Jared Goldberg, the lead researcher, said, 'The search for a hidden companion to Betelgeuse is more than a scientific curiosity - it could help our understanding of the star's strange behavior and future supernova explosion.'

**Scientists Fear Betelgeuse Explosion Could Affect Earth: When and What Could Happen**
Scientists are concerned that the explosion of the star Betelgeuse could affect the Earth, but it's still impossible to predict when it will happen. According to Wired, the star will enter a supernova in the next 10,000 to 100,000 years. This news comes after the NASA's announcement about the asteroid 2024 YR4, which has caused more uncertainty. However, it's essential to note that the Earth is constantly changing. When a star explodes, it expels matter and gas into the galaxy, which happens after it exhausts its hydrogen fuel. If Betelgeuse were closer to our planet, its explosion would have a direct impact and end the entire solar system. Since it's 725 light-years away, scientists say that when it explodes, its light will be visible and will reach its peak on the 10th day. After that, its light will cease to exist. A study published in the Astrophysical Journal notes that a supernova can be noticed from Earth without causing fatal consequences if it's 150 light-years away. However, the Earth would be exterminated if a supernova occurs within 40 light-years.

**Betelgeuse Supernova: A Potential Threat to Earth**
Astronomers have warned of an imminent supernova explosion of the star Betelgeuse, which could potentially damage the Earth. According to NASA, the star has been showing signs of deterioration since 2019 and could explode at any moment. The explosion would be visible from Earth for the first time in 400 years. Betelgeuse is a supergiant red star located in the Orion constellation, and its explosion would have a direct impact on the solar system if it were closer to Earth. However, since it is 725 light-years away, the explosion would be visible as a bright, full-moon-like color on the day of the explosion, which could occur in the next few days or in the next few thousand years. As explained by Wired, it is impossible to predict when the explosion will occur, but scientists estimate that it will happen in the next 10,000 to 100,000 years. 'It is still impossible to predict when the explosion will occur,' said the scientists. 'However, Betelgeuse will enter supernova in the next 10,000 to 100,000 years.'

**Huge orange star above Earth could explode at any moment**
Astronomers believe that the Betelgeuse red supergiant star, located in the Orion constellation, is on the verge of exploding in a supernova, an event that could be visible to the naked eye. According to NASA, the star's brightness has dimmed by 60% since 2019, and it has been glowing and dimming at twice the usual rate. Scientists predict that the star will explode within the next 10,000 to 100,000 years, but it could happen as soon as tens of years. The star is between 430 and 643 light-years away from Earth, so it would not be immediately visible if it explodes. However, astronomers are excited about the prospect of witnessing the supernova, which would shine as brightly as the full Moon and reach maximum brightness after 10 days. As one study concluded, 'We conclude that Betelgeuse is... a good candidate for the next galactic supernova.'

**The huge orange star in the night sky that could explode any day  - Manchester Evening News**
Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in the constellation Orion, is expected to explode as a supernova soon. The star has been dimming in recent months, which is a sign that it's running out of fuel. According to Dr. Debra Wallace, Betelgeuse could burn for another 100,000 years, but a 2023 study suggests it could go into supernova in 'tens of years'. The explosion could be as bright as a full Moon and visible in broad daylight. Scientists and stargazers are hoping to witness the first naked-eye supernova in our galaxy since 1604. Betelgeuse is about 640 light years away from Earth, so it won't affect our solar system. The star is visible in the night sky, and its position will change over the next few days. 'Think about setting a fire in your back yard,' Dr. Wallace said. 'The more fuel you throw on it, the faster and hotter it burns. It's visually impressive - but gone in a flash.'

**What Would Happen if Betelgeuse Exploded as a Supernova?**
Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in the constellation Orion, is expected to explode as a supernova in the near future, possibly within the next few weeks or tens of thousands of years. According to Universe Today, the star's mass, rotation speed, and metallicity suggest that it will explode as a supernova in the next tens of thousands of years, but it could happen as soon as tomorrow. If Betelgeuse were to explode, it would be a spectacular event, with the star shining brightly enough to be visible during the day and as bright as the full moon at night. However, the radiation from the explosion would be negligible, and the star's proximity to Earth would not pose a significant threat. Universe Today notes that even if Betelgeuse were to explode, the effects on Earth would be minimal, and it would not pose a significant threat to human life or civilization. However, if the explosion were to occur closer to Earth, it could have more severe consequences, including an increase in cancer cases and mass deaths of marine life.

**Betelgeuse Supernova: A Spectacular Sight, Not a Threat**
The Betelgeuse star is expected to explode in a supernova, which can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. However, this explosion is not a cause for concern. The star is a red giant, 600 light-years away from Earth, and its explosion is a natural part of its life cycle. According to the Universe Today, the star may have already exploded, but the light has not yet reached Earth. The Betelgeuse star has burned out its hydrogen fuel and is now fusing helium in its core, making it unstable. The supernova will be a spectacular sight, but it will not pose a risk to Earth or its inhabitants, as explained by the Olhar Digital: 'Respondendo à pergunta: há riscos? Não. A Betelgeuse será um espetáculo luminoso no céu, mas não deve passar disso.'

**Betelgeuse's Supernova: A Spectacle We Won't Witness**
Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star, will eventually become a supernova, illuminating the Earth's skies. According to a study, the star has about 600,000 years of life left, burning helium in its core. However, even if Betelgeuse has almost exhausted its helium supply and is starting to burn carbon, it would take around 1,200 years to exhaust the carbon, which is roughly double the time it takes for its light to travel from the star to Earth. Therefore, the explosion of Betelgeuse will occur at least 1,200 years from now, but more likely between 600,000 years and possibly more. As a result, we won't be able to witness this spectacle, but it's not a reason to be sad, as the universe has many more wonders in store for us. As Thavisha E. Dharmawardena, one of the researchers, said, 'the universe's repertoire is very diverse, and Betelgeuse's supernova is just one of the billions of numbers it has in store for us.'
