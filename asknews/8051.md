**If Third World War breaks out, which countries will choose Russia, India and China will choose...**
The world has seen several deadly conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Gaza conflict, and India-Pakistan tensions. Media reports speculate that a world war may follow if these conflicts do not end. If a war-like scenario arises, possible blocks may form. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas to accept the Gaza ceasefire deal proposed by US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, 'or be destroyed.' The proposal includes the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 bodies in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and the release of 1,236 Palestinian detainees and prisoners, along with the bodies of 180 Palestinians. Ukraine launched Operation Spider Web against Russia, carrying out massive drone attacks targeting several airfields deep across the Russian territories. This military action came against the backdrop of scheduled peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul.

**Is Humanity Dead?**
The world is witnessing a sharp rise in armed conflicts and deaths, with over 200,000 people killed in 2022 alone. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the genocide in Gaza are two examples of devastating and unwinnable wars. The Gaza crisis is a symbol of moral collapse, with entire neighbourhoods flattened, families erased, and generations wiped out. The article argues that the global community has failed to act, with the media diluting the horror and institutions remaining paralysed. The writer calls for action, protest, and justice, and asks why Palestinian blood is treated as less sacred and their lives less worthy of outrage. The article concludes with a cry for humanity, urging the world to unite for justice, peace, and dignity.

**Multiple Threats Loom: China-Taiwan Tensions, Russian-Ukrainian Conflict, and Iran's Nuclear Ambitions**
According to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a military action by China against Taiwan 'may be imminent', which could happen before 2027, the year President Xi Jinping allegedly ordered the Chinese army to be ready to attack. Meanwhile, despite new peace talks scheduled for today in Istanbul involving Germany, France, the UK, Turkey, and the US, multiple sources say a new large-scale Russian ground offensive against Ukraine is 'imminent', and the US may be 'on the verge of abandoning Ukraine'. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) states that Iran now has over 408 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium, nearly doubling its stockpile from three months ago, and is on the verge of producing up to 10 nuclear weapons. This could lead to a 'preventive strike' by the US and/or Israel if a deal is not reached quickly. The greatest danger is that these threats become a reality simultaneously.

**The End of 'Golden Decades': US-China Relations Deteriorate and a New Cold War Begins**
The relationship between the US and China has deteriorated, marking the end of 'golden decades' and the beginning of a new Cold War. The number of Chinese students studying in the US has decreased, from over 370,000 in 2019 to a smaller number in 2023. This phenomenon, where two rival powers built bridges in education, science, and innovation, has come to an end. The Chinese government has become a major power with geopolitical ambitions, making a multipolar world more unstable. The tension between the two countries is inevitable. The US has imposed new tariffs, restricted technological exports, and adopted a hostile stance towards Chinese students, threatening to cancel the visas of many Chinese students in the US. The China has restricted the export of strategic minerals and developed alternative supply chains. The mistrust between the two countries has reduced the exchange of ideas, hindered scientific cooperation, and impoverished their understanding of each other. As new generations take power in Washington and Beijing, the risk of conflict increases. The relationship between the two countries is likely to worsen, and the world will become more volatile, making it difficult and costly to maintain neutrality. The 'golden era' of low geopolitical risk has come to an end.

**US-China Trade War: Who Will Be the Dominant Power?**
The trade war between the US and China has raised questions about who will be the dominant power in the future. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, but China has retaliated with its own tariffs. The situation has led to a decline in trade between the two countries, with the US experiencing a trade deficit of $700 billion in 2025. In contrast, China has a trade surplus of $700 billion, with a focus on exporting electronics and other goods. The US has a large national debt of $35 trillion, while China's debt is $15 trillion, but its total debt is 300% of its GDP. According to the IMF, China is expected to become the largest contributor to global growth in the next five years, with a 23% share. The US is still expected to be a major contributor, but its share is expected to decline. The two countries have different economic systems, with the US relying heavily on services, while China relies on industry. The US has a strong military, with over 6,100 tanks and 40,000 armored vehicles, while China has a large military with over 3.3 million soldiers and 3,260 aircraft. The US has a strong navy, with 490 ships, including 11 aircraft carriers, while China has a large navy with 777 ships. The US has a strong defense budget, with $740 billion in 2025, while China's defense budget is $178 billion. According to a report by the Telegraph, China has surpassed the US in terms of military strength, with over 1 million soldiers and a larger navy. The US is concerned about China's rapid military modernization, including its nuclear capabilities. The trade war between the US and China is not just about tariffs, but also about the future of the global economy and the balance of power between the two countries.

**US and China Engage in Confrontational Rhetoric Over Taiwan**
The rhetoric has become sharper and the tone more confrontational between Washington and Beijing in Singapore, as they accuse each other of destabilizing the Indo-Pacific region. At the center of the dispute is Taiwan and the question of how long peace will last. The Chinese government has strongly criticized US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth's comments on the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, accusing the US of undermining 'peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region' and turning it into a 'powder keg'. Beijing also warned the US government against interfering in the Taiwan issue. Hegseth had warned of a possible Chinese military intervention in Taiwan at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore, saying 'China's army is training for the worst-case scenario.' 'We will not sugarcoat it - the threat from China is real, and it could happen at any moment,' he added. Chinese Admiral Hu Gangfeng countered that Hegseth's accusations were 'unfounded' and aimed at 'provoking conflicts' and destabilizing the Asian-Pacific region. Hegseth also called on Asian allies to increase their defense spending in the face of the 'threat from communist China', saying that 'deterrence has its price.' China aims to become the dominant power in Asia and control the entire region, he said. 'But we will not start a conflict with China. However, we will not let ourselves be pushed out of this critical region. And we will not allow our allies and partners to be subordinated.' China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, despite the island having had an independent and democratically elected government for decades. The People's Republic has threatened to use military force to annex Taiwan if it does not do so peacefully.

**USD/CNY Forecast: Chinese Renminbi to Rise as 'Death Cross' Forms**
The USDCNY exchange rate has been trending downwards, from its annual high of 7.3500 on April 10 to a low of 7.20, as traders focus on the trade relations between China and the US. The US-China trade conflict escalated when Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese products, which he claimed would help reduce the trade deficit between the two countries. However, recent developments suggest that the crisis is escalating again, with the Trump administration taking unilateral decisions, including imposing export controls on key sectors, such as aviation. Marco Rubio plans to expel thousands of Chinese students from the US. These issues are affecting both economies, with recent data showing a slight improvement in the Chinese manufacturing PMI, but a decline in the non-manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, there are indications that the Chinese economy will prosper in the long run as it focuses on doing business with other countries. Key macroeconomic data from the US and China will be released this week, including the Caixin PMI manufacturing data, S&P Global and ISM PMI manufacturing data, and labor market data, which are expected to show a significant increase in employment. The daily chart shows that the USDCNY exchange rate has been under pressure in recent weeks, forming a double top pattern at 7.3318 and now below the neckline at 7.2185. The pair has also formed a death cross pattern, as the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have crossed. Therefore, it is likely to continue falling, with the next key point to watch being 7.1200.

**India Confirms Warplanes Shot Down, Refuses to Disclose Number**
India's Defense Chief Anil Chauhan confirmed that Indian warplanes were shot down in the recent conflict with Pakistan, but refused to disclose the exact number. Chauhan stated, 'What's important is not the number of planes that crashed, but the reason they crashed.' Pakistan claimed to have shot down 6 Indian warplanes, but Chauhan denied this, saying it was 'completely incorrect.' He emphasized that the importance lies in understanding why the planes crashed and what mistakes were made, rather than the number of planes lost. The conflict began on May 7 after a terror attack in Kashmir on April 22, which killed 26 people, mostly tourists. The two countries have been engaging in intense fighting, using warplanes, missiles, drones, and artillery. US President Trump announced on May 10 that India and Pakistan had agreed to an immediate ceasefire after US mediation. China's Central Television (CCTV) later confirmed that the Chinese-made J-10CE warplane had achieved a major victory in combat, shooting down multiple enemy warplanes without sustaining any losses. The exact date and location of the air battle were not specified, but it is believed to refer to the recent conflict between India and Pakistan.

**China Warns US Against 'Playing with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China has warned the US against 'playing with fire' over Taiwan, after US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made comments that China described as 'provocative' during a security forum in Singapore. China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement: 'The US should not use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and should avoid playing with fire.' The statement added that Beijing has made formal protests to Washington over Austin's comments, which China said were 'provocative' regarding China's sovereignty over Taiwan. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrei Rudenko, said that China is not concerned about the current interactions between Russia and the US, and that these interactions do not pose a threat to Russia-China relations. The US White House announced that President Donald Trump hopes China will choose a path of cooperation and mutual understanding, according to a report by Al-Qahera TV. The US State Department also announced that there is optimism about a proposed ceasefire in Gaza. Meanwhile, the Gaza Health Ministry announced that 54,249 Palestinians have been killed and 123,492 injured since October 7, 2023.

**ChatGPT Predicts No Winners in a War Between the US and China**
ChatGPT, a chatbot, has analyzed the possible scenarios of a war between the US and China. According to the chatbot, the US has a significant advantage in terms of defense budget, with $880 billion allocated in 2024, compared to China's $225 billion. The US also has a larger number of nuclear warheads, with 3,700, compared to China's 500. However, China has a larger navy, with the largest number of ships in the world. The chatbot suggests that a limited regional conflict, such as one around Taiwan or the South China Sea, is possible, but a full-scale war between the two countries is unlikely. In the event of a war, the chatbot predicts that neither side would emerge victorious, and the conflict would lead to a global crisis, with millions of deaths and a collapse of the global economy. 'There will be no winners in a war between the US and China,' ChatGPT said. 'The US has a strategic advantage, but any conflict would lead to global destabilization.'

**ChatGPT Predicts US-China War Scenarios: Who Would Win?**
ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence, has proposed several scenarios for a hypothetical war between the US and China. The AI warned that modeling a war between the two superpowers is a complex task that requires considering multiple variables, including military, economic, technological, geopolitical, demographic, and psychological factors. According to ChatGPT, the US has a significant advantage in terms of defense budget, with $880 billion allocated in 2024, compared to China's $225 billion. The US also has a larger nuclear arsenal, with 3,700 warheads, while China has around 500. Additionally, the US has more allies, including NATO countries, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and others. However, China has a larger navy and could potentially receive support from Russia, North Korea, and Iran. In the event of a war, ChatGPT predicts that the conflict could escalate to a global scale, with cyberattacks, blockades, sanctions, and space wars. The AI estimates that the probability of a nuclear escalation is low, but the consequences would be catastrophic. 'The result: no winners - a global crisis, millions of deaths, and the collapse of the global economy,' ChatGPT said. In terms of a winner, ChatGPT suggests that it would depend on the scope of the conflict. In a limited conflict, the US would have an advantage due to its allies, technology, logistics, and experience. However, China could inflict significant losses on the US, especially in the region. In a full-scale war, ChatGPT believes that there would be no clear winner, as both sides would suffer catastrophic consequences. 'There will be no winners in the classical sense. The US likely has a strategic advantage, but any conflict will lead to global destabilization,' ChatGPT said.

**UN Member States Demand Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflicts**
Approximately 80 UN member states, including Spain, France, Italy, and China, have called for the protection of civilians in armed conflicts, citing the need to prevent thousands of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip from starving in the coming days due to an 11-week Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid. The joint statement reads, 'This cannot continue. Today, we come with a clear message: the protection of civilians is not optional. It is a legal obligation under humanitarian law and a moral imperative that we cannot afford to neglect.' The signatory states have urged all parties to respect international law and for member states to 'exercise their influence.' They have also expressed concern that civilians in conflict zones continue to live in 'unimaginable conditions of danger, insecurity, and constant suffering,' with the UN reporting 36,000 civilian deaths in 14 armed conflicts in 2024. The statement highlights the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the population is at risk of famine and hundreds of humanitarian workers have died. Additionally, they have denounced the suffering of civilians in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.

**China Accused of Providing Pakistan with Missile and Satellite Support During India-Pakistan Conflict**
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been accused of providing Pakistan with missile and satellite support during the recent India-Pakistan conflict. According to Ashok Kumar, director of the New Delhi-based Center for Joint Warfare Studies, China helped Pakistan reorganize its radar and air defense systems to better detect Indian military and weapon deployments. Kumar stated, 'China helped them redeploy air defense radar so they could get to know our actions in the air.' China also allegedly helped Pakistan adjust its satellite coverage range over India during the 15-day period between the April 22 attack and the outbreak of hostilities. Kumar added, 'China helped them re-deploy air defense radar so they could get to know our actions in the air.' The conflict, which has resulted in nearly 70 deaths, has raised concerns about the possibility of a full-scale war between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. Kumar believes that China is using the conflict as a testing ground for its military equipment, citing Indian military assessments that China's defense systems are underperforming. 'India is now almost all calculations are considering a two-front scenario,' Kumar said. 'Today, anything in China could be seen as in Pakistan tomorrow.'

**India and Pakistan: New Casualties in Border War and Fears of Escalation**
The Pakistani military spokesperson, Ahmad Chaudhry, announced that 33 people were killed and 62 others were injured in the ongoing conflict with the Indian army. Chaudhry stated, 'We do not support any armed groups and our country is a victim of transnational terrorism, and we deny all Indian media allegations of Pakistan's military aircraft being shot down.' He added, 'India's accusations against Pakistan are politically motivated and lack evidence.' The conflict has resulted in the deaths of 5 civilians and injuries to at least 29 others in the Pakistani-administered Kashmir. The Chinese embassy in Nepal has advised its citizens to avoid areas near the border with India. Pakistani Defense Minister stated that the conflict with India has reached a stalemate, and there is no room for de-escalation. Chaudhry said, 'India is paying a heavy price for its aggressive actions and will pay more.' The Indian government announced that 13 civilians were killed and 59 others were injured in a Pakistani firing. US President Donald Trump expressed his desire for the conflict to end, stating, 'We want the conflict between India and Pakistan to end.' Trump also expressed his willingness to provide assistance in resolving the conflict.

**War Over Taiwan Would Cause 500,000 Deaths, Economic Devastation, US Admiral Paparo Says - Vision Times**
US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that a war over Taiwan would cause 500,000 deaths, economic devastation, and a 25% drop in Asian GDP. He also stated that a regional conflict could lead to nuclear-armed South Korea and Japan, and cause other countries to align with China. Paparo emphasized that a successful US intervention against a PRC invasion of Taiwan would reduce losses, but the damage and human toll would still be immense. He also called for enhancing capabilities in cyber, space, anti-space, and long-range strike operations across the Indo-Pacific, and advocated continuing the mission of USAID to promote American soft power around the world. According to Paparo, a regional conflict could result in 10-12% of the US GDP, 7 to 10% of American employment, and 500,000 deaths. He also stated that if the US reduces its military involvement on the Korean Peninsula, Japan and South Korea might consider producing and deploying nuclear weapons of their own. Paparo said, 'If the US reduces its military involvement on the Korean Peninsula, in Northeast Asia, or around Taiwan, Japan and South Korea might consider producing and deploying nuclear weapons of their own.'

**The Myanmar conflict: How US-Russia dynamics could favor China - Academia - The Jakarta Post**
The ongoing civil war in Myanmar has seen 6,000-plus people killed, 29,000 arrested, and over 3.3 million displaced. The conflict pits the military against a broad-based opposition, including ethnic minority groups. The military has turned to Russia for support, granting rights to extract minerals and build infrastructure. Russia has also supplied weapons and trained personnel for the military. However, the US has reduced its support for the opposition, and the EU may not fill the gap. China, which has traditionally supported the opposition, may take a greater role in shaping the course of the civil war, with a focus on stability and a negotiated solution. The shifting geopolitics of Russia, the US, and China may impact the war, but it is unlikely to encourage democracy or lasting peace in Myanmar. 'The US administration's reduction in aid and potential support for Myanmar's opposition could lead the way to China taking a greater role in shaping the course of the civil war,' said an expert. 'China's main concern is spillover from the war, and it wants a stable Myanmar. However, its chosen strategy to try to bring this about, that of forcing warring parties to sign ceasefire agreements, hasn't worked so far.'

**The new world order moves from unipolar moment to multipolar reality**
The world is shifting from a unipolar moment to a multipolar reality, with the US facing challenges from its own unilateralism and military interventionism, as well as the resurgent Russia and peacefully rising China. According to the SIPRI Yearbook 2024, 52 countries experienced armed conflicts in 2023, with 170,700 conflict-related fatalities worldwide. The US has incurred USD 8 trillion and 940,000 military and civilian deaths in its post-9/11 wars, while NATO and Russia have suffered extensive military and economic losses. China, on the other hand, has been pursuing cooperation instead of competition and has signed over 200 cooperation agreements with more than 150 countries and 30 international organizations. China's Belt and Road Initiative and other global projects have gained traction, and the country has emerged as a global peace maker to settle direct and proxy military conflicts. The joint statement between China and Russia after President Putin's visit to China in May 2024 pledged to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and to gather strength to build a just and reasonable multipolar world. The SCO Summit in Astana in July 2024 recognized the shift in global power structure from a unipolar world order to a multipolar one.

**China's War Preparations: A Threat to Global Security**
China is preparing for a large-scale war, including the possibility of using nuclear warheads, according to Colonel Philip Ingram, a retired British Army officer. China is building a new military command center near Beijing, which is ten times larger than the Pentagon, and is increasing its military presence in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Ingram stated that China is preparing its military, increasing its armed forces, and building up its naval and air forces. China is also stockpiling food, oil, gas, precious minerals, iron, and steel, in preparation for a potential conflict. Ingram emphasized that China is preparing for war, without any 'ifs' or 'buts'. He warned that a conflict between China and the US would have a global impact, and that the world would be at risk of a nuclear war. China is increasing its nuclear arsenal, with 100 new warheads added in 2024, and potentially over 1,000 by 2030. The US is reviewing its nuclear policy towards China in response. 'China is preparing for war, full stop, without any 'ifs' or 'buts', said Ingram. 'This is a very dangerous game for China, as it would lead to a mutually assured destruction, which has prevented nuclear war since 1945.'
