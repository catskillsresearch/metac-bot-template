**McDonald's Ranked Second in Fast Food Chain Category in Japan's First Brand Recall Survey**
Tribal Media House, a Tokyo-based company, conducted a 'first brand recall survey' which measures the brands that come to mind first when people think of certain categories. The survey, conducted in December 2024 with 6,000 participants, found the top brands for the following categories: 'beer', 'hair dryer', 'toothpaste', 'pet bottle drinks (tea)', 'residential housing', and 'fast food chains'. According to the survey, McDonald's ranked second in the fast food chain category, but the top brand was not specified. 'It was a great day.' would be a good example of how to quote people in the English summary, but in this case, there are no quotes from people in the article.

**Processed Potato Products Market to Hit US$ 62,190.7 Mn by 2032, Growing at 5.4% CAGR | Persistence Market Research**
The global processed potato products market is expected to grow from US$ 43,036.9 Mn in 2025 to US$ 62,190.7 Mn by 2032, reflecting a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period.

French fries remain the leading product segment due to rising demand from QSRs, while North America leads the global market with strong fast-food consumption trends. The market is segmented into foodservice and retail consumers, with the foodservice industry remaining the dominant end-user segment. Key players in the market include McCain Foods Ltd., Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., and The Kraft Heinz Company. The market faces restraints such as health concerns regarding high calorie and fat content in certain processed potato products, but there are opportunities for players who invest in innovation and healthier product variants.

**Why Are Politicians Banning Cultivated Meat? This New Study Gives A Hint**
A new study suggests that cultivated meat may threaten the livestock industry, particularly beef and lamb, due to its lower carbon footprint and potential to disrupt the market. Some lawmakers have banned cultivated meat, citing concerns over food safety and protecting ranchers. However, the study found that the livestock industry is backed by government subsidies, making it difficult for cultivated meat to compete on price. The researchers modelled two scenarios, one with a carbon tax and one without, and found that conventional beef, lamb, milk, and egg are more likely to lose market share to cultivated meat. Pork and chicken, with lower climate footprints, proved more resilient to the carbon tax. The study suggests that sheep and cattle rearing could be most vulnerable to competition, especially if a carbon tax is introduced. 'While there are still plenty of uncertainties here – such as whether technologies will ever improve to the point where cultivated proteins are commercially viable – this study suggests that sheep and cattle rearing could be most vulnerable to competition, especially if a carbon tax is introduced,' said Nick Roxburgh, a social systems simulation modeller at the James Hutton Institute. 'This is not an anti-farmer sector; this is a sector that is using farmed products in new ways. And generally using farmed products that are more profitable and highly sustainable in the way they’re produced,' said Roxburgh. 'These bills establish a precedent for adopting policies and regulatory requirements that could one day adversely affect the bills’ supporters,' said a letter. 'What we’re protecting here is the industry against acts of man, against an ideological agenda that wants to finger agriculture as the problem, that views things like raising cattle as destroying our climate,' said an Alabama politician. 'The main factor influencing choice is price. Cultivated meat firms must focus on cost reductions,' said Roxburgh. 'Farmers are more game for cultivated meat than politicians,' said a farmer. 'Given the potential for disruption, it will be important to plan carefully for the possible impacts of cultivated proteins on livestock farming and rural livelihoods,' said Roxburgh.

**Why Some Promising Vegan Burgers Are Disappearing from Fast-Food Menus**
In recent years, fast-food chains have shown a notable evolution in their offerings, adapting to the growing demand for plant-based options. Chains like Burger King, Telepizza, and Taco Bell have invested in the green market, making plant-based food more accessible and appealing to non-vegetarians. Plant-based burgers, made with vegetable products and no meat, have become a cornerstone of this transformation. Brands like The Vegetarian Butcher, Heura, or Impossible Foods offer medallions that aim to replicate the texture and flavor of meat, often with high protein content from beans or other plant-based proteins. Burger King leads in Spain in terms of plant-based burgers, offering the Whopper Vegetal and Nuggets Vegetales in collaboration with Impossible Foods. However, McDonald's in Spain does not regularly sell plant-based burgers, despite having implemented the McPlant in other markets. The chain's website mentions that many products can be personalized, but it does not explicitly offer plant-based options. The Rebel Whopper from Burger King has also faced controversy in Spain due to its cooking method, which is not suitable for strict vegans. This highlights the importance of clear communication and ease of consumption for the success of plant-based options. The interest in plant-based products is growing, but the sales volume of these burgers often fails to meet commercial expectations. If it's not profitable, options tend to disappear. Factors like price, perception of taste, and marketing also play a significant role. The language used in menus, with terms like 'vegan' or 'without meat,' can deter a portion of the public who do not identify with veganism, affecting sales. In the current market, some people associate these words with a strict lifestyle, limited diets, and even 'boring' or 'less tasty' food compared to meat. While the 'vegan' label is essential and highly valued for the vegan and vegetarian community, this group represents a relatively small percentage of the general population. Focusing marketing exclusively on them may limit the reach to a larger market that seeks more inclusive and less 'ideological' options.

**How McDonald's Is Stepping Up Its Burger Game In 2025 - Food Republic**
McDonald's plans to improve its burgers with its 'Best Burger Initiative,' which includes 50 small changes, such as toasting buns better, adding white onions to patties, and using more signature sauce on Big Macs. CEO Chris Kempczinski aims to accelerate the rollout of new signature burgers and further diversify the menu, while maintaining improvements that boost customer satisfaction. The changes are feasible for every location to follow, given McDonald's sells 6.5 million burgers daily. According to Kempczinski, 'the goal is to make our burgers the best they can be,' as he told The Wall Street Journal. The initiative is not limited to burgers, but will also include improvements to other menu items.

**Stocks of McDonald's and other fast food giants rise, but challenges from Trump tariffs loom**
Despite challenges from President Trump's tariffs, shares of fast food giants like McDonald's (MCD) have risen, with McDonald's hitting a record high and its stock increasing 5% in the last week. Yum Brands (YUM) and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) have also seen significant gains. However, shares of Chipotle (CMG), Cava (CAVA), and Shake Shack (SHAK) have declined. Analysts attribute the rotation into larger players to the uncertain market environment. The long-term future of the industry remains cloudy due to the unpredictable nature of tariff announcements, which is causing frustration among franchise owners, manufacturers, and agribusiness. Tariffs are expected to increase prices for various goods, including gas, rubber, and plastic products, processed rice, machinery, and equipment, vegetables, fruit, sugar, and dairy, potentially affecting equipment costs for restaurants.
