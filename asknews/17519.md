**36% annual jump in new home registrations in first quarter of 2025 - NHBC**
The National House Building Council (NHBC) reported a 36% annual jump in new home registrations in the first quarter of 2025, with 29,356 new homes registered across the UK. This represents a 17% increase from the fourth quarter of 2024. The NHBC attributed the growth to 'growing confidence in the market,' citing factors such as easing inflation, lower mortgage rates, and greater availability of lower deposit mortgages. However, London was the only region to experience a decline in new build registrations, due to the new building safety regime for high-rise buildings and lower demand from housing associations. Within the total, 20,653 new homes were registered in the private sector, a 62% jump compared to the first quarter of 2024, while 8,703 new homes were registered in the rental and affordable sector, a 2% fall compared to the same period last year. The types of homes registered included 9,821 detached homes, a 63% increase; 416 bungalows, a 54% annual rise; 9,955 semi-detached homes, a 44% increase; and 4,562 terraced homes, a 23% annual rise. In contrast, apartment registrations fell by 3% annually. The NHBC also reported that 26,120 new builds were completed in the first quarter of 2025, a 1% decrease compared to the same period last year. According to Steve Wood, CEO at the NHBC, 'Our figures for the first quarter of this year indicate growing confidence in the market with a 36% increase in developers registering their intent to build a new home compared to the same period last year.'

**Mortgage Payments Will Be Twice as High as Rent Prices in 2025, Senator Warns**
Senator Olga Epihannova explained to 'Gazeta.Ru' that mortgage payments will be twice as high as rent prices in 2025. According to her, in 2025, renting a flat will be financially more beneficial in the short and medium term than buying a flat with mortgage rates taken into account. 'The turning point when buying a flat will become unequivocally beneficial for new borrowers will not occur before a significant reduction in mortgage rates. It is extremely difficult to predict when this will happen (in 2026, 2027 years or later). The gap between mortgage payments and rent will be the largest in recent years: due to the combination of high housing prices (accumulated during the period of hype and favorable programs) and high market mortgage rates, the monthly mortgage payment in 2025 will be significantly (possibly two to three times) higher than the rent for similar housing. This gap makes renting economically more attractive at the moment,' she noted. Senator Epihannova clarified that in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other large cities with very high housing prices, the gap between mortgage payments and rent will be most noticeable. In regions with more affordable housing and potentially more stable labor markets, the situation may be slightly different, but the overall trend of high mortgage rates will remain widespread, she is convinced. According to her, the money going into the initial down payment on a mortgage can be invested. Epihannova emphasized that in the conditions of cooling the housing market and high mortgage rates, there is no guarantee of rapid growth in the price of the purchased flat. In her opinion, there is even a risk of stagnation or a small price correction of the flat's cost. Epihannova concluded that buying a flat in 2025 as 'an investment' with the goal of rapid capital growth looks less attractive than in previous years.

**Gonzalo Bernardos Predicts a 'Festival' in the Housing Market for 2025**
Gonzalo Bernardos, an economist, predicts that the housing market will be a 'festival' in 2025 due to the increasing availability of credit. He believes that banks will offer more credit as they will earn less per euro lent. Bernardos recommends buying a home in 2025, as it will be a good investment opportunity. He notes that the cost of a mortgage is often lower than the cost of renting, allowing for savings and the creation of wealth. According to Bernardos, buying a home provides greater security and control, as opposed to renting, which involves uncertainty and the risk of contract renewal. He also highlights the benefits of homeownership, including protection against inflation and the potential for long-term rental income. Bernardos suggests that the 2025 housing market will be driven by a combination of factors, including a possible decrease in interest rates and the increasing popularity of mortgage options, including those offered by savings banks.

**Market Expectation: Will Unique and Preferential Projects be Launched during the 520 Period?**
The real estate market is expecting unique and preferential projects to be launched during the 520 period. Experts point out that the period from the second half of this year to the first half of next year is the last year for the New Youth An preferential home loan, and with the housing market entering the 520 period, the question of whether the pre-sale market will launch unique projects or preferential schemes has attracted attention. According to Feng Xuan Not Dynamic Property Think Tank Executive Director He Shichang, the central bank's strict control on bank lending in the real estate sector and the implementation of the seventh round of credit control measures in September 2024 led to a decline in housing market sentiment from the fourth quarter of last year to February this year. The market had been in a five-month low, but in March, the pre-sale market saw a rebound of 1-2% compared to February, with monthly transaction volumes reaching over 6,000 units, indicating a 'stabilization' sign of hitting the bottom. However, the outbreak of the US trade war in April, despite being temporarily suspended for 90 days, triggered a global political and economic shock, causing a stock market crash and a decline in housing market confidence. The monthly transaction volume is estimated to have dropped to over 5,000 units, and the market's buying sentiment has shrunk again. If the new home market transaction volume does not continue to rise to 6-7,000 units in May and June, the selling pressure and price adjustment pressure in the second half of the year will increase, and the probability of builders reducing prices will be significantly higher. He Shichang emphasized that the period from the second half of this year to the first half of next year is the last year for the New Youth An preferential home loan, and with the 520 period, it is worth observing whether the pre-sale market can launch unique projects or preferential schemes that will stimulate the expansion of self-occupied buying and attract consumers' attention.

**Hong Kong Property Market Expected to Recover in 2025**
Hong Kong's property market has shown signs of recovery, with a predicted increase in housing prices in 2025. The market has been affected by the government's policies, including the removal of additional stamp duty and the relaxation of mortgage lending rules. The economy is expected to recover, with a predicted average annual growth rate of 3.3% from 2022 to 2025. The removal of additional stamp duty has increased market activity, with a 103.6% increase in mainland buyers in 2024. However, the market has not yet seen a significant increase in housing prices. Low-priced housing has become a market highlight, with a 81.6% increase in sales of housing priced below 500 million HKD. The market is expected to recover in 2025, but the process may be bumpy, and prices may not increase significantly. Different regions and types of housing will have different price performances. Investors should consider the following factors: location, property type, rental income, and risk control.

**Mass Withdrawal of Money from Bank Deposits Expected in July 2025, Says Economist**
Economist Dmitry Abzalov predicts that in July 2025, there will be a mass withdrawal of money from bank deposits by Russians. This is due to the constant decrease in deposit interest rates, which may accelerate in July if the central bank's key rate starts to fall. Abzalov believes that this will prompt many depositors to withdraw their funds from banks and invest them in more profitable areas, such as the housing market. As a result, Russian builders will offer even more attractive conditions to potential buyers, making investments in apartments a popular way to use deposited funds. This may lead to a housing market boom, according to Abzalov. The expert also notes that experts are not waiting for the start of the key rate reduction cycle for nothing, as its current high level will soon lead to dangerous imbalances in the economy, forcing the central bank to soften its monetary policy. Commercial banks will follow this trend, lowering their interest rates faster than they do today. This trend, Abzalov believes, will prompt many depositors to withdraw their money from deposits and redirect it to other areas. This process may begin as early as July, Abzalov concluded, citing 'It is not a coincidence that experts are waiting for the start of the key rate reduction cycle,' Abzalov said. 'The current high level of the key rate will soon lead to dangerous imbalances in the economy, forcing the central bank to soften its monetary policy.'

**Housing Market Trends: Expert Predicts 3 Major Directions**
According to real estate collector old Huang, the future of the housing market may see three major trends: 1. Banks will loosen their lending standards, allowing more people to get loans; 2. Market transactions will increase, and prices will become more stable; 3. The time for price negotiations will be limited. Old Huang believes that the time to buy a house is not when the market is at its lowest, but when the policy has changed, but the market has not yet fully responded. He suggests that now is the time to buy 'A-case' (high-quality and high-value properties) before the market becomes more competitive.

**Three Major Changes in the Housing Market: Expert Predicts a Shift in Policy and Market Trends**
According to '老黃房市筆記', the housing market is expected to undergo three major changes in the future. The first change is that banks will start to loosen their lending policies, making it easier for people to get mortgages. The second change is that market transactions will increase, and the price resistance will gradually rise. The third change is that the 'negotiable time' for buying houses will soon be over. '老黃房市筆記' suggests that people can buy houses during the period when the policy has changed but the market has not yet fully reacted. If you are a self-buyer, it is recommended to buy high-value houses (A-case) now. This is because it is difficult to buy houses at the bottom of the market, but it is a good time to buy when the policy has changed but the market has not yet fully reacted.

**Poly's New Project: A Turning Point in the Real Estate Market**
The real estate market has a cyclical nature, and in 2020, many factors affecting the development of the housing market began to change. The supply and demand relationship in the housing market is also undergoing a subtle change. For example, the average living area of urban residents in China has exceeded 40 square meters, indicating that the overall housing market has shifted from a state of supply and demand imbalance to one of oversupply. However, local markets may still experience structural imbalances. After a severe downward adjustment, combined with the continuous introduction of real estate policies, the overall housing market trend has shown a stabilizing trend since the fourth quarter of last year, indicating that a new turning point has arrived in the real estate market. The project information is as follows: developer: Poly, location: No. 1 plot, land area: 46 mu, property type: high-rise/low-rise, T4/T2, on-sale buildings: 9, 10, 12. The project features a high floor-to-area ratio of 2.5 and a green coverage rate of 35%. The project is expected to be completed in July 2025. The property management company is Poly Property. The project offers a range of amenities, including proximity to multiple subway lines, high-quality schools, and commercial areas. The developer emphasizes the importance of consistency and stability in the real estate market, citing the need for a new turning point.

**2025 Housing Market Trends and the '保利·北新学府' Project**
The 2025 housing market is expected to see a supply-demand adjustment, with the market accelerating the clearance of inventory. Local governments will gain more autonomy, and key cities may explore the 'purchase instead of construction' model to target inventory digestion. The policy of lowering mortgage interest rates and reducing transaction taxes will continue to be implemented, and the replacement demand brought by 'urban village renovation' and 'old house renovation' will further lower the threshold for first-time and upgrade-type homebuyers. Lowering the interest rate of existing houses can alleviate the interest burden of homebuyers, stimulate consumption, and drive economic growth, which is in line with the macroeconomic policy goals. However, there are some factors that may constrain the downward adjustment of existing house interest rates, such as the central bank's increased demand for stabilizing the exchange rate, preventing interest rate risks, and preventing capital from circulating, which will affect the decision to lower interest rates; banks' increased debt pressure and asset-side re-pricing pressure will also form certain constraints on LPR's continued downward adjustment. The article also mentions that the project, '保利·北新学府', has a total area of 53 mu, a total of 638 households, a car-to-house ratio of 1:1.33, and a building area of 70,300 square meters. The project is expected to be completed in July 2025 and will be managed by 保利物业. The project is located near the 'five-petaled flowers' of 成都教育质量天花板's representative, 成都公办小学's '清华北大', and the K12 full-day private boarding school, 新川外国语学校, which is committed to 'inheriting the past and innovating the new, embracing the vast and inclusive' educational pursuit, with the goal of becoming a 'school with cultural growth, educational innovation, and international competitiveness'.

**Housing Bubble or Bust? What's Next for Home Prices in 2025**
The housing market in 2025 is a topic of concern, with high mortgage rates and home prices. Experts predict that the market will not crash, but rather cool down slightly. According to Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, a housing market crash is unlikely due to a shortage of homes and high demand. Realtor.com's chief economist, Danielle Hale, also believes that mortgage rates will drop in 2025, making housing more affordable. Fannie Mae predicts a 3.5% increase in home pricing in 2025, while the NAR predicts a 2-3% increase. The best scenario for a housing market recovery in 2025 would be for mortgage rates to drop between 4 and 5%, which would help the market return to 'normal'. Ultimately, the decision to buy or wait in 2025 depends on individual circumstances and the potential for an interest rate drop.

**European Housing Market: A Brief Crash, but No Stabilization in Sight**
The European Central Bank (ECB) has published an analysis on the housing market in the euro area, comparing the 2007 crisis with the current post-pandemic adjustment phase. The 2024 crash was brief and shallow: after a modest decline, house prices returned to 2022 levels. However, valuations remain inflated, and the ECB warns that the upward trend may resume. As a result, homes are becoming less accessible, and the market is becoming increasingly rigid, hindering new investments. According to the ECB, the housing market is closely linked to the economy, influencing family budgets, monetary policy transmission, and credit. A housing market boom, accompanied by high interest rates, makes buying a luxury and complicates the rental market. The ECB report states that the housing market follows its own logic, with cycles that are more irregular and unpredictable than the overall economy. While the ECB notes that the recent price drop was more contained and shorter than previous cycles, it warns that the market is not ready for a crash, but also not for a true stabilization. The report concludes that the future of the European housing market will depend on the balance between demand and supply, but with house prices still out of scale and credit accessibility becoming increasingly complex, the scenario does not promise significant changes.

**UK housing market momentum slowed in February, surveyors institute**
The UK housing market slowed in February, with buyer demand at its weakest levels since November 2023, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Higher stamp duty costs, concerns over interest rates and inflation, and global events are dampening buyer confidence. Despite this, house prices continued to increase, but at a more subdued rate. Looking ahead, the majority of professionals believe house prices will rise over the next 12 months. In the rental sector, demand from tenants has fallen for the fourth month in a row, while supply is reducing at a faster rate, pointing towards further rental price rises. Rics Chief Economist Simon Rubinson said, 'The UK housing market appears to be losing some momentum as the expiry of the temporary increase in stamp duty thresholds approaches.' Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, added, 'The window of opportunity has effectively slammed shut on buyers, because even in February they knew there was next-to-no chance of getting a sale sorted before the end of the stamp duty holiday.' Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said, 'Markets still expect two Bank of England rate cuts in 2025 and we still believe there will be single-digit house price growth, but some caution is understandable.'

**Is the housing market going to crash in 2025? What to know**
The US housing market is expected to experience modest growth in 2025, according to current analyses. Despite high mortgage rates and inflation, the market is not expected to crash. Experts point to a few factors that could put pressure on the market, including a significant rise in mortgage rates or substantial job losses. However, these scenarios are unlikely, and the market is expected to remain stable. Zillow's Home Value and Home Sales Forecast for February 2025 predicts a 0.9% increase in home values, with existing home sales reaching 4.11 million in 2025. Affordability will remain a challenge, with Buffalo, Indianapolis, and Kansas City being the hottest markets. Mortgage rates are expected to drop slightly by the end of the year, but significant reductions are unlikely. Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, notes that the three pillars of housing affordability are mortgage rates, incomes, and home prices, and that mortgage rates will drop somewhat in 2025, contributing to improved housing affordability. However, home price gains will offset any mortgage rate improvement. Lawrence Yun, NAR Chief Economist, states that a sharp rise in mortgage rates to around 9 percent, combined with significant net job losses, could put severe pressure on the housing market, but both scenarios are unlikely. Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow, emphasizes that the housing market is on solid ground, with pent-up demand from millennials who have been unable to break into homeownership, and that affordability will remain a challenge due to a lack of supply. Mortgage rates are the big wild card, and it's never easy to predict mortgage rate changes, but signs point to rates not falling much this year, if at all.

**Housing market kicks off 2025 with price rise to hit new record high**
The UK housing market started 2025 with a price rise, reaching a new record high of £299,138. According to Amanda Bryden, Head of Mortgages at Halifax, 'The UK housing market started the year on a positive note, with average prices rising by +0.7% in January, more than recovering the slight dip of -0.2% in December.' Annual growth slowed to +3.0%, the slowest rate since last July. Despite geopolitical uncertainties, household earnings are expected to continue outpacing inflation, easing some of the financial pressure. However, the fundamental issue in the housing market remains the lack of supply. Northern Ireland continues to have the strongest annual property price growth in the UK, with a +5.9% increase in January, followed by Wales with a +3.6% increase. Scotland saw a lower rise in house prices, with a +2.4% increase, while the North East has overtaken the North West as the region with the strongest annual property price growth in England.

**UK: Housing market kicks off 2025 with price rise to hit new record high**
The UK housing market started 2025 on a positive note, with average property prices rising by 0.7% in January, reaching a new record high of £299,138. This increase, which more than recovered the slight dip in December, pushed annual growth to 3.0%, the slowest rate since last July. Despite the resilience of the market, affordability remains a challenge for many potential buyers. However, there is strong demand for new mortgages and growth in lending, which may be partly driven by first-time buyers eager to complete purchases before the looming stamp duty increase.

**House prices ‘gathering steam’ before stamp duty changes**
The UK housing market started 2025 strongly, with a 13% increase in buyer demand and 10% more homes on sale, according to Zoopla. This led to a 2% year-on-year increase in UK house prices. Sales Director at Finova, John Tilzey, said, 'Prices are gathering steam, marking a significant turnaround from this time last year.' However, experts warn that the recent uptick in prices will soon level out as mortgage rates and supply of homes rise, and the rush to buy homes before stamp duty changes in April will have distorted the market. Executive director at Zoopla, Richard Donnell, cautioned that the stamp duty change will have a disproportionate impact in higher-priced areas like London. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said, 'Demand in the UK housing market feels artificially high.' As the impact of higher mortgage costs kicks in, experts expect a period of downwards pressure on house prices, which will only be alleviated once rate cut expectations rise.

**Debunking Housing Market Crash Predictions for 2025**
Experts debunk predictions of a housing market crash in 2025, citing key differences between the current market and the 2008 crisis. The main distinctions are: a shortage of available homes, stricter lending practices, lower foreclosure rates, and more favorable mortgage rates. While there may be some moderate price corrections, a catastrophic crash is highly improbable. The market is far more stable than in 2008, with a fundamental shortage of homes and more secure lending practices. Experts advise staying informed, focusing on long-term goals, and avoiding knee-jerk reactions based on short-term market fluctuations. According to the author, a housing market crash in 2025 is 'highly unlikely' based on real market analysis.
