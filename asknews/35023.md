**Market Predictions: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, SUI**
The S&P 500 and the US Dollar Index have risen sharply after the US-China trade agreement, while Bitcoin has been cautious. André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise in Europe, said that the company's proprietary indicator has reached its highest level since 2024, historically resulting in a short-term correction or sideways movement in the price. Despite the uncertainty, long-term bulls are adding more Bitcoin to their portfolios. The S&P 500 has broken through the resistance level of 5,800, while the US Dollar Index has surpassed its 20-day EMA (100.42). If the price closes above 5,800, the movement could continue towards 6,000. Bitcoin has retreated from 105,819 dollars, with the first support level at 100,000 dollars and the 20-day EMA at 97,238 dollars. If the price rebounds from the support zone, bulls will try to push the BTC/USDT pair above 109,588 dollars. If they succeed, the pair could rise to 130,000 dollars. However, if the price falls below the 20-day EMA, it could indicate that buyers are taking profits at higher levels, opening the door for a drop to 93,000 dollars and then to the 50-day SMA (89,302 dollars).

**Bitcoin Must Close Above $104,500 to Enter 'Price Discovery' Mode**
Bitcoin has preserved significant gains heading into the weekly close on May 11, with analysis highlighting a key level to watch. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin could even initiate a return to all-time highs and the discovery of new prices. The key weekly close level for support, as he said, is around $104,500. 'Can Bitcoin do it? Can Bitcoin close the week above the maximum range of its recently recovered re-accumulation range to initiate the breakout process?', he questioned in a post on X along with an explanatory graph. 'Bitcoin is about to start the bullish trend of discovery of new prices 2'. An additional update calculated that the current Bitcoin bull market is complete at 85.5%, although there are still erratic bullish movements to come. Some market participants remained bearish in short-term periods. In X, the popular trader HTL-NL argued that the current impulse towards all-time highs would end as a 'fakeout' to catch late buyers. 'Will Bitcoin close/open the week staying within the range, will it do a 'fake out (UTAD)' or was this really a re-accumulation range as many want to believe?', he wrote that day. 'To be honest, although I still favor the first 2 options based on M/Q charts, it's not impossible that it's a re-accumulation'. Another voice of caution came from Il Capo of Crypto, a well-known trader in Bitcoin trading circles. In his latest updates on X, the commentator under pseudonym warned that BTC/USD could correct to the point where all its rebound disappears. 'This is the time to reduce positions, not to increase them', he argued on May 10. 'They are testing strong resistances, and if this is just a correction of the bearish trend since January, the entire movement could eventually be completely reversed'. Il Capo of Crypto originally gained notoriety for his price targets of $12,000 for BTC at the start of the bull market in 2023.

**Bitcoin must close the week above this level to start 'price discovery 2'**
Bitcoin (BTC) has preserved its gains and reached new multimonth highs of nearly $105,000.

However, some market participants remain bearish, with trader HTL-NL arguing that the current push toward all-time highs could end as a 'fakeout' to trap late longs.

**Bitcoin Surges Past $100,000, Triggering Widespread Market Gains and Forced Liquidations**
Bitcoin's price surged, breaking through the $100,000 barrier, with a daily increase of over 6%, reaching $103,064.8, a new high since February 2025. The price hike was driven by multiple factors, including the continuous increase in Bitcoin holdings by listed companies. Semler, a US-based company, has accumulated 3,467 Bitcoins in the past half month, while Metaplanet, a Japanese company, has exceeded 5,000 Bitcoins in its holdings and plans to increase it to 10,000 by the end of the year. The Salvadoran government has also announced its intention to continue increasing its Bitcoin holdings. As a result, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has seen a significant increase, with Ethereum rising by over 20%, and other major cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Aida, and Ripple also experiencing significant gains. However, the market's volatility has led to a large number of forced liquidations, with over 200,000 people being forced to close their positions in the past 24 hours, resulting in a total of $968 million in losses, with over 80% of them being short positions.

**Bitcoin Aging Chart sends Buy Signal: Prognosis Model Sees Price Target of $350,000 in 2025**
Bitcoin has been highly volatile in recent times, with a record high of $109,114.88 on January 20, following Donald Trump's inauguration, and a low of around $76,000. However, the cryptocurrency has recovered and is currently trading above $100,000 (as of May 9, 2025). Experts remain optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, with some predicting significant price increases. Standard Chartered's Digital-Asset-Stratege Geoff Kendrick expects a new all-time high for Bitcoin in the second quarter of 2025, driven by a strategic capital shift away from US assets. BitMEX-Mitgründer Arthur Hayes sees the current lower price as a potential buying opportunity, with a possible price increase to $200,000. Cardano-Gründer Charles Hoskinson is even more optimistic, predicting a price of $250,000 by 2026. A new prognosemodell also suggests that Bitcoin could reach $350,000 by 2025, based on a logarithmic diagram of Bitcoin's price history since 2011. The model shows a linear relationship between Bitcoin's age and its price growth, with a 40% increase in age resulting in a sixfold increase in price. 'Bitcoin has historically grown by six times its age every 40% increase,' said Sina, co-founder of 21st Capital. 'It's not about the calendar year, but about the age.'

**Bitcoin Breaks $100,000 Barrier, Setting Stage for Further Growth**
The recent week has been a triumph for the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin confidently breaking the psychological barrier of $100,000, closing at $104,118 with a weekly gain of 10.44%. The breakthrough of the significant barrier marked a new milestone for the first cryptocurrency and confirmed its growing resilience even in the face of global economic instability. The catalyst for this powerful movement was President Trump's statement on May 8 about the conclusion of a trade deal between the US and the UK. This event caused a real earthquake on the market, triggering a massive short-squeeze with liquidations of $395 million only on Bitcoin. Notably, traders who bet on a decline were completely unprepared for the market's rapid turnaround. In the face of Bitcoin's growth, Ethereum demonstrated a truly impressive dynamics, soaring 39.01% and reaching $2514. This four-fold gap from Bitcoin's indicators testifies to the growing interest of institutional investors in alternative cryptocurrencies offering broader functional capabilities. Ethereum has been cheaper than Bitcoin since September 2022, and this is only compensation for the rebound in the ETH/BTC pair by 25.9% to 0.02415. From a technical point of view, Bitcoin's confident consolidation above the $100,000 level opens the way to the next target zones at $114,000 and $119,000. The key support has formed at $98,500, and as long as the price remains above this level, the upward trend remains strong. Cyclical analysis indicates the preservation of the 'bullish' impulse until mid-June to early July 2025. After this period, there is a high probability of a correctional movement to August 1, followed by a new wave of growth to the end of September. A serious resistance is expected in the price zone of $125,000-133,000 in the long-term scenario. The key event of the upcoming week will be the publication of US inflation data on May 13, which may have a significant impact on the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding the further trajectory of interest rates, inevitably affecting the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Further statements by the Trump administration on trade policy, especially in the context of recent negotiations with China, also deserve attention. According to President Trump, these negotiations have been successful and have led to a 'complete reboot' of relations between the two largest economies in the world, which may create a favorable environment for further strengthening the positions of digital assets.

**Bitcoin price inches closer to new all-time high as ETH, DOGE, PEPE and ATOM rally**
Bitcoin has made a decisive move above the $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. The rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). Several altcoins, including Ether, Dogecoin, Pepe, and Cosmos, have also moved higher. Analysts are predicting sharp rallies in altcoins over the next few months. However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started. The relative strength index (RSI) for Bitcoin has pushed into the overbought zone, suggesting a correction or consolidation in the near term. If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000. Ether has skyrocketed from $1,808 to $2,600, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls. The up move has pushed the RSI into the overbought territory, indicating a minor pullback or consolidation is possible in the near term. Dogecoin has soared above the $0.21 overhead resistance, indicating a change in the short-term trend. The rally is facing selling at $0.26, which could result in a retest of the breakout level of $0.21. Pepe has rallied sharply from the 50-day SMA and broken above the $0.000011 overhead resistance. The rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone, signaling a pullback may be around the corner. Cosmos has broken out of the large base when it closed above $5.15, signaling a potential trend change. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily and will try to pull the price back below the $5.15 level.

**As Markets Churned, Bitcoin Surged. Here's What Could Happen Next. | The Motley Fool**
Bitcoin has surged 15% in the past 30 days, but the question remains whether this mini-rally will last through 2025. The bull-case scenario assumes that the worst of the tariff situation is behind us, leading to a grand rapprochement with China and a flurry of trade deals, causing Bitcoin to soar to another all-time high. However, the bear-case scenario suggests that the talk about new trade deals is a mirage, leading to a recession, and Bitcoin might still rally if investors lose confidence in the US dollar and view it as a safe-haven asset. The primary variable to watch is Bitcoin's performance compared to gold, which should narrow in 2025 if investors view Bitcoin as 'digital gold.' Historically, Bitcoin follows predictable four-year cycles, and the most recent halving date in April 2024 could mark the start of a new 'boom' period, potentially leading to an all-time high by November 2025. However, ignoring history at one's own peril, the four-year cycle may be coming to a close soon, and investors should be prepared for future volatility and willing to hold for at least four years.

**Cryptocurrency Market Sees Near-Universal Decline as Bitcoin Falls 0.70%**
The cryptocurrency market experienced a near-universal decline on Friday, May 2, 2025, with Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies falling after a strong rally in the previous days. Bitcoin had recently surpassed the $95,460 level, its highest price in the past two months. In this context, renowned investor Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and CEO of Maelstrom, reiterated his bold prediction that Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2028. Hayes attributed the next wave of growth to increased dollar liquidity, citing the 2.5 trillion dollar injection by the US government in the third quarter of 2022 to support traditional and digital markets after the FTX collapse. He believes that a similar expansionary monetary policy is on the horizon, driving investors towards rare digital assets like Bitcoin, which is scarce and has limited supply. The US economic pressures and financial changes support the upward trend, with Hayes noting that proposed economic policies by former President Donald Trump, such as tariffs on trading partners, create uncertainty in the markets. Although these tariffs are currently suspended, their potential negative effects worry investors. Hayes also mentioned that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell may not intervene to support the markets if Trump returns to power. However, in contrast, investment funds may start buying US Treasury bonds, injecting additional liquidity into the financial system. As of Saturday, May 3, 2025, Bitcoin's price fell by 0.70% to $96,428, while its market capitalization reached $1.92 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume for Bitcoin reached $25.44 billion, and its value added 1.6% over the past seven days.

**Gold Slips After Record Run, Bitcoin and Stocks Edge Back Into Focus**
Gold prices fell by 2.6% to $3,260 after a record high, but remains up 30% in 2025. The gold-to-silver ratio is at its highest since 1994. Bitcoin and stock markets decreased as investors reassessed the rally amid shifting political signals and cooling investor sentiment. Traders are now looking at the structural backdrop for Bitcoin, which remains supportive, according to Pavel. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said 'Markets paused for breath after the recent rally as investors were treated to a barrage of corporate news to get their heads around.' The Dow closed 400 points higher after dropping 800 points from session highs, while the Stoxx 600 is almost flat from yesterday.

**Bitcoin Rises to $87,770 as Dollar Declines and Institutional Investors Buy In**
Bitcoin started the week with a rise to $87,770, reaching its highest level in nearly a month. This increase, which exceeded 3% in the last 24 hours, resulted in a $3,000 increase during the day. As a result, Bitcoin recovered a significant part of the losses it experienced in April. The decline in the dollar, which was triggered by US President Donald Trump's announcement that he plans to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, strengthened Bitcoin. The dollar index fell to 98 at the beginning of the week, causing investors to turn to alternative assets. Gold, which is considered a safe-haven asset, also benefited from this development and rose to $3,390 per ounce, increasing its value by 28% since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin, which traditionally correlates with stocks like equities, seems to be breaking away from this correlation in recent times. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures indices fell, BTC rose in this environment. Some market analysts believe that Bitcoin is moving in parallel with 'hard assets' like gold and that this is due to the increasing number of investors positioning themselves as alternative financial systems. Institutional investors are also aggressively buying BTC. Metaplanet, a Japanese company, recently purchased 330 BTC worth $26 million, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 4,855. The company aims to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Institutional buying not only drives up prices but also increases overall market confidence. The increase in the number of publicly traded companies investing in Bitcoin in the first quarter of 2025 shows that institutional participation is accelerating. The halving effect, which is a classic upward trend seen after the halving event, is also supporting Bitcoin's price movement. In previous halving periods, new record highs were typically seen 500 days after the event, but this time BTC reached new highs in just 273 days. This is seen as a positive sign for long-term investors. However, madeneci and whale sales are creating a risk for the market. According to CryptoQuant's data, despite the short-term rise in Bitcoin, sales pressure remains in the market. Madeneci sales, in particular, have been significant in recent weeks. A 15,000 BTC sale on April 7 was the third-largest daily sale of 2025 so far. Additionally, large investors, or 'whales,' have slowed down their Bitcoin accumulation. Since February, the total amount of Bitcoin held by this group has decreased from 3.537 million to 3.5 million. The monthly accumulation rate, which was 2.7% in March, has dropped to 0.5%. Investor sentiment remains weak, with CryptoQuant's Boğa Skoru Endeksi (Bullish Score Index) currently at 20. The model, which scores between 0 and 100, has been below 50 for 58 out of the last 60 days. This indicates that investors are not yet confident enough for a strong and sustainable upward trend. Despite this, Bitcoin rose to over $87,500 on the first day of the week, starting a short-term relief rally. Analysts agree that the sustainability of the rise depends on increased investor interest and institutional participation.

**Bitcoin Is Struggling In 2025 As Gold Clocks New All-Time High But Here Is The Full Picture - Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) Common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:BTC)**
Gold prices reached an all-time high on Monday, driven by President Donald Trump's tariff threat, while Bitcoin struggled, falling 4.48% in the last 24 hours. Spot gold rose to $2,956 per ounce, while gold futures climbed to an intraday high of 2,970.39. Gold has gained 12.3% year-to-date and 44% over the last 12 months. In contrast, Bitcoin has lost 3.03% of its value year-to-date and has struggled to keep pace with gold's rise. According to Peter Schiff, a gold bug and Bitcoin critic, 'Instead of 2025 beginning a golden age for Bitcoin, it looks like it will just be a golden age.' Despite this, Bitcoin has surpassed gold in terms of annual returns, rising more than 76% compared to gold's 44% returns.

**How Price of Bitcoin Could Close In February As Rising Cycles Continue**
Despite a temporary dip in price, Bitcoin's realized market capitalization has reached a new all-time high of $857 Billion, indicating the continuation of the bull cycle. The rise in realized market capitalization suggests that new entrants are purchasing Bitcoin released by long-term holders who profited from earlier acquisitions at lower prices. Historically, the movement of Bitcoin among long-term investors indicates that the market peak is yet to be reached, offering room for further growth. However, the accumulation of high market leverage poses a risk of volatile price swings, potentially leading to a downward price flush or an upward price squeeze. Analyzing BTC's historical February performance, there is a potential continuation of a red close for February 2025, which would be the third such instance in its history. However, historical data also notes that Bitcoin's behavior in February was variable, with some years seeing significant gains. Therefore, stakeholders should prepare for possible sharp movements for the price of Bitcoin as the month transitions.

**DeepSeek Revises Bitcoin Forecast for 2025**
DeepSeek, a Chinese AI platform, has revised its forecast for the price of Bitcoin by the end of 2025. Initially, they estimated that Bitcoin would close 2025 at around $210,000. However, after a recent downturn, they now predict that Bitcoin will close the year at around $198,000, which is $12,000 less than their previous estimate. This change in forecast comes after Bitcoin's recent decline, which has erased almost all of its annual gains. Despite this, DeepSeek's analysis still suggests that Bitcoin will end the year with a 2.6% increase. According to DeepSeek, the factors that influenced their revised forecast include the 2024 halving, institutional adoption, and the existence of Bitcoin ETFs, as well as geopolitical risks and Donald Trump's financial strategy.

**Bitcoin (BTC) to Mirror Gold and Silver's Path to New All-Time Highs in 2025**
The prices of gold and silver are currently rising, with gold up 11% since the start of the year, reaching $285 in gains. The weekly chart shows gold making higher highs and higher lows, with the Stochastic RSI trending up. The 2-week chart indicates a potential cup and handle pattern, with a measured move to $3,000 and a Fibonacci level of $3,300. Silver has broken out of a triangle, but still needs to make a new local higher high. However, the horizontal supports are strong, and the Stochastic RSI suggests there is still room for the price to rise. The article suggests that Bitcoin will likely follow gold and silver's upsurge, and potentially outstrip them due to its scarcer supply. The author believes that the rest of this year has the potential to be one of the most exciting times in financial history.

**Investing Experts Predict How High (or Low) Bitcoin Will Go in 2025**
Investing experts predict that Bitcoin will continue to grow in 2025, with some predicting a new all-time high of $200,000 or more. The experts attribute this growth to institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and increasing investing opportunities. However, some also predict a major correction in Bitcoin, with prices potentially falling to $70,000 or $80,000. The experts include Sidney Powell, CEO of Maple Finance, who believes that institutional adoption and optimism for regulatory clarity will drive a bull market moment, and Johnny Gabriele, head analyst of blockchain economics at The Lifted Initiative, who predicts that a Bitcoin national reserve could lead to a buying frenzy and a price of $250,000 to $500,000.

**3 Undeniable Reasons Bitcoin Could Go Higher and Higher in 2025 | The Motley Fool**
Bitcoin is expected to continue its upward trend in 2025 due to several factors. Firstly, the increasing liquidity in the global financial system, driven by lower interest rates, will benefit Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and China's central bank have all cut interest rates, leading to a surge in liquidity. Secondly, the growing acceptance of Bitcoin by governments, including the possibility of creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) in the US, will increase its legitimacy and value. Finally, Bitcoin's reputation as a store of value, similar to gold, is gaining traction, and its image is improving. As a result, it will become more accepted as an investment and potentially as a medium of exchange, leading to higher prices.

**3 Undeniable Reasons Bitcoin Could Go Higher and Higher in 2025**
Despite a 46% rise in the past three months, Bitcoin is expected to continue its upward trend in 2025 due to several tailwinds. Firstly, increasing liquidity in the global financial system is expected to benefit Bitcoin. As interest rates are cut by major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and China's central bank, more capital will be available for investment, leading to higher liquidity. This is a bullish sign for Bitcoin, as it will make it easier for investors to acquire and deploy capital. Secondly, the cryptocurrency industry is expected to gain more acceptance from global governments, which could lead to increased adoption and higher prices. As one expert might say, 'The writing is on the wall' for Bitcoin's continued growth in 2025.
