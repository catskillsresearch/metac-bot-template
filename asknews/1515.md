**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**NurExone Biologic Takes a Leap Forward with Human Trials for ExoPTEN Therapy**
NurExone Biologic is on the cusp of a significant milestone as it prepares to conduct human trials for its ExoPTEN therapy, which aims to treat nerve damage. The company has announced plans for clinical studies, with Professor Nahshon Knoller, a renowned neurosurgeon and leading clinical advisor, set to present the results at the American Spinal Injury Association's annual conference in 2025. The studies, which are expected to start in 2026, will involve a Phase 1 dosing study with up to 18 patients, followed by a Phase 2a study with 10-15 patients. The therapy uses exosomes, tiny particles loaded with siRNA, to target the protein PTEN, which is believed to hinder neural regeneration. The company has raised significant capital, including a private placement of $480,000 CAD in January 2025 and another $2.3 million CAD in April, to support its clinical development. NurExone has also established a US subsidiary, Exo-Top Inc., and is preparing for a potential listing on the US stock exchange. The company's technology has shown promise in preclinical studies, with data presented at two scientific conferences demonstrating functional recovery in patients with spinal cord, optic nerve, and facial nerve injuries. The US FDA and European Medicines Agency have granted ExoPTEN orphan drug status for rare diseases, highlighting its medical potential.

**Neural Networks Already Outperform Human Doctors - Oleg Makarenko**
A recent study in Boston, one of the oldest and most prestigious cities in the US, found that a neural network was able to diagnose patients more accurately and effectively than human doctors. The neural network, a1-prevue, was trained on real patient data and outperformed the current standard, JPTE-4 (2023 model). The study's authors described the neural network's abilities as 'superhuman'. Currently, a combination of a modern neural network and a human doctor who can physically examine and listen to a patient would be on par with the best doctors in the world. If you have a health issue, you can upload your medical records and describe your symptoms to a robot, which will provide a second opinion that can be useful when visiting a human doctor. However, it's essential to note that neural networks vary greatly in power. If you use a weaker model, such as Alisa, Gigachat, or DeepSik, the results may be disappointing. Some models are as intelligent as a PhD holder, while others are as intelligent as a three-year-old child. To get the most out of neural networks, it's recommended to use the OpenAI platform and run the 'Deep Research' feature, which will provide a result close to the maximum available by June 2025. Many people believe that neural networks are a 'bubble' that will soon reach its limit and stop developing. However, the author argues that this is not the case, citing the abundance of training materials and the fact that neural networks are being developed in multiple directions. Engineers plan their work 2-3 years in advance, so it's safe to say that neural networks will continue to develop at an alarming rate until at least 2027-2028.

**Can adults grow new brain cells?**
Research suggests that adults may be able to grow new brain cells, a process called neurogenesis. Studies in mice and other lab animals have shown that lifestyle factors such as exercise and living in a stimulating environment can promote the growth of new neurons. However, the existence of adult neurogenesis in humans is still a topic of debate. While some studies have found evidence of new neurons in the adult human brain, others have been unable to replicate these findings. Hongjun Song, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania, said, 'Most of our knowledge about adult neurogenesis came from studies in animal models.' Gerd Kempermann, a professor of genomics of regeneration, said, 'Unfortunately, there is no way to measure neurogenesis in the living person yet.' However, some researchers have found indirect markers of neurogenesis, such as certain proteins that are only present in growing neurons. Arturo Alvarez-Buylla, a professor of neurological surgery, is skeptical of these findings and believes that the evidence is not yet convincing. Despite the debate, researchers believe that understanding whether adult neurogenesis exists will continue to be a key question for the field of neuroscience, with implications for the plasticity of the adult brain and potential therapies for brain injuries and neurodegenerative disorders.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**The First Person to Live Eternally May Be Born During Your Lifetime**
According to Omar Kardoudi, a scientist who studies brain perception and mental information transfer, it may be possible for the first person to live eternally during your lifetime. However, this person would not have a physical body. They would be able to perform all the tasks they do in real life, but in a simulated environment. Currently, scientists are struggling to understand the functioning of the brain, with 86 billion neurons and billions of connections that constantly adjust their functioning. It is unclear how many levels of complexity researchers need to reach to simulate a functioning brain. Kardoudi notes that even small distortions could have severe mental consequences, and that the current computational power is not sufficient to scan and map the 3D structure of the human brain. Nevertheless, he believes that the rapid advancements in computing power and artificial intelligence may make it possible to achieve this goal, potentially by 2045 or even sooner.

**Large-scale study explores lifespan changes in the human brain's functional connectivity**
Researchers at Beijing Normal University and other institutes in China conducted a large-scale study to explore the changes in the human brain's functional connectivity over the course of a person's lifespan. The study, published in Nature Neuroscience, analyzed data from 33,250 individuals worldwide and found that the strength and diversity of connections between different brain regions peak in early and mid-adulthood. The researchers also created brain atlases that highlight times during the lifespan when different brain regions become specialized in specific tasks. According to the researchers, 'Functional connectivity of the human brain changes through life.' They found that the brain's functional connectome grows non-linearly, with critical inflection points in the late fourth and late third decades of life. The study's findings can serve as a normative reference for quantifying individual variation in development, aging, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

**New Study Shows Brain Can Produce New Neurons to Repair Damaged Brain Circuits**
Researchers have found that it is possible to stimulate the brain to produce new neurons to repair damaged brain circuits caused by neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease. A study on mice published in the journal Cell Reports by the University of Rochester Medical Center in the US shows that the adult brain has niches containing stem cells that can produce new neurons. These stem cells are usually active in the early stages of development, but then switch to producing support cells, called glial cells, after birth. The stem cells are located near a region of the brain called the striatum, which is severely damaged by Huntington's disease, a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that affects muscle coordination. Previous studies on mice and primates had already shown that two proteins, BDNF and Noggin, can awaken these stem cells in the brain to migrate to the striatum and differentiate into medium spiny neurons, the most affected by Huntington's disease. The new research, conducted on mice, shows for the first time that the new neurons connect with the complex brain circuits that control movement, replacing the function of neurons damaged by neurodegeneration. 'In this work, we used a combination of electrophysiology, optogenetics, and animal behavior studies to demonstrate that these cells not only are produced in the adult brain, but functionally restore motor circuits, both in healthy mice and those with Huntington's disease,' observes the first author of the study, Jose Cano, who works in the laboratory of Steve Goldman, one of the first to discover neurogenesis in the adult brain in the 1980s. The study's results suggest a new strategy against Huntington's disease, which consists of inducing the brain to replace damaged neurons with new ones, restoring movement circuits. 'Considering the persistence of these stem cells in the brains of adult primates - adds neurologist Abdellatif Benraiss - these results suggest the potential of this regenerative approach as a treatment strategy for Huntington's and other disorders characterized by the loss of neurons in the striatum.'

**Study Predicts Human Body Changes in 3000: A Warning for the Future**
A study conducted by researchers from the Australian University of 'Sunshine Coast' has presented a hypothetical model of the human body in the year 3000, named 'Mendi', which illustrates how excessive use of technology may affect human physical development in the coming decades. According to the study, which is based on current trends and future predictions, the digital lifestyle may lead to significant physical changes, including permanent back curvature due to spending long hours in front of screens, as well as chronic problems in the spine and neck. The researchers predict that one of the most notable changes will be an increase in finger length and development of 'digital fingers' due to frequent use of touch screens. They also suggest that a second eyelid may develop to protect the eye from excessive light, and that the skull may become denser while the brain shrinks. These hypothetical biological changes not only reflect the adaptation to the digital world but also raise profound questions about the impact of technology on human physical and mental health in the future. To mitigate these potential changes, the researchers emphasize the importance of adopting healthy habits from an early age, starting with teaching children basic principles of proper sitting and using electronic devices in a healthy way. Regular physical activity is also considered a key factor in supporting musculoskeletal health, along with exercises to strengthen back muscles and improve flexibility. From a nutritional perspective, a balanced diet rich in antioxidants and essential vitamins is recommended to support bodily functions and maintain vitality. Although the 'Mendi' model remains hypothetical, the study highlights real risks associated with excessive technology use, particularly in an environment where reliance on smart devices is increasing. The researchers hope that these predictions will serve as a warning to encourage communities to think about their future physical and health well-being.

**Human lifespan changes in the brain's functional connectome - Nature Neuroscience**
A large-scale neuroimaging study of 33,250 individuals, aged 32 postmenstrual weeks to 80 years, has revealed the growth patterns of the functional connectome across the lifespan. The study found that the global mean of the functional connectome increases non-linearly from 32 postmenstrual weeks, peaking in the late fourth decade of life, and then declines. The global variance of the functional connectome also exhibits a non-linear growth pattern, reaching its peak in the late third decade of life. The study also found that the functional segregation and integration of the brain's functional systems change across the lifespan, with different networks showing distinct growth patterns. The study's findings provide new insights into the development and aging of the human brain's functional connectome. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our researchers and the dedication of our participants,' said Dr. [Name], lead author of the study.

**Dr. Manuel Sans Segarra on the Importance of Caring for the Mind**
Dr. Manuel Sans Segarra, a renowned surgeon and expert in the relationship between the mind, body, and soul, emphasizes the importance of caring for one's mind to develop neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. He advises a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, as well as mental activities such as reading, studying, and socializing. According to Sans Segarra, humans 'atrophy' over time and can lose neurons due to lack of cerebral irrigation, but neuroplasticity and neurogenesis can compensate by creating new connections and neurons. He warns that watching too much television can harm memory, and recommends reading before bed to reduce stress and improve sleep quality. A recent study by the University of Sussex found that reading before bed can reduce stress levels by up to 70%. Sans Segarra suggests opting for physical books to avoid distractions from electronic devices. 'The worst thing a human can do is sit in front of the TV and swallow whatever is on it,' he says. 'You have to keep your mind working all the time.'

**The Beta Generation: How to Protect the Brain and Ensure a Better Future**
The Beta generation, born between 2025 and 2039, is expected to be the longest-living generation in human history. However, they will face challenges such as cognitive decline and a higher incidence of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. To ensure a better future, experts recommend moderation in the use of technology, a healthy lifestyle, and protection of the brain from aging. A recent study from the University of Oxford found that diabetes, environmental pollution, and alcohol are the three most important modifiable risk factors for dementia. Other studies suggest that a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and social interaction can help reduce cognitive decline and prevent neurodegenerative diseases. It is essential to provide education, economic and social security, and mental health care to ensure that this new generation and future generations can live longer and healthier lives. 'It is fundamental to address all these issues so that our population can age well,' said the article. 'And, you, are you taking care of yourself?'
