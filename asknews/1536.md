**Scientists Discover New Evidence of Intermediate-Mass Black Holes' Origin**
Scientists have discovered new evidence of the origin of intermediate-mass black holes. The study, led by Dr. Karan Jani, director of the Vanderbilt Lunar Labs Initiative, found that gravitational waves detected by the LIGO and Virgo detectors were caused by the merger of black holes with masses 100-300 times that of the Sun, the largest collision of black holes ever recorded. According to Jani, 'black holes are like cosmic fossils that contain the keys to understanding the early universe.' The recent discovery of a group of black holes in this analysis provides a unique opportunity to learn more about the first stars that formed after the Big Bang. However, the current detectors can only capture a brief moment of the final collision of these 'lighter' intermediate-mass black holes, making it difficult to understand how they form. To learn more, Jani's lab is focusing on the future LISA mission, a space project by the European Space Agency and NASA, scheduled to launch in the late 2030s. Two additional studies published in the Astrophysical Journal demonstrated that the LISA mission can track intermediate-mass black holes for years before their merger, providing new insights into their origin, evolution, and fate. The researchers noted that the detection of gravitational waves requires extraordinary precision, comparable to hearing a pin drop during a hurricane. This work confirms the idea that intermediate-mass black holes are one of the most important sources for gravitational wave detectors on Earth and in space. Each new discovery helps scientists better understand where these black holes come from and why they exist in this unusual mass range. The team plans to investigate how lunar detectors can help observe intermediate-mass black holes in the future. Access to lower-frequency gravitational waves from the lunar surface can help identify the environments where these black holes exist, which cannot be achieved by ground-based detectors. Jani said, 'This is an exciting time not only for the study of black holes but also for the combination of scientific research with a new era of space and lunar exploration. This provides a rare opportunity to teach the next generation of students whose discoveries will depend on the Moon and be conducted from it.'

**Business News | India's Health Insurance Sector Faces Growth and Profitability Challenges: Report | LatestLY**
India's health insurance industry, previously considered a strong growth story, is now facing serious structural challenges. A recent report by Elara Capital highlights that both growth and profitability in the sector are being affected, which may redefine the long-term potential of health insurers in the country. The report notes that the overestimation of the total addressable market (TAM) for private insurers, the expansion of government-sponsored health schemes, and increasing competition are key reasons behind the slowdown. Additionally, the entry of LIC into the health insurance segment and rising costs of claims, including higher claim frequency and severity, are putting additional pressure on insurers. The report advises investors to lower their long-term expectations for broad-based growth in the health insurance sector and focus on more resilient areas such as third-party administrators (TPAs) and diversified multi-line private general insurers.

**Four Prophets Predict Start of Third World War by End of 2025**
Four renowned prophets have predicted the start of the Third World War by the end of 2025. According to New York Post, Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian seer Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicholas Ouley have independently predicted a massive conflict that could change the course of human history. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has predicted the 9/11 attacks, the death of Princess Diana, and recent earthquakes caused by climate change. She also predicted the start of war in Europe this year, which she sees as the beginning of 'humanity's downfall' and a global catastrophe for the planet's population. Nostradamus, in his 'Prophecies' of 1555, also made ominous predictions, including the rise of Adolf Hitler and the COVID-19 pandemic. This time, he warns that the UK will be drawn into brutal wars. He wrote: 'When those in European lands see England establish its throne behind, its flanks will be beset by brutal wars. The kingdom will be marked by wars so brutal that enemies from within and without will rise up.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian seer, also warns of an inevitable global conflict. According to his prophecy, the Third World War will be especially dangerous due to the use of new technologies, cyber weapons, and machines. He says: 'This is not just a war of people, but a war of machines, and what will happen next? The worst is yet to come.' Nicholas Ouley, a 38-year-old London hypnotherapist, adds that the war may start as early as mid-2025. He attributes this to 'a lack of compassion in the world', which provokes terrible acts of violence and hatred in the name of religion and nationalism. According to his prophecy, humanity will face unprecedented brutality and senselessness. All these terrifying predictions coincide with the current tense geopolitical situation. In late May 2025, Pakistan and India exchanged rocket attacks on military targets, leading to US calls for negotiations to stop the escalation of the conflict. Although the parties agreed to a ceasefire, it was violated within hours in the Kashmir region. Meanwhile, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has claimed the lives of at least seven people in recent weeks due to massive rocket and drone attacks on Kiev and other regions. These events demonstrate the high level of tension and seriousness of the situation. Experts in the field of technology also warn of the danger posed by uncontrolled development of artificial intelligence, comparing it to nuclear weapons in terms of potential threat. This idea resonates with Atos Salome's warning about the 'machine war' of the future.

**GST@8: Much done, some food for thought**
India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime has evolved over the last eight years, becoming a dynamic and efficient framework. GST collections have hit a record high of Rs. 2.37 lakh crores in April 2025, demonstrating the system's growing efficiencies. The introduction of the GSTN portal has streamlined tax filings and empowered authorities with data, driving businesses to adopt technology. As India continues to grow as an economic powerhouse, five key areas require attention to transcend limitations in the present laws: making GST credit fungible, introducing the group concept, smoothing the refund environment, and improving instructions and training for revenue authorities. These changes will enable granular insights, predictive risk modeling, and real-time anomaly detection, setting the stage for a virtually boundless future in tax administration. 'The GSTN processes millions of transactions daily, and these volumes are set to increase with optional line level B2C reporting on the anvil,' according to the article. 'Predictive risk modeling and real-time anomaly detection are set to become the cornerstone of a virtually boundless future in tax administration,' it adds.

**India to Surpass Japan as Third-Largest Economy, but Challenges Remain**
India is expected to surpass Japan as the third-largest economy by the end of 2025, according to the IMF. However, the country's per capita income is similar to that of Bangladesh. The Indian government has been celebrating this achievement, with President Emmanuel Macron of France supporting India's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. However, the country's economic growth has not translated to improved living standards for the majority of its population, with 80% of Indians still relying on rationing cards. The Indian government faces significant challenges, including creating 200 million jobs in the next decade and addressing climate change, which could see the city of Bombay underwater by 2050. Despite these challenges, the Indian stock market has seen significant growth, with the Sensex index increasing by 3.75% this year. An anonymous employee of the World Bank notes that while the Indian government has made improvements in infrastructure and digitalization, corruption remains a significant issue.

**IIT-Bombay astronomers hunt for light from biggest explosions in space**
A team of scientists from IIT-Bombay, led by Professor Varun Bhalerao, is searching the skies for flashes of light from the collision of black holes and neutron stars. These events are among the most violent in the universe, and the team hopes to find clues that could change our understanding of space. While detectors like LIGO can pick up gravitational waves from these events, spotting light is far harder. The team used India's space telescope AstroSat to look for X-rays from 70 known gravitational wave events, but so far, they haven't spotted any flashes. However, even these 'misses' help set limits on how bright such explosions might be, sharpening future predictions. As Prof. Bhalerao said, 'The universe is the most extreme physics laboratory. Looking for light from black hole collisions challenges what we think we know -- and could lead to surprises.' With upcoming facilities like LIGO India and the Daksha mission, scientists are hopeful that more data may finally shed light on these dark cosmic events.

**Listening for the Future: How a Black Hole Collision on May 14, 2025, Could Reveal a Hidden...**
On May 14, 2025, a cosmic event occurred where two black holes collided, sending ripples through space that were captured by giant detectors like LIGO and Virgo. This event, named GW250514, was used to test the Dual Sheet Model (DSM), which suggests that our universe, Sheet 1, has a hidden twin, Sheet 2, where time might run backward. Scientists are designing an experiment to look for echoes from the future, strange particle behavior, and even hints in our own brains. The DSM predicts that events like GW250514 could send messages between the sheets, even backward in time, because of Sheet 2's reversed time flow. The experiment will look for three signs of the DSM: a predictive ripple, strange behavior in tiny particles, and changes in our brains. If evidence of the DSM is found, it could change everything, revealing a hidden universe and its connection to our own.

**Episode 46: This week in India's science: 14 April 2025**
India has made significant strides in science this week, with the government approving the construction of LIGO-India, a ₹1600 crore observatory that will detect gravitational waves. Astrophysicist Somak Raychaudhury said, 'LIGO India is important, not just because it will be another gravitational wave detector, but a network of gravitational wave detectors around the world is very, very necessary.' Scientists are also recognizing the importance of working with Indigenous communities in conservation, rather than just lecturing them. Apoorva Kulkarni said, 'Science can't work alone. These communities are nature's real protectors.' Archaeologists have also made a new discovery about the origins of farming in South Asia, finding that it began around 5200 BCE, 2,500 years later than previously thought. This suggests that early farmers in the Indus Valley may have learned farming from neighbours in Iran or Central Asia.

**Scientists Develop New Technology to Enhance Gravitational Wave Detectors**
Scientists at the University of California have developed a new optical technology that significantly expands the capabilities of gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO. The new technology aims to solve one of the key problems facing such observatories, namely achieving laser power levels exceeding 1 megawatt, which far surpasses the current capabilities of LIGO. Researchers have developed a new approach to adaptive optics with low noise and high resolution, which can correct distortions in the main 40-kilogram mirrors of LIGO caused by laser power increase due to heating. This breakthrough opens the way to creating gravitational wave detectors that can work with extremely high levels of laser power. According to Jonathan Richardson, associate professor of physics and astronomy, 'Gravitational waves represent a new way of observing the universe. They occur when massive objects in the universe accelerate or collide, creating distortions in the fabric of spacetime. These waves carry information about extreme astrophysical objects, such as black holes, and the physics underlying the nature of spacetime.' LIGO, one of the largest scientific installations in the world, consists of two 4-kilometer-long laser interferometers located in Washington state and near Baton Rouge (Louisiana). These observatories work in tandem, 'listening' for any distortions in spacetime that may propagate through the Earth as a gravitational wave. To date, LIGO has detected around 200 events of collision and merger of compact objects of stellar mass. The new technology, developed in Richardson's laboratory, is designed to provide accurate optical corrections directly on the main mirrors of the LIGO interferometers. The instrument is located just a few centimeters in front of the reflecting surface of these mirrors and projects a correcting infrared radiation with very low noise onto the front surface of the mirror. This is the first prototype of a new approach using optical principles that have never been applied in the detection of gravitational waves before. The study also has significant implications for the future Cosmic Explorer project - a concept for a next-generation gravitational wave observatory after LIGO. Cosmic Explorer will be 10 times larger than LIGO, with 40-kilometer-long interferometric arms, making it the largest scientific instrument. At the planned sensitivity, these detectors will be able to observe the universe at earlier times than the formation of the first stars, when the age of the universe was about 0.1% of its current age in 14 billion years. The new technology promises to answer some of the deepest questions in physics and cosmology, such as the speed of the universe's expansion and the true nature of black holes. Currently, there are two conflicting measurements of the local speed of the universe's expansion, which may potentially be resolved using gravitational waves. In addition, gravitational waves will provide high-precision measurements of the detailed dynamics around the event horizons of black holes, allowing for direct tests of classical general relativity and alternative theories.

**Scientists Develop Method to Increase Sensitivity of Gravitational Wave Detectors by 1000 Times**
Scientists from the University of California have developed an innovative optical method that can significantly expand the functionality of gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO. This technology focuses on solving key problems that such observatories face, including achieving laser power exceeding one megawatt, which is significantly higher than the current capabilities of such installations. Researchers have developed a pioneering method of adaptive optics with minimal noise and high resolution. This method allows for the elimination of distortions on the main mirrors of LIGO, weighing 40 kilograms, caused by thermal effects when increasing laser power. This discovery paves the way for the creation of gravitational wave detectors capable of operating at very high levels of laser power. According to Dr. Jonathan Richardson, a lecturer in physics and astronomy, gravitational waves open up a new way of observing the universe. They are formed by the acceleration or collision of massive cosmic objects, which distort space-time. These waves carry information about extreme astrophysical objects, such as black holes, and about the fundamental laws underlying physical reality. LIGO, one of the largest scientific installations in the world, includes two 4-kilometer-long laser interferometers located in Washington state and near Baton Rouge in Louisiana. Both observatories work in coordination, 'listening' for any disturbance to the structure of space-time, passing through the Earth as a gravitational wave. Currently, LIGO has recorded approximately 200 events related to the merger and collision of compact objects of stellar mass. The new technology developed in Richardson's laboratory provides precise optical correction directly on the main mirrors of LIGO's interferometers. The instrument is located just a few centimeters from the surface of the mirror and projects a correcting infrared radiation with an ultralow noise level onto it. This is the first prototype of a new method based on optical principles, previously not used for registering gravitational waves. The study also has significance for the future Cosmic Explorer project - a concept for a next-generation gravitational wave observatory after LIGO. Cosmic Explorer will be 10 times larger than LIGO with 40-kilometer-long interferometric arms, making it the largest scientific instrument. With the proposed sensitivity, these detectors will be able to explore the universe in the era before the emergence of the first stars, when the age of the universe was only about 0.1% of its current age of 14 billion years. The new technology promises to push the resolution of some of the deepest mysteries in physics and cosmology, such as the speed of the universe's expansion and the true nature of black holes. Currently, there are two conflicting measurements of the local speed of the universe's expansion, which can be refuted using gravitational waves. In addition, gravitational waves will provide accurate data on the dynamics near the event horizons of black holes, allowing for experimental verification of classical general relativity and alternative physical theories.
