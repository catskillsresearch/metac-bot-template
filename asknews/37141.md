**Measles cases have now spread to 30 states**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,024 cases of measles across the U.S., with 14 outbreaks in 30 states. The majority of cases have been reported in Texas, with 722 confirmed cases, and New Mexico has the second-highest number of cases. According to the CDC, 13% of cases have resulted in hospitalization, and there have been three deaths. The American Public Health Association has criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for promoting 'unscientific theories' and downplaying the significance of the measles resurgence. Kennedy has since endorsed the MMR vaccine as the 'most effective way to prevent the spread' of measles.

**Measles Outbreak Spreads to 30 US States, Chicago Activates Health Alert**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed over 1,000 cases of measles since March 2025, with the outbreak centered in Texas and spreading to at least 30 states. Chicago has activated a health alert after a possible case was reported at O'Hare International Airport, one of the country's busiest airports. According to the Daily Mail, a person infected with the virus was at Terminal 1 of the airport between April 22 and 23, exposing hundreds of people to the virus. The person was isolated at home after diagnosis and later voluntarily admitted to a local hospital on April 28. The outbreak has also affected other public spaces in Chicago, including a public library, a healthy food restaurant, and two gas stations. Authorities have asked those who came into contact with the patient to consult their doctors and monitor for symptoms. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread through the air and remain active for hours, with symptoms including high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a characteristic rash. The spread of the virus has been fueled by vaccine hesitancy, with some communities and public figures contributing to the misinformation. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current US Secretary of Health, has been criticized for his past anti-vaccine rhetoric, despite stating in a Senate hearing on January 29 that 'I will not do anything as Secretary of Health that would discourage or dissuade people from receiving any of those vaccines.' However, the US has reduced funding for these programs.

**US surpasses 1,000 measles cases, Texas reports low count of new cases**
The United States has surpassed 1,000 cases of measles, according to Telemundo, despite Texas reporting one of its lowest counts of new confirmed cases since the outbreak began three months ago. Texas still concentrates the majority of cases in the US, with 709 confirmed cases as of Friday in an outbreak that has also spread measles to New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Two unvaccinated elementary school children died from measles-related illnesses in the epicenter of western Texas, and an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico died from a measles-related illness. Other states with active outbreaks (defined by the CDC as three or more related cases) include Indiana, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. 'We are concerned that the virus is spreading in communities with low vaccination rates,' said Dr. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary of Health. 'We fear that the spread of the virus may continue for a year.' The measles virus is highly contagious and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. It can be prevented by vaccination and is considered eradicated in the US since 2000. As the virus takes hold in US communities with low vaccination rates, health experts worry that the spread may continue for a year. In Texas, there are a total of 709 cases in 29 counties, mostly in the western part of the state, reported by state health authorities on Friday. The state confirmed only seven new cases since its update on Tuesday. The state also added a hospitalization to its count, for a total of 92 during the outbreak. Health authorities estimated that around 1% of cases (less than 10) are contagious. The 57% of cases in Texas are concentrated in Gaines County, with a population of 22,892, where the virus began to spread in an unvaccinated and closely-knit community. The county has registered 403 cases since late January, representing more than 1.7% of its residents. The death on April 3 in Texas was that of an 8-year-old child, according to Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health authorities reported that the child had no underlying conditions and died from 'what his doctor described as measles-induced respiratory failure.' An unvaccinated child without underlying conditions died of measles in Texas at the end of February; Kennedy indicated that the child was 6 years old. New Mexico added four cases on Friday, for a total of 71. Seven people have been hospitalized since the start of the outbreak. Most cases in the state are located in Lea County. Three cases are in Eddy County, two in Doña Ana County, and one in Chaves County. Curry County registered its first case this week. An unvaccinated adult died on March 6 due to a measles-related illness. The person did not seek medical attention.

**Measles Outbreak: New Jersey Investigates Possible Mass Exposure at Shakira Concert**
The New Jersey Department of Health is investigating a possible mass exposure to measles at a Shakira concert held at the MetLife stadium in East Rutherford. A person with measles attended the concert on May 15, and the health department is warning those who may have been exposed to contact their doctor before seeking medical attention. The department is also urging the public to stay up-to-date with vaccinations. According to the CDC, there have been 111 new measles cases in the US this year, surpassing the peak of 102 cases in 2019. The majority of cases are concentrated in a current outbreak in Texas and neighboring states. As of now, at least 935 cases of measles have been confirmed in the US this year, with over 1,000 cases reported in Canada. The high hospitalization rate and unusual severity of the current outbreak suggest that many mild cases may be going undetected. 'We recommend that anyone who believes they may have been exposed to measles contact their healthcare provider before seeking medical attention,' said the health department. 'It's also essential to stay up-to-date with vaccinations to prevent the spread of the virus.'

**Andalusia Reports 79 Cases of Measles, Reinforces Vaccination Measures**
Andalusia has reported 79 cases of measles, with two new cases added this week. The regional health department has called for increased vigilance and vaccination to control the outbreak. Although the situation is 'not concerning', effective control of the virus requires immunization. The two new cases are a 33-year-old man from Almería and a one-year-old girl from Huércal-Overa, who had received one dose of the triple viral vaccine. Authorities have implemented measures such as advancing the second dose of the vaccine to 15 months and offering vaccination to adults who are not previously immunized or unsure if they have had the disease. An active search is being conducted for vulnerable groups who are not protected against this preventable disease. The 24% of cases are imported, mainly from Morocco, while 20 cases are isolated and of unknown origin. The profile of the affected shows that 8 cases are under one year old, 33% are under 15 years old, and 67% are adults between 15 and 70 years old. Only 4% of cases had a documented history of vaccination with one dose, while the rest were not vaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. 32% of the affected required hospitalization. As of 2025, there have been 13 outbreaks declared, with 7 still active and 6 closed. Health authorities continue to monitor the situation and reinforce vaccination campaigns as the main strategy to contain the virus.

**Coahuila Confirms Five Measles Cases, Increases Surveillance**
Coahuila has confirmed five cases of measles, four of which are minors and one adult. According to state officials, two of the minors are from Zacatecas and presented symptoms while in Torreón, resulting in positive test results; the rest are located in Piedras Negras. Juan Roberto Baeza Díaz, head of Jurisdicción Sanitaria 01, stated that over the weekend, three cases were confirmed in the Texas border municipality: two minors and an adult who is a relative of one of the affected children, with four more cases suspected. 'When we detect or are notified of suspected cases, we activate the epidemiological plan and start sampling family members and conducting sweeps in nearby homes and streets,' he said. Martha Alicia Romero Reyna, subdirector of Prevention of Health in the state, noted that the two minors treated in Torreón are under observation for follow-up. The medical staff of the Ministry of Health has been instructed to increase surveillance for detection of cases. Iván Alejandro Moscoso González, subsecretary of Health in Coahuila, stated that having many suspected cases does not mean there is a problem, but rather that all units are actively searching, which has allowed them to locate cases that may not be measles, but other illnesses, and possibly some positive cases.' The health authorities in Coahuila are maintaining special observation in the municipalities on the Texas border, where a outbreak with over 700 cases has been detected, resulting in the deaths of two unvaccinated minors.

**Measles outbreak in Texas hits 481 cases, with 59 new infections confirmed in last 3 days**
A measles outbreak in western Texas has reached 481 cases, with 59 new infections confirmed in the last three days, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). Almost all cases are in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status. Children and teenagers between ages 5 and 17 make up the majority of cases, with 180 cases, followed by children ages 4 and under, who account for 157 cases. Singh, a spokesperson for the DSHS, said, 'Our greatest defense against the infection is vaccination.' She emphasized the importance of education on vaccination and encouraged families to consult with their pediatricians if they think their child needs a vaccine or is due for an additional dose. The CDC has confirmed 607 measles cases in at least 21 states, with 97% of cases in people who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Singh noted that having more than double the cases in just the first three months of 2025 is 'of significant concern' and attributed it to declining vaccine rates, both domestically and internationally. She also mentioned that many cases are coming from international travel. 'This is an unfortunate part of just declining vaccine rates, not just within the country, but internationally as well,' Singh said. 'Our greatest defense against the infection is vaccination.'

**Texas Measles outbreak 2025: 124 cases identified**
A measles outbreak in Texas has grown to 124 cases across 9 counties, with 18 people hospitalized. State health officials say the outbreak is the largest in nearly 30 years. Five of the reported cases were in patients who were vaccinated, while the rest were in unvaccinated people or those whose vaccination status was unknown. Dr. Philip Huang with Dallas County Health and Human Services said the outbreak is a concern due to the low vaccination rate in some communities, such as the Mennonite community in Lubbock County, where only 20% of the population is vaccinated. Health officials are monitoring for exposure and encouraging people to get two doses of the measles vaccine, which is 97% effective. 'They have this really large community of Mennonites, I think 25,000 or so, of which many are unvaccinated. Something like only 20% vaccination rate. So that's what, you know, really makes that community so vulnerable because the vaccine is so effective,' Dr. Huang said.
