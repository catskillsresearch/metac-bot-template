**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Gateway: A New Era of Space Exploration**
Scientists are proposing a new era of space exploration, with the lunar-orbiting station 'Gateway' serving as a key element. The station, which will rotate around the Moon, not the Earth, offers new possibilities for missions to Mars and the mysterious dwarf planet Ceres. According to researchers, 'Gateway' can be a 'transit hub' for missions to other planets, allowing for more efficient use of resources. The station will also serve as a testing ground for technologies that will be used in deep space missions. The researchers, Malaya Kumar Biswal and Ramesh Kumar V., propose a combined mission to Mars and Ceres, which would allow for the optimization of resources and the exploration of two objects in one 'journey'. The planned timeline is between 2040 and 2050. However, the researchers acknowledge that the realization of such ambitious plans is fraught with difficulties, including risk management, significant financial investments, and the need for a major technological breakthrough. Nevertheless, the creation of 'Gateway' is a bold step towards establishing a sustainable infrastructure for deep space exploration. An international consortium, including NASA, ESA, JAXA, CSA, and the UAE Space Centre, is already working on the first modules of the station, with the energy and living modules scheduled to be sent to the Moon in 2027.

**Elon Musk say it's '50/50' he'll land on Mars next year and he needs to 'get lucky' - Daily Star**
Elon Musk says there is a '50/50 chance' of landing a spaceship on Mars next year, and he needs to 'get lucky'. Despite recent test flight failures, Musk remains optimistic about progress towards establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. He believes reusable rockets will enable more than a million people to live on Mars within 30 years. Musk hopes to send 20 ships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with the goal of building a self-sufficient city that could survive even if cut off from Earth. He is scouting possible sites for a Mars city, with Arcadia Planitia being the leading candidate. Musk aims to fly 100 ships to Mars between 2030 and 2031 and 500 more in 2033. He said, 'This is, like, an incredible thing to have - this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet and a new world.'

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars: 5 to 500 Starships by 2033**
Elon Musk plans to send five Starships to Mars in 2026, followed by a drastic increase in the number of launches, with 20 in 2028, 100 in 2030, and 500 in 2033. According to Musk, this plan is a crucial step in colonizing Mars. As Musk said, 'This is a radical plan, but it's necessary to ensure the survival of humanity.' However, some experts question the feasibility of this ambitious plan, wondering if it's a point of inflection for humanity or simply a sign of Musk's mental detachment.

**Elon Musk's 'Life Insurance' for Humanity: Colonizing Mars**
Elon Musk has reiterated his vision of making humanity a multi-planetary species, citing the 450 million years before the Sun makes life on Earth impossible. Musk's justification for colonizing Mars has evolved over time, initially focusing on having a 'self-sustaining base on Mars' as a refuge from immediate threats. He now emphasizes the need for a 'life insurance' for humanity, as the Sun will eventually expand and destroy life on Earth. Musk's plan is to establish a city on Mars that can grow independently, without relying on resupply missions from Earth. He believes that this is crucial for ensuring the survival of humanity, even if the civilization on Earth were to collapse. The SpaceX CEO is using the Starship program to make Mars colonization economically viable, but the project faces significant technical challenges. Musk's predictions have been revised, with a possible unmanned landing on Mars in 2026 and human presence before 2030. However, experts consider these predictions overly optimistic. The scientific community is not aligned with Musk's apocalyptic view of the end of life on Earth, with some models suggesting different scenarios. The colonization of Mars is not seen as the best solution to long-term threats, with some arguing that it is a costly distraction from the problems we already face on Earth.

**Elon Musk's Plan B for Humanity: Colonizing Mars by 2031**
Elon Musk has reiterated his conviction that humanity's future must pass through Mars. In an interview on 'Jesse Watters Primetime' on Fox News, the SpaceX CEO defined the colonization of the red planet as a 'life insurance' for the human species. With the end of his experience in the DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) group, Musk has shifted his attention to his most ambitious project: transforming Mars into a safe and self-sufficient refuge. According to Musk, Earth will not be habitable forever. The Sun, as explained by NASA scientists, has a life expectancy of around 5 billion years, but will eventually expand to become a red giant, likely engulfing Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth. 'The Sun is slowly expanding. Eventually, life on Earth will be wiped out,' Musk said. 'It's essential to become a multi-planetary civilization to ensure the continuity of life.' The project aims to build an autonomous city on Mars that can survive without supplies from Earth, as Musk stated, 'We need to become a multi-planetary species to ensure the survival of humanity.'

**Future on Mars: A Children's Book Explores the Possibility of Human Settlement**
A team of authors, led by the Catalan astrophysicist Guillem Anglada-Escudé, have written a children's book that explores the possibility of humans living on Mars. The book, 'Zukunft auf dem Mars' (Future on Mars), aims to bridge the gap between science and fiction and change our perspective on the Red Planet. Elon Musk has stated that he believes humans can become a 'multiplanetary species' that can live on multiple planets, and he plans to establish a self-sustaining civilization on Mars by 2050 through his company SpaceX. However, it is unclear whether it is realistic for parts of the Earth's population to live on Mars in the long term. The book delves into the challenges of space travel and the difficulties of living on Mars, including the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere and the dangers of cosmic radiation. As Elon Musk said, 'It is a multiplanetary species that we will become.'

**Elon Musk's chilling prediction raises fears among Americans**
Elon Musk has warned that the sun will eventually destroy Earth, and that humanity needs to become a multi-planet civilization to survive. He believes that Mars is 'life insurance for life collectively' and is working to make it self-sustaining within his lifetime. Musk said, 'Mars is life insurance for life collectively. So, eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the sun. The sun is gradually expanding, and so we do at some point need to be a multi-planet civilization because Earth will be incinerated.' He aims to send a SpaceX Starship rocket to Mars by 2026, and if successful, plans to send a human to Mars by 2029 or 2031. Musk's efforts to colonize Mars have been boosted by a recent vote in Texas, where residents voted to incorporate Starbase, the facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program, as a city.

**Elon Musk: Mars is a 'Life Insurance' for Humanity**
Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, has shared his vision for colonizing Mars, calling it a 'life insurance' for humanity. According to Musk, the long-term goal is not just to send humans to Mars, but to create a self-sustaining colony. 'Mars is a life insurance for humanity. The sun is gradually expanding, and at some point, Earth will be destroyed,' Musk explained. He emphasized that his goal is not just to send humans to Mars with flags and footprints, but to create a colony that can survive independently. 'If supplies from Earth are cut off due to a catastrophe or the decline of civilization, Mars must be able to stand on its own. Otherwise, it's not a life insurance for humanity,' he said. Musk plans to send a Starship rocket to Mars with a humanoid robot from Tesla in late 2026. If the mission is successful, the first human landings on Mars could begin as early as 2029, although a more likely date is 2031. Musk's vision for a self-sustaining Martian colony is not only a way to protect against cosmic threats but also a step towards a radical transformation of humanity's fate. 'Creating an independent settlement on Mars will forever determine the future of life as we know it,' Musk said.

**Mars as a Life Insurance for Humanity**
Elon Musk told Fox News that all life on Earth will eventually be lost when the sun expands and eventually destroys the planet. According to NASA, the sun will become a red giant and potentially engulf Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth in about five billion years. Musk emphasized the importance of becoming a multi-planetary civilization, stating, 'Therefore, we must become a multi-planetary civilization.' Musk's ambitions go beyond symbolic presence, he explained, 'The crucial thing is that a Martian settlement must be self-sustaining. If it is dependent on supplies from Earth to survive, we have not created a real life insurance.' Musk plans to send a spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026, with Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus on board. If everything goes according to plan, he believes humans can land on the planet as early as 2029, but 2031 is more realistic.

**Scientists Predict When We'll Find Extraterrestrial Life**
Scientists from the University of Berkeley believe that the search for extraterrestrial life may yield results in the next few decades. Some experts, such as Claire Webb from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, mentioned that Frank Drake, a pioneer in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, predicted that we may find evidence of life in 2024. Andrew Siemion, director of SETI research at Berkeley, predicted that we will find evidence of life on Mars in 2036. Others, such as Sara Seager, believe that the search for extraterrestrial life will be possible with the development of new space telescopes, which will take decades to design and launch. Despite the differences in predictions, the participants agree that the search for extraterrestrial life is a real scientific challenge that requires long-term investments and global coordination.
