**Frazzled Brits admit 'doom scrolling' on phone is part of their 'self care routine' - Daily Star**
A recent survey of 2,000 UK adults found that despite 97% of people agreeing that taking time out is essential for their wellbeing, many are struggling to prioritize self-care. Two-fifths of Brits consider 'doom scrolling' on social media as a form of self-care, while 14% struggle to remember the last time they did something indulgent just for themselves. The top barriers to self-care include work (25%), lack of time (13%), and looking after kids (13%). Fox's Fabulous Chocolatey is encouraging Brits to put themselves first and ditch the guilt, with the help of Craig Revel Horwood. As Craig said, 'Darling if you're not treating yourself, then what are you doing? Life's far too short not to take time for yourself to indulge and unwind.'

**Brits spending less than ever on 'me time' as two in five admit 'doom scrolling' - The Mirror**
A survey of 2,000 UK adults found that despite 97% of people agreeing that taking time out is essential for their wellbeing, very few are doing so. In fact, half of Brits (47%) are getting less 'me time' than they managed five years ago. Shockingly, two-fifths (38%) of Brits consider doom scrolling as a form of self-care. The main barriers to self-care are work (25%), lack of time (13%), and looking after kids (13%). Fox's Fabulous Chocolatey is encouraging Brits to put themselves first and ditch the guilt, with the help of Craig Revel Horwood. 'Darling if you're not treating yourself, then what are you doing? Life's far too short not to take time for yourself to indulge and unwind,' Craig said. Fox's Fabulous Chocolatey is launching a competition to give one lucky winner £1,000-worth of luxury spa vouchers.

**80% of People with Obesity are Women, Says Nutritionist**
According to Daisy Rivas, a nutritionist at the Teófilo Dávila hospital, there is a high percentage of obesity in the country, with at least 10-13 out of 15 patients she sees per week suffering from obesity, and the majority of them are women. Rivas emphasizes that this problem affects people of all ages, from children to adults and the elderly, with around 80-90% of patients presenting with obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1 billion people (1 in 8) worldwide suffer from obesity, a figure that was expected to reach 2030 but has already become a reality in 2024. Rivas highlights the importance of education in preventing obesity, suggesting that parents, especially mothers, learn and teach their children how to eat a balanced diet. She also warns against the dangers of processed and ultra-processed foods, as well as fast food, which can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Rivas recommends consulting a nutritionist for a personalized treatment plan, rather than following 'miracle diets' that can cause imbalances and harm. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) promotes strategic lines of action through public policies and intersectoral interventions to address obesity as a national problem.

**Over 25% of U.S. adults don't have dental insurance**
A recent report by the CareQuest Institute for Oral Health found that over 25% of U.S. adults, approximately 72 million people, do not have dental insurance. The report analyzed data from a nationally representative study of U.S. adults' oral health attitudes and behaviors, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. The study found that adults ages 18 to 29 and those 60 and older were more likely to lack dental insurance compared to middle-aged adults. Additionally, individuals with lower education and income levels were more likely to be uninsured. However, 12% of adults without current dental insurance reported losing it in the past year, with higher loss rates among younger adults and those with less education. According to the report, about one-third of Medicare and Medicaid recipients lack dental insurance, and over 80% of adults without health insurance also go without dental coverage. Dr. Burroughs stated, 'It’s time for policy solutions that address our nation’s oral health, starting by preserving Medicaid adult dental coverage.'

**Guatemalan Law Fails to Provide Specific Alert for Missing Men**
According to the Public Ministry (MP), between January 1, 2020 and March 23, 2025, there were 5,356 reported disappearances of adult men. In the first three months of this year, at least 228 cases were documented. Unlike women, children, and adolescents, Guatemalan law does not provide a specific alert for missing men once they reach adulthood. The MP and National Civil Police (PNC) records show a sustained increase in disappearances of men over the past five years. In 2020, there were 760 reported cases of men over 18. In 2021, the number rose to 1,085, while in 2022, 1,122 cases were registered. In 2023, 988 reports were received, and in 2024, the number increased again to 1,173 cases. Since May 4, 2024, the PNC has been required to act under the Protocol for Police Action in the Investigation of Missing Men, established by Resolution 96-2024. However, search actions are mainly concentrated in checkpoints, where citizens' identities are verified. According to the PNC's General Directorate, an average of 2,964 people disappear each year, with 66% being women and 44% being men, regardless of age. Over 1,000 men are reported missing each year, including Pablo Méndez Vega, who went missing on May 28, 2024, while showing a vehicle for sale in Zone 11. His disappearance was reported to the police, who activated the protocol, and his family has circulated information on social media to try to locate him.

**We're The First 0.5% in Human Species  --  What We Owe The Future by William MacAskill**
William MacAskill's book 'What We Owe The Future' explores the idea that humans are only 0.5% of the way through their species' history, with 99.5% of the future yet to be written. MacAskill argues that we have a duty to consider the interests of future people, even if they don't exist yet, and that our actions today will have a significant impact on their lives. He discusses the three possible outcomes for human civilization: extinction, collapse, and stagnation. MacAskill suggests that we are living in a period of high plasticity, where our actions can have a lasting impact on the future. He argues that we need to take effective altruism seriously, not just by making individual choices like being vegan or reducing plastic, but also by making systemic changes through elections and donations. MacAskill's book is a call to action, urging readers to consider the long-term consequences of their actions and to work towards creating a better future for all people, past, present, and future.

**Half of US Adults Acknowledge the Health Benefits of Plant-Based Diets - vegconomist - the vegan business magazine**
A recent survey found that 65% of US adults would consider trying a plant-based diet if they saw evidence of its benefits. Young, non-white, college-educated adults from urban areas were most open to making the change. However, only 1 in 5 people recalled their doctors discussing the benefits of a plant-based diet. Xavier Toledo, a registered dietitian, noted that more support and guidance from healthcare professionals is needed to turn interest into action and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. 'What's missing is support and guidance from health care professionals,' he said. 'This represents a huge missed opportunity to turn interest into action — and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases that affect millions.'

**Despite Misinformation, 50% of Americans Still Find Plant-Based Diets Healthy**
A new survey by Morning Consult and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found that 50% of Americans believe that plant-based diets are healthy, but lack guidance from healthcare professionals to adopt them. Xavier Toledo, a registered dietitian, stated, 'What's missing is support and guidance from health care professionals.' Only 1% of Americans follow a vegan diet, and 91% of respondents eat meat at least once a week. The survey revealed that when Americans are shown evidence of how plant-based diets can enhance their health, their willingness to try such a diet jumps by 15 percentage points. Dr. Shireen Kassam, a consultant haematologist, noted that nutrition training in most non-nutrition healthcare courses is still lacking, with education on plant-based diets being even less well covered. The poll comes at a time when health is in full focus in the US, thanks in part to the continued post-Covid wave of wellness and nutrition.

**America: Obsessed with Image, Drowning in Excess**
The United States is a nation obsessed with image and excess, yet struggling with a health crisis. Nearly 40% of adults are obese, and over 10% battle diabetes. The author argues that honesty is necessary to address this issue, rather than guilt or shame. They propose that real wellness requires commitment, not quick fixes, and that change starts at a personal and cultural level. This includes prioritizing education around nutrition, pushing for better food options, and shifting the traditional American diet towards lean proteins and fruits. The author concludes that America's future depends on recognizing the crisis and committing to real, lasting change.

**Table for one? More people say they eat all their meals alone.**
A new analysis of the 2025 World Happiness Report found that 26% of US adults surveyed said they ate every meal alone the previous day, a 50% increase from 2003. The trend is attributed to the rise in people living alone, irregular work schedules, and remote work. The report found that sharing meals is a stronger predictor of well-being than income or unemployment, and that dining alone has a greater impact on life evaluation than unemployment. The US ranked 24th in the report, its lowest ranking in 13 years, partly due to the rising number of people eating alone. The report also highlighted the US's high and increasing rate of 'deaths of despair' from suicide, alcohol abuse, and drug overdose.

**The anti-vegan backlash that made Britain fall back in love with meat**
After a few years of decline, meat consumption is on the rise in the UK, with 19% of 18- to 24-year-olds increasing their meat intake in 2024, according to a survey by Eating Better. Veganism, which was once a cultural phenomenon, is now in sharp decline, with participation in Veganuary, the annual push to give up meat in January, stalling at 4% in the UK. Sales of chilled and frozen meat alternatives have fallen by 16.8% and 21% respectively from 2022 to 2024. Experts attribute the decline to the high cost of vegan products, the complexity of alternative proteins, and the extreme message that everybody can be healthy on a vegan diet. Many people are re-embracing dairy and meat, and chefs are welcoming the shift, with some reporting a fall in demand for vegan food and a rise in meat-eating and pescatarian dieters.

**60% Americans favor defending Taiwan when the time comes: Report - The Taiwan Times**
A recent survey titled 'Order and Disorder' found that 60% of Americans support the US defending Taiwan against a possible Chinese invasion. The survey, conducted by YouGov from August 28 to September 6, gathered responses from 1,000 adult US citizens. According to the results, 18% strongly supported intervention, 42% somewhat supported intervention, 27% were somewhat opposed, and 13% were strongly opposed. Republicans were more likely to support taking military action than Democrats or Independents. The survey's findings suggest that the US may be willing to commit troops to defend Taiwan, which could potentially lead to a global conflict, including the possibility of World War III.
