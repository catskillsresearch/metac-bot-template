**Ticking Taiwan Strait: Waiting for a war everyone sees coming**
The Taiwan Strait is a highly flammable and consequential fault line in global power politics, with war between China and Taiwan becoming increasingly likely. China has mandated the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be ready for an invasion by 2027, and Taiwan has responded by increasing defense spending and adopting asymmetric warfare strategies. The real concern, however, is whether the rest of the world is ready to back Taiwan. The US has traditionally employed strategic ambiguity to deter China, but this approach is losing relevance as China openly prepares for war and Taiwan becomes increasingly de facto autonomous. Taiwan's centrality to the global tech economy, particularly in chip production, makes a war over Taiwan a systematic shock to globalization. The Taiwan crisis is a model of 21st-century warfare, combining cyberattacks, electromagnetic warfare, disinformation campaigns, and economic coercion. Taiwan's security extends beyond military readiness to encompass data protection, satellite resilience, and psychological preparedness. The Taiwan problem is existential for Beijing, and it presents a normative challenge to the Chinese Communist Party's assertion that authoritarianism is required for order and development. The world must choose whether deterrence is to be revived or merely remembered.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China warned the US not to 'play with fire' over Taiwan, in response to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's accusations that Beijing is preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and seeking to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson in a statement issued after midnight. Beijing expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore warned that the Chinese military 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and hinted at the supposed intention to do so before 2027. 'Let me be clear: any attempt by the Communist Party (Chinese) to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world (...) The Chinese threat is real. And it could be imminent,' emphasized the Pentagon chief. China also accused the US of fomenting confrontation between blocs, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea, and 'turning the region into a powder keg.' The spokesperson warned the US not to 'harbor illusions' about using the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and announced a formal protest had been lodged with Washington. 'China manages its differences through dialogue and in accordance with the law,' the spokesperson said.

**China Criticizes US Defense Minister Hegseth Over Taiwan Comments**
China has criticized US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth for his statements on the situation in the Indo-Pacific region. Hegseth had previously described China as a threat in the region and warned of a possible military intervention in Taiwan. The Chinese government accused the US of undermining peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region. China also warned the US against interfering in the Taiwan issue, calling it an 'internal matter'. Hegseth had warned of a possible Chinese military intervention against Taiwan, saying 'China's army is training for the worst-case scenario'. He stated that the threat from China is real and could happen at any moment. Chinese President Xi Jinping has allegedly ordered his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Hegseth's comments were his strongest since taking office in January. Chinese Admiral Hu Gangfeng, leader of the Chinese delegation at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, called Hegseth's accusations 'unfounded' and aimed at provoking conflicts and destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region. Hegseth had also urged Asian allies to increase their defense spending in the face of the 'threat from communist China'. China wants to become the dominant power in Asia and control the entire region, he said. The US does not seek a conflict with China, but will not be pushed out of the region, Hegseth stated.

**'Unacceptable': China slams Macron for comparing Taiwan issue to Ukraine war**
China has condemned French President Emmanuel Macron's comments comparing the Taiwan issue to the Ukraine war, calling them 'unacceptable'. Macron warned that unchecked Russian aggression in Ukraine could set a precedent in Asia, and questioned what would happen if Russia took Ukrainian territory without restrictions. China's embassy in Singapore responded, saying the two issues are 'different in nature and not comparable at all'. Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that a threat from China in Asia could be 'imminent', and that any Chinese military move on Taiwan would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. Macron also criticized Europe's credibility for giving Israel a 'free pass' on its actions in Gaza, which has led to the death of over 50,000 civilians since October 2023.

**China Accuses US of Provoking Conflict over Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has sparked outrage in China with his warning of an impending attack by China on the island of Taiwan. Beijing sees this as a threat to peace and stability. The Chinese government suspects that the US has a motive to provoke conflicts. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry accused the US of undermining 'peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region' and turning the region 'into a powder keg.' China also warned the US government against interfering in the Taiwan issue. Hegseth had warned at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore on Saturday that China's army was training for a worst-case scenario.

Chinese Admiral Hu Gangfeng countered that Hegseth's accusations were 'unfounded' and aimed at provoking conflicts and destabilizing the Asian-Pacific region. Hegseth emphasized the 'threat' from China, saying that it is seeking to become the hegemonic power in Asia and dominate the entire region. He called on Asian allies to increase their defense spending in the face of this 'threat.' China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, despite the island having a democratically elected government. Beijing has threatened to use military force to annex Taiwan if necessary.

**US and China Engage in Confrontational Rhetoric Over Taiwan**
The rhetoric has become sharper and the tone more confrontational between Washington and Beijing in Singapore, as they accuse each other of destabilizing the Indo-Pacific region. At the center of the dispute is Taiwan and the question of how long peace will last. The Chinese government has strongly criticized US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth's comments on the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, accusing the US of undermining 'peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region' and turning it into a 'powder keg'. Beijing also warned the US government against interfering in the Taiwan issue.

Hegseth also called on Asian allies to increase their defense spending in the face of the 'threat from communist China', saying that 'deterrence has its price.' China aims to become the dominant power in Asia and control the entire region, he said. 'But we will not start a conflict with China. However, we will not let ourselves be pushed out of this critical region. And we will not allow our allies and partners to be subordinated.' China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, despite the island having had an independent and democratically elected government for decades. The People's Republic has threatened to use military force to annex Taiwan if it does not do so peacefully.

**China Warns US Against 'Playing with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China has warned the US against 'playing with fire' over Taiwan, after US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made comments that China described as 'provocative' during a security forum in Singapore. China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement: 'The US should not use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and should avoid playing with fire.' The statement added that Beijing has made formal protests to Washington over Austin's comments, which China said were 'provocative' regarding China's sovereignty over Taiwan. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrei Rudenko, said that China is not concerned about the current interactions between Russia and the US, and that these interactions do not pose a threat to Russia-China relations. The US White House announced that President Donald Trump hopes China will choose a path of cooperation and mutual understanding, according to a report by Al-Qahera TV. The US State Department also announced that there is optimism about a proposed ceasefire in Gaza. Meanwhile, the Gaza Health Ministry announced that 54,249 Palestinians have been killed and 123,492 injured since October 7, 2023.

**US Warns of Potential Chinese Advance Against Taiwan Islands**
The US Defense Intelligence Agency has issued a warning that China could advance against the islands of Taiwan. According to the 2024 Global Threat Assessment, China is a key player in the conflict between China and the US. The islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Dongsha, and Taiping, as well as Penghu, are crucial in this conflict. The US is ready to support Taiwan, its ally in the Pacific, as stated by the Institute for the Study of War. This move comes as the US government tightens relations with China by making a key announcement about visas. As reported by the US Defense Intelligence Agency, China's President Xi Jinping has been a key figure in this conflict. The US has also signed a multi-million dollar agreement that includes the sale of arms to a Middle Eastern power, as confirmed by former US President Donald Trump.

**Eight Heng Warns of Imminent War between Taiwan and China in 2027**
Social media influencer Eight Heng (八炯) has warned that a war between Taiwan and China in 2027 is likely unavoidable, unless Chinese President Xi Jinping dies or is removed from power. He stated that 'most pro-Taiwan factions' are not prepared for this scenario. Eight Heng pointed out that the US Congress held a hearing on May 15 to discuss China's plan to invade Taiwan in 2027, and that he has been trying to raise awareness about this issue through his speeches and online posts. He believes that the Taiwanese people are not yet prepared for this scenario, and that many people who claim to be pro-Taiwan are actually planning to emigrate. Eight Heng also stated that the goal of removing pro-Communist Party legislators is to increase the chances of winning and to disrupt the Communist Party's efforts to unify Taiwan. He cited the words of Chinese military strategist Li Yi and other Communist Party officials, who have said that if the Taiwanese people and military can unite and resist, China's invasion will fail.

**War Over Taiwan Would Cause 500,000 Deaths, Economic Devastation, US Admiral Paparo Says - Vision Times**
US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that a war over Taiwan would cause 500,000 deaths, economic devastation, and a 25% drop in Asian GDP. He also stated that a regional conflict could lead to nuclear-armed South Korea and Japan, and cause other countries to align with China. Paparo emphasized that a successful US intervention against a PRC invasion of Taiwan would reduce losses, but the damage and human toll would still be immense. He also called for enhancing capabilities in cyber, space, anti-space, and long-range strike operations across the Indo-Pacific, and advocated continuing the mission of USAID to promote American soft power around the world. According to Paparo, a regional conflict could result in 10-12% of the US GDP, 7 to 10% of American employment, and 500,000 deaths. He also stated that if the US reduces its military involvement on the Korean Peninsula, Japan and South Korea might consider producing and deploying nuclear weapons of their own. Paparo said, 'If the US reduces its military involvement on the Korean Peninsula, in Northeast Asia, or around Taiwan, Japan and South Korea might consider producing and deploying nuclear weapons of their own.'

**US Commander Warns of 'Great Humanitarian Disaster' if War Breaks Out in Taiwan Strait**
US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Samuel Paparo recently warned in a Senate hearing that a war in the Taiwan Strait would destroy the global economy, potentially causing 500,000 people to die in desperation, even if the US intervenes successfully. He stated that the Chinese Communist Party's military pressure on Taiwan has increased by 300%, and is not just a simple military exercise, but a 'dress rehearsal' to simulate the forced unification of Taiwan. Paparo said that Taiwan is a core component of the global semiconductor industry, and if the production line is blocked, it would severely impact the US's economic modernization and growth. He warned that if a regional war breaks out, the GDP of the Asian region could drop by 25%, and the US GDP could decline by 10-12%, with a 7-10% increase in unemployment rate, and 500,000 people could die in desperation, such as through suicide or drug overdose. Even if the US intervenes successfully, it would only be able to reduce the damage by half, and still cause a 'great humanitarian disaster.' Paparo also stated that the trust between regional allies and partners would be tested, and if the US's influence declines, some Indo-Pacific countries may follow China's long-term goal of leading the international order, while others may turn to developing their own nuclear weapons due to security concerns, leading to an escalation of conflict. He emphasized that 'the victory of World War II relied on logistics, not artificial intelligence. You cannot use AI to compensate for the lack of physical equipment.'

**China Conducts Comprehensive Military Exercise Surrounding Taiwan**
China has announced the start of a comprehensive military exercise surrounding Taiwan, which is at the center of a sovereignty dispute between the two. According to Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the exercise will involve units from the PLA's land, air, sea, and rocket forces. Shi said that the exercise will focus on 'maritime-air combat patrols, comprehensive superiority, attacks on sea and land targets, blocking key areas and sea lanes,' and will aim to test the interoperability of the units. Shi described the exercise as 'a stern warning' and 'a strong deterrent' to Taiwan's independence-seeking separatist forces, and said that it is a 'legitimate and necessary action' to protect China's sovereignty and national unity. This is the latest in a series of large-scale military exercises China has conducted around Taiwan, including ones in 2022, 2023, and 2024. These exercises have been dubbed 'Joint Sword'. The China-Taiwan dispute dates back to the end of the Second World War, when the Communist Party of China (CPC) defeated the Nationalist Party (KMT) and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) on October 1, 1949. The KMT members who lost the civil war retreated to Taiwan and established a temporary government, claiming that the 'Republic of China' continued to exist on the island. China considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory, while Taiwan has been de facto independent since 1949. The dispute continues to this day, with Beijing increasing military pressure on Taiwan in recent years, and warning that it will not rule out the use of force to reunify the island with the mainland.

**US-China War over Taiwan: A Devastating Conflict**
A recent analysis by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) suggests that a war between the US and China over Taiwan could be devastating for all parties involved. The study, based on the All-Source Intelligence methodology of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and open sources, estimates that the US would lose between 10 and 20 warships, including 2 aircraft carriers, and 200 to 400 combat aircraft, with over 3,000 US military personnel killed in the first three weeks of the conflict. Taiwan would be devastated and would run out of critical ammunition, while China would lose up to 90% of its amphibious fleet, 52 surface ships, and 160 combat aircraft. The study also notes that the US and Taiwan would exhaust their ammunition reserves quickly, including critical missiles such as LRASM, JASSM-ER, and Tomahawk Block V, which would take two years or more to produce. The analysis concludes that the US would likely lose a war with China over Taiwan, but at a very high cost, and that the conflict would have significant economic and industrial implications for all parties involved.

**The Taiwan-China Conflict: A Complex and Delicate Situation**
The Taiwan-China conflict is one of the most complex geopolitical issues in the world. The conflict dates back to the Chinese Civil War between 1927 and 1949, where the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) was defeated by the Communist Party of China. The Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, where they established a separate government. The People's Republic of China claims Taiwan as its own territory, while Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state. The United States has supported Taiwan diplomatically and militarily, which has increased tensions between China and the US. China has offered Taiwan greater autonomy, but Taiwan has refused, leading to a stalemate. The US has increased its military presence in the region, which has led to a buildup of Chinese military forces around Taiwan. There are several possible scenarios for the future: a peaceful reunification, a continued state of tension, or a military conflict. The conflict has significant implications for global security and stability.

**Taiwan's Separatism Threatens Peace in East Asia**
The conflict between China and Taiwan has been escalating in recent years, with some Western media outlets portraying it as a potential cause for a third world war due to alleged Chinese aggression. However, the situation is more complex than that. Since 1949, the international community has recognized China as a single entity, with the People's Republic of China (PRC) being the legitimate representative of the country. The controversy has not been about China's one-China policy, but rather who should represent this single China - the PRC in Beijing, which represents 99% of China's population, or the Taiwan-based Republic of China (ROC), which claims to be the legitimate representative of the entire country. In 1972, the US suddenly changed its stance, recognizing the PRC as the legitimate representative of China and establishing diplomatic relations with it. This move was motivated by realpolitik, with the US seeing China as a potential capitalist market and a way to split the socialist bloc. The US has since maintained extensive economic and military ties with the Taiwan-based ROC, despite not having diplomatic relations with it. However, a shift has occurred in Taiwan, with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) coming to power in 2016 and advocating for Taiwanese independence. This has been met with support from imperialist forces in the US and other Western countries, who see a divided China as a way to challenge China's growing influence on the global market. China has been driving an aggressive policy in the South China Sea, which has been unacceptable. However, the question of Taiwan is of a different nature, as Taiwan is a part of the historical China, making the PRC's claims on Taiwan legitimate. The Taiwanese people have the right to express their views, but all forms of imperialist intervention must be condemned. The PRC has shown great patience in reuniting with Taiwan, which has been separated from China for 75 years. However, if imperialism intervenes to permanently detach Taiwan from China, the patience will likely reach its limit. It is this Western involvement that poses a threat to peace in East Asia.

**China and Taiwan: The Background to the Conflict**
Taiwan is one of the most democratic and free countries in the world, but its freedom is threatened by China's claim that it is an 'abtrünnige Provinz' (secessionist province). China's President Xi Jinping has threatened to use force to 'reunify' Taiwan with the mainland. The conflict between China and Taiwan dates back to the early 20th century, when the Chinese Republic was established in 1912 and the Communist Party was founded in 1921. The Nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-shek, were defeated by the Communists in 1949 and fled to Taiwan, where they established the Republic of China. Taiwan has since become a democracy and a major economic power, but China has never recognized its sovereignty. The US and most other countries have a policy of 'strategic ambiguity' towards Taiwan, recognizing it as part of China but also providing it with military aid. The situation is complex and volatile, with many analysts predicting that China will invade Taiwan in the near future. However, Taiwan is well-prepared for a potential conflict, with a strong military and a well-trained population. 'It is a horror scenario for the Taiwanese people to become part of the communist People's Republic of China and to have to give up their democratic traditions and freedoms,' said a Taiwanese official. 'The Chinese government's actions against the democracy movement in Hong Kong have shown us what happens when the Communist Party takes away people's freedoms.'
