**Topic: Marvel**
The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has surpassed other iconic franchises like Star Wars, James Bond, and Lord of the Rings to become the highest-grossing film franchise of all time. The MCU's box office success can be attributed to its ability to combine storylines of numerous superheroes, cross-promoting its other films. The Avengers series takes this concept further, appealing to a wide range of superhero fans. The success of the films has brought comic book superheroes into the mainstream, with Black Panther receiving 7 Academy Award nominations and 3 wins. Marvel's comic books also dominate the market, with over 40% of US comic store sales, and its movies, TV shows, and video games preferred by the majority of consumers. The brand's revitalization has increased the popularity of the superhero genre, and with continued success across various entertainment platforms, Marvel is set for continued success in the years to come.

Disney has started marketing its next billion-dollar movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, which is set to be released on December 19, 2025.

It is highly likely that the movie will earn more than $2 billion worldwide, following the precedent set by the previous two movies.
