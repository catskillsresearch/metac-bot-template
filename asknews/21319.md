**Airline Industry Faces Turbulent Times Amid Trade Tensions and Environmental Pressures**
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) held its annual summit in New Delhi, where the global airline industry is facing a less favorable economic context due to trade tensions, environmental pressures, and rising costs. Despite a sustained demand, the industry is expected to revise its 2025 forecasts downward due to 'adverse winds' for the global economy. The US-China trade war, relaunched by Donald Trump, has imposed a 10% tax on aircraft and aeronautical components produced outside the US, affecting Airbus and Boeing. The transition to sustainable aviation fuels, essential for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, is also hindered by the removal of US subsidies. As a result, airlines are absorbing these cost increases, sometimes accompanied by delivery delays, leading to reduced international flights and profitability. However, the demand for air travel remains strong, with India doubling its number of passengers and airports in ten years, and Africa and the Middle East experiencing a 14% growth in traffic. Despite this, airlines are under pressure to manage their costs, with stable profit margins and a need for economic adjustments.

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**Multiple Threats Loom: China-Taiwan Tensions, Russian-Ukrainian Conflict, and Iran's Nuclear Ambitions**
According to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a military action by China against Taiwan 'may be imminent', which could happen before 2027, the year President Xi Jinping allegedly ordered the Chinese army to be ready to attack. Meanwhile, despite new peace talks scheduled for today in Istanbul involving Germany, France, the UK, Turkey, and the US, multiple sources say a new large-scale Russian ground offensive against Ukraine is 'imminent', and the US may be 'on the verge of abandoning Ukraine'. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) states that Iran now has over 408 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium, nearly doubling its stockpile from three months ago, and is on the verge of producing up to 10 nuclear weapons. This could lead to a 'preventive strike' by the US and/or Israel if a deal is not reached quickly. The greatest danger is that these threats become a reality simultaneously.

**The End of 'Golden Decades': US-China Relations Deteriorate and a New Cold War Begins**
The relationship between the US and China has deteriorated, marking the end of 'golden decades' and the beginning of a new Cold War. The number of Chinese students studying in the US has decreased, from over 370,000 in 2019 to a smaller number in 2023. This phenomenon, where two rival powers built bridges in education, science, and innovation, has come to an end. The Chinese government has become a major power with geopolitical ambitions, making a multipolar world more unstable. The tension between the two countries is inevitable. The US has imposed new tariffs, restricted technological exports, and adopted a hostile stance towards Chinese students, threatening to cancel the visas of many Chinese students in the US. The China has restricted the export of strategic minerals and developed alternative supply chains. The mistrust between the two countries has reduced the exchange of ideas, hindered scientific cooperation, and impoverished their understanding of each other. As new generations take power in Washington and Beijing, the risk of conflict increases. The relationship between the two countries is likely to worsen, and the world will become more volatile, making it difficult and costly to maintain neutrality. The 'golden era' of low geopolitical risk has come to an end.

**US-China Trade War: Who Will Be the Dominant Power?**
The trade war between the US and China has raised questions about who will be the dominant power in the future. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, but China has retaliated with its own tariffs. The situation has led to a decline in trade between the two countries, with the US experiencing a trade deficit of $700 billion in 2025. In contrast, China has a trade surplus of $700 billion, with a focus on exporting electronics and other goods. The US has a large national debt of $35 trillion, while China's debt is $15 trillion, but its total debt is 300% of its GDP. According to the IMF, China is expected to become the largest contributor to global growth in the next five years, with a 23% share. The US is still expected to be a major contributor, but its share is expected to decline. The two countries have different economic systems, with the US relying heavily on services, while China relies on industry. The US has a strong military, with over 6,100 tanks and 40,000 armored vehicles, while China has a large military with over 3.3 million soldiers and 3,260 aircraft. The US has a strong navy, with 490 ships, including 11 aircraft carriers, while China has a large navy with 777 ships. The US has a strong defense budget, with $740 billion in 2025, while China's defense budget is $178 billion. According to a report by the Telegraph, China has surpassed the US in terms of military strength, with over 1 million soldiers and a larger navy. The US is concerned about China's rapid military modernization, including its nuclear capabilities. The trade war between the US and China is not just about tariffs, but also about the future of the global economy and the balance of power between the two countries.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had stated that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is currently on track to reach defence spending levels of 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is optimistic about the progress of the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine deal.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China warned the US not to 'play with fire' regarding Taiwan, in response to comments from US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who accused Beijing of preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and attempting to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry in a statement issued after midnight. Beijing expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday, during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, warned that the Chinese army 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and alluded to the supposed intention to do so before 2027. 'Let me be clear: any attempt by the Communist Party (Chinese) to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world (...) The Chinese threat is real. And it could be imminent,' emphasized the Pentagon chief. China has warned the US not to use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and has presented a formal protest to Washington. Beijing has also accused the US of fomenting confrontation between blocs, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea, and 'turning the region into a powder keg.' The spokesperson stated that there are no problems with freedom of navigation in the waters, where tensions exist with neighboring countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia, or Vietnam, and that China 'manages its differences through dialogue and in accordance with the law.' In his Saturday speech, Hegseth had warned that China seeks to 'dominate and control' Asia, and assured that Washington will not allow Beijing to modify the status quo by force.

**US-China Decoupling: A New Cold War in Academia**
The US administration, led by President Donald Trump, has threatened to revoke visas for hundreds of thousands of Chinese students in the US, and to subject future applicants from China, including Hong Kong, to additional scrutiny. This move is part of a broader effort to 'decouple' the US from China, aimed at cutting the close economic and educational ties between the two countries. The Trump administration has already imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and has restricted the sale of advanced technologies to China. The US has also stopped Chinese ships from docking at American ports, and has imposed restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. The administration has argued that the measures are necessary to protect American national security, but critics say they will harm the US economy and limit the exchange of ideas between the two countries. The Chinese government has responded by imposing its own restrictions on American companies, and has warned that it will retaliate if the US continues to escalate the trade war. The conflict has already had significant economic and diplomatic consequences, and it is unclear what the ultimate outcome will be. Some experts have warned that the US may lose access to talented Chinese students and researchers, and that the country's universities may suffer as a result. Others have argued that the US should focus on promoting its own education and research, rather than trying to restrict the flow of ideas and talent from China.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**The US-China Trade War: A New Era of Global Economic Competition**
The US and China have agreed to a temporary truce in their trade war, with both countries agreeing to reduce tariffs and engage in further negotiations. The US will lower its tariffs on Chinese goods from 30% to 10%, while China will also reduce its tariffs on US goods. However, this agreement does not affect the existing tariffs between the two countries, and the real negotiations are only just beginning. China is seen as having won this round, as it has successfully resisted the US's aggressive trade policies. However, the US claims that it has emerged victorious, as it has secured market access and trade agreements from China. China has been preparing for this trade war, and has been implementing policies to boost its domestic economy and reduce its reliance on exports. The country has also been building up its manufacturing capabilities and has been promoting its technological advancements and economic resilience. The US, on the other hand, has been focusing on reducing its trade deficit and promoting its manufacturing sector. However, its trade policies have been having a negative impact on its national debt and consumer prices. China's goal is to become a global economic powerhouse by 2050, and it sees this trade war as an opportunity to challenge the US's dominance. China has been building a coalition of countries that are opposed to US's trade policies, and has been promoting its own economic model as an alternative to the US's. The future of the world economy is now at a crossroads, with the existing trade order based on Chinese supply chains and the US's efforts to establish a new order based on its own supply chains. South Korea's position is becoming increasingly difficult, as it needs to balance its alliance with the US while also engaging with the rest of the world. The country needs to find a way to navigate this complex situation and find a way to utilize the 'devil in the details' of the US-China trade war.

**China, the war-monger - The Singapore Post**
China has rejected a proposal from US President Donald Trump to cut the defense budget by 50%, which would have reduced the chance of a global war and spared funds for development. Instead, China has increased its defense budget to a record high of $249 billion, a 7.2% increase over the previous year. This move has triggered an arms race, with the US and its allies stepping up their defense efforts to combat the threat. The US has announced plans to develop a next-generation fighter jet, the NGAD, which will be way ahead of any other fighter aircraft of the current generation. China has been modernizing its navy and air force, with plans to possess six aircraft carriers by 2035. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is on the rise, and nations facing the Chinese threat are not sitting idle, increasing their defense budgets and developing advanced arms and weapon platforms. Posterity will brand China as the war-monger, having triggered an arms race through its aggressive moves.

**2054 US Collapse: A Terrifying Future Predicted by Authors Elliot Ackerman and Admiral James Stavridis**
Twenty years after the bestselling novel '2034 US-China War', author Elliot Ackerman and Admiral James Stavridis predict a terrifying future in their new novel '2054 US Collapse'. In 2054, the United States has been devastated by a nuclear war and is on the brink of collapse. A populist party, led by President Castro, has risen to power and is implementing policies to solidify its control, but this has led to a violent resistance movement among citizens. Suddenly, the President collapses during a speech, and the government is forced to announce his death. This event sparks widespread discontent among the public and sets off a chain reaction of events that lead to the collapse of the United States. According to Ackerman and Stavridis, this is a possible future scenario, and they warn that the integration of artificial intelligence and genetic engineering could lead to a catastrophic outcome. 'The President's sudden death and its relation to the government's secrets is a mystery that needs to be uncovered,' says Ackerman. 'The government's handling of the situation has only fueled the public's anger and mistrust.' Stavridis adds, 'The consequences of this event will be far-reaching and devastating. We must be aware of the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the importance of transparency and accountability in government.'

**Chile and Mars: The Scenarios of the Space War Between the US and China**
The space war between the US and China is heating up, with both countries vying for control of Mars. According to José Maza, 'it's very difficult for Europe to join the US, so I think China will win'. However, Ricardo Demarco notes that 'the main actors for reaching Mars are the US and China'. The country that arrives first will have a key role in space exploration. The journey to Mars is a long and complex one, taking around six to nine months, and requiring a distance of 400 million kilometers. Eduardo Bendek explains that 'new forms of propulsion and motors that want to travel in a straight line are still in an initial development stage'. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's SpaceX is working towards establishing a human settlement on Mars, with the goal of building bases, greenhouses, and other sustainable technologies by 2050. China is focused on its Tianwen-3 mission, which aims to send a spacecraft to Mars, while the US is working on its Starship program. The competition for Chile is also heating up, with the country's government putting a project to build an astronomical observatory with Chinese funding on hold due to US concerns. The Chinese Embassy in Chile has responded, stating that 'any attempt to interfere or obstruct legitimate astronomical cooperation between China and Chile will fail'.

**Baba Vanga's Devastating Prediction for 2025: China and US on Brink of War**
The Chinese embassy in the US has stated that they are ready to face any type of war, prompting a response from the US Secretary of Defense, who said that they are preparing their armed forces. This comes as a prediction made by the Bulgarian oracle Baba Vanga in 1996 may come true this year, as tensions between China and the US escalate over trade tariffs. Baba Vanga predicted that in 2025, a new international conflict would break out, pitting the West against the East. The Chinese embassy said, 'If what the US wants is a war, whether it's a trade war, a commercial war, or any other type of war, we are ready to fight to the end.' The US Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, also stated that the US is prepared for a possible war against China, saying, 'We are preparing. Those who desire peace must prepare for war. That's why we are rebuilding our Army.' Hegseth emphasized that the US is in a dangerous world with powerful countries that have different ideologies, and that they are increasing their defense spending and modernizing their technology. He said, 'They want to supplant the US. If we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we must be strong.'

A recent survey by the US think tank Atlantic Council has raised concerns about the possibility of a third world war in the next ten years. The survey, which polled experts from 47 countries, found that 40% of respondents believe a world war is likely to occur by 2035. The majority, 59.5%, disagreed, but the Atlantic Council still considers the findings 'alarming'. The survey, titled 'Global Foresight 2025', highlights the conflict between China and Taiwan as a particularly significant threat. As one expert noted, 'The conflict between China and Taiwan is a ticking time bomb that could lead to a global catastrophe.'

**Lin Yifu: China's Economy Will Surpass the US by 2030**
Lin Yifu, a Taiwanese-born Chinese economist, spoke at the 'Taiwanese Enterprises Association Great Lecture Hall' in Beijing, saying that it's difficult to say whether the US will benefit more than China in the trade war, as the US is an extremely practical country that will 'follow you and live in peace' when it can't 'strangle' you. He believes that China has a strong belief in its own abilities and will 'ride the wind and break through the waves' as long as it does its job well. According to Lin, China's economy will surpass the US by 2030, and its per capita GDP will reach 50% or even higher than the US by 2049, assuming no external influences such as trade wars. He also stated that the US is not only targeting China, but also other countries like Canada and Mexico. Lin believes that China's internal market and supply chain advantages will allow it to thrive in this challenging environment and even widen the gap with other countries. He also emphasized that China's goal of becoming a modernized strong nation and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation by 2049 is 'inevitable' and that Taiwan will not be left behind.

**Experts Predict Global War by 2035 and Escalating Tensions between US and China**
A survey conducted by Atlantic Council found that 40% of 357 experts from 60 countries believe that there will be another global war by 2035, defined as a conflict between major economic powers. The experts, from various sectors including private, non-profit, academic, government, and multilateral institutions, also predicted that the current tensions between the US and China could escalate and become more dangerous. Additionally, 48% of the respondents expected that at least one actor would use nuclear weapons in the next decade, and 45% believed that a conflict could develop in space. Other concerns included environmental degradation, a 'war between powers', and the decline of trade due to protectionism. The survey also found that women were more pessimistic about the prospects of democracy, with 46.5% predicting that the current 'democratic recession' would worsen and become a 'democratic depression'. Furthermore, 61% of women surveyed predicted that nuclear weapons would be used in the next decade, and 32% believed that women's rights would be restricted. However, the experts were optimistic about the impact of biotechnology, with 53% seeing it as 'something positive'.

**US General Predicts War with China in 2025, Warns of Increased Tensions**
US Air Force General Mike Minihan predicted a possible war with China in 2025, saying 'I hope I'm wrong. My instinct tells me I'll be fighting in 2025.' He sent a memo to his officers in January 2023, warning them to prepare for the conflict. The memo advised 'aiming for the head' of targets for maximum lethality and taking more risks in training. However, two years after the memo was sent, tensions between the US and China remain high, but there is no indication of an imminent conflict. The US Department of Defense distanced itself from Minihan's comments, stating they do not reflect the department's view on China. Minihan has since retired in September 2024, and his warnings are now seen as personal opinions rather than official military advice.

**China's War Preparations: A Threat to Global Security**
China is preparing for a large-scale war, including the possibility of using nuclear warheads, according to Colonel Philip Ingram, a retired British Army officer. China is building a new military command center near Beijing, which is ten times larger than the Pentagon, and is increasing its military presence in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Ingram stated that China is preparing its military, increasing its armed forces, and building up its naval and air forces. China is also stockpiling food, oil, gas, precious minerals, iron, and steel, in preparation for a potential conflict. Ingram emphasized that China is preparing for war, without any 'ifs' or 'buts'. He warned that a conflict between China and the US would have a global impact, and that the world would be at risk of a nuclear war. China is increasing its nuclear arsenal, with 100 new warheads added in 2024, and potentially over 1,000 by 2030. The US is reviewing its nuclear policy towards China in response. 'China is preparing for war, full stop, without any 'ifs' or 'buts', said Ingram. 'This is a very dangerous game for China, as it would lead to a mutually assured destruction, which has prevented nuclear war since 1945.'
