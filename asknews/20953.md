**Russia Destroys 776 Ukrainian Drone and Rocket Targets, Promises Proportionate Response**
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement in response to the sharp increase in Ukrainian drone and rocket attacks on civilian objects in various regions of the country, including Moscow. The ministry stated that Russia will give a proportionate response to the massive terrorist attacks, but unlike the Ukrainian side, only military objects and defense industry enterprises will be targeted. According to the ministry, from May 20 to 23, 788 drone and rocket attacks were recorded on Russian territory, outside the zone of special operation. The Russian air defense system destroyed 776 targets, but 12 drones managed to strike. As a result of the attacks, civilians were killed and injured. In Panteleimonovka in the Donetsk People's Republic, eight people were injured, while in the Zaporizhzhia region, a 1990-born girl was killed and four children were injured. In the Lipeck region, eight people were injured after a drone was shot down, and in the Kursk region, people were injured, including two children, as a result of rocket attacks. The ministry emphasized that 'Russia will give a proportionate response to the massive terrorist attacks from the Kiev regime. Unlike the Ukrainian side, only military objects and defense industry enterprises will be targeted.' The ministry also reminded that the Russian president has decided to create a security zone on the adjacent territory to minimize the threat of attacks. The ministry believes that the escalation by the Ukrainian Armed Forces is linked to attempts to disrupt the resumed negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, facilitated by the United States, and prevent the implementation of the first agreements on the exchange of prisoners of war, reached in Istanbul on May 16. Earlier, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, stated that the Ukrainian side has not stopped attacking civilian objects, but the air defense system is effectively countering them. In recent days, the Kiev regime has carried out several massive drone attacks on Russian territory. Over the past day, Russian air defense forces have destroyed 112 Ukrainian drones, with a significant part of them being eliminated in the airspace of the Moscow region.

A resident of the building, Vanda Bondarenko, shared her impressions: 'I had glued my windows with tape in 2022. Only one window on the balcony remained uncovered, and it was blown off during the attack. I thought it would pass, but then I heard an explosion, and the glass flew onto the balcony. I wanted to jump, but the smoke in the corridor hindered me. I waited until the boys came up, and with their help, I went down. I'm grateful to God that I'm mostly okay, but what happened to other people is terrifying,' she said.

At least two people have been killed and 15 others injured in a drone attack on Odessa, Ukraine. The attack, which occurred on the night of May 1, 2025, was carried out using Russian-made explosive drones. 'This is a new wave of aerial attacks on Ukraine,' said Oleg Kiper.

The attack comes as the US and Ukraine sign a new economic and strategic partnership for the reconstruction of Ukraine. The US has also announced plans to access Ukraine's natural resources.

'We're not worried about the tariffs, we're focused on the economy.' The US has also been criticized for its handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with thousands of residents evacuated from Jerusalem due to a series of arson attacks. 'This is a humanitarian crisis,' said an Israeli official. 'We need international help to contain the fires.' The US has also been accused of blocking aid to the Gaza Strip, with the UN calling for an end to the blockade. 'We're not going to let the Palestinians starve,' said a US official. 'We're working on a solution.' In other news, a mother has been arrested for throwing her seven-month-old daughter from a balcony in Misterbianco, Italy. The baby died instantly. The mother had been suffering from severe postpartum depression. 'It's a tragedy,' said a local official. 'We're doing everything we can to support the family.' A car accident on the A4 highway has also claimed the lives of two elderly drivers. The accident occurred when a car crashed through a barrier and collided with a stationary vehicle.

**U.S. military launches 'decisive and powerful' strikes against Houthis - UPI.com**
Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. military has launched 'decisive and powerful' strikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Trump claimed that the Houthis have waged an 'unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism' against American and other ships, aircraft, and drones. He also stated that Iran funds the Houthis and that the U.S. is carrying out aerial attacks on Houthi bases, leaders, and missile defense sites to protect U.S. commercial shipping and restore navigational freedom in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Trump warned the Houthis that their time is up and that their attacks must stop, and also cautioned Iranian leaders to end their support of the Houthis. The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy carried out aerial strikes with jet aircraft and drones on Saturday and will continue the attacks for several days and possibly weeks. The strikes resulted in 13 deaths and 9 injuries in Yemen, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. Trump said, 'No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the waterways of the world.' He also stated, 'If you do [threaten me and the U.S. people], beware, because America will hold you fully accountable, and we won't be nice about it!'

**Night of 250 drones attack Ukraine in record 'aerial terror' onslaught**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia launched a record 'aerial terror' onslaught with over 250 drone attacks on Ukraine, one day before the three-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion. 'Every day, our people stand against aerial terror,' Zelensky said on X. The attack saw more strikes than any other single attack since the war started on February 24, 2022. Ukraine's air force said 138 drones had been shot down over 13 Ukrainian regions, with 119 more lost en route to their targets. Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, with one person killed in a missile strike on the city of Kryvyi Rih. Zelensky expressed fears that US President Donald Trump's push for a quick resolution to the war would result in lost territory for Ukraine and vulnerability to future Russian aggression. Trump has suggested that Kyiv started the war and called Zelensky a 'dictator', prompting alarm and anger in Ukraine.

**US Launches Aerial Attacks Against Islamic State in Somalia**
The United States carried out 'aerial attacks' against several fighters of the extremist group Islamic State (IS) in Somalia, announced US President Donald Trump. The attacks targeted a leader of the group responsible for planning attacks and 'other terrorists he recruited and directed in Somalia,' explained Trump on his social media platform Truth. This was the first attack in Trump's second term. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the attacks by the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) were directed by Trump and coordinated with the Somali government. An initial Pentagon assessment indicated that multiple operatives were killed and no civilians were injured in the attacks. Trump wrote on the social media platform that the attacks 'destroyed the caves where they lived and killed many terrorists without harming civilians.' Trump said, 'For years, our military has had this Attack Planner of ISIS in its sights, but (former President Joe) Biden and his cohorts did not act quickly enough to do the job. I acted!' Trump added, 'The message to ISIS and to all those who want to attack Americans is this: 'We will find you and kill you.' The US military authorities warned that the IS cells have received increasingly more guidance from the group's leadership, which has moved to northern Somalia. This guidance included how to kidnap Westerners for ransom, how to learn better military tactics, how to hide from 'drones,' and how to build their own small quadcopters ('drones' with four propellers). In May 2024, a US military airstrike in Somalia targeted IS militants and killed three people, according to AFRICOM. It is estimated that the number of IS militants in the country is in the hundreds, mostly scattered in the Cal Miskaat mountains in the Bari region of Puntland, according to the International Crisis Group, a think tank focused on defense and security issues.
