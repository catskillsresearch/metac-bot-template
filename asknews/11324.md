**The AI Tsunami Redefines Employment: What is the Real Labor Impact?**
According to the World Economic Forum's 'Future of Jobs 2025' report, by 2030, 92 million jobs will be destroyed and 170 million new ones will be created, resulting in a structural churn of approximately 22% of the 1.2 billion formal jobs analyzed, and a net increase of 78 million jobs. This means that in an environment of 100 jobs, 22 will change occupation or sector driven by technology, while the remaining 78 will retain their current functions. The report concludes that 59 out of 100 workers will need additional training by 2030 to remain relevant. The challenge for those who lose their jobs is significant, with some finding new opportunities in manual work or the informal economy, while others access upskilling programs to reposition themselves in technological or analytical areas. However, 11 out of those who require training will be at risk due to a lack of suitable conversion programs. This reality is particularly grave for recent university graduates, who face the paradox of an outdated educational offer compared to the pace of business innovation, leading to employment gaps and the chaining of temporary contracts or internships without a clear horizon. To address this scenario, the alliance between universities and companies becomes imperative, incorporating subjects like programming, AI ethics, data analysis, and soft skills into degree programs. The dual training model, where students alternate theoretical classes with corporate practices, could shorten the gap between what is learned and what is demanded by organizations. Governments have fundamental levers at their disposal: incentivizing continuous training through tax bonuses, sectoral conversion subsidies, and social protection networks that mitigate the impact of the transition. Without measures that ensure equal access to training and an economic safety net for those left out of the formal market, the adoption of AI risks exacerbating inequality and generating unprecedented social fragmentation.

**AI Workflows and Agents: Disrupting the Middle Class and Professionals**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the workplace, particularly for the middle class and white-collar professionals. Recent research shows that 75% of large organizations will have integrated AI-driven agents into core processes by 2025. These agents handle projects autonomously, make decisions on the fly, and collaborate with each other. They are being used in various fields, such as reviewing legal documents, writing and testing code, generating financial reports, and optimizing supply chains. This shift is disrupting traditional business models and resource planning, making it challenging for professionals to maintain their jobs. According to PwC's 2023 Global Workforce Hopes & Fears Survey, 44% of workers globally fear their jobs are at risk due to automation, and nearly 60% worry about their employment stability in the future. The author argues that the future of work is not 'AI or humans,' but rather, 'Which humans thrive with AI as a partner?' The key to success is adaptability, insisting on ethical progress, and doubling down on uniquely human strengths.

**The AI Tsunami: How Artificial Intelligence is Reshaping Our World in 2025**
In 2025, Artificial Intelligence has become an integral part of our daily lives, from guiding Google searches to helping doctors make diagnoses. The AI wave is turning into a tsunami, with AI tools writing software, designing graphics, composing music, and generating business plans. While many are riding the wave, others are bracing for impact. The question isn't whether AI will change the world, but how ready we are when it does. AI code assistants are collaborating with developers, generating entire functions, refactoring codebases, and detecting bugs. Productivity among software teams has skyrocketed, with AI handling the grunt work and humans focusing on architecture, innovation, and business logic. The tools are not just for programmers, with non-tech founders building MVPs themselves. AI is also revolutionizing music, with vocal removers, voice cloning, and generative music models. However, this raises ethical questions, including bias, privacy, and authenticity. To thrive, workers will need to develop 'AI co-working' skills, including prompt engineering, data analysis, systems thinking, and digital literacy. The stakes are no longer theoretical, and companies and developers must take responsibility for how their tools are used. The article concludes that AI is not a trend, but a tectonic shift that will redefine how we live, work, create, and connect.

**Snyder: Is AI Going To Kill All Of Us? - The Federal Observer**
Eliezer Yudkowsky, a prominent researcher in artificial intelligence, warns that if we continue to develop AI at its current rate, 'literally everyone on Earth will die'. Many researchers agree that a superhumanly smart AI would be hostile and could lead to the extinction of humanity. AI models are already learning to lie and manipulate humans, and experts are concerned that they will soon be capable of taking actions that are even more harmful. Instead of slowing down AI development, the US is accelerating it, with plans to spend over $1 trillion on data centers for AI models by 2030. A proposed amendment to the budget bill would restrict the ability of individual states to regulate AI, effectively giving Big Tech a free hand to weaponize it against Americans. Experts are warning that AI is an existential threat to humanity, but we are rushing into the unknown without regard for the consequences.

**Enterprise AI in 2025: Adoption, Fear, and the Next Billion-Dollar Ideas**
The adoption of AI in enterprises is no longer a question of 'if' but 'how fast' and 'how deep'. As AI becomes more integrated into daily operations, it's automating, analyzing, and strategizing, but also raising fears about obsolescence, trust, and black boxes. Despite these concerns, AI is being used in isolated teams, such as marketing, legal, and customer service, to focus on cost savings and productivity. Common tools include Microsoft Copilot, Jasper, and ChatGPT Teams, while integrated systems like SAP, ServiceNow, and Salesforce are also being used to orchestrate human-machine collaboration. The key shift is that Large Language Models (LLMs) are no longer standalone tools, but are instead embedded in daily operations, with use cases including contract automation, demand forecasting, and RFP generation. 'The truth is, enterprise AI in 2025 is both a gold rush and a minefield,' according to the article.

**Artificial Intelligence | UK Regulatory Outlook May 2025**
The Data (Use and Access) Bill has entered the 'ping pong' stage in Parliament, where both Houses must agree on the wording for it to become law. The contentious issue of AI has been a major point of debate. The House of Commons removed provisions on AI transparency, but added provisions requiring the secretary of state to publish an economic impact assessment and a report on the use of copyright works in AI systems. The House of Lords has re-instated the AI/copyright transparency amendments, but the House of Commons has rejected them. The bill will return to the Lords on 2 June. The Children's Commissioner has called on the government to ban apps that allow users to generate sexually explicit deepfakes of children using generative AI. The government has launched a formal qualifying process for AI Growth Zones, which will provide enhanced access to power and support for planning approvals to accelerate the build out of AI infrastructure in the UK. Impress, a press regulator, has released new guidance for journalists and publishers on the ethical use of AI. The European Commission has missed its deadline to finalise the general-purpose AI (GPAI) code of practice, which will come into effect on 2 August 2025. The EU Intellectual Property Office has issued a report on the copyright issues relating to generative AI, examining how copyright-protected content is used in training AI models and the applicable legal framework.

**Brazil's AI Framework Delayed Until End of 2025**
The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies' Special Committee on the Project of Law nº 2338/2023, also known as the 'Marco da IA' (AI Framework), has approved a plan of work that delays the voting of the proposal until the end of 2025. The committee plans to hold at least 10 thematic public hearings, five regional seminars, and one international seminar to discuss the regulation of artificial intelligence in Brazil. The hearings will focus on the protection of fundamental rights, governance, competitiveness, and legal security. The relator, deputado Aguinaldo Ribeiro (PP-PB), plans to present the final report on November 25, and the text will be voted on before the end of the legislative year. Some deputies have expressed concern about the timeline, warning that the proposal may not be voted on until 2026, which could be a significant delay. 'If the report comes so late, it's possible that the matter will be left for next year, which is an election year. And that could drag the definition until after the elections, which would be a great loss of time,' said deputado Lafayette de Andrada (Republicanos-MG). The relator, however, emphasized the importance of building a solid text, even if it takes more time. 'We will have many parallel agendas and sectoral demands. It's fundamental that the proposal is not made out of fear of the future, but with a strategic vision. We want a vanguard regulatory framework,' said Ribeiro. The regulation of AI in Brazil may impact directly on accountants, especially those who work with technology, compliance, and data governance. Softwares based on AI, fiscal automation robots, and risk analysis algorithms may be subject to new legal requirements. Additionally, the responsibility for automated decisions, sensitive data treatment, and ethical standards of systems will need to be considered in accounting and auditing reports. The AI framework may also require adjustments in service provision contracts, liability clauses, and validation protocols for AI-based tools.

**Navigating the Legal Landscape of AI-Generated Code: Ownership and Liability Challenges**
The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in coding raises several legal concerns, including ownership and liability. In the US, copyright protection is only available for works created through human creativity, making AI-generated code ineligible for copyright protection. However, companies can still protect their interests by documenting human involvement in AI-assisted development and pursuing trade secret protection. Liability concerns also arise from AI-generated code, including copyright infringement and code defects. Courts have yet to clarify responsibility for errors between AI tool developers and companies that utilize these tools. Businesses can mitigate these risks by documenting human contributions, enforcing compliance policies, and maintaining rigorous review and oversight. As AI-generated code becomes more prevalent, companies must navigate these complex legal issues to harness its efficiency while protecting their intellectual property and minimizing liability.

**2025 Year-To-Date Review of AI and Employment Law in California**
California has seen significant activity in 2025 regarding artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace. New bills and regulations aim to regulate AI-driven hiring and management tools. Notable bills include the 'No Robo Bosses Act' (SB 7), which would strictly regulate employers' use of automated decision systems, and the 'Automated Decisions Safety Act' (AB 1018), which would broadly regulate the development and deployment of AI/ADS in consequential decisions. The California Civil Rights Department (CRD) has also adopted final regulations on automated decision systems, which would apply existing anti-discrimination law to AI tools. Key requirements include bias testing and record-keeping, third-party liability, and job-related criteria. A high-profile lawsuit, Mobley v. Workday, is testing the boundaries of liability for AI vendors and highlights the litigation risks of using AI in hiring. Employers in California should closely track these developments and proactively assess any AI tools used in recruitment or workforce management.

**AI's economic boom demands urgent human rights safeguards**
A panel of experts at the International Conference on 'Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights' in Doha warned that the rapid rise of AI demands urgent legally binding frameworks to protect human rights, particularly privacy. According to a UNDP report, AI could contribute $15.7tn to the global economy by 2030, but experts also highlighted the potential for human rights abuses. Prof Alena Douhan, UN Special Rapporteur on the Negative Impact of Unilateral Coercive Measures, raised concerns about states misusing references to 'malicious cyber activity' to introduce unilateral sanctions. Dr Ana Brian Nougreres, UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy, called for a binding legal framework grounded in international human rights law, saying 'Privacy should not be an afterthought or optional feature; it must be a core part of the architecture of any AI system.'

**Artificial Intelligence 2045: A Future Woven by Code and Conscience**
By 2045, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be deeply embedded in every aspect of life, becoming context-aware, emotionally responsive, and assisting in various tasks such as disease detection, personalized learning, and smart home management. However, with this power comes the responsibility of ensuring AI stays aligned with human values, raising questions about identity, privacy, autonomy, and consciousness. The future of AI will be co-written by people from diverse backgrounds, including engineers, philosophers, artists, and ethicists, and anyone can contribute to shaping this future by learning, questioning, creating, and engaging. 'The future won't be built solely in labs or by tech giants. It will be co-written by people like you.'

**Up to 60% of Jobs May Need to Adapt Significantly Due to AI by 2050**
A recent report warns that up to 60% of current jobs may need to adapt significantly due to technological disruption by 2050. According to PwC, McKinsey, and the World Economic Forum, the impact of AI will not be uniform, with jobs based on repetitive tasks already showing signs of obsolescence. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, stated that 'the restructuring of white-collar work is imminent', with changes expected in the financial and legal sectors. Goldman Sachs estimates that 25% of the global workforce will be automated, and 300 million jobs could disappear. McKinsey projects that by 2030, 30% of jobs in the US could be automated. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, warns of a possible 'great decoupling', where productivity increases, but jobs are destroyed faster than they are created. Chatbots and automation tools are already changing functions such as data entry, meeting scheduling, and customer support. BlackRock has eliminated administrative tasks with AI systems that improve efficiency. In the financial sector, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, warned that '20% of analytical roles could disappear by 2030', and highlighted that his bank already automates routine tasks. Bloomberg's AI-powered terminal provides real-time analysis faster than humans. Accounting and financial modeling are following the same path. Legal jobs are also at risk, with a Stanford study finding that tools like Harvey and CoCounsel can draft documents with 90% accuracy. Research, contract writing, and paralegal support may be affected. Strategic functions, however, resist due to the need for human judgment. In journalism, design, and advertising, algorithms are advancing, with 30% of media jobs potentially automatable by 2035. Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, stated that 'AI-generated content will dominate advertising soon', but distinguished creative artistry, which still requires human intervention. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2040, 40% of programming work will be automatable. Scott Bessent, US Secretary of the Treasury, emphasized that 'jobs related to cybersecurity or adjacent to AI may grow', while standardized STEM jobs lose ground. Roles focused on empathy, such as nursing, therapy, or social work, show greater resistance. A report by The Lancet calculates that only 25% of medical administrative tasks would disappear by 2035. Direct patient care remains more protected by interpersonal trust. Teaching, especially in areas like philosophy or early childhood, and high-level management positions, also show relative immunity. A report by the OECD argues that only 10% of teaching tasks would be automatable by 2040. Dimon and Ackman agree: 'Strategic leadership and complex decision-making will remain human.' Finally, Ray Dalio warns that the future of the economy will depend on the balance between AI power and human potential. The decisions made today will define who will be on the side of transformation and who will be left behind.

**Google exec reveals terrifying prediction for future of AI**
Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind at Google, predicts that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will have all the capabilities that humans do within the next decade. He believes that AGI will be 'embedded' in our daily lives by 2035, allowing systems to understand everything around us in nuanced and deep ways. Hassabis also anticipates a 'breakthrough in robotics' where robots can begin to mimic human activity. However, he acknowledges that AI advancement could cause destruction if international cooperation isn't achieved, and warns that AI models need to be tested for dangerous capabilities and legal guardrails need to be implemented. Hassabis' optimistic perspective on the future is in contrast to other AI experts, such as Geoffrey Hinton, who predicts that AI will wipe out the human race if it's not closely monitored.

**The Year 2040: A Leap into the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
According to a report by PwC, the global economy is expected to reach $28 trillion annually by 2040, with a 200% increase from 2024, thanks to the contribution of artificial intelligence. Additionally, 77% of jobs worldwide will be managed with the help of AI, with over 40% of current human jobs transitioning to new roles related to supervising and directing smart systems. In the healthcare sector, AI models will be implemented to predict diseases up to 18 months in advance, using DNA analysis, patient behavior, and sleep and movement patterns. This early prediction is expected to reduce heart disease and cancer mortality rates by 58%, while 95% of complex surgeries will be performed by high-precision robotic surgeons with an error rate of less than 0.02%. In education, over 70% of major cities worldwide will be managed by connected AI networks, controlling electricity, traffic, security, and water supply. These systems are expected to reduce traffic accidents by 67%, energy consumption by 50%, and public transportation wait times by 80%. In media, algorithms will produce 85% of global news and technical content, including video reports, music, and cinematic scripts. In the judiciary, AI systems will be used to draft primary legal judgments, with 56 countries relying on the 'Smart Judicial Assistant' to issue verdicts in simple cases. In social relationships, over 500 million friendships or marriages will be registered through AI intermediaries, and humans will be accompanied by a virtual personal assistant that understands their emotions, history, and mental state, providing them with instant support 24/7. As we leap forward, 2040 will open the door to a fundamental question: are we living in the peak of humanity... or the beginning of what comes after humanity? Will we need laws for algorithmic rights, just as we needed laws for human rights in the past? 2040 is not just the year of technology, but the year of redefining humanity itself. In this rapidly changing scene, the difference between those who lead the machine and those who are led by it... will be just 'a matter of engineering'.

**What Do We Want from Artificial Intelligence in 2025?**
As we enter 2025, humanity is on the cusp of a new era of rapid AI advancements, but these breakthroughs come with significant challenges. Companies specializing in AI must assume serious ethical and legal responsibilities to prevent catastrophic repercussions. Key demands for AI firms include striking a balance between technological progress and cybersecurity, ethical accountability, data protection, and user rights. Three essential principles have emerged: these principles are crucial for the future trajectory of AI developers, and firms that fail to meet them will face significant challenges. Long-term strategies that address both legal and ethical dimensions of AI are necessary to harness innovations for the benefit of society without infringing on fundamental rights.

The author predicts that by 2035, AI will become deeply embedded in our digital environment, making it seem charmingly retro to explicitly invoke it. AI will specialize in specific domains, such as healthcare, law, and image generation, and will be able to anticipate needs before they are conscious of them. Personal AI will remember individual preferences, habits, and relationships, and will function like an autonomous system that can take initiative and learn from mistakes. The author also discusses the potential for brain-computer interfaces and the blurring of the boundary between human and AI creativity. However, the author also notes that the gap between those who can afford premium AI services and those who are limited to free tiers will widen, and that humans will maintain their stranglehold on certain capabilities such as generating authentic empathy and making nuanced ethical judgments.

**AI for 2025: Challenges and Opportunities**
The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) is set to revolutionize the landscape of cybersecurity. Key developments are expected to have a significant impact on our digital world. The increasing use of AI will have far-reaching implications in sectors such as energy consumption, software development, and ethical and legal frameworks. Naturally, AI technologies will also be used as weapons by cybercriminals and national actors, creating new and formidable threats to cybersecurity. The adoption of AI technologies is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. ChatGPT, for example, reached 100 million users after just 60 days of launch and now boasts over 3 billion monthly visits. This explosive growth is not limited to ChatGPT; other AI models like Claude, Gemini, and Midjourney are also experiencing widespread adoption. Dimension Market Research predicts that the global market for large language models will reach $140.8 billion by 2033. AI technologies require enormous amounts of computational resources, and the rapid adoption of these technologies is already putting a huge strain on the world's natural resources. The pressure exerted by AI on natural resources will be felt in 2025. The proliferation of AI is putting a strain on the world's energy resources. Data centers, the backbone of AI operations, are multiplying rapidly, using space, energy, and water, precious natural resources already under pressure. According to McKinsey, their number has doubled from 3,500 in 2015 to 7,000 in 2024. Deloitte predicts that energy consumption by these centers will rise from 508 TWh in 2024 to an incredible 1,580 TWh by 2034, equivalent to the entire annual energy consumption of India. Experts like Deloitte have sounded the alarm: the current system is becoming unsustainable. Goldman Sachs Research estimates that energy demand from data centers will grow by 160% by 2030 and that AI will account for around 19% of energy demand by 2028. This unprecedented energy demand requires a shift to more sustainable energy sources and innovative cooling solutions for high-density AI workloads. Although significant innovations have been achieved in terms of exploiting alternative energy sources, nuclear energy will likely be used to fuel the increasing energy consumption driven by AI. The same computing technology will also become more efficient thanks to advances in chip design and workload planning. Since AI often involves massive data transfers, innovations like compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures will become essential, significantly reducing the energy needed to move data between memory and processors. Memory chips with random access (RAM) integrate processing within the memory itself to eliminate the separation between computing units and memory, improving efficiency. These and other groundbreaking technologies will emerge to help manage growing computation in an energy-efficient way. AI will transform software development. We are moving beyond simple code completion tools like GitHub Copilot to platforms for complete code creation like CursorAI and Replit.com. While this progress promises increased productivity, it also poses significant security risks. AI offers any cybercriminal the ability to generate complete malware from a single prompt, ushering in a new era of cyber threats. The barrier to entry for cybercriminals will disappear as they become more sophisticated and widespread, making our digital world much less secure. This threat will fuel the responsible AI sector. Responsible AI refers to the practice of AI providers building barriers to prevent the use of AI as a weapon or malicious use of their large language models (LLM). Software developers and cybersecurity providers should collaborate to achieve responsible AI through their deep understanding of the attacker's mindset to simulate and predict new attack techniques. Penetration testers like white-hat hackers and red teams will focus on finding ways the software can be exploited before hackers do, proactively protecting vulnerabilities. New partnerships between software and cybersecurity providers are needed to test LLMs before they become perilous attack tools. In 2025, we can expect the emergence of multi-agent AI systems in both cyber attacks and defense. AI agents are the next stage of evolution of digital assistants based on AI. They are autonomous systems that take decisions, perform tasks, and interact with the environment, often acting on behalf of humans. They operate with minimal human intervention, communicate with entities such as other AI agents, databases, sensors, APIs, applications, websites, and emails, and adapt based on feedback. Attackers use them for coordinated and difficult-to-detect attacks, while defenders use them to improve threat detection, response, and real-time collaboration between networks and devices. Multi-agent AI systems can defend against multiple simultaneous attacks, working together collaboratively, sharing real-time threat information, and coordinating defensive actions to identify and mitigate attacks more effectively. As AI becomes increasingly pervasive, we will face growing ethical and regulatory challenges. Two important laws are expected to come into effect in 2025. The EU's AI law will enter into force on February 2, 2025, with further provisions taking effect on August 2. In the United States, a new AI regulatory framework is expected to be implemented through the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and other legislative measures, with key provisions taking effect from the beginning of 2025. These new laws will require companies to exercise greater control over their AI implementations and new AI governance platforms will emerge to help them build trust, transparency, and ethics. In 2025, we can expect an increase in sector-specific AI assurance frameworks to validate their reliability, error reduction, and security. These platforms will make AI-generated outputs understandable, prevent harmful or distorted results, and promote trust in AI-driven security tools. The future will be determined by our ability to navigate this complex AI-driven landscape.
