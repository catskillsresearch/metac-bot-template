**LAFC embraces ‘massive game’ with Club América in FIFA Club World Cup qualifier**
Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) is set to face Mexican giant Club América in a high-stakes showdown on Saturday night at BMO Stadium. The winner will secure a spot in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and a guaranteed $9.55 million payday. According to Hugo Lloris, 'there's nothing for granted in football. Just live the moment. Enjoy the moment. But at the same time you don’t want to have any regrets.' Lloris, along with close friend and teammate Olivier Giroud, hopes to win together one more time. Giroud noted, 'it could be nice to meet Chelsea again' in the tournament's Group D, alongside Brazilian standout Flamengo, Espérance Sportive de Tunis and English power Chelsea FC. LAFC brought in the veteran winners to provide poise and results in pressure-packed games, after regret in similar situations became the Black & Gold story in the season prior to their arrival. Defender Ryan Hollingshead said, 'This in a sense is a way to redeem that and get us that berth in the Club World Cup.' The teams' only official encounter came in 2020, with LAFC winning 3-1. Lloris noted, 'Listen, last time we played them in our stadium, I know it was only a friendly game, but there was more yellow in the stands than black jerseys.' Home fans will occupy the standing section in the North End, while a strong contingent of América supporters is expected to overtake the opposite side of the stadium.

**Brazil's Crisis: A Team in Need of a Savior**
Brazil, the king of football, is experiencing a crisis without end. The absence of leaders, the lack of a coach, and the dream of Carlo Ancelotti as a savior are some of the factors that have led to the team's downfall. The team has not won a title since 2019, and their last World Cup victory was in 2006. Argentina, on the other hand, has risen to become the best team in the world, winning the Copa América in 2021, the World Cup in 2022, and the Copa América again in 2023. Brazil needs a change, and the arrival of Ancelotti could be the solution. He has a good relationship with some of the team's players, such as Vinicius, Rodrygo, and Endrick, and is known for his ability to get the best out of his players. The next challenge for Brazil is the 2026 World Cup in Los Angeles, where they will face the maximum pressure of being the king of football.

The Brazilian national team secured a 3-1 victory over Paraguay in the opening match of the South American Under-20 Championship, maintaining their 100% record and earning a spot in the 2025 FIFA World Cup. The team, led by coach Ramon Menezes, has been working to overcome their disappointing elimination in the 2023 World Cup quarterfinals against Israel. Menezes emphasized the importance of respecting Paraguay and avoiding complacency, as they had done in their previous match against Colombia. The Paraguayans, who had been defeated 4-0 by Colombia in their first match, were determined to win and needed a victory to stay in contention. The Brazilian team took the lead with a goal from Gustavo Prado, and Wesley scored a second goal in a counterattack. However, Paraguay responded with a goal from Aguayo, and the match became a back-and-forth affair. In the end, Brazil secured the win with a goal from Alisson, and Menezes made some tactical changes to ensure the result.
