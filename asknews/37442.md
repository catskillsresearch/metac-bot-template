**Börsen-Tag: Experts Expect Economic Recovery, but Warn of Trade Policy Risks**
According to Jörg Krämer, Chief Economist at Commerzbank, the sixth consecutive increase in the Ifo business climate is a clear signal that the economic downturn is behind us. He expects the German economy to recover, not due to better conditions for businesses, but mainly due to the large government financial package and the ECB's interest rate cuts. For 2026, he forecasts a growth of 1.4%. Alexander Krüger from Hauck Aufhäuser Lampe Privatbank notes that the current situation is still affected by the events in the Middle East, but the confidence in future business development is increasing. Jens-Oliver Niklasch from LBBW believes that the improvement in early indicators will continue, and that the current good reasons for cautious optimism include supportive monetary policy, expanding fiscal policy, and the possibility of a less restrictive trade policy between the EU and the US. However, he identifies the US trade policy as the biggest individual risk for the economy, and warns that negative news from the US could lead to a sharp downward correction in expectations.

**US Business Activity Slows Amid Ongoing Tariffs and Rising Inflation**
Business activity in the United States slowed slightly in June, while prices continued to rise amid ongoing strict tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on imported goods, fueling expectations of accelerating inflation in the second half of the year. According to a survey conducted by 'Standard & Poor's Global', the prices that manufacturers pay for production inputs and the prices they charge for final products rose to their highest levels since 2022. The company noted that about a third of the manufacturers who reported an increase in production input costs attributed it to tariffs, while more than half of them linked the rise in sales prices to these tariffs, according to 'Reuters'. These results support economists' expectations of a return to rising inflation starting in June, after a series of relatively positive readings on consumer and producer price indexes in recent months. Some experts believe that the response to inflation from tariffs was relatively slow because companies were consuming inventory purchased before the implementation of these tariffs. The composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the United States fell to 52.8 points in June compared to 53.0 in May (May). Readings above 50 indicate economic expansion. The initial manufacturing index remained at 52 points, while expectations pointed to a decline to 51. The services index fell to 53.1 points compared to 53.7 in May, in line with expectations. The survey was conducted between June 12 and 20, before the United States' involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Chris Williamson, chief economist at 'Standard & Poor's Global Market Intelligence', said, 'The initial data for June suggests that the US economy continued to grow at the end of the second quarter, but expectations remain uncertain, amid a clear increase in inflationary pressures over the past two months.' Other economic data, such as retail sales, the labor market, and the housing sector, showed signs of slowing down the economy due to the uncertainty related to the changing trade policies, while the tensions in the Middle East added to the complexity of the economic scene. Inflation on the verge of acceleration The new orders index fell to 52.3 points in June compared to 53 in May, while the index of prices paid for production inputs fell to 61.6 points from 63.2 points. However, manufacturers saw a sharp increase in production input costs, with the index rising to 70 points, its highest level since July 2022, compared to 64.6 points in May. Service companies' input costs continued to rise, driven by tariffs, rising financing costs, wages, and fuel prices. However, strong competition contributed to limiting the pace of the increase. The sales price index, which reflects companies' ability to pass on costs to consumers, continued to record high levels, rising to 64.5 points for manufacturers, its highest since July 2022, compared to 59.7 points in May. The recent increases in oil prices, due to the escalation in the Middle East, are expected to fuel further inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve's board kept the main interest rate unchanged last week within a range of 4.25% - 4.50%, which has not changed since December last year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that inflation remains a major challenge in the coming period. Williamson added, 'The data confirms the expectations that (the Fed) will keep interest rates stable for a period, to evaluate the resilience of the economy and the continuity of the current inflation wave.' Employment showed a significant improvement this month, driven by a major boost from the manufacturing sector, which is suffering from a backlog of orders. 'Standard & Poor's Global' noted a slight increase in industrial companies' optimism, 'partially driven by hopes of achieving greater gains from trade policies.' However, it added that 'levels of optimism remain lower than before Trump took office'.

**Morgan Stanley Remains Optimistic About US Stock Market Despite Conflict**
Despite the escalating conflict between the US, Israel, and Iran, Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about the US stock market. According to a report published on Monday (23), the bank believes that the impact of the conflict on the market will be short-lived. Historically, the S&P 500 index has seen average gains of 2%, 3%, and 9% in the periods of one, three, and twelve months after geopolitical risk events. The bank also points out that the current oil price increase is not a significant threat to the economic cycle, as it would require a sustained interruption in oil supply through the Strait of Hormuz, which is not expected. 'The risk is more related to oil than to the conflict itself', the report states. Additionally, the bank's optimistic view is based on economic fundamentals, including a projected growth of two-digit earnings per share (EPS) until the first half of 2026, driven by positive operational leverage and a weak dollar. The bank also sees the current monetary context as favorable to stocks, with a potential for seven interest rate cuts in 2026, starting as early as July this year. The bank's recommendation is to prefer large-cap stocks, such as those in the S&P 500, over smaller-cap stocks, and to maintain an overweight position in energy and an underweight position in consumer goods to mitigate the effects of potential oil price increases. 'Unless there is a sustained and significant increase in oil prices, recent events do not change our constructive view for stocks in the next 6 to 12 months', the report concludes.

**US Economy in Contraction: Key GDP Data This Week**
The US economy is already in contraction, and this week's GDP data will be a key indicator. The data on employment in the US could provide clues about the next steps in monetary policy. Hans-Jörg Naumer, Global Head of Capital Markets & Thematic Research at Allianz Global Investors, notes that 'the market will also be very attentive to initial and continued unemployment benefit claims, as they may provide clues about the next steps in monetary policy.' Lale Akoner, global market strategist at eToro, says that 'given the magnitude of market fluctuations in the first months of 2025, it is not surprising that investors are becoming increasingly cautious about the global macroeconomic situation. This market turbulence, combined with the ongoing ambiguity about the future dynamics of international trade, is configuring what retail investors perceive as risk.' The US market will also be watching the publication of the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) index, a closely followed indicator by the Fed that measures changes in the prices of goods and services acquired by consumers, according to Naumer.

**US Economy Heads Towards Recession in 2025, Says BCA Research**
Despite a recent reprieve in tariffs, Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, still projects a recession in 2025, accompanied by a strong correction in the stock market. He reduced the probability of recession from 75% to 60%, but remains in his base scenario. In this case, he projects that the S&P 500 index could fall to 4,500 points, a drop of around 25% from the levels recorded last Friday. 'It's not a crushing probability of recession, but it's still my main scenario,' he said. Berezin believes that it wouldn't take much for the index to plummet, citing that it would only need to be traded at 18 times earnings per share (EPS) with an EPS of $250. Currently, the index is around 23 times EPS with an EPS of $260. He warns that the US economy was already fragile before the escalation of trade tensions. He notes that the decline in job openings since 2022 has reduced the resilience of the labor market. Other analysts, such as Sam Tombs, have also pointed to a weakening in small business hiring. Meanwhile, delinquency in credit cards and loans is increasing: in the first quarter of 2025, credit card debt in arrears reached 3.05%, the highest level since 2011. The return of student loan debt collection, after years of suspension, also affects family credit. The housing market is still under pressure, with low supply and high prices making it difficult to access housing. In May, new launches fell 9.8%, which Berezin sees as another sign of deceleration. Even with the temporary pause in tariffs, the effective interest rate remains at 15%, a high level according to Berezin. For the strategist, levels above 10% already cause damage to the economy. If new agreements are not reached, companies must begin to pass on costs to consumers, exacerbating the scenario. He evaluates that Trump should not back down from the 10% tariff base applied to various countries, unless the market pressures him. Additionally, there is a risk of new tariffs in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and wood, which could intensify the economic impact. Even if Trump bets on a new package of tax cuts, such as the 'Big Beautiful Bill', Berezin warns of fiscal risks. Unfunded stimuli can increase the yields of public bonds, canceling out the positive effects. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposal would increase the GDP by 0.5% per year, but increase the interest rates of Treasuries by 14 basis points and the deficit by $2.8 trillion. For the specialist, a market crisis may be the only factor capable of forcing a change in tariff policy. He believes that the fall of the S&P 500 below 5,000 points and the rise of Treasuries above 4.5% were decisive for the tariff pause. 'We can see more relief, but only if the market demands it. I don't believe it will come from anywhere else,' he concluded.

**Morgan Stanley Remains Optimistic About US Stock Market Despite Conflict**
Despite the escalating conflict between the US, Israel, and Iran, Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about the US stock market. According to a report published on Monday (23), the bank believes that the impact of the conflict on the market will be short-lived.

**Key Indicators for the Week Ahead: Ibov, Dollar, Nasdaq, S&P 500, and BTC**
The week ahead is expected to be intense for global markets, with a packed agenda of economic events that could impact asset prices. In the US, the focus is on economic indicators such as durable goods orders and GDP data, while the conflict between Israel and Iran is also on the radar. Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress will provide clues on the Federal Reserve's next steps, affecting risk appetite and stock market indices. In Brazil, the Central Bank's Copom meeting will shed light on the monetary authority's stance after maintaining the Selic rate. This combination of factors is expected to bring volatility to the Ibovespa and dollar futures. Investors are monitoring key supports and resistances on the charts of the Ibovespa, dollar futures, Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Bitcoin, seeking opportunities or warning signs for the next trading sessions. 'The Ibovespa ended the last week in a correction movement in the short term, after renewing its historical top in the 140,381 points range. Despite the bullish bias over 2025, the index closed the week in decline and began to test a LTA (line of trend of high) of the high channel. The closing occurred below the 9 and 21-period moving averages, reinforcing the need for attention to the next movements.' The S&P 500 has been showing a recovery movement in the short term, after reaching the year's minimum at 4,835 points, attracting buying force and changing the short-term bias of the index. Since then, the S&P 500 has accumulated a 0.95% gain in June and elevated its gains in the year to 1.47%. 'For the S&P 500 to retake the upward flow, it will be necessary to overcome the region of 6,059 points; conquered that resistance, the index may seek the 6,147 points (historical maximum), with projected targets in 6,195 points and in the range of 6,300/6,308 points.' On the other hand, to continue the downward flow of the last week, the index will need to break the support in 5,963/5,843 points. The loss of that range may lead the S&P 500 to test the supports in 5,767/5,720 points, with the possibility of extension to 5,580/5,500 points, if the downward movement gains strength.

**Germany Expected to Outperform US Economy in 2026**
According to the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research (IMK), Germany's economy is expected to grow stronger than the US in 2026, with a predicted GDP growth rate of 1.5% compared to the US's 1.2%. The IMK expects the economy to recover from the recession in 2025, with a growth rate of 0.2%. IMK Director Sebastian Dullien said, 'The political uncertainty in Germany has decreased, as have energy prices, which is boosting consumer spending.' A key driver of the recovery is expected to be government investments and funding programs, which are expected to provide additional growth impulses of over 40 billion euros in 2026. Additionally, private consumption is expected to increase due to higher real wages and improved conditions, provided that social cuts and a halt to the minimum wage do not occur. However, the US faces risks due to President Donald Trump's erratic economic policy, which could lead to new trade conflicts or geopolitical upheavals, potentially pushing the US into a recession.

**The 10 Most Democratic Countries in the World in 2025, According to the Latest International Ranking**
The latest 'Democracy Index' report from The Economist Intelligence Unit reveals that Norway remains the most democratic country in the world, followed by New Zealand and Iceland. However, the report highlights an increase in authoritarian regimes globally, raising serious questions about the future of democracy. The analysis examines the health of 167 democracies, scoring them in five key categories. Although Europe still dominates in terms of democracies, the global index shows a concerning decrease in overall score, reflecting a context of political disaffection that could have long-term repercussions. According to the 'Democracy Index', the most democratic countries in 2025 are: Norway, New Zealand, and Iceland. The report notes that over a third of the world's population lives under authoritarian regimes, with 60 countries classified as 'authoritarian regimes', an increase from previous years. The global score of the index has decreased from 5.23 in 2023 to 5.17 in 2024, reflecting a growing sense of discontent. Civil liberties and electoral processes have been the most affected categories, with significant deterioration since 2008. However, political participation has shown a slight improvement, suggesting that, despite challenges, there is a growing interest in citizen participation. Interestingly, some countries have improved their position in the index. The UK has risen from 18th to 17th place, while Portugal has been upgraded to the category of 'full democracy'. Estonia and the Czech Republic have also achieved this status for the first time in years. In contrast, the US remains in 28th place, classified as a 'defective democracy'. The stability of its checks and balances will be crucial in determining its classification in the future. The 'Democracy Index' of 2025 provides a clear view of the global democratic situation. Despite advances in some countries, the increase in authoritarian regimes and the decline of civil liberties are concerning. The health of global democracy will depend on the ability of countries to address these challenges and promote active and effective political participation.

**The Democracy Index 2024: A Cry for Alarm**
The Democracy Index 2024 from The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) is a cry for alarm. With a global average score of 5.17 (out of 10), the lowest in years, the message is clear: democracy is in intensive care. In 2024, a year where over half of humanity went to the polls, the result was not a democratic revitalization, but a somber verdict: only 45% of the world lives in some type of democracy, while a chilling 39.2% - over 3.2 billion people - are under the yoke of authoritarian regimes. Confidence is crumbling, governments are fortifying themselves, and citizens, tired of empty promises, are torn between apathy and populism. However, in this landscape of shadows, 25 nations emerge as titans of 'full democracy', a fierce reminder that the ideal is still alive - if we are only willing to fight for it. In the American continent, full democracy is a rare luxury, reserved for three exceptional nations: Canada (8.69, ranked 14th), Uruguay (8.67, ranked 15th), and Costa Rica (8.29, ranked 18th). Canada stands out with a political participation score of 8.89, reflecting a people that does not give up. Uruguay, with a perfect electoral process (10.00), embodies a tradition of inclusion that endures over time. Costa Rica, with civil liberties of 9.71, remains a peaceful oasis in a turbulent region. In contrast, giants like the United States (7.85) languish as 'imperfect democracies', weighed down by distrust and polarization. The rise of figures like Nayib Bukele in El Salvador (4.61) shows how security is negotiated at the cost of freedom. These three full democracies are beacons in a hemisphere where most struggle between hybrid regimes and pure authoritarianism. The Democracy Index 2024 is not a passive diagnosis; it is an ultimatum. Since 2008, civil liberties have fallen a devastating -1.00 and electoral processes a -0.66, while government functioning (4.53 global) has sunk into mediocrity. In 2024, 83 countries worsened, 47 stagnated, and only 37 improved, figures that scream dysfunction. The 25 countries of full democracy are not an elite club; they are a challenge, a mirror that shows us what we could be. For the Dominican Republic, the United States, and the world, the clock is ticking: either we reform our democracies with transparency, inclusion, and real power for the people or we surrender to the 60 authoritarian regimes that already dominate over a third of humanity. This is not an analysis to file away; it is a call to wake up before it is too late.

**Is Latin America Condemned to Lose Its Voice?**

However, in this landscape of shadows, 25 nations emerge as titans of 'full democracy', a fierce reminder that the ideal is still alive - if we are only willing to fight for it. These are not just numbers; they are living proof that free elections, effective governments, and guaranteed rights can coexist - but only where there is a will. In the American continent, full democracy is a rare luxury, reserved for three exceptional nations: Canada (8.69, ranked 14th), Uruguay (8.67, ranked 15th), and Costa Rica (8.29, ranked 18th). Canada stands out with a political participation score of 8.89, reflecting a people that does not give up. Uruguay, with a perfect electoral process (10.00), embodies a tradition of inclusion that resists time. Costa Rica, with civil liberties of 9.71, remains a peaceful oasis in a turbulent region. In contrast, giants like the United States (7.85) languish as 'imperfect democracies', weighed down by distrust and polarization. The Democracy Index 2024 is not a passive diagnosis; it is an ultimatum. Since 2008, civil liberties have fallen a devastating -1.00 and electoral processes a -0.66, while government functioning (4.53 global) has sunk into mediocrity. In 2024, 83 countries worsened, 47 stagnated, and only 37 improved, figures that scream dysfunction. The 25 countries of full democracy are not an elite club; they are a challenge, a mirror that shows us what we could be. For the Dominican Republic, the United States, and the world, the clock is ticking: either we reform our democracies with transparency, inclusion, and real power for the people or we surrender to the 60 authoritarian regimes that already dominate over a third of humanity. This is not an analysis to archive; it is a call to wake up before it is too late. Will Latin America remain trapped between populisms and broken promises? Can the Dominican Republic break free from clientelism and claim its place among full democracies? Or are we all condemned to see how authoritarian silence silences our voices? The future is not yet written, but I firmly believe that we can move towards full democracy.

**Opinion | What the numbers say about the erosion of American freedom**
Freedom in the United States is at risk, according to various measurements of democracy and personal freedom. The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom shows a decline in economic freedom since 2020, with the US ranking 27th in personal freedom and 5th in economic freedom. The Cato Institute's Human Freedom Index also shows a drop in personal freedom during the pandemic era, with the US ranking 27th out of 180 countries. The Freedom House's Freedom in the World measure rates the US as a 'flawed democracy' with a low score among G-7 countries. The Economist Group's Democracy Index also shows a decline in democracy in the US, particularly during Trump's presidency. Analysis from the Varieties of Democracy project shows a significant drop in liberal democracy in the US between 2016 and 2017. Additionally, the World Press Freedom Index shows a decline in press freedom in the US and most other G-7 countries. These measurements suggest that freedom in the US is at risk, particularly in terms of personal freedom and democracy.

**Norway Leads Democracy Index, Cuba, Venezuela, China, and Russia Follow Among the Worst**
The Economist magazine has released its Democracy Index 2024, an annual study that evaluates the level of democracy in 167 countries based on five criteria: electoral process and pluralism, government functioning, political participation, political culture, and civil liberties. According to the magazine, the report reveals a concerning picture: global democracy is at its worst level since 2006, when the ranking was created. The Economist states that 'the global democratic recession continues to deepen'.

**Just 6% of the world's population live in a full democracy, new report claims**
A new report by the Economist Intelligence Unit has found that democracy has hit a record low around the world, with a global democracy index score of just 5.17 out of 10. Only 25 countries have been designated as full democracies, out of 167 countries covered in the index. The report warns that the United States remains a 'flawed democracy', with an index score of 7.85 out of 10, and that 2025 may bring changes to the US democracy score with uncertainty around checks and balances. The report's authors also note that political participation has improved between 2008 and 2024, but that electoral processes and pluralism, and civil liberties have both deteriorated in the same time frame. Just 6.6 per cent of the world's population now lives under a full democracy, down from 7.8 per cent in the previous year. 'There is a risk of the president seeking retribution, using the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to go after political enemies, which would also erode checks and balances,' says the report. 'Civil liberties of immigrants, migrants, other minorities and protesters [are] also at risk,' it adds.

**Authoritarianism rises worldwide, new index reveals**
The Economist Intelligence Unit's 2024 Democracy Index revealed a slight decline in the global democracy score to 5.17, reflecting growing public disillusionment with democratic institutions. Despite the presence of formal institutions, citizens are frustrated by government gridlock, corruption, and a disconnect between elites and the public. The report highlights a 'democratic recession,' with weakened civil liberties, electoral process, and functioning of government. Western Europe is the only region to register a marginal improvement, while regions like the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia experience notable declines. The findings suggest that many democracies are failing to address citizens' needs, leading to rising support for populist alternatives. Analysts warn that unless governments reform to become more inclusive and responsive, trust in representative democracy will continue to erode, potentially emboldening autocrats and destabilizing political systems.

**Democracy Index: World Democracy Hits 20-Year Low**
The Economist's Democracy Index has shown that democracy in the world is in its worst state in the last two decades. The index, which is compiled annually by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), evaluated 167 countries and territories based on five criteria. The results showed that the global average score has dropped to a record low of 5.17, down from 5.55 in 2015. Only 6.6% of the world's population lives in fully democratic countries, compared to 12.5% ten years ago. A significant portion of the world's population, approximately two out of five people, live under authoritarian rule. Norway topped the list with a score of 9.81, followed by New Zealand and Sweden. Ukraine ranked 92nd with a score of 4.9, classified as a 'transitional' or 'hybrid' regime due to the ongoing war and centralized power. The EIU notes that holding free and fair elections in Ukraine would be impossible at present. Despite a record number of elections held in 2024, with over 1.65 billion votes cast in more than 70 countries, the Democracy Index shows no growth in democracy worldwide. Russia, for example, scored 2 out of 10, with 'fake elections' securing Vladimir Putin's fifth presidential term. Other countries, such as Burkina Faso, Mali, and Qatar, cancelled elections altogether. Even in Europe, where nine out of ten most democratic countries are located, a significant decline in democracy was observed. France was downgraded from a 'full democracy' to a 'flawed democracy' due to declining trust in the government after the 2024 elections. Rumania also worsened its score after cancelling the presidential election results, amid signs of Russian interference. South Korea was removed from the list of 'full democracies' after its president declared and then revoked a state of emergency, plunging the country into crisis. The US remains a 'flawed democracy', with its position potentially worsening further due to President Donald Trump's actions, which have raised concerns about the independence of the public service and the issuance of executive orders of questionable legality.

**EIU's 2024 Democracy Index: trend of global democratic decline and strengthening authoritarianism continues through 2024**
The Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) 2024 Democracy Index reveals a decline in global democratic trends, with a total score of 5.17 (on a 0-10 scale), down from 5.23 in 2023. According to Joan Hoey, Director for the Democracy Index, 'autocracies seem to be gaining strength, while the world's democracies are struggling.' The decline was driven by reversals in every region except Western Europe and North America. The functioning of government and electoral process and pluralism categories registered the biggest declines, with the latter declining by 0.08 points. The report highlights the factors contributing to popular dissatisfaction with democratic systems, including gridlock, corruption, and a lack of accountability, which have led to a decline in public trust in democratic institutions.
