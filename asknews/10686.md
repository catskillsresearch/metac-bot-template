**Q&A with Jim Obergefell on the future of Supreme Court's gay marriage ruling, LGBTQ rights**
Ten years after the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case, expresses concern about the future of LGBTQ+ rights. Obergefell, who married his partner John Arthur in 2013, reflects on the decision's impact and the current threats to marriage equality. He notes that two Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, have expressed a desire to overturn the decision, and that state legislatures are passing resolutions urging the court to do so. Obergefell also discusses the backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the targeting of transgender Americans. He emphasizes the importance of people across the country standing up against hate and pushing back against extremist legislation. Obergefell remains optimistic about the future, citing the need for a national realization that hate is not the way for the country to operate. He encourages people to vote and to support the LGBTQ+ community, particularly the trans community, which he believes is being unfairly targeted.

**Wusband and Wife: Whitman’s Big Gay Wedding**
Whitman College senior Lita Bacus and alum Fi Black, her 'wusband,' held a wedding ceremony that doubled as a performance art piece for Bacus' senior art thesis, 'Queerly Beloved.' The ceremony, which was officiated by President Sarah Bolton, was open to the public and aimed to reclaim the term 'dyke' as a positive identity. Bacus said that the event was a protest against the increasing hostility towards the LGBTQIA+ community, citing recent rhetoric against gay marriage. The ceremony was attended by a crowd of young punks and queers, and featured a dress code of 'dyke decadence.' Bacus wore a black and grey wedding dress that she sewed herself, while Black wore a white suit with the Dykemint logo. The couple's fashion brand, Dykemint, has been featured in New York Fashion Week. Bacus said that the 'stars aligned' for the ceremony, which fell during lesbian visibility week and near the ten-year anniversary of the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court ruling. Wedding attendant Rocio Lybarger-Yanes said that witnessing the ceremony felt like a celebration and a 'giant fuck you to the Trump administration.'

**After 775K gay marriages, Americans are still fighting for rights 10 years later**
Ten years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, the LGBTQ+ community is still fighting for rights. Despite 775,000 same-sex marriages in the U.S., opponents are introducing resolutions and bills to challenge the decision. Public support for same-sex marriage remains high, but there are ongoing legislative efforts targeting the LGBTQ+ community, particularly transgender individuals. Legal experts believe overturning Obergefell is possible, highlighting the vulnerability of LGBTQ+ rights. Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark case, is worried about a backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion, and marriage equality. 'They don't believe we deserve the right to form families and to have a life where we can enjoy the same rights, the same protections, the same responsibilities as anyone else,' Obergefell said. Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, married her wife in 2015 and believes the Obergefell decision brought relationships out of the closet and increased understanding of the LGBTQ+ community. However, she is certain that opponents will continue to try to unravel the civil right. 'I don't think there is a safe corner of public policy in the United States right now,' Antonio said. Even 10 years ago, Antonio said she wasn't certain the Obergefell decision would be totally locked in 'because of the fact that people use our community as a pawn when they see fit and don't worry at all about any kind of retribution or consequence.'

**Ohio man who challenged same-sex marriage ban has died**
Arthur Obergefell, an Ohio man who challenged the state's same-sex marriage ban, has passed away. He and his partner, John Arthur, decided to get married after the US Supreme Court's decision striking down portions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. Due to Arthur's terminal illness, they had to travel to Maryland to get married, and then filed a lawsuit in federal court in Cincinnati against the state and the city, claiming that failure to recognize their marriage violated the equal protection clause of the US Constitution. The case moved quickly through the court, with federal Judge Timothy Black issuing a temporary order requiring that Arthur be listed as married on his death certificate and Obergefell be named his surviving spouse. Arthur's terminal illness played a significant role in the case, as it allowed the couple to argue that they would face 'irreparable harm' if Arthur was listed as single on his death certificate. Arthur's family plot at Spring Grove Cemetery is limited to direct descendants and their spouses, so the question of recognizing their marriage also influenced where he was buried and whether his partner could someday be buried next to him. 'It's been a swell of anonymous support,' Arthur said in August, referring to the publicity from his court case, which gave him a link to the outside world as hundreds of people sent gifts, letters and cards of support. 'It's truly the supporters who are seeking us out to congratulate us and acknowledge us and give us words of support and thanks.'

**Pride Month starts this weekend. Here’s what to expect - WTOP News**
Pride Month starts this weekend with events around the world celebrating LGBTQ+ culture and rights. This year's celebrations in the U.S. are focused on speaking out against policies that restrict transgender people and end diversity, equity and inclusion programming. According to Wes Shaver, president and CEO of Milwaukee Pride, Inc., 'We're feeling that people will be showing up, and that's their protest.' The event's theme is 'Celebrating the Power of Pride' and will feature only transgender performers for the first time. Several big companies have pulled back on sponsorships for Pride events this year, including Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo, leaving organizers short of budget. However, some companies have kept contributing but asked not to be listed publicly as sponsors. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which recognized same-sex marriage nationwide.

**Support for same-sex marriage stays strong as party divide widens, poll shows**
A recent Gallup poll shows that 68% of Americans still support same-sex marriage, a decade after the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. While overall support has remained steady, party opinions have shifted, with Democrats reaching a record high of 88% support and Republicans dropping to 41%, their lowest level since 2016. The gap between Democrats and Republicans is now 47 points, the widest it's been since Gallup started tracking this issue 29 years ago. Democrats and Republicans are also growing further apart on the issue of same-sex relationships being morally acceptable, with 86% of Democrats and 38% of Republicans agreeing, respectively. This growing political divide could put LGBTQ+ rights at risk, as some Republican lawmakers have pushed for the Supreme Court to overturn the decision on same-sex marriage.

**The U.S. Supreme Court Could Realistically End Cannabis Prohibition in the Near Future**
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently rejected a lawsuit by Massachusetts-based cannabis businesses seeking to overturn the federal ban on marijuana. However, the plaintiffs' attorney, Jonathan Schiller, said they will seek Supreme Court review. Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed skepticism about the federal government's approach to marijuana policy, and some legal experts believe the case has a realistic chance of being taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Court takes up the case, the three liberal justices may side with Justice Thomas in ending prohibition, potentially ending the federal ban on personal freedom grounds. A decision could be expected by mid-2026, potentially making it a key issue for the midterm elections.

**Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, is the marriage equality ruling next?**
As Pride Month 2025 begins, many in the LGBTQ+ community are worried about the potential loss of federal recognition of gay marriage, similar to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. While there are laws in place to protect same-sex marriage, some experts believe it's not impossible for the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. 'Some of it is unlikely, but I don't think any of it is impossible,' said Rick Kavin, a political science teacher at Rutgers University. 'It's way more likely than it was five years ago, that's for sure,' he added. Gay married couples are starting to ask themselves: What's our plan of action? What's our escape route? Some are even considering rushing into matrimony while the door is still open. 'I think there may be a try,' said Brielle Winslow-Majette, deputy director of Garden State Equality, a statewide LGBTQ advocacy group. 'I don't think it is far-fetched to say that it could happen.' Meanwhile, experts are advising married gay couples to make sure their wills, health proxies, and other documents are in order, in case a worst-case scenario unfolds.

**The Experiences of LGBTQ Americans Today**
A recent Pew Research Center study surveyed 3,959 LGBTQ adults in the United States to understand their experiences 10 years after the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The study found that LGBTQ adults have mixed views on social acceptance, with 73% of gay or lesbian adults and 68% of transgender adults saying they have been subject to slurs or jokes because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Transgender adults are about twice as likely as gay or lesbian adults to say this has happened to them recently. The study also found that 70% of transgender adults say they have feared for their personal safety at some point, and 42% say they have been treated poorly by health care professionals. Many LGBTQ adults say they were first aware of their sexual orientation or gender identity at an early age but didn’t tell anyone until later. The study highlights the diversity of experiences across and within LGBTQ groups, and underscores the need for continued social progress and acceptance. 'In broad strokes, the survey finds some sense of social progress, as well as a feeling that acceptance will continue to grow,' said the study. However, it also highlights experiences with discrimination, especially among transgender adults. 'But it also highlights experiences with discrimination, especially among transgender adults,' the study noted. 'And it underscores the diversity of experiences across and within LGBTQ groups – from coming out, to navigating public spaces, to connecting with a broader LGBTQ community.'

**First Roe v. Wade, now Obergefell: How gay marriage is next on the Supreme Court's chopping block, thanks to Trump**
Following the lead of the Trump administration, Republican lawmakers in several states are pushing to overturn the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. Michigan Rep. Josh Schriver introduced a resolution asking the Supreme Court to delegate the ruling on same-sex marriage to state law, citing the 'sanctity of marriage' and the Michigan Constitution. Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota are also introducing measures to challenge the Obergefell ruling. Meanwhile, Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee are introducing bills that reinforce the concept of 'covenant marriage' between a man and a woman. Michigan Democrats have condemned the resolution as a 'ridiculous distraction' that doesn't help a 'single Michigan family.' The developments have raised concerns over the future of Obergefell, especially considering the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. However, the Biden administration's 2022 Respect for Marriage Act has codified the right to same-sex and interracial marriage into law, offering some protection to minority groups.

**Resolution introduced to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges**
Several Republicans in the Michigan state legislature have introduced a resolution to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. If the decision were to be overturned, Michigan would revert to its old laws, invalidating every same-sex marriage in the state. Representative Josh Schriver, who introduced the resolution, cited his religious beliefs as the main motivator, stating that 'Michigan Christians follow Christ's definition of marriage as a covenant between a man and a woman.' Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Jeremy Moss, the first openly gay member of the Michigan Senate, have expressed outrage at the proposal, saying it is an attack on the rights of same-sex couples. Protestors showed up to a Republican press conference, chanting 'love is love' and 'hate won't win,' and arguing that their marriage is not hurting anyone. The resolution will need to make its way through committee before it gets a vote on the House floor.

**Michigan legislator introduces resolution calling on Supreme Court to overturn same-sex marriage**
Michigan Representative Josh Schriver has introduced a resolution urging the US Supreme Court to overturn the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which protects same-sex marriage. The resolution, which has 12 co-sponsors, aims to preserve the sanctity of marriage and protect freedom of conscience for Michigan residents, according to Schriver. Schriver has previously spoken out against the ruling, stating that it negatively affects children and that America was 'thrust' into accepting gay marriage by the Supreme Court. This move comes after Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that the decision could lead to the review of other landmark cases, including Roe v. Wade, in 2022.

**Michigan state representative wants U.S. Supreme Court to overturn same-sex marriage**
Michigan Rep. Josh Schriver plans to introduce a resolution urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn same-sex marriage, citing that the landmark ruling Obergefell v. Hodges is 'at odds with the sanctity of marriage.' This move comes after Schriver previously posted on X saying 'Make gay marriage illegal again' and 'American only 'accepted' gay marriage after it was thrust into her by a perverted Supreme Court ruling.' Schriver has a history of posting controversial content, including a white supremacist theory called 'The Great Replacement,' which led to him losing his committee assignment and staff in February 2024. Despite this, Schriver won reelection in 2024 with 68.1% of the votes. Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel responded to the plan, calling it 'deeply dangerous' and stating that Schriver is 'attacking hundreds of thousands of Michiganders who are beloved members of the community.'

Michigan Representative Josh Schriver introduced a resolution urging the US Supreme Court to overturn the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Schriver, who has previously expressed opposition to gay marriage, stated that it offends God and is at odds with the sanctity of marriage. However, LGBTQ rights advocates, including Jay Kaplan of the ACLU of Michigan, argue that the resolution is 'mean-spirited' and 'cruel', and that it would have no legal effect. Kaplan notes that a resolution is not a court case and would require a court case before the US Supreme Court to reconsider the Obergefell decision. The resolution has received pushback from Democrats, with state Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel condemning it as 'deeply dangerous' and 'homophobic rhetoric'.

**The Right-Wing Campaign To Overturn Obergefell Picks Up Speed**
Right-wing anti-LGBTQ activists have been working to overturn the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which guaranteed the right of same-sex couples to marry, since 2015. With the help of far-right justices appointed by President Donald Trump, they believe the time is now 'ripe' to bring a case before the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling. Religious-right attorney Mat Staver declared that Obergefell will be overturned, stating, 'There is no so-called constitutional right in the Constitution to same-sex marriage. That's ridiculous.' Oklahoma state Sen. David Bullard introduced a bill to provide tax credits to married couples who have 'natural' children, excluding LGBTQ couples, in an effort to 'push back on Obergefell.' Bullard stated, 'The reality is we have to push back on Obergefell. If we wait too long, it's going to be too late at some point for us to push back.'

**SCOTUS Needs To Reevaluate Problem It Created In Obergefell**
The Idaho House of Representatives has passed a memo calling on the US Supreme Court to 'reverse' its 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage. The memo argues that the decision redefined marriage in opposition to its natural definition and is 'illegitimate overreach.' Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have previously argued that Obergefell should be overturned, citing its lack of basis in the 14th Amendment and its 'ruinous consequences for religious liberty.' The article argues that Obergefell is logically intertwined with the transgender movement, as it declared that some people are 'designed by nature' to marry members of the same sex. The author suggests that Obergefell's logic is similar to the trans argument, which denies physical reality and claims that a person can be a member of the opposite sex. The article concludes that Obergefell should be scrapped and replaced with something rational that respects those who wish to be in committed same-sex relationships.
