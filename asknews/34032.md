**'Lei Antimáfia': Lewandowski's Proposals Enter Final Stages of Elaboration**
Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski plans to submit the 'Lei Antimáfia' (Anti-Mafia Law) project to the National Congress in June. The main points of the proposal include creating specific preventive measures for organized crime groups, increasing the severity of punishment for leaders of factions, and establishing tools to confiscate illicit assets. The project aims to curb the activities of factions within and outside Brazil. A working group at the Ministry of Justice is reviewing the draft, which will then be sent to the ministry's legal consultancy before Lewandowski signs and sends it to Congress. Although it will be sent after the Security PEC, the 'Lei Antimáfia' may be approved before, as a constitutional amendment requires more votes than a bill.

**House of Representatives Adjourns Until May 25, Approves Amendment to Pharmacy Law**
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr. Hanafi Gobali, has adjourned the general session of the House until May 25, 2024. This decision comes after the approval of a government-proposed law to amend some articles of Law No. 127 of 1955 regarding the practice of pharmacy. The law aims to separate the academic study that leads to a Bachelor's degree from the training certificate that is obtained after completing the mandatory training and university studies. According to MP Karem Badr Helmy, the Chairman of the Health Committee, the law aims to achieve equality between students of pharmacy colleges and other health colleges in Egypt, in line with international and regional developments. He explained that the current scientific reality has shown the need to establish a new system of pharmaceutical education in Egypt, which is in line with the actual needs of the labor market. The new system, called 'FARM D' (PHARMD), has been implemented and students have been accepted since the 2019/2020 academic year. However, in practice, there is a difference between the study system for pharmacy students to obtain a Bachelor's degree and the study system for other health colleges. The Chairman of the Health Committee emphasized the need to introduce a legislative amendment to the Law on the Practice of Pharmacy to separate the academic study from the training certificate, in order to achieve equality between students of pharmacy colleges and other health colleges in Egypt.

**Lee Jae-myung's Perjury Trial Postponed Until After June 3 Early Presidential Election**
The Seoul High Court has postponed the first hearing date for the appeal trial of Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party of Korea's presidential candidate, who is accused of perjury. The court changed the original date of May 20 to a later date due to Lee's recent registration as a presidential candidate. As a result, all of Lee's criminal trials will be postponed until after the June 3 early presidential election. The court had previously postponed the trial of Lee's corruption case to June 24, and the trial of the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology case to June 18. The court accepted the argument that the election date should be taken into account, citing the Constitution's Article 116, which guarantees equal opportunities for candidates. Lee's team had requested the postponement, citing the need to ensure equal opportunities for the candidate's election campaign.

**Ko Chien-ming: Amendment to Holiday Act Should Not Raise Constitutional Issues**
The Legislative Yuan recently passed an amendment to the 'Holiday and Festival Implementation Act' to add Teacher's Day, Taiwan's Retrocession Day, and Constitution Day as national holidays. This has raised concerns about whether the Executive Yuan will initiate a review of the amendment. National Party legislator Hsu Yu-chen urged Premier Chou Hsi-wei to clarify the government's stance on the issue. DPP legislator Ko Chien-ming responded by saying that the amendment should not raise any constitutional issues and is simply a policy choice. He also hinted that the political environment and party composition of the Legislative Yuan may change next year, and that the issue can be re-examined then. Ko questioned whether the KMT and PFP legislators who supported the amendment will be able to retain their seats in the next election, and urged the public to remain calm. Despite the Executive Yuan's silence on the issue, the Ministry of Civil Service has announced that it will revise the 2025 second-half calendar to include the three new national holidays. The 2026 holiday schedule will be announced after collecting opinions from various parties.

**Trump's Revenge Campaign Targets the National Archives and Records Administration**
US President Donald Trump has fired Archivist Colleen Joy Shogan without reason, and her deputy William J. Bosanko resigned after being threatened with dismissal. Trump's actions violate the United States Code, which requires the President to inform Congress of the reasons for the dismissal. Trump has appointed Marco Rubio as the new head of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), with Jim Byron, president and CEO of the Richard Nixon Foundation, as his deputy. Critics see this as part of Trump's 'revenge campaign' against those involved in investigations against him. The National Archives and Records Administration is responsible for preserving and making available documents of permanent value, including the founding documents of the United States. The independent agency is also responsible for publishing laws of Congress, verifying constitutional amendments, and overseeing the storage of presidential records. The Archives have been at the center of controversy in the past, particularly in 2022 when they demanded the release of secret documents stored by Trump at his private residence Mar-a-Lago. Trump has announced that he will replace the head of the NARA, which critics see as an attempt to control the agency and shape the narrative of American history. As the person in charge of the records, Trump will also control what Americans know or don't know about their presidency, according to Bosanko. The free access to documents in archives is a fundamental right in democratic countries, and the National Archives and Records Administration plays a crucial role in preserving and making available these documents. However, the agency's ability to fulfill this role is threatened by Trump's actions, which critics see as an attempt to politicize the agency and undermine its independence.

According to the instructions of Deputy Prime Minister Lê Thành Long, the Ministry of Public Security will establish and manage a system to collect opinions from citizens through the VNeID application, starting from May 6 and ending on May 29. The Ministry will also be responsible for promoting and guiding citizens to participate in the consultation process, as well as coordinating with the Ministry of National Defense and other relevant agencies to ensure security and order during the implementation. After the consultation period, the Ministry of Public Security will compile a report on the results of the opinions received through VNeID and submit it to the Ministry of Justice by May 30.

**We expect to get justice from SC: AIMPLB member Rasheed Farangi Mahali ahead of hearing on Waqf (Amendment) Act**
Ahead of the Supreme Court hearing on the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) member Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali expressed hope for justice. He stated, 'AIMPLB is of the view that these amendments made in the Waqf Act are basically against the right to equality and prohibition of discrimination on the ground of religion, sex, caste or place of birth. These amendments are also against the right to freedom of religion, right to manage religious properties and religious affairs and the right to property. We are expecting that we will get justice from the Supreme Court.' The AIMPLB has planned protests nationwide until July 7 as part of their 'Save Waqf, Save Constitution' campaign. The first phase of the movement includes rallies, meetings, and a human chain in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. A round-table meeting will be held in Hyderabad on May 18, and a women's protest gathering will take place on May 22. The movement aims to protect Waqf and safeguard the Constitution.

**Amended Labor Union Ordinance to Strengthen National Security and Regulation**
The 2025 Labor Union (Amendment) Bill was tabled in the Legislative Council today (April 30). Labor and Welfare Bureau Director, Sun Yut-sin, stated that since the 'anti-extradition bill' protests in 2019, some individuals and groups have attempted to use labor unions as a front to engage in activities that harm national security. The proposed amendments aim to strengthen the power of the Director of the Labor Union Registration Office to supervise and manage labor unions, and to effectively implement the Hong Kong National Security Law and the National Security Ordinance. The amendments include measures to: grant the Director the power to refuse labor union registration or merger applications based on national security needs; prohibit individuals convicted of national security crimes from holding positions in labor unions or signing registration applications; restrict labor unions from receiving funding or donations from foreign forces; regulate labor union members who are also members of foreign organizations; and grant the Director the power to appoint a manager to take over the assets of a labor union whose registration has been revoked. The amendments also aim to strengthen the enforcement powers of the Director and authorized personnel, adjust the penalties for offenses under the Ordinance, and make other improvements to the labor union regulatory system. The Ordinance will come into effect six months after it is gazetted.

**The President doesn’t decide if an amendment has passed**
President Joe Biden announced that the Equal Rights Amendment is ratified, but this decision is not within his authority. According to the Constitution, the archivist of the United States, Dr. Colleen Shogan, is responsible for certifying and publishing the amendment, and the Supreme Court would ultimately decide its validity. However, legal experts question the ratification process, citing lapsed deadlines and rescinded approvals from five states, making Biden's move 'performative and has no substance', according to critics.

**History is written by the winners. History is kept by the archivists.**
The National Archivist, Dr. Colleen Shogan, refused to certify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as the 28th Amendment to the US Constitution, citing 'established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions.' However, President Biden declared the ERA as the 28th Amendment, stating it is 'the law of the land.' This raises questions about the balance of power between the President's executive authority and the National Archivist's role in certifying constitutional amendments. As Dr. Shogan stated, 'At this time, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) cannot be certified as part of the Constitution due to established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions.' The ERA Coalition has also released a video retelling the history of the proposed amendment, highlighting the importance of accurate historical representation.

**More Biden: I Hereby Commute ERA's 1982 Deadline Too**
President Joe Biden declared on Twitter that the 28th Amendment, also known as the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), is the law of the land. However, this claim is not supported by the US Constitution, which outlines the process for amendments. The ERA was never successfully ratified, falling short of the necessary three-quarters of states required for ratification. The National Archives and the Office of Legal Counsel have consistently upheld the deadline established by Congress for the ERA, and the Archivist of the United States has stated that the ERA cannot be certified as part of the Constitution. Biden's declaration is seen as an example of executive overreach, and the National Archives has responded by stating that they will not follow his lead. 'The president is not going to direct the archivist,' a senior administration official said, 'the archivist is required to publish an amendment once it's ratified, so the archivist is required to publish this amendment.' However, the ERA was not ratified under the terms of its own text, and the archivist will not publish it. 'This is a long standing position for the Archivist and the National Archives,' the Archives said in a statement. 'The underlying legal and procedural issues have not changed.'

**'Long Standing Position': National Archives Shoots Down Biden's Last-Minute Bid To Change Constitution**
The National Archives has maintained its position that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is not part of the Constitution, despite President Joe Biden's statement that it is the 'law of the land.' A spokesperson for the National Archives said, 'This is a long standing position for the Archivist and the National Archives. The underlying legal and procedural issues have not changed.' The Archivist of the United States, Dr. Colleen Shogan, and Deputy Archivist, William J. Bosanko, stated in December that the ERA 'cannot be certified as part of the Constitution due to established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions.' The Biden Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel also found in 2022 that 'the ERA Resolution has expired and is no longer pending before the States.'

**World News | Biden Says Equal Rights Amendment Should Be Considered Ratified | LatestLY**
President Joe Biden announced that the Equal Rights Amendment should be considered ratified, stating, 'It is long past time to recognise the will of the American people.' However, it's unclear if his statement will have any impact, as presidents do not have a role in the amendment process. The National Archives leader has said that the amendment cannot be certified due to a deadline set by Congress. A senior Biden administration official clarified that Biden was not directing the archivist to certify the amendment. The Equal Rights Amendment, which would prohibit discrimination based on gender, was sent to the states for ratification in 1972 and has been ratified by 38 states, but the archivist requires Congress or the courts to change the deadline to consider it certified.

**National Archives rebuffs Biden’s attempt to add Equal Rights Amendment to Constitution**
The National Archives has rejected President Biden's claim that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is now part of the Constitution, citing court decisions and the Justice Department's stance that the ratification deadlines are valid. The Archives stated that the ERA's ratifications did not happen before the deadline, and that the president's announcement does not change the underlying legal and procedural issues. The ERA's supporters argue that the post-deadline ratifications should be counted, while opponents claim that the law and court decisions already require equality and that the ERA is a backdoor attempt to enshrine abortion rights. As the National Archives said, 'Court decisions at both the district and circuit levels have affirmed that the ratification deadlines established by Congress for the ERA are valid. Therefore, the Archivist of the United States cannot legally publish the Equal Rights Amendment.'

**‘Legally meaningless’: Experts respond to Biden’s Equal Rights Amendment declaration**
President Joe Biden's declaration that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is 'the law of the land' has been met with criticism from legal experts, who argue that the move is 'unserious' and 'legally meaningless.' The ERA, which aims to guarantee equal rights for women, failed to meet the congressional deadline of June 30, 1982, and U.S. Archivist Colleen Shogan has stated that it 'cannot be certified as part of the Constitution.' Robert George, a professor at Princeton University, called the declaration a 'stunt' that carries no legal force, while Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, described it as 'typical of how [Biden] has operated' and 'legally meaningless and indefensible.' The National Archives office has also reiterated the amendment's dead-letter status, pointing to its earlier statement on the amendment deadline's expiration, which occurred more than 40 years ago.

**Ohio Democrats urge Biden to finalize Equal Rights Amendment implementation**
Ohio House Democrats have written a letter to President Biden urging him to formally publish the Equal Rights Amendment as the 28th amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the process is not that simple, as the amendment's seven-year deadline has expired and court precedent is murky. University of Florida law professor Danaya Wright argued that while the court may have upheld the deadline for the 18th Amendment, it is not a clear-cut case for the ERA. Wright warned that the question will likely wind up back in the courts, with four possible outcomes. The National Archivist has insisted that they cannot legally certify the ERA, citing the need for new action by Congress or the courts. President Biden has reiterated his support for the ERA, but puts the onus for action on Congress. New York's Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has been a vocal advocate for the ERA, insisting that Biden can get it implemented immediately by simply directing the archivist to publish it.
