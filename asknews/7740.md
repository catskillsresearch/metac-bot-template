**One Question Dogs Pa. Cannabis Debate: Should Big Businesses Have a Leg Up?**
The Pennsylvania legislature is debating the legalization of recreational cannabis, but a major question remains: should big businesses have a leg up in the new market? Major companies that sell medical marijuana in Pennsylvania and recreational cannabis in other states are spending millions to influence lawmakers. At least two proposals would allow medical sellers to convert to recreational sales, giving them a head start in the market. Chris Goldstein, a pro-legalization advocate, said this would allow big businesses to dominate the industry and make it difficult for smaller businesses to compete. However, other advocates, such as Kristal Bush, suggest that the state should provide 'pre-industry support' to small businesses, including training and technical assistance, to help them compete. Bush also supports allowing medical dispensaries to convert their licenses, but thinks new licenses should be reserved for small business owners. Damian Fagon, director of the Bronx Cannabis Hub, suggests that lawmakers could implement policies to make the industry more equitable, such as requiring dispensaries to stock products from local growers. However, lobbyists for large medical cannabis companies argue that excluding existing sellers would harm consumers and lead to a surge in unlicensed sellers.

**Ohio's revenue and pitfalls provide insight amid Pennsylvania's marijuana legalization battle**
Ohio's recreational marijuana law, passed in November 2023, is being reevaluated by lawmakers just 10 months after its implementation. The law, which allows for the growth of 12 marijuana plants in a home and a 10% tax on marijuana purchases, has been criticized for its lack of consumer protection and its 'entrapment program' for users. According to Tim Johnson, a consultant who has testified in the Ohio Statehouse, the law has created an 'ultra-low' level of metabolized marijuana in state law, making it difficult for employers to determine intoxication levels. Johnson said that this has led to a high number of positive drug tests among prospective employees. In contrast, Tom Haren, an attorney who advocated for the ballot measure, views the Ohio program as a success and says it has helped to build on the existing medical marijuana infrastructure. The Ohio law has also been criticized for the increase in accidental poisonings reported to Ohio Poison Centers, with nearly 500 children under 6 years old seen in emergency rooms after ingesting a THC-based product in 2024. Pennsylvania lawmakers are taking note of Ohio's experience and are considering their own marijuana legalization bill, which was passed by the House but voted down by a Senate committee. 'Pennsylvania is late to the game, but can learn from the mistakes elsewhere,' said Democratic Rep. Rick Krajewski of Philadelphia. 'We should run away from this as fast as we can, for our kids' sake,' said Aaron Baer, president of the Center for Christian Virtue. 'It goes contrary to everything else we say we care about,' he added.

**The U.S. Supreme Court Could Realistically End Cannabis Prohibition in the Near Future**
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently rejected a lawsuit by Massachusetts-based cannabis businesses seeking to overturn the federal ban on marijuana. However, the plaintiffs' attorney, Jonathan Schiller, said they will seek Supreme Court review. Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed skepticism about the federal government's approach to marijuana policy, and some legal experts believe the case has a realistic chance of being taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Court takes up the case, the three liberal justices may side with Justice Thomas in ending prohibition, potentially ending the federal ban on personal freedom grounds. A decision could be expected by mid-2026, potentially making it a key issue for the midterm elections.

**New Jersey Lawmakers Consider Recriminalizing Some Marijuana Purchases And Sales**
New Jersey lawmakers are considering a bill that would recriminalize the purchase of unlicensed marijuana, which has sparked criticism from cannabis activists. Senate President Nick Scutari (D-Union) sponsored the bill, saying it's necessary to address the 'black and gray market' that has flourished despite the legalization of recreational cannabis in 2020. Scutari claims that unlicensed sellers are operating brick-and-mortar stores and selling cannabis products without regulation. However, cannabis advocates argue that the bill would bring back the criminalization of weed and put people with cancer or chronic pain disability at risk of arrest for accessing a plant that helps them survive. Larry Grant, a cancer survivor and board member of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana, said, 'Recriminalization is not regulation. It’s retaliation.' The committee did not vote on the bill, which does not yet have a companion in the Assembly.

**U.S. Congress: Legislation to End Federal Marijuana Prohibition in Legal States Gains New Sponsor**
Congressmember Gregory Steube has joined the STATES 2.0 Act as its fourth sponsor, a federal proposal to end marijuana prohibition in states that have legalized it. The legislation, reintroduced by Congressmembers Dave Joyce, Max Miller, and Dina Titus, would exempt individuals and businesses from federal enforcement if they are operating in accordance with state or tribal marijuana laws. The bill would also legalize interstate cannabis commerce, overhaul IRS policy, and establish a framework for future federal regulation and taxation of marijuana. This mirrors a version introduced during the previous session of Congress.

**Islanders asked for views on recreational cannabis - Jersey Evening Post**
The Jersey government is inviting islanders to share their views on whether recreational cannabis should be legalized in Jersey. While medicinal cannabis use is permitted for patients with a prescription, recreational use is currently forbidden. The government is urging islanders to complete a survey, which will inform the States Assembly's debate on the issue. Those who complete the survey will also be invited to attend one of three focus group sessions. As stated by the government, the findings will be used to 'inform the Assembly's debate'.

**Ohio Republicans Plan to "Gut" Voter-Approved Marijuana Legalization**
Ohio Republicans are planning to 'gut' the voter-approved marijuana legalization measure, Issue 2, by restricting and slowing down House Bill 160. The bill would make sharing or gifting cannabis, or buying it from out of state, illegal, and limit smoking or vaping marijuana to residential or agricultural spaces. Karen O'Keefe, director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, testified in opposition to HB 160, stating that it would 'gut' the voter-approved measure and eliminate opportunities for social equity applicants. The bill would also divert a larger portion of cannabis tax revenue to the state's general fund, reducing funding for local governments, social equity programs, and substance use disorder treatment. O'Keefe warned that the changes would negatively affect Ohio's legal industry and consumers would find easier and unregulated ways to get their marijuana, driving business across the border to Michigan. According to a survey of 38 local governments, the changes would 'shrink the market' and reduce consumer choice.

**Top U.S. Marijuana Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist Right Now**
The U.S. cannabis industry is expected to grow significantly, with over 80% of Americans supporting some form of legalization. Recent headlines suggest the DEA may reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III, which could ease tax burdens and promote medical research. Analysts project the legal U.S. cannabis market could surpass $71 billion by 2030. Three top marijuana stocks to watch in May 2025 are Verano Holdings Corp. (VRNOF), Cansortium Inc. (CMTNF), and Ayr Wellness Inc. (AYRWF). Verano is a major U.S. multi-state operator with a large retail presence, while Cansortium is a U.S.-based cannabis company operating under the Fluent brand. Ayr Wellness is a vertically integrated cannabis company with operations in several U.S. states. Each of these companies has faced market challenges but continues to position itself for long-term growth. As federal reform efforts progress, these stocks may offer substantial upside.

**State Senate committee rejects bill that would have legalized recreational marijuana in Pennsylvania**
A Republican-led Senate Committee in Pennsylvania has rejected a bill to legalize recreational marijuana, despite it passing the Democratic-led House by a single vote. Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman expressed doubt on whether the issue can move forward, calling the bill 'unserious' and a 'ruse'. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is pro-legalization, has included over $500 million in revenue from a recreational marijuana law in his proposed 2025-26 budget. Shapiro said the House action was an important step, but that a bipartisan compromise is needed. Law & Justice Committee Chairman Dan Laughlin said finding a compromise might be difficult, but possible, and that Shapiro needs to 'roll his sleeves up and help do some of the work'. Laughlin also expressed concerns about the bill, saying it would limit consumer choice and drive customers to other nearby states. Proponent Sen. Marty Flynn said it is time for Pennsylvania to legalize recreational marijuana, citing neighboring states that have already established sales systems.

**Indiana Governor Mike Braun signed a law Tuesday banning marijuana advertising**
Indiana Governor Mike Braun signed a law banning marijuana advertising in the state. The law, which was passed by the Indiana General Assembly on April 29, prohibits advertising for products containing marijuana or listed as a Schedule I controlled substance. This comes as recreational marijuana use is legal in three surrounding states: Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois. The new law will impose fines of $5,000 for first-time offenders and $15,000 for repeat offenders. Existing marijuana advertising agreements cannot be canceled and will remain in effect until 2035, according to the state. As a result, many marijuana businesses from surrounding states have advertised in Indiana to encourage consumers to purchase and partake in recreational marijuana while across the border.

**Potent policy: America's extraordinary evolution on marijuana, in 7 charts**
The United States has undergone a significant transformation in its marijuana laws over the past two decades. In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, and since then, more than half of Americans live in states where recreational use is legal and three-quarters live in places that allow medical marijuana. According to a Gallup poll, the share of Americans who say they smoke weed has more than doubled between 2013 and 2024, but regular pot smokers still represent only 15% of Americans. The public's perception of marijuana's benefits and risks has also shifted, with 70% of Americans now believing that marijuana should be legal and a strong majority believing it is less harmful than alcohol or tobacco. The legal marijuana industry has grown significantly, with almost 15,000 dispensaries and a combined revenue of over $43 billion in 2024. However, the marijuana black market still poses a threat to the future of the legal weed industry, and bringing recreational use to additional states will require convincing conservative voters to back the idea.

**You voted to legalize marijuana, but it's being restricted. Here's what that means.**
Ohioans voted to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023, but the Republican-led Senate is now restricting its use. Senate Bill 56 aims to limit advertising, prevent packages from appealing to children, and decrease the THC content in products. The bill also limits home growing to six plants and reduces the allowable THC levels in adult-use extracts. Medical marijuana will not be impacted by the proposed restrictions. The tax revenue from marijuana sales will be redirected to law enforcement purposes, and the social equity fund will be removed. Citizens cannot stop the bill through the courts, as it is an initiated statute that can be easily changed. Lawmakers justify their changes by saying that voters knew they were voting for marijuana, but not exactly what they were voting for. The bill still needs to pass the House, which is more weed-friendly than the Senate. Ohio's gerrymandered districts make it difficult for Democrats to win, despite the state being relatively evenly divided. Republican Senators voted unanimously to change the marijuana policy, while all Democrats voted against it.

**As Pennsylvania inches toward legalizing recreational cannabis, lawmakers propose selling it in state-owned dispensaries similar to state liquor stores**
Pennsylvania is expected to be a key player in the next wave of recreational cannabis legalization in the United States. Despite a tough election in 2024, where legalization ballot measures failed in several states, advocates are looking to places like Pennsylvania and Hawaii in 2025 as the next fronts in recreational legalization. State Sen. Dan Laughlin has been the clear Republican champion for legalization, working with Democratic state Sen. Sharif Street to build support and find a policy design that works for both parties. However, Republican Senate leadership has remained cool to the idea, and the biggest challenge for legalization in Pennsylvania will be navigating internal political dynamics. Democrats in the state House have proposed selling legal cannabis in state-owned stores, but this approach has significant drawbacks, including the potential for federal repercussions and the development of a 'Big Cannabis' oligopoly. Social equity is another challenge facing recreational legalization, and finding a legislative solution to these thorny issues in a divided government could push legalization forward or stall the effort.

**Florida Republicans sponsoring marijuana expansion bills, including home grow**
Florida Republicans are sponsoring bills to expand marijuana laws, including allowing medical marijuana patients to grow their own plants at home. According to Jodi James with the Florida Cannabis Action Network, this would give patients control over what goes into and comes out of the plant. The House bill also permits recreational use, allowing adults 21 and up to purchase up to two ounces of flower and five grams of concentrate. James is 'very excited' about the bill, saying it would be good for innovation, entrepreneurialism, and ultimately, the consumer. While it's unclear how much support the bills have, voters may get another chance to weigh in on recreational marijuana in the 2026 election.

**Pennsylvania lawmakers clash over legalizing marijuana amid Governor’s budget goal**
Pennsylvania lawmakers are divided on the issue of legalizing recreational marijuana, with Governor's budget proposal aiming to generate $500 million in revenue by 2026. However, Republicans, including Appropriations Chairman Scott Martin, are skeptical about the feasibility of implementing the law by January 2026, citing concerns about increased DUIs, lack of breathalyzer tests, and workplace issues. Senator Sharif Street, a supporter of legalization, believes it will happen this year, arguing that neighboring states are already benefiting from Pennsylvania's citizens buying marijuana there. The Governor's budget wants marijuana legalized by July 1, with implementation by January 1, 2026.

**2024's Cannabis Movement: Big Wins and Some Bumps Along the Way**
2024 was a significant year for cannabis legalization, with new laws, surprising challenges, and growing buzz worldwide. In the US, 24 states fully legalized recreational weed, while Florida, North Dakota, and South Dakota failed to pass recreational cannabis measures. Nebraska legalized medical marijuana, and the DEA proposed rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III. Globally, Germany became the first major European country to fully legalize cannabis, allowing adults to possess up to 25 grams and grow up to three plants at home. However, challenges remained, including unlicensed dispensaries in New York and health concerns like Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome. The cannabis industry brought in billions in tax revenue, with California alone generating over $1 billion. As the movement grows, it will need to address issues like unregulated markets, health risks, and fair access to legalization benefits.
