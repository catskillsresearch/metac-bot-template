**EU Countries Approve Plans for CO2 Border Taxes**
The 27 EU member states have agreed to the European Commission's plans to exempt most companies in Europe from the planned CO2 border taxes starting from 2026, according to the European Union's Council. The relevant ministers approved the proposed changes at a meeting in Brussels. The EU states still need to negotiate the final details with the European Parliament. The European Parliament had previously signaled its support for exempting more than 90% of companies from the taxes. The new EU system, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), will only cover companies that import more than 50 tons of goods per year. However, this would still account for 99% of the emissions generated by imported products, as previously stated in a draft. The CO2 border taxes aim to protect European companies from unfair competition from countries that do not charge climate protection fees. The EU requires companies in the EU to balance the CO2 emissions in imported goods through the tax. This should also prevent the relocation of production to non-European countries. The taxes will be paid through emissions certificates, which importers must purchase in Europe. It is expected that importers will demand price discounts from their suppliers in China, South America, or the US, or switch to European products, which are already burdened with the purchase of CO2 pollution rights. Initially, CO2-intensive goods such as cement or steel will be affected, but the scope is expected to be expanded to all industrial goods by 2030.

**Global Times: Why China, as a developing nation, still committed to carbon reductions?**
China remains committed to reducing carbon emissions, despite some developed countries abandoning their efforts. According to a reader on people.cn, 'Some media reports suggest that certain developed countries have already abandoned their carbon reduction efforts. As a developing country, why does China still remain committed to cutting carbon emissions?' China's commitment to carbon reduction is driven by its own desire to upgrade its economic development model, said Li Changan, a professor at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies at the University of International Business and Economics. 'The country is shifting away from a resource-intensive and extensive growth approach toward one that is innovation-driven and efficiency-oriented. This transformation naturally brings higher environmental standards, including stricter targets for emission reductions, making decarbonization a strategic necessity,' he said. China has made significant progress in optimizing its energy mix, with significant growth in hydropower, nuclear, wind, and solar power generation. The country has also built the world's largest and most complete new-energy industrial chain, and its exports of wind and solar products have helped other countries reduce carbon emissions by approximately 810 million tones in 2023. Carbon reduction is conducive to driving China's green and low-carbon transition and ensuring sustainable development, and is an inherent requirement for promoting high-quality development.

**Are Countries' New Climate Plans Ambitious Enough? What We Know So Far**
The World Resources Institute analyzed the initial submissions of countries' new climate commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), for 2025. The results show that while some countries, such as the U.S., U.K., and Brazil, have made ambitious commitments, many others, including major emitters like the EU and China, have yet to submit their NDCs. The analysis found that the new NDCs submitted so far have made a noticeable but modest dent in the 2035 'emissions gap', with a projected reduction of 1.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2035 compared to 2030. However, this is far from what's needed to keep global warming within safe limits, and many countries, including developed and wealthy economies, have not strengthened their 2030 targets. The analysis also found that some countries, such as the U.K. and Brazil, have set ambitious targets, while others, such as Canada, have made only marginal increases to their targets. The report concludes that much greater ambition and action are needed to narrow the emissions gap and keep global temperature goals within reach.

**Three Studies That Give Us Hope**
Three recent studies have provided positive news that can boost our morale. Firstly, a study of nearly nine million deaths in the US found that taxi and ambulance drivers have a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. The researchers believe that the constant changes in their environment may activate the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for spatial orientation and memory. Secondly, a team of scientists from the Austrian Academy of Sciences has successfully developed brain organoids without using animal testing, allowing them to study the development of the corpus callosum, a brain structure involved in information exchange between the two hemispheres. Finally, China has reported a decrease in CO2 emissions for the first time, thanks to the expansion of renewable energy sources. According to the climate research portal Carbon Brief, China's CO2 emissions decreased by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year, despite increasing electricity demand. 'This shows that climate protection is possible if the right political measures are taken,' said the researchers. 'It is a hopeful message for a better future.'

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**China Unveils Climate Change Standard System, Japan Relaxes Offshore Wind Power Regulations**
China has released a plan to build a climate change standard system, which includes three aspects: basic capacity, reducing climate change, and adapting to climate change. The plan aims to promote the development of green energy and reduce carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the country has launched a fourth round of ecological environment protection inspections, focusing on five provinces and three state-owned enterprises. In other news, Japan plans to relax its regulations on offshore wind power development, allowing for longer project periods and clearer rules for non-Japanese ships. In a separate incident, a chemical plant in Shandong province exploded, killing five people and injuring six. The company's founder, Li Zhen Guo, has resigned as CEO and chairman, and will focus on research and development. China has also seen an increase in sandstorms, with 2060 days of sandstorms in the first four months of 2025, a 24% increase from the same period last year. The main reasons for the increase are drought, high temperatures, and strong winds.

**Building material stocks and embodied carbon dataset for two urban agglomerations in China from 2000 to 2020 - Scientific Data**
A new study provides comprehensive data inventories of material stocks and associated embodied carbon emissions for the cradle-to-gate stage in China's two major urban agglomerations: the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Greater Bay Area (GBA). The dataset, which covers 11 distinct construction materials across 38 cities from 2000 to 2020, aims to facilitate detailed, longitudinal analyses of building materials and their carbon footprints, crucial for sustainable development. According to the study, the 'cradle to gate' stage accounts for approximately 62% of total building embodied carbon emissions, underscoring its substantial role in accurately accounting ECE during early stages. The study contributes to global efforts to meet the carbon reduction targets established by the Paris Agreement and lays the groundwork for informed urban planning and environmental policy. As stated by the study, 'Comprehensive accounting of building ECE, which emphasizes both long-term trends and material-specific emissions, is essential for developing effective carbon reduction strategies.'

**Jamal Al-Loughani: Electricity Consumption Will Double by 2050**
The Secretary-General of the Arab Organization for Energy, Jamal Al-Loughani, predicts that electricity consumption will double by 2050, emphasizing the need for significant investments in all energy sources without exception. Al-Loughani stated that the global trend of interest in renewable energy sources in the first quarter of 2025 will continue, but noted that there are significant differences in investment levels between different regions. He pointed out that the total capacity of global renewable energy reached approximately 4,448 gigawatts by the end of 2024, and that it must grow at a rate of 16.6% annually to achieve the goal of tripling the global cumulative capacity of renewable energy by 2030, as agreed upon during the 'COP 28' climate conference. Al-Loughani emphasized that the concept of energy security differs from country to country, depending on their priorities and economic conditions, and that energy transitions must be fair, comprehensive, and smooth, taking into account the economic and social conditions of each country during the transition to clean energy. He also noted that the concentration of critical minerals in specific geographic regions around the world is increasing concerns about supply chain disruptions and geostrategic risks, as China currently dominates 60% of the global supply chains of rare earth minerals and around 90% of their processing capacity. Al-Loughani highlighted that nuclear energy is a strategic option that holds great opportunities and complex challenges, combining the ability to achieve energy security and reduce carbon emissions on the one hand, and the need to ensure the element of safety and proper handling of waste on the other. He pointed out that there are 440 operational nuclear power plants in 32 countries around the world, with a total installed capacity of 400 gigawatts, and that they provide approximately 9% of global electricity production.

**China's Emissions Peak: A New Era in the Fight Against Global Warming?**
China, the world's largest CO2 emitter, has seen a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Lauri Myllyvirta, a China analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), if current trends in renewable energy growth, electric vehicle sales, and energy demand continue, the conditions for a structural emissions peak are in place. This means that renewable energy will grow so strongly that it will meet the increasing demand for electricity and displace fossil fuels. In the first quarter of 2025, Chinese companies and consumers demanded 2.5% more electricity than in the previous year, but emissions from electricity generation decreased by 5.8% due to less coal and gas being burned. China has built wind and solar power plants with a capacity of 80 GW and 278 GW, respectively, in 2024, which is two-thirds of the world's installed capacity. The Chinese government's goal is to reach an emissions peak by 2030. However, the government's approach to achieving this goal is not through a high CO2 price, but through massive subsidies combined with a hard competition between domestic companies. Claudia Kemfert, an energy economist at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), says that the 'but China' argument is always wrong and that Chinese companies have been 'aggressively' pursuing green markets. She suggests that the argument should be changed to 'look at China' instead of 'but China'. The Chinese government seems to have a business model for a 'sustainable' CO2 reduction, says Wanyuan Song, a China expert at CarbonBrief. The central government in Beijing sets the plans, while the provincial and city governments are responsible for implementation, which can lead to data manipulation. Myllyvirta says that he has no trust in individual data sources and therefore uses data from multiple sources. Despite China's efforts to reduce emissions, the country will likely miss its goal of reducing CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by over 65% compared to 2005 by 2030. Kemfert says that China needs to stop building coal-fired power plants on a large scale to meet the Paris Agreement targets. The Chinese government must fill the gap left by the US withdrawal from the agreement.

**China's CO2 Emissions Decrease in First Quarter 2025, Driven by Renewable Energy Growth**
China, the world's largest emitter of CO2, has seen a 1.6% interannual reduction in CO2 emissions in the first quarter of 2025, according to a study published by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). This reduction is attributed to the growth of renewable energy sources, which have almost doubled the global capacity of the rest of the world. Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at CREA, stated, 'The growth of clean energy production currently exceeds the average, current, and long-term growth of electricity demand, thus reducing the use of fossil fuels.' This is the first time that a decrease in emissions is mainly linked to the growth of clean energy production. However, China still lags behind in one of its 2030 goals, reducing carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per GDP) by 65% compared to its 2005 level. Additionally, coal remains a crucial component in the country's energy mix, with 94.5 gigawatts of new coal-fired power plants being built in 2024, accounting for 93% of the world's total.

**China Reduces CO2 Emissions in First Quarter, Despite Increased Energy Demand**
A China has reduced its CO2 emissions in the first quarter, despite an increase in energy demand, according to a study released on May 15. The country, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has invested heavily in renewable energy in recent years and aims to peak its emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The study, conducted by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), found that the country's wind and solar capacity has nearly doubled the global total. The new installations allowed for a 1.6% reduction in CO2 emissions in the first quarter, said Lauri Myllyvirta, a CREA analyst. 'The growth of clean energy production exceeds the average, current and long-term growth of energy demand, reducing the use of fossil fuels,' Lauri noted. 'It's the first time a reduction like this is linked mainly to the increase in clean energy production.' However, the study also notes that China is still 'very behind' in achieving one of its 2030 goals, reducing carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per GDP) by 65% compared to 2005 levels. Additionally, coal remains an essential element in the country's energy matrix. Despite the progress in renewable energy, China announced the construction of 94.5 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants in 2024, accounting for 93% of the world's total, according to a report published in February by CREA and the Global Energy Monitor (GEM).

**China Sees Slight Decrease in CO2 Emissions Thanks to Renewable Energy Growth**
China has seen a slight decrease in CO2 emissions in the first quarter of 2025, thanks to the growth of renewable energy sources. According to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), this is a significant milestone in the country's transition to a cleaner energy mix. The increase in wind, solar, and nuclear power has allowed China to reduce its CO2 emissions by 1.6% in the first three months and 1% in the 12 months up to March, according to analyst Lauri Myllyvirta. Myllyvirta stated, 'The growth of clean energy production has now surpassed the average and long-term growth of electricity demand, reducing the use of fossil fuels.' The country's energy sector emissions have decreased by 5.8% in the first three months of 2025, offsetting the increase in emissions from the use of coal in the metallurgical and chemical industries. China remains 'significantly off track' to meet its 2030 target of reducing its carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per GDP), according to the Paris Agreement on climate change. Myllyvirta noted, 'The future trend of China's CO2 emissions is uncertain, depending on the performance of each sector of its economy, as well as the response to the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.' Despite the growth of renewables, coal remains a vital part of China's energy mix, with the country initiating the construction of 94.5 gigawatts of coal projects in 2024, accounting for 93% of the global total, according to a report by Crea and Global Energy Monitor.

**China Sees Decrease in CO2 Emissions in First Quarter of 2025**
China has seen a decrease in CO2 emissions in the first quarter of 2025, thanks to the growth of renewable energy, despite a significant increase in electricity demand. This is a notable step in its energy transition, according to a study published on Thursday. China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, aims to peak its emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The country has heavily invested in renewable energy, building nearly twice as much wind and solar capacity as the rest of the world combined, according to a study published last year. 'The growth of clean energy production now exceeds the average and long-term growth of electricity demand, reducing the use of fossil fuels,' said Lauri Myllyvirta, analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). 'This is the first time that such a decline is mainly due to the growth of clean energy production,' he added. The Chinese electricity sector generated 5.8% fewer emissions in the first quarter, allowing it to offset the increases in emissions related to coal use in metallurgy and chemistry. However, China remains 'very behind' on one of its key objectives for 2030, which is to reduce its carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per GDP) by 65% compared to its 2005 level.

**China's Carbon Regulation to Expand and Intensify**
A recent study has analyzed China's national, regional, and corporate goals and policies for achieving carbon neutrality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The authors of the study expect that in the future, part of the carbon credits will be distributed through an auction system on a paid basis, as stated in the temporary rules for managing CO2 emissions trading. However, the exact timeline for launching the paid distribution system and the schedule for increasing its share have not been officially announced. In addition to introducing a paid distribution system, the list of regulated activities will be expanded. Primarily, the steel industry, cement production, and aluminum production will be included in the list. This will bring 1,500 new companies under the carbon trading system, increasing the scope of emissions by 3 billion tons and exceeding 60% of China's CO2 emissions. Further expansion of industries is expected in 2026-2035. Specifically, the national carbon trading system is planned to be expanded to the oil refining and chemical industries, non-ferrous metallurgy, pulp and paper industry, and civil aviation industry. In the case of expanding the system to these industries, it will cover around 75% of CO2 emissions.

**China to cut energy use per unit of GDP by 3% in 2025**
China plans to reduce its energy use per unit of GDP by 3% in 2025, a target slightly higher than the 2.5% goal set for 2024 but below the actual result of 3.8%. The country aims for overall GDP growth of 5% in 2025. China has fallen short of its intensity targets in the past, but a rule change in 2022 made the target easier to reach by excluding renewables and industrial feedstock. The government will set aside energy intensity as a metric starting in 2026, focusing on reducing emissions intensity and overall emissions instead. By 2031, overall emissions will become the primary target, with emissions intensity secondary.

**China cuts carbon intensity in 2024 but still lags on key targets**
China's economy became less carbon-intensive in 2024, with a 3.4% reduction in carbon intensity, according to official data. However, this falls short of the country's goal of 3.9% and its 2025 target of an 18% reduction in carbon intensity over the 2021-2025 period. Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst with the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, stated that achieving the 2025 target 'is extremely hard' and that China's commitment to the United Nations to reduce carbon intensity by more than 65% from 2005 to 2030 may become more challenging. China has only managed to cut intensity by 8.0% from 2020 to 2024, and its fossil fuel energy consumption per unit of economic growth fell by 3.8% in 2024, beating an annual target of 2.5%.

**China Fails to Meet Key Climate Target in 2024**
China failed to meet a key climate target in 2024, with its carbon emissions increasing despite record improvements in renewable energy, according to official data released on Friday. The country's carbon intensity, which measures CO2 emissions per unit of GDP, decreased by 3.4% last year, but fell short of the official target of -3.9%. This setback hinders Beijing's ambition to reduce its carbon intensity by 18% between 2020 and 2025. Moreover, total carbon emissions continued to rise, according to the same source. Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Clean Air and Energy Research Center (CREA), stated that it will be 'extremely difficult' for China to maintain its commitment, citing that even with optimistic assumptions for 2025, the country's CO2 emissions intensity would need to drop by 22% between 2026 and 2030 to achieve its key Paris Agreement goal. China remains the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, although it is investing heavily in renewable energy. Beijing aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

**Analysis: Clean energy contributed a record 10% of China’s GDP in 2024 - Carbon Brief**
China's clean-energy sectors contributed a record 10% of the country's GDP in 2024, with a total value of 13.6tn yuan ($1.9tn). The sectors, which include renewables, nuclear power, and energy storage, grew three times as fast as the Chinese economy overall, accounting for 26% of all GDP growth in 2024. Electric vehicles and solar power were the top growth drivers, making up 39% of the total value of the clean-energy industries. The growth in clean-energy sectors played a key role in driving their overall contribution to GDP in 2024, whereas investment was the driver in 2023. The analysis notes that the growth of clean-energy sectors is expected to continue into 2025, driven by major projects aiming to finish before the end of the current five-year plan. However, the sectors are plagued by weak profitability and oversupply, and returning them to profitability would require maintaining strong domestic demand and measures to address overcapacity. The government's economic stimulus measures are likely to support investment in the clean-energy sectors, given their significant role in investment growth.
