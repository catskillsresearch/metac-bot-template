**Solar System May Lose Planets in the Future Due to Passing Stars**
Scientists simulated encounters between the Solar System and passing stars to reveal the probabilities of planets being lost in space. According to the researchers, 'the passage of stars can alter the stability of planets and Pluto, as well as the secular architecture of giant planets, over the next 5 billion years.' The study, published in Icarus, estimates that there will be approximately 19 encounters per million years per parsec (3.26 light-years) traveled by the Sun. In the simulation for the next 5 billion years, 2% of the scenarios end with planets being ejected into space. Pluto has a 5% chance of becoming unstable due to a perturbation in its giant orbit, while Mercury's proximity to the Sun increases its chance of instability from 50% to 80%. The study suggests that the cases of planet loss will occur in the near future, with the influence of a passing star being the main cause of instability in the Solar System for the next 4 billion years.

**NASA Discovers Potentially Habitable Exoplanet TOI-700 e**
The NASA has discovered a new exoplanet, TOI-700 e, which is potentially habitable. According to Science NASA Gov, the planet is a terrestrial exoplanet that orbits a small, cool star, M-type, and has a mass of 0.818 times that of Earth, takes 27.8 days to complete an orbit around its star, and is located 0.134 AU from it. Emily Gilbert, a postdoctoral researcher at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said, 'This is one of the few systems we know with several small planets within the habitable zone. That makes the TOI 700 system an exciting perspective for additional follow-up. The planet e is about 10% smaller than the planet d, so this system also shows how additional TESS observations help us find smaller and smaller worlds.' The TOI-700 system consists of a small, cool star and four planets, including TOI 700 e, which is about 10% smaller than the planet d. The system is located about 100 light-years away in the constellation of Dorado.

**Discovery of Potentially Habitable Exoplanet K2-18 b**
Scientists have discovered a potentially habitable exoplanet, K2-18 b, which orbits a small star 120 light-years from Earth. According to NASA, the exoplanet has a thick atmosphere rich in hydrogen, and a surface covered in oceans of water. The discovery was made using the James Webb Space Telescope, which detected the presence of methane and carbon dioxide in the exoplanet's atmosphere. The team also found a possible detection of a molecule called sulfuro de dimetilo (DMS), which is only produced by living organisms on Earth. 'Our findings highlight the importance of considering diverse habitable environments in the search for life beyond our planet,' said Nikku Madhusudhan, astronomer at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. 'Traditionally, the search for life in exoplanets has focused mainly on smaller rocky planets, but the larger Hycean worlds are much more conducive to atmospheric observations.' The team plans to conduct further research using the MIRI instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope to validate their findings and gain new insights into the conditions on K2-18 b.

**A Map of the Star Wars Galaxy: Exploring the Vast Expanse**
The Star Wars galaxy is estimated to be 100,000 light-years in diameter, roughly twice the size of the Milky Way. The galaxy is divided into four layers, with the central core being the most influential. The farther a planet is from the core, the less it responds to the central government. The galaxy is home to 3.2 million habitable star systems and 400 billion stars. The map of the galaxy is not complete, and there are many uncharted regions, especially in the outer rim. The author suggests using online resources such as swgalaxymap.com and starwarsgalaxy to explore the galaxy and its many planets, including Mandalore, the home planet of the Mandalorians. The article concludes that the galaxy is vast and complex, with many mysteries waiting to be uncovered.

**Scientists Create New Method for Searching for Extraterrestrial Life**
American astronomers from the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science proposed a revolutionary method for evaluating the habitability of exoplanets, using our own existence around a yellow star as a key argument. The study, published on the arXiv preprint server, suggests that the classical approach to finding habitable planets, which focuses on zones where water can remain liquid, may be flawed. According to the researchers, if humanity emerged around a star of the same type as the Sun (yellow dwarf), rather than the more common red dwarfs, it statistically indicates that the latter are less suitable for complex life. The calculations show that if red dwarf systems were more than eight times more favorable for life than solar systems, the probability of our emergence around a yellow star would be less than 5%. This counterintuitive finding forces a reevaluation of the optimism regarding the habitability of planets around red dwarfs, which make up 70% of the stars in our galaxy. The study also makes bolder claims in the context of the multiverse hypothesis, where fundamental constants can vary between universes. In this scenario, the statistical approach becomes a powerful tool, and the researchers demonstrate that the constraints on the habitability of rogue planets, water worlds, and even environments with non-aqueous biochemistry are strengthened by at least an order of magnitude. The study's finding that the uniqueness of water for life may be overestimated is particularly intriguing, as it suggests that water's 'special' properties may not be as critical if life in the multiverse consistently chooses a water-based environment. This research may fundamentally change the strategies for searching for extraterrestrial life, shifting the focus from a narrow range of 'golden' conditions to a statistical analysis of planetary diversity. Future data from next-generation telescopes will allow us to test these bold predictions in the coming years. 'The fact that we exist around a yellow star is a strong argument that life is not as common as we thought,' said Dr. [no name mentioned in the article]. 'We need to rethink our assumptions about the conditions necessary for life to emerge.'

**Bitcoin's 'Time Bomb': Should the 21M Cap Be Removed? - Crypto News Flash**
Justin Drake, a Bitcoin and Ethereum security researcher, has warned that Bitcoin's security is a 'ticking time bomb' due to its Proof-of-Work mechanism. According to Drake, the current mechanism is unsustainable and may leave Bitcoin vulnerable to attacks. He claims that Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million coins is a critical bug that breaks security. Drake suggests that Bitcoin should switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to fix the issue. He argues that even if Bitcoin reaches a value of $10 million per coin, the daily budget for network security would still be around $65 million, making it vulnerable to attacks. Drake believes that the fundamentals of Bitcoin's security are getting louder and that the issue needs to be addressed. He dismissed alternatives like BitVM and OP_CAT as speculative and insecure.

**What Are The Odds Of Alien Life?**
The Drake Equation is a mathematical framework for estimating the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. While it doesn't provide a definitive answer, it sets parameters for scientists to study and refine as our understanding of the universe expands. Dr. Frank Drake, then president of the SETI Institute, convened a historic meeting at the Green Bank Observatory in November 1961 to discuss the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, attended by luminaries such as Carl Sagan and Philip Morrison. The equation serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for guiding discussions and scientific inquiries into the appearance of life and its development into something capable of sending messages across the light-years. 'It was a privilege to be in the company of so many famous and cerebral individuals,' said Dr. Drake, highlighting the significance of the meeting. 'The equation isn't a formula that spits out a number, but rather a tool for guiding our understanding of the universe and the possibility of life beyond Earth.'

**The Fermi Paradox: A Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Understanding Ourselves**
The Fermi Paradox, also known as the 'Great Silence', highlights the contradictions in our understanding of extraterrestrial life. Despite the passage of time since the Big Bang, we have not found any evidence of their existence, despite recent discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones. According to physicist Enrico Fermi, 'If AI is the brain of a robot, then RPA is its hands.' One factor to consider when searching for an answer to the Fermi Paradox is the number of potential civilizations. This value allows us to determine the Drake equation, a mathematical formula that outputs the number of active, communication-capable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation uses several factors, including star formation rate, percentage of stars with planets, number of habitable planets per star, percentage of planets where life emerged, percentage of planets where intelligent life developed, number of civilizations developing detectable communication technologies, and average lifespan of such civilizations. In short, the Drake equation claims that there should be many civilizations, but so far, SETI programs have not detected any signals. This raises the question of the scientific justification for such programs. Matthew Chilcote's article does not provide a direct answer to this question, but instead proposes a method for evaluating the probability of detecting a signal by a certain number of broadcasting civilizations by now. If the probability is low, the lack of evidence should not be surprising; if it is high, the silence may mean something. Chilcote's model suggests that the absence of detected electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial civilizations may impose constraints on the number of existing civilizations. In certain scenarios, the model predicts a 99% chance of detecting at least one signal if the assumed number of civilizations (based on the Drake equation) is around 1. We have a zero result so far. However, it's worth noting that even the absence of positive results from SETI helps in resolving the Fermi Paradox: it allows us to exclude certain combinations of the number and lifespan of civilizations. Ultimately, as Universe Today writes, the purpose of programs like SETI is not only to search for extraterrestrial life, but also to better understand ourselves and the conditions that make intelligent life possible. A team of scientists from Germany studied the feasibility of a new method of searching for extraterrestrial life - using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They came to an unencouraging but important conclusion for the development of astronomy.

**Echoes in the Void: Tracing the Whisper of Extraterrestrial Life**
The possibility of intelligent life beyond Earth has long fascinated humanity. With an estimated 100 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy and 1 to 2 planets per star, the odds seem stacked in favor of other intelligent life. However, despite numerous searches, no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations has been found. The Fermi Paradox, posed by physicist Enrico Fermi, questions the absence of signs pointing to galactic colonization or the existence of advanced civilizations. Various theories attempt to resolve the paradox, including the Rare Earth Hypothesis, which suggests that complex life is extremely rare, and the Zoo Hypothesis, which proposes that advanced civilizations are intentionally avoiding contact. The search for extraterrestrial life continues, with scientists using the Drake Equation to estimate the likelihood of finding alien life capable of communication. Despite the vastness of space and the limits of current technology, humanity remains united in its curiosity and driven to better understand its place in the universe.

**Did Life Ever Exist on Venus? Scientists Develop New Equation to Find Out.**
Scientists have developed a new equation, the Venus Life Equation (VLE), to determine the probability of life existing on Venus. The equation, presented at the 2025 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, is similar to the Drake Equation and takes into account factors such as origination, robustness, and continuity. According to the authors, the VLE can help us understand rocky planets in the habitable zones of other stars and provide a framework for thinking about life in the galaxy and on Venus. The equation suggests that Venus may have had a period of watery warmth in the past, which could have allowed life to arise and survive to this day in the planet's clouds. However, many factors are still unknown, and the VLE is limited by the 'n=1 problem' of having only one concrete example of life on Earth. The authors write, 'Although we are currently limited by the n=1 problem of having Earth-based life as our only concrete example, we can nevertheless use our understanding of the genesis and evolution of life on Earth to establish a framework for identifying the unknowns and uncertainties of life on other worlds.'

**New Forms of Estimating Alien Life in the Universe: Revisiting the Drake Equation**
Frank Drake, an American astronomer and radio astronomer, developed the Drake Equation in 1961 to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy that might be able to communicate with Earth. The equation is expressed as: N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L, where each term carries significant uncertainties, making it more of a conceptual tool than a precise calculation. Some variables, such as R*, can be estimated with some accuracy, while others, like fi and fc, remain uncertain. Advances in astronomy and astrobiology have refined some of these factors over the years. The discovery of exoplanets has improved our understanding of fp and ne. However, the fraction of planets where life emerges (fl) and evolves into intelligence (fi) remains unknown. 'Intelligence and technological capability seem to be more uncommon phenomena, considering that billions of species existed before one developed the ability to send radio signals into space,' said an expert. The time of life of technological civilizations (L) is another crucial factor. If civilizations are common but have short lifetimes due to self-destruction or natural disasters, the chance of detecting them would be low. This point raises philosophical and scientific implications about the future of humanity. Modern versions of the equation have been developed, incorporating new concepts and refining the original parameters. Some scientists have added variables related to bio-signatures and technosignatures, while others have suggested including terms that address the impact of catastrophic events.

**The Drake Equation and Alien Typologies Catalogued by Ufologists Based on Case Studies**
The Drake Equation, a mathematical formula to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, has been updated to 2025. Using values such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, and the average lifespan of a technological civilization, the equation yields an optimistic N = 0.08, implying we might be alone or nearly so. In contrast, ufology has compiled an array of alleged alien races, drawing from a wealth of testimonies that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the sighting of certain extraterrestrial typologies. When merging the Drake Equation with ufologists' alien typologies, two approaches emerge: either the lifespan of civilizations would need to rise significantly, or intelligence or communicative capacity would need to be far more prevalent than assumed. Alternatively, each civilization estimated by Drake might give rise to multiple races, yielding a figure modest compared to ufological accounts. Challenges and reflections arise from the lack of definitive data for many parameters in the Drake Equation and the need for objective scientific validation of ufological cataloguing.

**The Great Silence: Why Aliens Haven't Contacted Us -- Or Have They?**
The possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life and Earth visitation remains a topic of debate. Modern astrobiology has revealed that planets are abundant in our galaxy, with over 5,000 exoplanets confirmed as of 2023, and one-fifth of stars estimated to have planets in the 'habitable zone' where temperatures could allow liquid water. The building blocks of life have been found in interstellar clouds and meteorites, suggesting the chemistry for life might be common. However, the emergence of intelligent, technological civilizations is far more uncertain, and the famous Drake Equation provides a framework to estimate the number of advanced civilizations by considering factors like the rate of star formation and the likelihood of life and intelligence. As of now, there is no conclusive evidence to prove or disprove the existence of intelligent alien life or their visitation to Earth.

**Opinion: Is there life out there? The existence of other technological species is highly likely**
The existence of extraterrestrial life is highly likely, according to scientists. New telescope technologies have enabled us to discover thousands of potentially habitable exoplanets that could support life similar to that on Earth. Gravitational wave detectors have opened a new avenue for space exploration by detecting space-time distortions caused by black holes and supernovae millions of light-years away. NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission successfully touched down on asteroid Bennu and brought back rock and dust samples. Several countries have developed the ability to deploy robots on the moon and Mars, with plans to send humans to these celestial bodies in the future. The probability of humanity being the sole technological civilization in the observable universe is considered to be less than one in 10 billion trillion. With an estimated 200 billion trillion stars in the observable universe, the existence of other technological species is highly likely, potentially even within our Milky Way galaxy. 'Considering the sheer number of stars and planets, it seems highly improbable that life wouldn’t have arisen elsewhere,' said an astronomer. 'The Drake equation, developed by astronomer Frank Drake in 1961, provides a framework for estimating the number of detectable civilizations within our galaxy. An optimistic estimate using this formula suggests that 12,500 intelligent alien civilizations might exist in the Milky Way alone.'

**Is there life out there? The existence of other technological species is highly likely**
The existence of extraterrestrial life is highly likely, according to scientists. New telescope technologies and space exploration advancements have enabled us to discover thousands of potentially habitable exoplanets. While defining life is challenging, a comprehensive definition considers life as a self-sustaining chemical system capable of processing information and maintaining a state of low entropy. The universe may harbor life forms based on different principles and biochemistries, such as silicon-based life. The origins of life on Earth are still debated, with competing hypotheses on how life arose on our planet. Recent analyses of meteorites have revealed a slight asymmetry in the chirality of organic molecules, which could support the theory that life on Earth is extraterrestrial in origin. The Drake equation suggests that 12,500 intelligent alien civilizations might exist in the Milky Way alone, and the probability of humanity being the sole technological civilization in the observable universe is considered to be less than one in 10 billion trillion.

**NASA Hopes to Reestablish Contact with Extraterrestrials**
The NASA is hoping to reestablish contact with extraterrestrials using a new method. The famous Drake equation calculates the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy, and it is not zero. It is now established that space is teeming with exoplanets located in the habitable zone of their star. Therefore, it is logical that scientists wonder what method would be the most effective for communicating with another form of life. 'The space is full of exoplanets, and it's only a matter of time before we find one that is capable of supporting life,' said a scientist. The NASA is currently exploring different options for communication, including the use of radio signals and laser pulses.
