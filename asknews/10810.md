**Rakuta: Decrease in Key Interest Rate Will Have Little Impact on Housing Market**
Credit broker Dmitry Rakuta believes that a potential decrease in the key interest rate by the Central Bank of Russia will have little impact on the housing market. He states, 'Even if the Central Bank of Russia decides to lower the key interest rate, it will be very insignificant. If the market interest rate for mortgages is offered at 25-26%, it will still be unaffordable for potential homebuyers. The monthly payment will not decrease significantly, possibly by 2-5 thousand rubles.' Rakuta thinks that a decrease in the key interest rate might encourage some people to buy a home, but it will likely be for small loans or deals with the intention to refinance the loan in the future. He adds, 'If market interest rates for loans decrease to 20%, the market will come alive: borrowers will start looking for properties, and deals will be made.' However, in the current situation, a decrease in the key interest rate will be more of a technical change than a clear signal for significant changes.

**Imported Alcohol Sales in Russia Decrease by 30% Compared to Pre-Sanction Level**
The sales of imported alcohol in Russia have decreased by 30% compared to the pre-sanction level, according to A.LIST data. Despite this, the sales of strong drinks have increased. The head of AGK, Pavel Pobedkin, noted that the sales of whiskey, gin, rum, and liqueurs have increased, but the market share of imports has decreased. The president of the Alcopro guild, Andrei Moskovsky, said that the products of foreign companies can be found on the shelves of Russian stores through parallel imports. The sales of imported whiskey have increased by 50% compared to 2021, while the sales of Russian whiskey have increased by 73%. The average retail price of Russian whiskey is 160% lower than that of imported whiskey. Experts believe that it will be difficult for foreign companies to regain their lost positions in the Russian market. The Russian market is not significant for global sales of alcohol giants such as Diageo and Pernod Ricard, which accounted for only 2-2.5% of their sales before 2022. Even if they decide to return, it will be a gradual process, and they will need to invest in local production and marketing. The most likely scenario in the next 2-3 years is that foreign companies will continue to work with the Russian market through parallel schemes and partners in third countries. 'The current situation allows them to maintain a significant presence and sales volumes while avoiding significant operational and reputational risks associated with official work in Russia', says Andrei Moskovsky. The return of brands in the format 'before 2022' is possible only in case of serious geopolitical stabilization. A complete disappearance of parallel imports is possible only in case of government decisions. For now, the Russian consumer will see further growth in the assortment of local brands and products from friendly countries, while familiar Western favorites will remain available but at significantly higher prices. 'Expecting a massive return of Western brands in their previous format, with cheap prices, is not necessary', says Moskovsky.

**Russian Government Increases Pressure on Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina to Lower Interest Rate**
The Russian government is increasing pressure on Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina to lower the key interest rate, fearing its impact on businesses, according to 24 Kanal citing Bloomberg. Sources indicate that the Kremlin expects Nabiullina to lower the rate at the next Central Bank meeting on Friday, June 6, as the consequences of high rates on the budget and civilian sectors of the Russian economy are becoming more apparent. Public statements from high-ranking government officials, including Minister of Economy Maxim Reshetnikov, who warned that if the Central Bank does not take measures, there is a risk that the economy will cool down too much, are adding to the pressure on Nabiullina. 'If the Central Bank does not take measures, there is a risk that the economy will cool down too much,' Reshetnikov said. Nabiullina has faced a new challenge as the key interest rate has been at 21% since October last year, introduced to combat inflation, which exceeded 10% at the end of 2024, twice the target rate of 4%. However, this has significantly impacted the economy. According to the Central Bank, the adjusted annual inflation rate decreased to 6.2% in April from 10.7% in January, but this decline is mainly due to the strengthening of the ruble and may not be sustainable. 'The Bank of Russia is facing two risks now,' said economists. 'If the key interest rate is lowered, inflation may rise, and if it remains high, there is a risk of recession.'

**Time to be more frugal: why the economic growth is slowing down**
The Russian economy is experiencing a slowdown in industrial production and a decrease in demand from households, which may lead to a vicious cycle of declining production, reduced government revenue, and decreased consumer demand, warns economist Oleg Vyuigin, professor at the Higher School of Economics. The decline in industrial production and decrease in demand from households are a result of the high interest rate set by the Central Bank, which has reduced commercial banks' lending to the production sector. The ban on investment loans and the high cost of working capital loans have also had a negative impact on some heavily indebted companies. Additionally, the effect of the government's policy of advancing enterprises in the defense industry at the beginning of the year has weakened, and the growth of non-oil and gas revenues of the federal budget has slowed down. The economist believes that the Central Bank has the opportunity to lower the interest rate and ease financial restrictions on production activity, but this would require the government to abandon its expansionary budget policy, which has led to inflationary risks. The budget stimulus is coming to an end, and the parameters of the federal budget for 2025 indicate that there will be a period of stagnation or even a decline in economic activity. The Ministry of Finance has proposed amendments to the budget, which would increase the planned deficit to 3.8 trillion rubles. The economist concludes that the government needs to be more frugal in its budgetary desires and abandon the model of supporting the economy through increased budget spending on the defense industry, which has led to inflationary consequences.

**Russian Car Dealers Predict Stable Market Share for Chinese Car Manufacturers in 2025**
According to the directors of several major Russian car dealerships, the market share of Chinese car manufacturers in Russia is expected to remain stable in 2025, around 60-65%. However, if the new law on localizing taxis is not implemented, the market share of Chinese car manufacturers may decrease in 2026. Rolf's director of new cars, Nikolai Ivanov, predicts that the market share of Chinese car manufacturers will not change significantly in 2025, but may decrease in 2026 if the law is not implemented. Avilon's deputy director of sales, Renat Tyukteev, notes that the market share of Chinese car manufacturers has grown significantly over the past two years and is expected to continue growing in 2025. He also mentions that there is a growing trend of locally produced cars with Chinese investment. On the other hand, Autodom's general director, Andrey Olkhovsky, disagrees and believes that the market share of Chinese car manufacturers will decrease due to the increasing number of cars assembled directly in Russia.

**Russia's Deposit Rates Continue to Decline: Experts Advise on Alternative Investment Options**
Bank deposit rates in Russia continue to decline, with the average yield on deposits falling to a minimum level since August 2024, exceeding 19%. Despite this still being a relatively high level, investors should consider alternative options for placing their funds after the reduction in rates. According to current data, rates on deposits for terms from three months to one year have decreased to 18.8%. Over the past month, rates on three- and six-month deposits have decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 19.2%, while one-year deposit rates have decreased by 0.7 percentage points to around 18%. Economist Andrey Barkhota noted that banks expect the key rate not to exceed 20-20.5% and predict a level of around 19% in the coming year. However, Anderida Financial Group's Alexei Tarapovsky suggested that there is a possibility of reducing the rate at the CBR meeting on June 6. Most experts believe that the regulator will not change the rate in the near future. Analyst Igor Dodonov from Finam emphasized that rates in the range of 18-19% are still very attractive. However, Freedom Finance Global's Natalya Milchakova noted that the peak of deposit yields has already passed, and Russians need to think about transferring their funds after the reduction in deposit interest rates. At present, it is advisable to pay attention to federal loan bonds and bonds of leading Russian companies - their yield is also linked to the key rate. In addition, money market mutual funds can offer a yield close to the CBR rate. Some funds can be transferred to stocks before the key rate is reduced. Experts believe that after the easing of monetary policy, the stock market may gradually start to grow, but they warn about the impact of geopolitical news on its dynamics.

**Economists Expect Increase in Currency Savings Among Russians**
Economists expect a 10-12% increase in the share of currency savings among Russians in 2025. Currently, the share of currency on Russian accounts remains low, at less than 10%. Experts predict that the share of currency savings may increase in 2025 due to high interest rates and a shift of funds from checking accounts. However, the growth rate of people's savings in banks is expected to slow down to 23% in 2025 and 10% in 2026. In 2024, the share of deposits in banks increased from 65% to 70%, and the total amount of savings among Russians increased by 28%. 'The growth rate of people's savings in all savings instruments may decrease to 24% and 19% in 2025 and 2026, respectively', experts predict.

**Snow Coverage in Russia Decreases by 5-10% Over Past Few Days**
According to Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, the area of Russia covered in snow has decreased by 5-10% over the past few days, now making up 25-30% of the country's territory. 'The area covered in snow is gradually decreasing, there is no doubt about it. Currently, it is around 25-30%. It is very important that the height and density of the snow are already small. Of course, it will still exist for a long time, but in the southern regions of the Siberian Federal District and the Far East, it will not be there', Vilfand said. He noted that snow remains only in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, on Novaya Zemlya, and in the mountains of the Kola Peninsula.

**Moscow Residents' Interest in Sochi Housing Drops by 26.4% in Q1 2025**
According to more precise numbers, the interest of Moscow residents in purchasing housing in Sochi decreased by 26.4% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year. Despite the overall annual decline, a local surge in interest was recorded in March, with an 8% increase compared to February. Experts note that demand increased in two out of the first three months of 2025. From March to April 2025, Moscow buyers preferred apartments in Sochi's new buildings. The proximity to the sea remained a key factor in their choice, making Adler and Lazarevsky districts, as well as the 'Sirus' federal territory, the most in-demand areas. Among specific housing formats, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments led the way.

**Poverty Rate Among Multi-Child Families in Russia Decreases to 20% in 2024**
According to preliminary data from Rosstat, the percentage of multi-child families living below the poverty line in Russia decreased to 20% in 2024, which is almost twice less than five years ago, when the indicator reached 38.1%. Experts attribute the significant reduction in poverty among families with three or more children to the introduction of a single child allowance and increased social support measures. The overall poverty level in Russia has also reached a historic minimum, decreasing to 7.2% by the end of 2024. Experts note that the key factor in reducing poverty among multi-child families was the introduction of a single child allowance, which significantly improved the financial situation of families with children, especially in the regions. However, despite the positive dynamics, 20% of poor among multi-child families remains a high indicator. According to the 'Family' national project, it is planned to reduce the poverty level among multi-child families to 12% by 2030 and to 8% by 2036. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to further increase the minimum wage, support the growth of the median salary, and increase the amount of assistance depending on the number of children.

**VTB Predicts 20% Decrease in Mortgage Lending in 2025**
VTB predicts a 20% decrease in mortgage lending in 2025, with a total volume of around 3.8 trillion rubles. This is a decrease from the previous forecast of 3.3 trillion rubles. According to Georgy Gorshkov, deputy chairman of VTB, the market of retail lending will also decrease by 30% to 8.8 trillion rubles. The main volume will be in mortgages, with a total of around 3.8 trillion rubles. 'We expect the market to shrink by more than expected, with a 30% decrease to 8.8 trillion rubles,' said Gorshkov. 'The main reason for this decrease is the reduction in sales of housing loans by 20% compared to 2024.' The decrease in mortgage sales is due to the reduction in the cost of funding, the easing of regulatory measures by the Central Bank of Russia, and the increase in the size of subsidies for government programs. However, the final results of mortgage sales will depend on the decisions made on government support programs. Additionally, VTB predicts a decrease in car loans of more than 40% to 1.3 trillion rubles. The final result will depend on the regulator's position on the macroprudential limits for collateral car loans and changes to the existing legislation on the mandatory cooling-off period. Cash loan sales are expected to show a result of 3.7 trillion rubles, a decrease of 35% year-on-year. 'As a result of the significant 'cooling' of demand, the growth rate of the retail credit portfolio will slow down significantly. If in 2024 its volume grew by 13% to 39.45 trillion rubles, then by the end of 2025, growth is planned at 4%, to 41.1 trillion rubles,' concluded Gorshkov.

**Russia's Older Population to Decrease by 2030, Strategy Reveals**
According to the strategy for the development of the older population in Russia until 2030, the proportion of citizens aged 65 and older will decrease to 23% by 2030, resulting in a total of 32.9 million people. This is due to the ongoing increase in the pension age. The strategy also notes that there is a gender imbalance among pensioners, with 1,869 women aged 65 and older for every 1,000 men. The number of disabled pensioners decreased from 5.7 million in 2021 to 5.3 million in 2023. The strategy aims to maintain a coverage rate of at least 90% for preventive observation of citizens aged 65 and older, and to increase the proportion of home visits by doctors to 20% by 2030. Additionally, the number of citizens aged 65 and older living in rural areas and covered by preventive examinations and medical check-ups using transportation is planned to increase to 405,350 by 2027.

The number of tourists who got lost on natural routes has decreased by 46% in 2024 compared to 2023, thanks to new safety requirements. According to Russian Vice-Premier Dmitry Chernyshenko, the number of registered tourists on routes in natural environments increased by 32% in 2024, while the number of lost tourists decreased by 46%. Chernyshenko noted that the mandatory requirement to inform territorial emergency services before going on a route reduces the number of accidents. However, not all tourists comply with this requirement. 'There is still work to be done, primarily at the local level,' Chernyshenko said.

**Russia Aims to Reduce Poverty Rate Below 5% by 2036**
Russian Vice-Premier Tatyana Golikova announced plans to reduce the country's poverty rate below 5% by 2036. Golikova stated, 'Further reduction of this indicator, and by 2030 it needs to be reduced below 7%, and by 2036 - below 5%, will require from us very targeted, precise, and comprehensive work. The lower we need to reduce this indicator, the more precise our measures should be and the more targeted they should be.' The focus of this work will be on increasing the income of large families, with the first step being the introduction of a family tax allowance for parents of two or more children from 2026. Golikova emphasized that the President's task is not only to reduce poverty, but also to reduce the gap in income inequality. She noted that the Gini coefficient (a measure of the degree of unevenness in the distribution of income among the population) should decrease, 'especially in the first and second deciles, which characterize the well-being and well-being of families with the lowest income, that is, 20% of the population with the lowest incomes.' Labor income plays a key role in reducing poverty, Golikova said. 'And here, 2024 showed quite serious indicators of growth in real income of the population. Real income of the population, preliminary data, grew by 8.4%', she said. Golikova also presented preliminary data from Rosstat on the growth of real monetary income in 2024, with the top performers being the Kalmykia, Adygea, Orlov, Smolensk, and Chelyabinsk regions. 'These are good achievements, but, of course, there is still something to strive for', Golikova said.

**Russian Mortgage Rates Unlikely to Decrease Before 2026, Says Real Estate Expert**
According to Ruslan Syrtsov, the head of the company 'Metrium', it is unlikely that interest rates on mortgage loans in Russia will decrease before 2026, reports RIA Novosti. Syrtsov emphasized that the Central Bank's decision to keep the key interest rate unchanged at 21% per annum indicates that the regulator does not see a worsening of inflationary processes. He believes that this will serve as a guideline for developers and potential buyers, suggesting a likelihood of a decrease in mortgage rates in 2026. Syrtsov is confident that maintaining the key interest rate at its current level will have a stabilizing effect on the economy. However, this will have little impact on the availability of housing in the country. As a reminder, the Central Bank has decided for the third time in a row not to change the key interest rate, leaving it at 21%. Most analysts had predicted this outcome, noting the lack of grounds for further increases and the fact that the regulator did not consider easing monetary policy at the previous meeting in March, as stated by Syrtsov, 'This will be an indicator for developers and potential buyers, indicating the likelihood of a decrease in mortgage rates in 2026.'

**Analyst Predicts Key Interest Rate to Decrease to 20% by End of 2024**
Analyst Mikhail Vasilev predicts that the key interest rate in Russia may decrease to 20% by the end of 2024. However, he does not expect any significant changes in the near future. The current rate is 21%, and Vasilev believes that it will remain the same after the Central Bank's meeting on April 25. According to Vasilev, the main cycle of rate reduction will likely occur in 2026. Alternatively, the rate may drop to 18% or even 13% in a more extreme scenario. Mikhail Hazin, an economist, notes that the situation with Russian citizens' deposits is critical, with 56 trillion rubles deposited in banks, making it difficult for them to be returned. Meanwhile, Russia's gold reserves have reached a record $217 billion, with gold now making up over a third of the country's total savings.

**Russia's Natural Population Decline Increases by 20% in 2024**
According to Rosstat, the natural population decline in Russia increased by 20% in 2024, reaching over 596,000 people. The number of births decreased, while the number of deaths increased, as reported by 'Interfax'. The Ministry of Health stated in January that Russia's birth rate has reached one of the lowest levels in the country's modern history. Rosstat predicts that birth rates will not increase until 2027. However, the absolute number of births is expected to rise after 2030, driven by an increase in the number of women of reproductive age. The natural population decline indicator shows the excess of deaths over births. In 2024, this indicator reached 596,200 people, compared to 495,200 in 2023. Rosstat previously reported that the population of Russia (excluding new territories) decreased to 146.028 million people at the beginning of 2025, down from 146.151 million at the beginning of 2024.
