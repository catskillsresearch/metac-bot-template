**NASA's Europa Clipper Mission Canceled, but Technology Could Explore Enceladus Instead**
NASA has announced that the Europa Clipper mission, originally planned to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, has been canceled in 2023. However, the technology that supports it can be used to explore Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. According to Interesting Engineering, the subsurface oceans of both Europa and Enceladus could potentially harbor life, making them prime targets for searching for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. If the Europa Clipper mission had launched, it would have collected data on the possibility of life on Europa. The mission was not an easy one, as the intense radiation from Jupiter would damage electronic devices, and communication time would be limited due to Europa's short orbital period of 85 hours. As NASA's Dr. said, 'The mission was not feasible due to the harsh environment of Jupiter.'

**'We're on borrowed time': Investigative journalist being warned of 'apocalyptic event' in 2027 * WorldNetDaily * by Joe Kovacs**
Investigative journalist Ross Coulthart claims he has been warned of a mysterious apocalyptic event that will take place in 2027, but officials are not specifying what type of cataclysm. Coulthart says he has been given various possible scenarios, including a pole reversal, an asteroid hitting the planet, or A.I. reaching quantum and losing control of computer systems. He emphasizes that everyone is telling him 'we're on borrowed time' and that people have a right to know about the event. However, officials are constrained by their national security oaths and are not revealing the information. Coulthart's claims have sparked a range of reactions online, including skepticism and criticism of the officials' secrecy.

**A Theory Says We Can't Find Advanced Aliens Because They're Not Trying to Be Found**
A new study re-examines the 'Sustainability Solution' to the Fermi paradox, which suggests that advanced alien civilizations may not be trying to be found because they have adapted to their planet's limitations and created sustainable technologies that blend with nature. This idea, first proposed in 2009, suggests that technosignatures like Dyson Spheres or interstellar spacecraft may not be detectable. New York University researcher Lukáš Likavčan re-conceptualizes technology, history, and sustainability on a planetary scale, arguing that the technosphere is a transitory armature of the biosphere's evolution. Likavčan quotes Canadian sci-fi author Karl Schroeder, who wrote that 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from nature.' This could explain why we haven't found civilizations while looking for technosignatures alone. The study provides a valuable lens through which to value our own society, its future perils, and how we might survive long enough to one day solve the Fermi paradox.

**NASA's Europa Clipper Mission Canceled, but Technology Could Explore Enceladus for Life**
NASA announced that the Europa Clipper mission, which was originally planned to land on Jupiter's moon Europa in 2030, has been canceled in 2023. However, the technology that supports it could be used to explore Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. According to interesting engineering, the subsurface oceans of Europa and Enceladus could potentially harbor life, making them promising places to search for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. If the Europa Clipper mission had launched, it would have collected data on the possibility of life on Europa. The original plan was to send a lander to search for biosignatures if the Clipper mission found good evidence of a habitable environment. However, the mission was challenging due to the intense radiation from Jupiter, which would damage electronic devices, and the limited communication time due to Europa's short orbital period of 85 hours.

**WIDE ANGLE: SEEING RED**
Ten years after the release of Andy Weir's bestselling novel The Martian, Mars exploration has made significant progress, but it looks different than predicted. While the book envisioned humans landing on Mars three times by 2035, NASA's current plans are fragile. Instead, robotic missions have propelled discovery and human imagination forward. The Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance rovers have studied layered rock formations, revealing insights into Mars' past climate and environment. A planetary scientist notes that the area of Arabia Terra, where the protagonist Mark Watney must cross, has been the focus of scientific investigation, with detailed analyses of layered materials and the naming of previously unnamed craters. Despite advances, many unknowns remain, including the precise ages and atmospheric conditions of different rock types. The Mars Sample Return mission aims to address these questions by delivering unaltered fragments of Mars to Earth. The scientist argues that robotic exploration has been more effective than sending humans to the surface, and that the payoff has been staggering, with rapid technological advances in robotics, telecommunications, and materials science.

**What is Oumuamua? 6 Fascinating Facts About the First Interstellar Visitor to Our Solar System**
Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object to enter our solar system, has sparked debate with its strange shape, speed, and unexplained acceleration. Here are six key facts about this cosmic visitor: Oumuamua was detected in 2017 by the University of Hawaii's Pan-STARRS1 telescope and was initially classified as an asteroid before being reclassified as a comet due to its unexpected acceleration. It is estimated to be up to 400 meters long and has a reddish hue, with a rapid rotation every 7.3 hours and dramatic brightness variations. Unlike typical comets, Oumuamua displayed no visible gas or dust, leading researchers to suggest it had been bombarded by cosmic rays for millions of years. Its anomalous acceleration sparked debate over its true nature, with some experts suggesting it could be a piece of alien technology. However, the dominant scientific consensus holds that it is a natural object, perhaps a fragment of a hydrogen ice body or a 'dark comet' unlike any seen before. Oumuamua is now heading toward the constellation Pegasus and is expected to exit the solar system entirely by 2038.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars: 5 to 500 Starships by 2033**
Elon Musk plans to send five Starships to Mars in 2026, followed by a drastic increase in the number of launches, with 20 ships in 2028, 100 in 2030, and 500 in 2033. According to Musk, this plan is a crucial step in colonizing Mars. As Musk said, 'It's a very ambitious plan, but I think it's necessary to make humanity a multi-planetary species.' However, some people are skeptical about the feasibility of this plan, questioning whether it's a point of inflection for humanity or just a sign of Musk's mental detachment.

**Elon Musk says his Mars 2026 presentation will take place Friday**
Elon Musk announced that his SpaceX Mars 2026 presentation will take place on Friday, marking his return to his business after nearly 130 days of enacting government cuts. Musk aims to send an unmanned spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and have humans 'likely' land on the planet by 2031, citing the long-term survival of humans as the reason. He envisions creating a self-sustaining colony on Mars, using Tesla-developed solar panels to provide electricity and heat homes. Musk aims to have one million people living on Mars by the 2040s, but has missed his own deadlines for planetary exploration in the past, including sending humans to Mars by 2024 and offering private citizens trips to the moon by 2017. 'That's one of the benefits of Mars, is life insurance for life collectively,' Musk said in a Fox News interview. 'We do at some point need to be a multi-planet civilization, because Earth will be incinerated.'

**Scientists Warn: Earth Still Blind to Solar Storms - Al Masry Al Youm**
Despite the scientific progress in monitoring coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the sun, scientists still face a critical weakness in predicting the impact of these solar storms on Earth. According to a report by Space-com, physicist Valentín Martínez Martínez stated that the biggest challenge lies not in monitoring the sun, but in the lack of early information about the 'Bz' component. He added that spacecraft like 'ACE' and 'DSCOVR' only collect Bz data when the storm reaches the 'Lagrange 1' (L1) point, giving Earth a warning of between 15 to 60 minutes. Martínez emphasized that we have the necessary scientific models to provide accurate predictions, but we lack continuous coverage from multiple angles of the sun. He believes that without expanding the monitoring network to points like L4, L5, and L3, we may need another 50 years to reach the accuracy of weather forecasting on Earth. Scientists hope to fill this gap through new space missions, including the 'Vigil' mission by the European Space Agency (ESA), which aims to launch towards the L5 point in 2031 and monitor solar storms from the side, allowing for the detection of their shape and magnetic field direction before they approach Earth. However, some scientists see waiting until the 2030s or later as a risk, as the world remembers the 'Carrington Event' in 1859, which caused a disruption to telegraph networks, or the 2012 solar storm that could have caused trillions of dollars in damage if it had hit Earth directly. Dan Baker from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) warned in a 2013 scientific paper that a direct hit could completely shut down technological life. Although there are monitoring networks like GONG and DSCOVR, their limited capabilities highlight the urgent need to expand coverage. Martínez concluded by saying: 'The sun has not changed, but our increasing reliance on technology has made us more vulnerable.' Until scientists can monitor solar storms before they arrive, Earth will remain at risk without real protection.

**Baba Vanga made terrifying predictions for the next 3,000 years**
Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic and healer, made predictions for the next 3,000 years, including several that have come true. According to Vanga, humans will visit Venus in 2028, climate change will worsen by 2033, and communism will spread globally in 2076. Additionally, she predicted that humans will make contact with aliens in 2030, and then go to war with a Martian civilization in 2170. Vanga also predicted that humans will have to evacuate Earth in 3797 due to it becoming uninhabitable. These predictions, along with others, have sparked concern and interest in the future. As Steven Hawking said, 'We are running out of space and the only places to go to are other worlds. It is time to explore other solar systems,' and 'Spreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves. I am convinced that humans need to leave Earth.'

**NASA's New Probes to Search for Alien Life**
The NASA project, called ORCAA (Oceanic World Recognition and Astrobiological Analog Characterization), aims to search for extraterrestrial life. In 2023, the team conducted a test mission at the Echo glacier in Alaska, using a hot water drill to collect samples from the glacier's bottom. They found traces of ATP and chlorophyll-a, key molecules for life. The team is now preparing for a second campaign in North Basin in 2025, where they will use a cryobot to simulate the conditions they will face on Jupiter's moon Europa. The goal is to test the autonomous operation of the cryobot, from drilling to sample analysis, to determine if these technologies can be used in a future real landing on Europa. The study aims to detect changes in the environment and find potential indicators of habitability, such as microorganisms or organic compounds. The research is advancing, with the Europa Clipper mission already en route to Jupiter's moon. This spacecraft will fly over Europa 49 times starting in 2030, searching for areas where the ice crust is thinner. This will help choose the most promising location for a future landing mission, such as the Europa Lander. While this mission will not penetrate the ice, it will test the first key instruments for that stage. Other oceanic worlds in the solar system where these probes could be used include Enceladus and Titan (Saturn), Triton (Neptune), Ganymede and Callisto (Jupiter), and even Ceres and Pluto. Enceladus, for example, has active geysers that eject water into space and have already been analyzed by the Cassini mission, which found water vapor, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds: basic ingredients for life.

**Elon Musk shares vision of Mars as 'life insurance' for humanity: 'Multi-planet civilization'**
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk discussed his vision for a self-sustaining civilization on Mars as 'life insurance' for humanity on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' Musk stated, 'Mars is life insurance for life collectively. So, eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the sun. The sun is gradually expanding, and so we do at some point need to be a multi-planet civilization because Earth will be incinerated.' He emphasized that his vision for Mars is not just about landing on the planet, but about creating a self-sustaining city that can grow and survive without resupply ships from Earth. Musk predicted that humans could start landing on Mars as soon as 2029, although 2031 is more likely. He also mentioned that a SpaceX Starship will depart for Mars at the end of 2026, carrying Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot.

**Have they been here? - Ravi Kopparapu & Jacob Haqq Misra**
Ravi Kopparapu and Jacob Haqq Misra suggest that it's worth investigating the possibility of extraterrestrial technology being present in our solar system, on the Moon, Mars, or in the asteroid belt. They argue that finding alien technology close to Earth would be a transformative discovery, challenging humanity's sense of itself in the universe. While previous hypotheses, such as Lowell's idea of canals on Mars, have been disproven, the authors believe that proximity changes everything and that continued research in biosignature science, which seeks to identify signs of life in the universe, is crucial in the search for life beyond Earth.

**Massive new telescope could find alien life in hours as it's set to transform the way we search for life beyond Earth**
The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), developed by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), is set to revolutionize the way we search for life beyond Earth. According to the ESO, the ELT will be able to track down Earth-like planets around other stars and potentially find evidence of life outside of our Solar System. A recent study suggests that the ELT could detect signs of alien life within just hours. The telescope is expected to produce groundbreaking results, potentially leading to a 'paradigm shift in our perception of the Universe.' As the ESO states, 'The ELT will probe the furthest reaches of the cosmos, revealing the properties of the very earliest galaxies and the nature of the dark Universe.' While we may have to wait until December 2030 for the first scientific observations, the excitement surrounding the ELT is palpable, with the potential to conclusively prove the existence of aliens out there.

**Michael Moore Sounded Off on Trump's Mass Deportations. The White House Just Fired Back.**
Michael Moore, a left-wing filmmaker and activist, criticized President Trump's mass deportations, suggesting that the US might be missing out on potential geniuses, such as a child who could have discovered the cure for cancer. Moore wrote, 'Who's really being removed by ICE tonight? The child who would've discovered the cure for cancer in 2046? The 9th grade nerd who would've stopped that asteroid that's gonna hit us in 2032? Do we care?' The White House responded by listing a series of violent crimes committed by illegal aliens in the US, and stating that the Trump Administration will continue to prioritize the deportation of 'illegal migrant rapists, murderers, and other criminals.' White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai said, 'Michael Moore is free to visit the quantum computing and particle physics labs that MS-13, TDA, and the cartels are now going to have to set up back home in El Salvador, Venezuela, and Mexico.'
