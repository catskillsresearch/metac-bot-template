**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**Britain unveils radical defense overhaul to meet new threats**
The UK government has unveiled a radical defense overhaul to address threats from Russia, nuclear risks, and cyber-attacks. The plan, which includes investing in drones and digital warfare, aims to make the army more lethal, not larger. Defense Secretary John Healey said, 'Drones now kill more people than traditional artillery in the war in Ukraine and whoever gets new technology into the hands of their armed forces the quickest will win.' The government will spend 15 billion pounds on replacing the nuclear warheads for its main nuclear fleet and build new munitions plants. The review also recommends increasing the total number of regular personnel when funding allows, likely after 2029. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged the largest sustained increase to UK defense spending since the end of the Cold War, aiming to reach 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and 3% in the next parliament, likely between 2029-2034.

**UK Must Prepare for War, Says Labour Leader Keir Starmer**
UK must prepare for war, said Labour leader Keir Starmer in a defense industry in Scotland on Monday, presenting a report on the state of the country's defense. - The threat we face today is more serious, less predictable, and more immediate than anything we've seen since the end of the Cold War. We are facing a war in Europe, a new nuclear threat, cyber attacks, increased Russian aggression in our territorial waters and airspace, and their reckless behavior is leading to increased living costs in our country. This is a new era for security and defense, said Starmer. The British government has announced an increase in defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and now aims to reach 3%. Six new ammunition factories will be built to replenish the army's dwindling stockpiles, which are being depleted as artillery ammunition is sent to Ukraine. A new generation of nuclear weapons and submarines is being developed, and new drones, ships, and aircraft will be acquired to increase naval capabilities. The Times reports that the government is considering purchasing American F35A fighter jets to be able to launch nuclear weapons from the air. However, there are question marks about the pace of the buildup. - I'm not going to engage in fantasy politics and take dates out of the air now, said Starmer when pressed by the BBC about when the 3% target will be met. Ministers have spoken of 'the end of the next parliamentary term' - but within Starmer's Labour Party, criticism is growing that they have already cut aid and support for poor families. Meanwhile, the center and right-wing opposition argue that it is happening too slowly. Former army chief Richard Dannatt is among those who criticize the pace of the buildup. - A vague goal of increasing defense spending to 3% by 2034 is not enough, it's like asking Adolf Hitler to wait until 1946 to attack us in 1938, he said.

**UK Must Prepare for War Amid Russian Threat, Says Keir Starmer**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that the country must prepare for war in the face of a real and immediate threat from Russia. In a speech in Glasgow, the Labour leader stated that the Kremlin's aggression represents the most significant challenge to European security since the end of the Cold War and called on 'every part of society' to assume its responsibility in national defense. 'Russian aggression is growing, and its reckless actions are already increasing the cost of living in our country,' Starmer said during the presentation of the Defence Review, a report commissioned by his government to a panel of experts. 'I hope we don't have to deploy British troops on European soil, but to ensure we don't, we must prepare. The UK cannot ignore the threat that Russia represents.' The Defence Review outlines the lines of a deep transformation of British military policy, including a gradual increase in defence spending, from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% in 2027, with the goal of reaching 3% by the end of the next parliament in 2034. The report also calls for the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines, along with a £15 billion investment in the UK's nuclear deterrent programme. These initiatives are part of the AUKUS security agreement with the US and Australia, and are aimed at strengthening British strategic deterrence in a context of growing global competition. 'We know that threats are increasing and we must act decisively to face Russian aggression,' said Defence Secretary John Healey. According to the government, the nuclear investment will generate around 30,000 highly qualified direct jobs in the UK by the early 2030s. Starmer emphasized that the defence strategy aims not only to strengthen security but also to boost key sectors of the British economy. 'This review will ensure that our armed forces have the equipment they need to keep us safe, while also generating greater opportunities for engineers, naval builders and technicians,' he said.

**UK to Build New Attack Submarines and Boost Nuclear Arsenal Amid Russian Threat**
The UK's Labour leader has outlined a plan to make the country a 'war-ready' nation, equipped for 'decades to come', in the face of the Russian threat. 'The threat we face today is more grave, more immediate, and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,' he said. He added, 'We are facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyberattacks, and an increasing Russian aggression in our waters, which also threatens our airspace.' Key measures include the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons, as part of the Aukus military alliance with the US and Australia. These new submarines will replace the current UK fleet by the end of the 2030s, which currently consists of seven such vessels.

**UK to Introduce New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines by Late 2030s**
The UK government plans to introduce 12 new attack submarines powered by nuclear energy and equipped with conventional weapons by the late 2030s. The UK Ministry of Defence announced that it will replace the current 7 submarines with the new ones. The ministry also stated that the cost of the existing nuclear warhead development program, which was previously initiated, will be £15 billion. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said, 'We know threats are rising and we must act decisively against Russian aggression. Our cutting-edge new submarines patrolling the world's oceans and our own nuclear warhead program at home are making our country both safe at home and strong abroad.' The new submarines are reportedly being developed as a joint model with the US and Australia under the AUKUS security partnership.

**New twist in Russia-Ukraine war as Britain asks for US nuclear-capable fighter jets to..., Starmer govt accuses Putin of...**
The UK is reportedly in talks with the US to acquire a fleet of nuclear-capable fighter jets to enhance its nuclear deterrence against Russia. According to reports, the UK plans to equip US-made fighter jets with nuclear missiles, which could be the largest expansion in UK's nuclear deterrence capabilities. The move has the support of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who believes the world faces its worst nuclear threat since the Cold War era. The UK currently lacks the capability to launch nuclear strikes from the air, but acquiring the US-made F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets would allow it to do so. The deal would also enable the UK to launch nuclear strikes from air, vastly enhancing its deterrence capabilities. Additionally, the Starmer government plans to manufacture 7,000 long-range weapons and increase its defense spending to 3% of the country's GDP by 2034.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. The move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks globally. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and will move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, wrote in The Sun on Sunday, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**British fighter jets will carry nuclear weapons for the first time**
British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time as part of the country's biggest defense expansion since the Cold War. The decision, backed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, includes purchasing US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. Defence Secretary John Healey has promised a 'certain decade of rising defence spending', with the goal of reaching 3% GDP by 2034. The Government will also conduct a strategic defence review, exploring 'deliverable and affordable' solutions within the resources available. This move comes after the Government previously set out a goal to reach the 2.5% GDP target by 2027. The Defence Secretary has stated that the UK will meet its target, and the new defence money will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI.

**Dr Survè's grim possibility of nuclear war must be taken seriously**
Dr Iqbal Surve's warning of a grim possibility of nuclear war should be taken seriously. The world is plagued by ongoing conflicts, wars with no end, and the fabric of global governance is being torn apart. The writer notes that the United States' foreign policy over the past 50 years has been marked by treachery and a failure to distinguish between friends and foes. The introduction of exotic new weapons that could obliterate the human race in 60 minutes is a pressing concern, and leaders are 'seconds away from Armageddon.' According to the writer, the world will record 2023/4 as a brutal year for mankind, marked by bombs, missiles, and chemical weapons. The regime change in various countries triggered the migrant crisis in North Africa, and the writer blames the United States' foreign policy for destabilizing the globe. As Dr Surve said, 'the bloody carnage in war-torn areas has morphed into brutal civil wars that defy description.'

**'This is a threat to Russia': Lavrov reacts to Macron's nuclear umbrella statement**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has called the statement of French President Emmanuel Macron about a possible nuclear umbrella for Europe a 'threat' to Russia. According to RIA Novosti, Lavrov said that Macron is 'preparing to use nuclear weapons against Russia', although Macron did not make such a direct statement in his speech. Lavrov also compared Macron to Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler, calling them his 'predecessors'. 'Mr. Macron is not acting very elegantly, because those [Napoleon and Hitler] directly said: we need to conquer Russia, we need to defeat it. And he, it seems, wants the same thing, but somehow claims that we need to fight Russia so that it doesn't defeat France, that Russia creates a threat to France and Europe', Lavrov said. He also stated that 'any sane person should understand that Moscow is not planning to fight Europe'. Lavrov also suggested that Macron should call Russian President Vladimir Putin to 'discuss problematic issues'. Macron previously stated that Russia plans to expand its army by 2030 and will not stop at Ukraine, and that Russia has turned the war against Ukraine into a global conflict. He also said that Russia represents a threat to France and Europe, and that peace is impossible without Ukraine. Macron also announced that France will start a strategic discussion on the spread of a nuclear 'umbrella' to European partners after a call from the likely future German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

**Nuclear Power Must Be Considered Again for Secure Electricity Supply**
The current expansion of renewable energy is insufficient. The necessary system expansion - storage, grid, and grid regulation - is neither designed nor seriously begun. Politics must again seriously discuss new nuclear power plants. The term 'Energiewende' (energy transition) generally refers to the replacement of fossil and nuclear energy with renewable energy. The recently adopted Stromgesetz (Electricity Act) aims to ensure a secure electricity supply solely with renewable energy. However, the main objectives of energy policy today are supply security and net-zero, i.e., reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero. Therefore, it is not sensible to declare the exit from nuclear energy as a goal of the energy transition from the outset, alongside the exit from fossil energy. First, it must be shown whether the expected purely renewable electricity supply is technically and economically feasible by 2050. The current development speaks a different language. To cover the increasing electricity demand and replace nuclear energy, only hydroelectric power and new renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy are available. Hydroelectric power is largely developed and can only produce a little additional electricity, but it will become even more important as the electricity supply becomes increasingly unstable. The expansion of renewable electricity generation will primarily be driven by photovoltaics. This has significant implications for the entire electricity system. The photovoltaic power output is fluctuating, with only about 30% available in winter, little is produced on cloudy days, and nothing at night. Therefore, seasonal and short-term storage, as well as increased grid and grid regulation, are necessary. This system expansion is just as necessary as the increase in production, it costs and takes time. The Stromgesetz requires 45 TWh of new renewable electricity by 2050, of which about 40 TWh should come from photovoltaics, requiring over 200 square kilometers of panel area. The wind is expected to produce 4.3 TWh in the energy perspectives 2050+, which corresponds to around 500 to 600 wind turbines of 4 MW each. However, this would only achieve a balanced annual balance of generation and consumption by the middle of the century. In winter, there would still be a high winter import dependence of 7 TWh, and in contrast, a significant summer surplus. There is also a power problem. The installed capacity of photovoltaics would be around 40 GW by 2050, to which would be added that of run-of-river power plants and wind. Even if not all plants produce at full capacity at the same time, a power output far exceeding the consumption load would have to be expected, which the grid could not absorb. The impending power surpluses could be reduced by flexibility measures, but in the summer, up to 20 GW of photovoltaic power generation would have to be prevented by regulation. The current expansion of renewables is too low to achieve the goals of the Stromgesetz on time. It must be immediately doubled. And the necessary system expansion - storage, grid, and grid regulation - is neither designed nor seriously begun. Therefore, a secure, independent electricity supply cannot be spoken of. This is already evident from the mentioned winter import requirement. For a secure electricity supply with renewable energy, which deserves this designation, an additional 7 TWh of winter power would have to be produced, primarily through photovoltaics. The PV capacity would then be 63 GW, and the area requirement 315 square kilometers. This is even more unrealistic than the requirements of the Stromgesetz. Politics must again seriously discuss new nuclear power plants, thanks to the Blackout Initiative. In the winter of 2023/24, nuclear energy covered 39.8% of the country's consumption, while new renewables brought together only 10.2%, and photovoltaics 4.2%. We should continue to use nuclear energy in the same scope of 3 GW of band energy in the future. Then, only 135 square kilometers of photovoltaic area would be needed for a secure electricity supply, the summer power and power surpluses would be significantly lower, and the system expansion requirement would be more moderate. Additionally, the production costs and greenhouse gas emissions of nuclear energy are lower than those of photovoltaics. With replacement nuclear power plants, a secure electricity supply and the exit from fossil energy would be more feasible and also more economical and climate-friendly.

**This Is The End (expanded )**
The world is on the brink of a new era of nuclear danger, with the likelihood of nuclear war higher than at any point since the Cuban Missile Crisis. The risk of nuclear war is driven by geopolitical instability, failing arms control agreements, and the emergence of AI in military decision-making. Experts estimate a five to ten percent chance of a full-scale nuclear war by 2030, while the probability of limited nuclear use is much higher, at twenty to thirty percent. The breakdown of diplomatic communication between nuclear-armed states raises the risk of miscalculation. The world is at a crossroads: either we take decisive action to prevent nuclear catastrophe, or we drift toward the unthinkable. The erosion of arms control agreements and the modernization of nuclear forces come at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock to 90 seconds to midnight in 2024, the closest it has ever been. Without serious diplomatic efforts, the world may be heading toward a new nuclear era  --  one far more unstable and unpredictable than the last. Some argue that nuclear war is unthinkable, but today's nuclear doctrines emphasize limited or tactical use, increasing the likelihood of an initial strike. History suggests that once nuclear weapons are used, the pressure to retaliate will be overwhelming, and escalation is far more likely than restraint. The world is at a crossroads, and the question is not whether nuclear war is possible, but whether we will take action to prevent it. Renewed arms control, diplomatic engagement, and international cooperation are the only viable paths forward.

**We must act urgently to stop Iran producing a nuclear bomb**
The UK and its allies are running out of time to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran has been accelerating its nuclear programme, and experts believe it could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear device at any time. The UK has a particular responsibility to act, as a signatory to the 2015 nuclear deal. A new policy paper argues that 2025 is a critical year to stop Iran, and suggests that the UK should build a common front with the E3, G7, and the US on tightening sanctions, especially on Iranian oil shipments to China. The UK government should also help isolate Iran and meet its threats by proscribing the IRGC, and be prepared to implement the snapback mechanism if Iran does not change course. Keir Starmer has said, 'We must ensure that Iran cannot possibly get weapons. The sanctions, and the regime around them, must be geared towards that central issue.'

**Towards a WW III Scenario. The Privatization of Nuclear War. - LewRockwell**
The world is closer than ever to a nuclear holocaust, with the US nuclear weapons program set to increase to 2 trillion dollars by 2030. The doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) has been scrapped, and 'offensive' military actions using nuclear warheads are now described as acts of 'self-defense'. The development of tactical nuclear weapons, also known as 'mini-nukes', has been accelerated, with the goal of making nuclear war more 'usable'. The privatization of nuclear war has led to corporations having a direct voice in setting the agenda regarding the use and deployment of nuclear weapons. The US public is not aware that the Truman administration had a secret plan to bomb 66 Soviet cities with 204 atomic bombs in 1945, and those who speak out against the use of nuclear weapons are branded as 'conspiracy theorists'.

**Towards a WW III Scenario. The Privatization of Nuclear War.**
According to Michel Chossudovsky, humanity is closer than ever to a nuclear holocaust, with the safeguards of the Cold War era scrapped and offensive military actions using nuclear warheads described as acts of 'self-defense'. The August 6-8 2003 'Privatization of Nuclear War' secret meeting at Strategic Command Headquarters in Nebraska led to a $1.3 trillion dollar nuclear weapons program, which is set to increase to 2 trillion dollars by 2030. Chossudovsky argues that the development of tactical nuclear weapons, which are identical to strategic nuclear bombs, poses a significant threat to global security. He also notes that the US military contractors are directly involved in the decision-making process, and that the nuclear weapons industry is controlled by a handful of defense contractors. Chossudovsky warns that the use of nuclear weapons threatens the future of humanity, but those who dare to say so are branded as 'conspiracy theorists'.
