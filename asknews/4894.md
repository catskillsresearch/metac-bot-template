**UK Bans Disposable Vape Devices to Combat Youth Vaping and Environmental Impact**
The United Kingdom has banned the sale and supply of disposable vape devices, a measure aimed at reducing youth access to vaping and the environmental impact of these devices. The ban, proposed by the previous Conservative government, was implemented by the current Labour government led by Keir Starmer. A fixed tariff of 2.20 pounds (2.62 euros) per 10 milliliters of liquid for vape devices will be introduced in October 2026. Businesses have six months to prepare for the change by selling existing stock, but those who continue to sell disposable devices risk fines of over 200 pounds (240 euros) and product seizures. David Tjokro, owner of London Vape House, a vape shop with multiple locations in London, said, 'If you switch from disposable to rechargeable, the user can save between 60 to 70%.' The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said that the use among young people is too high, and that the ban 'will put an end to its alarming increase in schoolyards and the avalanche of waste that floods the streets.' A study by Action on Smoking and Health found that 18% of British children aged 11-17 have tried vape devices, and 7% (390,000) vape regularly, attracted by their colors and flavors. The environmental component was a key factor in the ban, as the department estimated that nearly five million disposable vape devices were discarded each week in 2023.

**Morocco Implements 'Ban on Slaughter' Ahead of Eid al-Adha, Using Drones to Monitor Rooftops**
In a unprecedented move, Moroccan authorities have begun using drones to monitor rooftops and private areas to prevent illegal sheep slaughter outside the legal framework set by the kingdom for this year's Eid al-Adha. This measure is part of a set of strict security measures imposed by local authorities to prevent chaotic practices that may violate the official ban on slaughter during the Eid al-Adha 2025 season. According to Moroccan media, the instructions were issued from the highest administrative levels, including monitoring every household in residential areas, especially rooftops that are often used for home slaughter during the Eid. 'Any slaughter found outside the official channels will be confiscated immediately by the authorities and transferred to storage facilities owned by the municipality,' said sources familiar with the matter. The authorities have emphasized that the instructions are clear and there will be no leniency or tolerance in dealing with these cases, and all relevant institutions, including security agencies and municipalities, have received orders to apply the law firmly and quickly. The decision to ban slaughter is linked to a royal directive issued by King Mohammed VI in February 2025, in which he called on Moroccans to abstain from practicing the Eid al-Adha ritual this year due to exceptional circumstances, including drought, decline in animal production, and rising feed prices, which threaten the sustainability of the national livestock wealth. In a symbolic gesture aimed at alleviating the impact of the decision on people's minds, King Mohammed VI announced that he would perform the Eid al-Adha ritual on behalf of the Moroccan people, inspired by the prophetic tradition that refers to the Prophet Muhammad's sacrifice for himself and his people. Additional restrictions and limited public rejection The official decision did not only ban slaughter, but also prohibited the sale of all products related to Eid al-Adha traditions, such as coal, slaughter tools, and barbecue equipment. Field monitoring teams were formed to monitor markets and shops, with the aim of verifying their compliance with the ban in an attempt to cut off any preparations for slaughter outside the licensed framework. On the other hand, some consumer associations expressed their concern that these measures may be seen as an infringement on religious freedoms, warning of their social implications. However, the Moroccan authorities have confirmed that these decisions are temporary and exclusively linked to the environmental and economic circumstances, emphasizing that the top priority is to preserve the country's animal and environmental resources, which will achieve the public interest at the expense of the individual practice.

**Morocco's Ban on Eid al-Adha Slaughter Sparks Debate**
In Morocco, the decision to ban the slaughter of animals for Eid al-Adha has sparked a debate among citizens. Some have chosen to abide by the royal decree, while others have continued to slaughter animals in secret. The market for livestock has been affected, with some farmers reporting a 38% decrease in the number of animals since 2016. The government has imported 124,000 sheep, 21,000 cows, and 704 tons of red meat to meet the demand. The price of sheep has reached unprecedented levels, with some selling for up to $1,000. Some citizens have criticized those who have bought and slaughtered animals in secret, calling it a 'symbolic act of disobedience' and a 'disregard for the government's efforts to maintain food security.' A farmer from Tiflet said that the ban has caused a 'medium loss' for him, but that the 'public interest is above all consideration.' A teacher, Meryem Zaynoun, said that she and her family have not slaughtered an animal for Eid al-Adha in the past year, and that they have been buying meat from butchers before the holiday. She added that 'it is better to buy meat before the holiday and allocate the day for family and worship.' The government has taken measures to stabilize the market, including exempting livestock and red meat from customs duties and VAT in the 2025 budget. However, the ban has not been without its challenges, with some citizens feeling that it is an infringement on their right to practice their faith.

**UK Bans Disposable Vape Devices to Protect Environment and Minors**
The United Kingdom has banned the sale of disposable vape devices, effective from this Sunday, in an effort to reduce their environmental impact and curb their use among young people. The new regulations, which include fines of over 200 pounds (240 euros) and product seizures, prohibit the sale or supply of any vape device that does not have a rechargeable battery. However, the industry sees this as an opportunity for business, and health associations warn that they are already offering similar products in terms of appearance and price to disposable ones. 'If you switch from disposable to rechargeable, the user can save between 60% to 70%', said David Tjokro, owner of London Vape House, a specialized vape shop with several branches in London. Tjokro, who claims to have recommended this switch to his customers for months, also points out the poor quality of disposable devices, often made in China, compared to the liquids used in rechargeable devices, which come from countries like the US, Canada, or the UK. 'I'm not saying that the Chinese product is bad, but considering the perception and quality control, I would say that China is probably not the best country for this type of thing', explained Tjokro. The ban aims to protect both the environment and minors, as the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimated that nearly five million disposable vape devices were discarded every week in 2023. If not properly recycled, the batteries and circuit boards of these devices can release toxic compounds like copper and cobalt, and cause fires in waste trucks, according to the Local Government Association. A 2024 study by the Action on Smoking and Health NGO found that 18% of British children aged 11-17 (980,000) have tried vape devices, and 7% (390,000) vape regularly, attracted by their colors and flavors. The ban was proposed by the previous Conservative government and was implemented by the current Labour government, led by Keir Starmer, when they came to power in July 2024. A fixed tax of $2.20 pounds ($2.62 euros) per 10 milliliters of vape liquid will be added in October 2026.

**Ayodhya to ban meat sale along key religious routes, says Mayor Tripathi**
Ayodhya officials have begun taking action to ban meat sales along key religious routes like Ram Path and Dhama Kosi Marg, following complaints raised at UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath's Janta Darbar. According to Ayodhya Mayor Girish Pati Tripathi, a liquor ban is also being planned. Tripathi stated, 'It was under discussion for a very long time that the sale of meat be banned in Ayodhya. It was decided that the sale of meat must be prohibited on Ram Path.' Commissioner Manik Chand informed that 22 meat shops were running across these religious routes and that notices are being issued to the shopkeepers, giving them a time limit of seven days to relocate. Chand said, 'There are 22 meat shops on Ram Path, Bhakti Path and Dharma Path and 14 Kosi Marg... If there are any other shops, they will also face a similar procedure.' CM Yogi Adityanath had earlier issued strict orders to close illegal slaughterhouses and enforce a ban on the sale of meat within a 500-meter radius of religious sites.

**UK to Ban Single-Use E-Cigarettes Amid Growing Concerns Over Nicotine Addiction**
The UK will ban the sale of single-use e-cigarettes, commonly used among young people, starting from Sunday. This move comes after Belgium and France announced the same decision earlier this year. According to Environment Minister Mary Creagh, 'single-use e-cigarettes have filled our streets and caused nicotine addiction among our children.' From Sunday, the sale and distribution of cheap, colorful, and flavored single-use e-cigarettes popular among young people and available in the country since 2021 will be prohibited. Those who violate the ban will face a fine of £200 (approximately $269) and those who repeat the offense may face up to two years in prison. This law has been in the making since the previous Conservative government. In 2024, around 5 million of these e-cigarettes were disposed of every week, according to the non-profit organization 'Material Fox.' This represents over 40 tons of lithium per year, enough to power 5,000 electric cars, according to the non-governmental organization. E-cigarette waste also poses a fire risk to household waste. According to the Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) organization, 11% of British adults use e-cigarettes, approximately 5.6 million people. ASH also reported that 18% of young people aged 11-17, approximately 980,000, used e-cigarettes in 2024. ASH's Deputy Executive Director Caroline Sweeney said, 'This new law represents a step towards reducing e-cigarette use among children, while ensuring the availability of products that help people quit smoking.' E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful components of tobacco smoke, but they do contain nicotine, a major cause of addiction. The ban has led to a decrease in the use of these products: according to ASH, the percentage of single-use e-cigarette users among all e-cigarette users aged 18-24 decreased from 52% in 2024 to 40% in 2025. France and Belgium were the first European countries to ban the sale of single-use e-cigarettes this year, while Irish authorities are considering similar measures. On the other hand, the e-cigarette industry warns of the growth of the black market due to these measures. Dan Marchant, director of 'Vape Club,' the UK's largest online retailer of e-cigarettes, said, 'This law only prohibits the sale of single-use e-cigarettes; it does not ban their use.' He added, 'This is a gamble that may lead to an increase in illicit products that may be hazardous.'

**Tangier Governor Bans Sale of Sacrificial Animals**
The Governor of Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region has issued strict instructions to the mayors and workers in the region to prevent the sale of sacrificial animals in the coming days. According to sources, the Governor, Younes Tazi, held a meeting with the mayors and leaders, and issued strict orders to tighten the surveillance and prevent any illegal sales of the sacrificial animals. The sources also reported that the authorities in the city of Tetouan have increased their surveillance efforts, in coordination with the security forces and the Royal Gendarmerie, and are stopping any trucks carrying sacrificial animals to the city for sale in the markets at the end of the week. The sources stated that the city has seen a significant movement in the purchase and slaughter of sacrificial animals in the past few days, and their storage in a warehouse that has raised eyebrows among many observers and stakeholders in the meat industry. The sources also reported that checkpoints have been set up at the entrances to the city of Al Hamama Al Bayda, preventing the passage of any trucks carrying sacrificial animals, unless the driver has a permit that allows him to go directly to the slaughterhouse affiliated with the municipal council. As for the region of Al Hoceima, which has one of the largest markets for the sale of sacrificial animals in the north, the sources confirmed that the ban will also apply to the marketing of sheep in the market of 'Oulad Hamid' in the Kasr Al Kebir, which is visited by residents of various cities in the north to buy sacrificial animals. The local sources reported that the instructions issued in this regard aim to prevent the transfer of sacrificial animals to the market, and that the authorities will confiscate the heads of the animals and issue reports against those who violate the ban. This measure appears to be applied to all regions in the province.

**The Future of Slaughterhouses in South Tyrol: A Look at the Challenges and Opportunities**
The South Tyrolean butchers' branch is setting important milestones for the future. The focus is on updating the training content and maintaining a functioning and widespread slaughterhouse structure. The Professional Advisory Board of the Butchers in the lvh and the Working Group Committee for Food, as well as the lvh Presidency, have approved the educational order and the final examination program. Key points include professional ethics, with a focus on respectful treatment of animals and products, grilling and BBQ, convenience products, and the sustainability aspect. After consulting with the social partners, formal approval by the provincial government will follow. In parallel to the educational reform, the future of the 42 slaughterhouses in South Tyrol was also discussed with Provincial Councillor Luis Walcher. A lvh survey among the companies shows that two-thirds of the slaughterhouses consider their structures to be efficient, while one-third recognizes the need for adaptation. Alarmingly, around 21% of the companies see no prospect for continued operation. lvh Vice-President Hannes Mussak and Director Walter Pöhl emphasized in the following statement, 'The discussion was factual and constructive - we are pursuing the same interests.'

**Factcheck: British government does not plan to ban meat and dairy products by 2050**
A claim is circulating online that the British government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, plans to ban meat and dairy products by 2050 to make the country carbon neutral. This is false. The claim is based on a report from a British research consortium, but the report does not mention a ban on dairy or meat. The report, 'Agro-Food System Innovation without Greenhouse Gases', published on March 11, 2025, does discuss the impact of meat and dairy production on carbon emissions, but does not advocate for a ban. The British government has announced a ban on importing cheese and meat from the European Union, but this is to prevent the spread of diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie, not to ban meat and dairy products. 'We are not planning to ban meat and dairy products,' said a spokesperson for the British government, 'our goal is to make the country carbon neutral by 2050, but we will do this through sustainable and innovative practices, not through bans.'

The UK has banned the importation of meat and dairy products from EU countries, except for poultry, due to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. This ban has significant implications for travelers who may be tempted to bring back local delicacies from their European holidays. Meanwhile, conservationists have warned that some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being pushed closer to extinction due to intense grass fires. Farmers are also concerned about trade deals, including a potential agreement with India, which they fear could undermine their livelihoods. The Jones Food Company, a leading vertical farm operator, has gone bust, raising questions about the viability of this method of growing food. Finally, we explore the art of sheep shearing in West Dorset.

**All products Brits are now banned from bringing back from Europe following new rule**
A new ban on certain products from Europe has been implemented for Brits to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. The disease, which poses little danger to humans but is catastrophic for cattle and other livestock, has been detected in Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia. The UK government has announced a ban on bringing meat and dairy products from EU or EEA countries into Great Britain for personal use, including beef, pork, lamb, mutton, venison, and goat meat, as well as all dairy products like cheese, butter, or yoghurt. According to Dr. Jorge Martin-Almagro, the UK's Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer, 'Following the detection of foot and mouth disease in EU countries resulting in a rising risk of introduction into Great Britain, we have extended restrictions on the personal imports of food products that pose a risk in FMD transmission.' The UK Border Force will destroy any prohibited items, and individuals are allowed to bring up to 2kg per person of pet food for medical reasons. The last foot and mouth disease outbreak in the UK was in 2001, resulting in the slaughter of over six million animals.

**UK bans EU cheese and meat imports to prevent disease spreading - MyJoyOnline**
The UK government has imposed a temporary ban on holidaymakers bringing in cheese and meat products from the EU to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. The restrictions apply to people arriving in Great Britain, excluding Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man. Products will be seized and destroyed if people try to bring them in, and in 'serious cases' people could be fined up to £5,000. The Guild of Fine Food supports the ban, stating that biosecurity is paramount, but notes that 'bureaucracy' brought in after Brexit has added 'significant constraints' for small food and drink importers and exporters. John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food, said, 'The food and drink industry absolutely supports the fact that we must protect our farmers and that biosecurity is paramount.' There are currently no cases of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, but the last outbreak in 2001 resulted in 2,000 confirmed cases and the slaughter of over six million sheep, cattle, and pigs.

**UK Bans Livestock Products Due to Foot-and-Mouth Disease Outbreak**
The UK has announced a ban on bringing any products of bovine, ovine, or porcino origin into the country, including cheese, cured meats, raw meat, and milk, due to an increase in the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe. Although the disease does not pose a risk to humans, it is highly contagious among livestock, posing a significant risk to farmers and ranchers. The disease is characterized by the formation of ulcers or sores in the mouth, particularly painful and similar to a burn. The virus responsible for the disease is a picornavirus, and according to the World Health Organization, it is not transmitted from animals to humans. However, scientists who have worked with infected livestock have reported some cases of transmission, although the number is less than 100. The symptoms are mild and do not lead to long-term complications. The risk of the disease lies in its high level of viral activity, which can have significant economic consequences, including severe losses. A recent outbreak in the UK in 2001 resulted in the slaughter of over 6 million animals and losses of over €13 billion.

**Travel warning as UK issues ban amid 'highly contagious virus' outbreak in Europe - Manchester Evening News**
The UK government has announced a ban on personal meat and dairy imports from all EU countries due to a highly-contagious foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in Hungary. The ban aims to protect British farms from the growing crisis, which has resulted in the slaughter of thousands of cattle. FMD poses no danger to humans but can cause trade restrictions. The UK government will seize and destroy any banned items found at the border, and violators could face fines of up to £5,000. Farming Minister Daniel Zeichner said, 'This government will do whatever it takes to protect British farmers from foot & mouth.' UK Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Jorge Martin-Almagro added, 'Robust contingency plans are already in place to manage the risk of this disease to protect farmers and Britain's food security.'

**Strict Enforcement of Ban on Slaughtering Female Sheep and Goats: A Significant Decrease in Import Requests**
According to a source within the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water, and Forests, the strict enforcement of the ban on slaughtering female sheep and goats for a year has been 'present in a significant way' during the first week of the implementation of the joint circular issued in coordination with the Ministry of the Interior. The source explained that 'efforts were made to motivate the authorities of the two ministries, as well as the National Office for Food Safety, to ensure the proper and strict implementation of the circular, which is considered very important and has a strategic impact.' The source stated that 'no clear violations of the decision to ban the slaughter of female sheep and goats have been reported in the past period, but the relevant authorities remain vigilant and prepared to take necessary action and intervene according to their powers.' The source also pointed out that 'there is a formal wager that the recent rainfall will help the proper implementation of the circular in the coming periods, as we have seen during the past two weeks that some shepherds have kept their sheep, especially females, in their possession.' Additionally, the source acknowledged that 'there was a kind of confusion in the markets after the royal decision to the Moroccans not to slaughter the sacrifices this year, where the shepherds were seen to get rid of their sheep and direct them directly to the slaughterhouses, which was a harbinger of a difficult problem.' However, the source explained that 'the market soon regained its stability due to the rainfall recorded in March.' In a related context, the source confirmed that 'a significant decrease has been recorded in the number of requests received for importing pet animals, especially sheep, since the royal decree was issued regarding Eid al-Adha'; describing this decrease as 'strange', at a time when the authorities 'relied on bringing more sheep from abroad to reduce the prices of red meat in the kingdom.' The source also explained that 'this process enjoys significant facilitations from the relevant ministries, where the payment of import duties for these animals is suspended, while a subsidy of 500 dirhams per head is provided only for Eid al-Adha last year, meaning that this subsidy does not include import operations throughout the year, but is exceptional.' Regarding the results of the 2024 livestock census, the source informed the newspaper that they 'are practically ready after the work that brought together the responsible ministry and the National Association of Sheep and Goat Breeders; however, the decision to disclose them to the public remains the prerogative of the Minister.' The results of this census, according to the source, 'will be a real indicator of the national flock's situation and the extent of its impact by the drought over the past six years, at least; which contributed to the decision to suspend the sacrifice during Eid al-Adha next year.'

**Walloon Region to Ban Home Slaughter of Pigs, Goats, and Sheep**
The Walloon region plans to ban the slaughter of pigs, goats, and sheep at home in order to ensure better enforcement of food safety and animal welfare laws. According to the Walloon Minister-President, who is in charge of animal welfare, 'It's not about going against religious practices, but about regulating them in light of essential animal welfare elements.'
