**Ahsa Appeals Against 62 MW Solar Plant in Alicante**
The environmental group Ahsa has filed an appeal against the authorization of the 62 MW Lucinala solar plant, which was approved in April. The plant will occupy 120 hectares of land, and the group argues that it will have a significant impact on the Clot de Galvany wetland. Ahsa is not alone in its appeal, as other groups such as the association vecinal of Santa Anna and ADR have also filed appeals. The group highlights that the appeal is made 'in the midst of a controversy over the model of implementation of renewable energies', which was sparked by the power outage on April 28. They argue that the current model benefits only large energy companies and investment funds, 'more concerned with generating enormous profits than ensuring a sustainable, secure, and accessible electricity grid for citizens.' The group also notes that Spain's renewable energy capacity has exceeded the country's needs, with 144 GW of capacity already in place, surpassing the 138 GW target set by the new PNIEC 2023-2030 plan. Ahsa is part of the campaign ¡IPSO FACTO!, which demands the immediate halt of all macro-renewable energy projects in Spain.

**AI Energy Consumption to Surpass Bitcoin Mining by 2025, Study Warns**
According to a new study, the energy consumption of AI systems is growing faster than expected and could surpass that of Bitcoin mining by the end of 2025. By then, AI will account for almost half of the global energy consumption of data centers, up from 20% currently. The study's author, Alex de Vries-Gao, criticizes the lack of transparency from tech companies about the actual energy costs of AI applications. He draws parallels with the cryptocurrency industry, where the 'bigger is better' approach has led to environmental degradation. The study warns that the US market could see a 25% increase in energy consumption from AI, Bitcoin mining, and traditional data centers by 2030. However, it's not just the amount of energy that matters, but also its source. For example, a search query in West Virginia generates almost twice as much CO2 emissions as the same query in California, where renewable energy dominates. Despite progress in efficiency and sustainability, the study finds the situation alarming. The global energy consumption of data centers could reach the level of Japan's total energy demand by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency. Additionally, the increasing demand for specialized chips and other components drives up the demand for rare earth materials, while water consumption for cooling systems is also on the rise. In some regions, the establishment of data centers and their water consumption is already in conflict with the needs of the local population.

**Solar Power Surpasses Nuclear Power Globally for the First Time**
According to Ember's research, solar power has surpassed nuclear power globally for the first time in April, generating 233 Terawatt-hours compared to the 213 Terawatt-hours produced by nuclear power. This milestone is the result of a long-standing competition between the two energy sources, although it is not yet definitive due to the fluctuations inherent in solar power. In the past five years, the global capacity of solar power has tripled, largely thanks to massive Chinese investments. Solar power is now competing with nuclear power for the fourth spot among energy sources, preceded by various hydrocarbons (coal remains the most used), hydroelectric, and wind power. Renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, have generated 32% of the world's electricity consumption, according to Ember's data. However, the growth of renewable energy has not been accompanied by a corresponding reduction in other energy sources, leading to increased consumption and emissions. As a result, 2024 was also a record year for oil and coal consumption, as well as CO2 emissions. These findings raise further doubts about the opportunity to relaunch nuclear programs, such as those proposed by the Meloni government, considering the long time it takes to build new nuclear power plants, which would only provide the first watts in a couple of decades.

**Trump's Climate Policy: Climate Collapse or Minor Hiccups?**
According to the Climate Action 100+ initiative, over 160 companies with a combined market capitalization of $25 trillion have joined efforts to reduce emissions. Large users of renewable energy have a significant impact, as 70% of the US GDP today comes from the service sector, which consumes a lot of energy. The rapid growth in demand for energy from data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) is also noteworthy. Internet traffic has increased by 18 times over the past 10 years, and the AI revolution and data explosion require more and more energy. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Google, Microsoft, and Amazon's investments in AI and data centers in 2023 exceeded those of the entire US oil and gas industry. The increased demand for electricity creates challenges for utilities. Meanwhile, tech companies want the lowest electricity prices, and renewable energy sources offer them. The main reason is that energy consumption from renewable sources is growing faster than from any other source of electricity in the US. The global market for these technologies is expected to grow from $700 billion in 2023 to over $2 trillion by 2035. China dominates the production of solar panels, electric vehicles, and batteries. If the US does not support its domestic renewable energy industries, China's dominance will only grow, followed by the European Union (EU) and even India. Abandoning federal support for VRE in the US means missing out on significant economic opportunities.
