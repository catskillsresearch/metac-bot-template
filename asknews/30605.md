**The Richest Individuals in the World: What They Do and How They Made Their Fortunes**
Forbes has released its list of the world's richest individuals, and we take a look at what they do for a living. With figures that are hard to comprehend, these individuals are heirs, entrepreneurs in sectors such as technology, cosmetics, and logistics, as well as business leaders from various nationalities. The majority of these entrepreneurs hold active roles such as creatives, CEOs, or shareholders, building empires valued in millions and making strategic decisions for each sector. Elon Musk remains the world's richest man after adding $46 billion to his fortune in April. His companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI, have contributed to his growth. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, comes in second with a fortune of $201.6 billion, despite a 4% drop in Amazon's stock price in April. Mark Zuckerberg, despite a $9.3 billion loss in April, remains a key figure in the digital world. Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, increased his fortune by $1.9 billion in April, thanks to the rise in Oracle's stock price and his involvement in the Proyecto Stargate, a key alliance for the development of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US. Warren Buffett, the architect of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s growth, will retire at the end of 2025, ending a six-decade tenure and leaving a lasting impact on global investment.

**Elon Musk's Fortune Grows to $386.5 Billion, Leading the List of the 10 Richest Men in the World**
Elon Musk's fortune increased by $46 billion in April 2025, making him the leader of the list of the 10 richest men in the world, according to Forbes. The 'volatility of April' affected the ranking of the richest people in the world, with Musk's fortune increasing due to a 7% rise in Tesla's stock price. However, Tesla's sales fell by 13% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Musk plans to dedicate more time to Tesla starting from May. The global ranking of fortunes shows that Musk leads with an estimated $386.5 billion, followed by Jeff Bezos with $201.6 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg with $192.3 billion. Amancio Ortega, the founder of Inditex, saw his fortune increase by $8.9 billion in April, reaching a total of $114.4 billion. 'The combination of a 2% increase in Inditex's stock price and the appreciation of the euro against the dollar (+5%) contributed to his fortune,' according to Forbes, citing Infobae.

**Bill Gates Accuses Elon Musk of Contributing to Deaths of Poorest Children**
Bill Gates accused Elon Musk of being 'the richest man in the world and being involved in the death of the poorest children in the world' due to his cuts to the USAID budget. Gates stated that Musk 'could have been a great philanthropist, but meanwhile, the richest man in the world has been involved in the death of the poorest children in the world.' He emphasized that the rich should do more philanthropy, especially in the next 20 years when the Gates Foundation will cease to exist. Gates expressed optimism about the potential of artificial intelligence to improve healthcare, agriculture, and education, but noted that it requires continued investment beyond business benefits. He believes that the humanitarian budget will not be consistently cut and that child mortality will continue to decrease over the next 20 years.

**The Loss of Humanity and the Rise of Politics**
Bill Gates, the American billionaire and founder of Microsoft, plans to distribute his wealth, estimated to be over $100 billion, to the poor and humanitarian projects in the coming years before closing his foundation in 2045. Gates criticized Elon Musk, the richest man in the world and owner of Tesla, for reducing funding to the US Agency for International Development, which led to the expiration of lifesaving food and medicine. Gates said, 'The picture of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a beautiful one.' The article highlights the issue of humanity being overshadowed by politics, where the latter can justify any action, including sacrificing the poor and vulnerable. The author also discusses the current situation in Egypt, where there are complex issues related to the old rent law and the attempt to find a balance between the rights of landlords and tenants. The author believes that the timing is not suitable for introducing this law now, as it will only create more controversy and anxiety in a country already facing economic difficulties. Additionally, the article mentions a group of women in a new residential city who are promoting a course on 'sexual culture' and making provocative comments. The author believes that there is a lack of shame and decorum in discussing such topics. The article also shares a personal anecdote about a vendor who sold a tree to the author's family for a small amount of money, which eventually grew into a large tree that became a landmark in the area. The author concludes by saying that this is a sign of the times, a sign of the loss of values and the lack of education and family values. Finally, the article touches on the current situation in Egyptian football, where teams are using data and making threats to other teams to gain points outside of the game. The author believes that this is a sign of the decay of the sport and the lack of respect for the law and the game.

**Elon Musk Remains World's Richest Person in 2025**
As of the end of April 2025, Elon Musk remains the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $335 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This is significantly higher than the net worth of other billionaires, such as Jeff Bezos ($209 billion) and Mark Zuckerberg ($195 billion). Forbes also estimates Musk's net worth to be $342 billion, keeping him at the top of the list of the world's richest people. Musk's wealth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. Although Tesla's stock has declined by 37% since the beginning of the year, the growth in value of SpaceX and other assets has helped to offset these losses. Musk has also announced plans to focus on leading Tesla, reducing his involvement in public affairs, which may positively impact investor confidence and further growth of his companies. In December 2024, Musk's net worth reached a record $500 billion, but it later decreased due to the decline in Tesla's stock. Since the beginning of 2025, Musk has lost approximately $134.7 billion. However, thanks to the growth in value of SpaceX and other assets, his net worth has again exceeded $300 billion. As a result, Musk continues to hold the position of the world's richest person, despite market fluctuations and political challenges.

**'Better Balance His Time Between DOGE and Tesla, SpaceX': Elon Musk's Net Worth Has Dropped More Than $100 Billion This Year**
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has seen his net worth drop by around $102 billion in the last couple of months, mostly due to Tesla's share price dropping 35% this year. Despite this, Musk remains the richest person in the world with a net worth of $330 billion, according to Bloomberg. Analysts are optimistic that Tesla will turn around, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives saying, 'We expect Musk will better balance his time between DOGE and Tesla/SpaceX over the course of 2025.'

**Who are the 10 richest people in the world in March 2025**
Elon Musk, owner of companies like Tesla and Space X, was the biggest loser in the group, despite still maintaining his position as the richest person on the planet in March. The reason was the decline in Tesla's stock, which reduced his fortune by $62 billion (R$ 366 billion). In December, Musk, who also serves as the leader of the Doge (Department of Government Efficiency) of Donald Trump's government, had become the first billionaire to surpass $400 billion, driven by the growth of Tesla and the valuation of his artificial intelligence company xAI. Now, with the decline in Tesla's stock, his fortune is estimated to be around $360 billion (R$ 2.1 trillion), according to Forbes.
