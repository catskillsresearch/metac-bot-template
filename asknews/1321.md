**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**Putin thought time was on his side, Ukraine proved him wrong, says Ian Bremmer**
American geopolitical expert Ian Bremmer believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin's assumption that time is on his side in the three-year-old war with Ukraine was proven wrong by Kyiv's drone attacks on Russian airbases. Bremmer stated that Putin has been unwilling to take meaningful steps towards a peace deal with Ukraine, and that US President Donald Trump is increasingly frustrated with Putin's non-commitment to a ceasefire. Trump is now pivoting towards the Middle East, as he is 'bored and tired' with the lack of progress in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks. Bremmer warned that if Putin does not respond positively to the US's overtures, there could be a 'basic expectation' that Trump may end his diplomatic engagement in the Russia-Ukraine war. Bremmer added that Putin's miscalculation may threaten his own survival, as those around him may hold him responsible for making the worst strategic decision in Russia's contemporary history. 'If Putin is prepared to see things clearly, this should be an incentive for him to engage more seriously,' Bremmer said. 'But, Russians and Ukrainians are very far from an agreement. There's no common language right now.'

**The AI Singularity: Are We on the Edge of a New Era?**
The concept of the 'Singularity,' where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, has long been a topic of debate. With recent breakthroughs in AI, such as large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, the timeline for the Singularity has moved from decades to possibly years or months. According to a study by AIMultiple, there has been a huge acceleration in anticipation, driven by innovation in AI models. Experts predict that the Singularity could be reached by 2026, with some estimating it could happen as soon as the next six months. Factors driving this faster pace include exponential growth in computing power and the availability of data. As AI systems become smarter, they may be able to solve complex problems and exhibit human-like abilities, but critics fear possible dangers, such as the loss of human control and unintended outcomes. As Dr. Kurzweil, a pioneer of the Singularity concept, said, 'The Singularity refers to the point at which AI systems start improving themselves and become smarter than human intelligence.'

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts a Future of 'Immortality' and Superintelligence: Science Fiction or Reality?**
Ray Kurzweil, a well-known futurist, reiterates his vision of a future transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) and exponential advancements in various areas. He predicts that AI will surpass human intelligence in 2029 and, shortly after, humanity will be able to stop aging forever. Kurzweil attributes this to the convergence of three trends: the constant and exponential growth in the relationship between price and performance of computing, the improvement of algorithms, and the massive increase in rich and extensive datasets to train AI. He also anticipates a transformation in medicine, where AI will enable intensive biosimulation, testing billions of molecular sequences to find optimal medications for each disease. Additionally, AI will facilitate the development of proteins with specific functions, such as stimulating the immune system to combat cancer and Alzheimer's. Kurzweil believes that the AI will act as if it were conscious by 2029 and will be treated as such. He envisions a future where intelligence transcends the physical and expands into the cosmos, with humanity exploring other planets and spreading its intelligence through nanobots. Kurzweil dismisses the possibility of encountering an aggressive alien superintelligence, arguing that if such civilizations exist, they would have already performed galaxy-scale engineering, which is not observed. He emphasizes that the predictions are based on scientific data and the Law of Accelerating Returns, which states that information technologies improve exponentially. Kurzweil has tracked the power of computing for 42 years and his data show a constant exponential growth since 1939. He concludes that the future is optimistic, with the potential for humanity to use technology responsibly and make progress in areas like energy, food production, and medicine.
