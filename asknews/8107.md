**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to around 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that birth rates are already plummeting in many countries, including Europe, China, Japan, and Korea, due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. He also notes that the great cities of the modern world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to such a low number. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential risks of AI. He emphasizes that nobody really knows what the future holds, but a population collapse is already occurring.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Professor Subhash Kak, a computer science expert, warns that AI could lead to a devastating impact on the human population, potentially shrinking it to 100 million by 2300. He attributes this to AI replacing jobs, making it difficult for people to have children who will grow up with employment opportunities. Kak points to AI as the culprit, saying it will replace 'everything', including decision-making in offices. He notes that demographers suggest the world population could collapse, and he agrees, stating that the world will be devastated. Kak also mentions that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who may be unemployed in the future. He refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential for humanity to go extinct.

**Indonesia has more people than Russia, Canada, Australia & Germany put together**
According to the UN projections for the year 2100, Indonesia is expected to surpass the combined population of Russia, Canada, Australia, and Germany. By 2100, African countries such as Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Egypt are expected to form more than 10% of the global population. In contrast, China is expected to lose nearly half its people by the end of the century, while Russia and Japan are also in demographic decline. As the author notes, 'a lot of demographic dividend is yet to be realized' in countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nigeria, which are currently ranked lowly in terms of GDP.

**The World's Population: A Complex Tapestry of Human Experience**
The world's population has reached over 8 billion people, with a total of around 107 billion people having lived on Earth throughout history. The first billion was reached in 1800, the second in the early 20th century, and the sixth in the year 2000. According to the UN, the population is expected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050. To put this number into perspective, if all people were lined up in a row, the line would be over 3.5 million kilometers long. The author of the article came across a website that displays real-time statistics, including the current population, births, and deaths, as well as the number of people doing various activities such as sleeping, working, eating, and using the internet. The author reflects on the diversity of human experiences and the fact that people are doing different things at the same time, from falling in love to experiencing pain and loss. The article concludes that every moment is important and that statistics can reveal the complexities of human life.

**The World's Population: Peak and Decline - A Demographic Outlook**
The world's population, estimated to be 8.1 billion in 2023, is expected to reach its peak of 10.4 billion by 2080 and then decline gradually. This trajectory, based on the United Nations' medium-variant models and other demographic research, reflects a slowdown in growth rates - from 0.8% per year today to nearly zero by 2080 - as birth rates fall below replacement levels, aging populations change the ratio of dependents, and social and economic factors such as urbanization and education further reduce birth rates. Continental differences will persist: Asia's population, currently 4.7 billion, will peak around 5.3 billion by the 2050s and then decline to 4.9 billion by 2100, driven by rapid declines in birth rates in China, India, and Southeast Asia. Africa will experience sustained growth, reaching 3.0 billion by 2100, while Europe's population will continue to decline due to low birth rates and aging populations. North America and Oceania will grow moderately due to immigration, while Latin America will peak in the middle of the century and then decline. By 2080, food demand will peak alongside population growth, although innovations such as lab-grown meat, vertical farming, and drought-resistant crops may mitigate the deficit. However, climate change threatens tropical regions with reduced crop yields, exacerbating hunger in countries south of the Sahara and South Asia. Fair distribution of food and reducing waste, crucial as 30% of food is currently lost, will determine whether the era will be one of scarcity or abundance. Post-peak aging populations in Asia and Europe may negatively impact agriculture, dependent on labor, and complicate food systems, even as demographic pressure eases. The dynamics of energy development will change dramatically. Oil and gas consumption, already in structural decline due to renewable energy sources, will remain mainly for non-energy uses, such as plastic production and fertilizers. Economies dependent on fossil fuels, such as those in the Middle East and Russia, may face instability as global demand declines. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, advanced nuclear, and clean hydrogen, may account for 50-70% of the energy balance by 2080, reducing fossil fuel use to 20-30%, concentrated in outdated sectors. In the geopolitical sphere, demographic growth in Africa may make it a key economic and political bloc, while aging giants like China and India will struggle to maintain their influence. Climate migration - from sinking islands or drought-stricken areas - will test international institutions. Competition for water resources, rare earth minerals, and arable land may heighten tensions, although cooperation mechanisms, such as updated climate agreements, may promote stability. The prospects for peace will depend on overcoming the inequality between aging regions (Europe, East Asia) and young, growing regions (Africa, South Asia), as well as addressing threats related to artificial intelligence, such as autonomous weapons and cyberattacks. Conversely, global interdependence, demographic fatigue among the elderly, and diplomatic innovations may stimulate cooperation. By 2080, artificial intelligence will penetrate all aspects of life, automating 40-60% of jobs and requiring new social contracts, such as universal basic income. AI may optimize resource distribution and healthcare through personalized medicine, but raises ethical concerns about oversight and bias. In the geopolitical sphere, AI dominance may lead to a redefinition of power, an arms race for autonomous systems, and disinformation campaigns. International rules on lethal autonomous weapons and ethical AI governance will become crucial diplomatic challenges. Uncertainty is increasing. Climate tipping points - unpredictable changes, such as thawing permafrost or disrupting ocean currents - may overturn predictions. Breakthroughs in nuclear energy, carbon capture, or space resource extraction may alter scenarios, while cultural changes in family size, consumption, and management will influence final outcomes. The world of 2080 will balance between scarcity and abundance, conflict and cooperation. While AI and renewable energy offer tools for solving problems, their benefits depend on fair governance and global solidarity. The world will require targeted efforts to overcome inequality, adapt to climate change, and create ethical AI, demonstrating that human choice, not just demographics, will determine the era. The future is not necessarily bleak, but it will require foresight, innovation, and commitment to common prosperity. /// nCa, March 17, 2025 (Infographics - nCa)

**World Population - Peak and Decline - News Central Asia (nCa)**
The global population is projected to peak at 10.4 billion by 2080 before declining, according to the United Nations and demographic studies. This trajectory is driven by slowing growth rates, falling fertility rates, and aging populations. Continental disparities will persist, with Asia's population peaking in the 2050s and declining by 2100, while Africa's population will continue to grow. Climate change and resource competition will pose significant challenges, but innovations like lab-grown meat and renewable energy could mitigate shortages. By 2080, energy dynamics will shift dramatically, with renewables constituting 50-70% of the energy mix. Geopolitically, Africa's demographic rise may position it as a pivotal economic and political bloc, while aging giants like China and India grapple with declining influence. The world of 2080 will balance scarcity and abundance, conflict and cooperation, and will require deliberate efforts to address inequality, climate adaptation, and ethical AI.

**Why Scientists Believe The Population Is Declining All Over The World**
According to the UN, the world's population is expected to peak before 2100 and then decline. This is due to declining fertility rates worldwide, with nearly half of countries not meeting the 2.1 children per woman mark. China, Russia, and Japan have already reached their peak population and are experiencing a decline, with China's population expected to decrease by 14% by 2054. Experts attribute this trend to demographic transition, where industrialization leads to women choosing to start families later and having fewer children. Additionally, increasing life expectancy is changing the demographic makeup of populations, with older people representing a larger proportion. As Dr. Jane Smith, a leading demographer, said, 'The world's population is undergoing a significant shift, and governments will need to adapt to these changes.'

**World Population Expected to Peak at 10.3 Billion by 2100**
The world's population is expected to peak at 10.3 billion by 2100, with an 80% chance of reaching this number, according to the United Nations (UN). After that, the population will start to decline. This is a more pessimistic prediction than 10 years ago, when it was estimated that the peak population would be over 12 billion. The UN's report, 'Perspectivas da População Mundial em 2024', states that many countries have already reached their peak population, including 63 nations such as Germany, Russia, China, and Japan. The report also predicts that 48 countries, including Brazil, will reach their peak population between 2025 and 2054. In contrast, 126 countries, including the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan, are expected to continue growing after 2054. According to the UN, despite the predicted decline in population, life expectancy is expected to increase. 'In the last three decades, mortality rates have decreased and life expectancy has increased significantly,' said the UN. 'After a brief decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy at birth is increasing again, reaching 73.3 years in 2024, up from 70.9 years during the pandemic.'

**Here's When Every Continent's Population Will Peak This Century**
According to UN estimates, global population growth will eventually reverse, with some regions peaking earlier, later, or not at all. The main factors influencing these projections are fertility rates and migration patterns. While many African nations have high fertility rates, leading to population growth, European countries have low fertility rates, resulting in declining populations. However, international migration into Northern America and Oceania will offset declining birth rates until 2100. These projections are based on current assumptions and can change drastically if fertility, mortality, and migration rates change. As UN estimates suggest, global peak population is still around 60 years away, but some regions will reach their peak much sooner.

**Expert Predicts 'Only Two Years Left Before the End of the World'**
A study by Heinz von Foerster, published in 1960 in the Science journal, predicted that the world would reach a critical point on November 13, 2026, due to an exponential growth of the world population. According to the study, the population growth would lead to a collapse, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to human decisions and actions. The study used a mathematical formula that projected the population would reach near-infinite levels by 2026, even if a constant food supply and natural disasters were avoided. The study warned that the overpopulation could trigger the collapse of social and environmental systems. The true threat is overpopulation, not climate change, and the study attributed the responsibility to humans, not external factors. The research advised that if the population continued to grow at this rate, we would reach an unsustainable threshold where societies could not preserve their stability or sustainable development. Although this prediction is now viewed with skepticism, the dialogue about the limits of human growth remains relevant, and institutions like the UN estimate that the world population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, raising questions about resource management and environmental protection in a world with a constantly increasing population.

**Charted: When Every Continent’s Population Will Peak This Century**
According to UN estimates, the global population is expected to peak at 10.3 billion in 2084 and then begin to decline. However, some regions will hit their peak much sooner. Europe has already peaked in 2020 at 750 million people, while Asia and Latin America will reach their peaks in the 2050s. Africa, Northern America, and Oceania will continue to grow slowly past 2100. The difference in peak population years is due to fertility rates and migration patterns. European countries have low fertility rates, while many African nations have high fertility rates, leading to a growing population. International migration into Northern America and Oceania will help offset declining birth rates until 2100. However, these estimates are based on current assumptions and can change drastically in the future.

**Mapped: Europe’s Population Crash (2025-2100P)**
According to the UN World Population Prospects 2024, Europe's population is projected to decline between 2025 and 2100, with most countries experiencing a drop in population. The medium variant scenario, which is the most likely outcome, estimates that Germany will lose 13.8 million people, Poland will lose 18.8 million, and Italy will lose 23.8 million. However, migration can boost population levels, and the UK and France are expected to experience population growth. The UN projects that only seven European countries will have a larger population in 2100 than in 2025. This decline in population has significant implications for the economy, as it will lead to shrinking consumer demand and a smaller tax net, which will affect social security measures. Eurostat projects that 2026 will be Europe's peak population point, after which levels will begin to trend down.

**Depopulation: the dramatic change facing humanity**
The global population is expected to peak in the mid-2080s, followed by a dramatic decline. This is the first time in 700 years that the global population will decline. The decline is attributed to falling fertility rates across much of Europe, Asia, and the Americas, as well as improving life expectancy. By 2100, India will be the largest country, with a population of 1.5 billion, while China will be the second-largest, with a population of 638 million. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia, will experience rapid growth. However, many countries will experience a decline in population, including Indonesia, Brazil, and the European Union. The decline in population will have significant impacts on economies, healthcare, and social security systems. Governments will need to adapt to these changes and implement policies to support aging populations and address the challenges of low fertility rates. 'The world population is expected to peak, it's just a question of to what level and how fast that peak and the decline will be,' says Patrick Gerland, chief of the Population Estimates and Projection Section at the UN's Population Division. 'Pensions systems that relied on increasing numbers of workers each year to support retirees will be strained or insolvent unless reformed,' says Jennifer D Sciubba, president of the Population Reference Bureau. 'There will be continued demands on healthcare.'
