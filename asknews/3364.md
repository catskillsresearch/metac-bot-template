**Meta Partners with Anduril to Develop Metaverse Technologies for Military Training**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has been struggling to make its metaverse platform profitable, with Reality Labs, its division dedicated to developing metaverse technologies, accumulating over $58 billion in losses since its creation. However, the company has found a new way to monetize its investments in the metaverse through a partnership with Anduril, a US-based military technology company founded by Palmer Luckey, the creator of the Oculus Rift. According to Mark Zuckerberg, 'Meta has spent the last decade building AI and AR to create the future of computing. We're proud to partner with Anduril to help bring these technologies to American military personnel who protect our interests at home and abroad.' The partnership will focus on developing immersive reality software for training soldiers and police officers, which will be sold to the US military, law enforcement agencies, and allied countries. The technologies developed by Meta and Anduril will include EagleEye, immersive devices designed to prepare soldiers for decision-making in combat scenarios, as well as smart glasses and other accessories that will optimize the user's sensory perceptions. The devices will benefit from Meta's AI technology, Llama.

**Meta Partners with Anduril to Develop Immersive Military Training Equipment**
Meta has entered the military arena by partnering with Anduril Industries, a 14 billion dollar valued US defense startup, to develop immersive training equipment for soldiers and law enforcement. This partnership marks Meta's new attempt to revive its XR technology, which has struggled to convince the general public despite massive investments through Reality Labs. The project will be funded by individuals and aims to aid the US military. Palmer Luckey, Oculus' founder, who was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for 2 billion dollars, leads Anduril. This partnership can be seen as a loop closing, but in a different context: defense. The EagleEye range, resulting from this collaboration, will include helmets, smart glasses, and tactical wearables designed specifically for military and secure use. The goal is to improve soldiers' sensory capabilities (sight and hearing) and provide remote control tools for autonomous systems, such as drones or terrain sensors. At the heart of the EagleEye system, Meta and Anduril's technologies will be tightly integrated. Software-wise, devices will run Lattice, Anduril's in-house OS, designed to aggregate and visualize data from thousands of sources (sensors, vehicles, networks). This system relies on Lattice Mesh, a motor capable of managing transmission priorities in low-bandwidth environments, all via encrypted connections. EagleEye will also benefit from Meta's AI via Llama models. Some of these models, such as Llama 3.2-1B, are light enough to run directly on XR devices without requiring a connection to distant servers. By partnering with a key defense player, Meta may have found a new strategic outlet for its XR technology, previously limited to entertainment or confidential professional applications. This military turn also allows it to diversify its industrial partnerships, at a time when its advertising-based business model is increasingly challenged. This military incursion is part of a broader trend. Tech giants are exploring or strengthening their relationships with the defense sector, seeking public contracts, funding, and legitimacy in critical technologies. However, this foray into a sensitive domain like security and the military could also raise some controversy.

**'Insane radical leftists' are gone: Zuckerberg and Palmer Luckey reunite for US military project | Blaze Media**
Palmer Luckey, the creator of Oculus Rift, has announced that he is teaming up with Meta, the company he was fired from in 2017, to create virtual and augmented reality systems for the US military. Luckey claims that Meta is now a 'very different company' than it was when he was fired, and that the people who conspired against him are no longer there. He believes that accepting others into his political circle would be a smarter move than rejecting Mark Zuckerberg and Meta. The first project will be a military helmet called Eagle Eye, which will give Army soldiers access to advanced augmented reality systems. Luckey's mission is to 'turn warfighters into technomancers,' and he believes that the products they are building with Meta will do just that. 'The people who conspired to oust me, they're not even there anymore,' Luckey said. 'It would be a harsh lesson indeed to discover that the only way to compete militarily with China is to lose our own identity here at home.'

**Meta to Develop AI-Powered Armament with Palmer Luckey's Anduril Industries**
Meta has partnered with Palmer Luckey, the creator of the Oculus Rift, to develop AI-powered devices and armament. According to a press release, Meta has closed a deal with Anduril Industries, the company founded by Luckey after his departure from Facebook. The partnership will allow the construction of AI-powered armament and extended reality (XR) that will improve the performance of soldiers. Meta and Anduril will develop EagleEye, a system that improves the hearing and vision of combatants to detect hidden enemies or distant objects. Luckey stated that the development of these devices is based on existing components and commercial technology. 'Meta has spent the last decade building AI and AR to enable the future of computing,' said Mark Zuckerberg. We are proud to partner with Anduril to help bring these technologies to the US military personnel who protect our interests at home and abroad.' The announcement comes at a crucial time for the company, which has changed its policies to align with Donald Trump. Meta not only wants to change its perception but also to get ahead of its rivals in obtaining more income from military contracts. A system of AI-powered armament is the next step for the company. Anduril mentions that Meta's mixed reality capabilities will be integrated with its Lattice platform, an AI-powered command system. Lattice uses data from thousands of sources to provide real-time intelligence to soldiers. The glasses, helmets, and portable devices that integrate Meta's models will connect directly to the system to obtain key information in decision-making.

**Meta, TikTok, and X: An Uncertain Future for Social Media**
Meta, TikTok, and X are facing an uncertain future in the world of social media. Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has invested over $65 billion in AI and has introduced AI-generated tools in its advertising suite. The AI has already impacted 50% of the content viewed by users on Facebook and Instagram. However, the company is also facing challenges in the metaverse, with Zuckerberg having invested over $80 billion in Reality Labs, the division responsible for the metaverse, since 2019. TikTok, on the other hand, is facing regulatory issues in the US, where Congress is threatening to ban the app. Despite these challenges, TikTok has diversified its offerings with TikTok Shop, which aims to promote commerce within the platform, and has also invested in longer-form content to retain users and compete with YouTube. X, formerly Twitter, has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in half of the US states, and AI will be central to the development of the platform. However, the future of X is also uncertain, with Elon Musk's big bet on AI and the creation of a promised super-app. The social network has faced a massive exodus of users and advertisers in recent months due to concerns over the proliferation of hate speech and disinformation. Big companies like Coca-Cola, Google, Airbnb, Amazon, Netflix, IBM, Disney, and Apple have removed their ads from the platform, with X estimating a loss of around $11 million in the last quarter of 2024 due to the exodus of advertisers. Other media outlets have estimated this figure to be much higher, up to $75 million.

**Ten years later, Facebook's Oculus acquisition hasn't changed the world as expected | TechCrunch**
Ten years after Facebook's acquisition of Oculus, the company's metaverse division has lost $42 billion between 2020 and 2024, a significant amount considering the $2 billion price tag of the acquisition. Despite this, Meta believes it's playing the long game, hoping to saturate the market and corner content. The company sells its Quest headsets at a loss, but sees it as a necessary step to democratize access to virtual reality. Apple's recent entry into the VR market with the Vision Pro has been seen as validation for the space, and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has used this as an opportunity to highlight the superiority of his company's headsets. However, it's clear that the Vision Pro is a more impressive piece of technology, and the pricing gulf between the two products puts them into different categories. As the author notes, Zuckerberg was right about the content, but not necessarily the delivery mechanism, and the past four years have dramatically impacted how we interact with each other and the world.

**Meta Exposes Iranian Network Manipulating Public Opinion in Azerbaijan**
Meta has stopped a campaign to manipulate public opinion in Azerbaijan, which originated in Iran and used fake accounts on Meta, X (Twitter), and YouTube platforms. The campaign, which targeted Azerbaijani-speaking audiences in Azerbaijan and Turkey, included 17 fake Facebook accounts, 22 Facebook pages, and 21 Instagram accounts, according to The Hacker News. The fake accounts were used to publish content, manage pages, comment on their own posts, and artificially inflate their popularity. Many of these accounts posed as journalists and pro-Palestinian activists. The operation used spam methods, inserting itself into current discussions using popular hashtags such as #palestine, #gaza, #stoppalestiniangenocide, #starbucks, and #instagram. The content in Azerbaijani language covered topics such as the 2024 Paris Olympics, Israel's attacks using pagers in 2024, boycotts of American brands, criticism of the US, President Biden, and Israel's actions in Gaza. This activity has been linked to Storm-2035, a known Iranian group that Microsoft described in August 2024 as a network spreading polarizing narratives among American voters. OpenAI also blocked ChatGPT accounts created by Storm-2035 in 2024, which used AI chatbots to generate propaganda materials. The Iranian network used coordinated manipulation, disguising itself as independent activists and journalists to increase its influence in Azerbaijan and Turkey. Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI continue to counter such campaigns.

**Meta Partners with Anduril to Develop Advanced Military Technology**
Meta, the US internet company, is now working with the US military after Microsoft abandoned its Augmented-Reality-Headset HoloLens. According to CNBC, the project was taken over by Anduril, a company founded by Palmer Luckey, the creator of Oculus VR. Luckey's company had previously been acquired by Meta, which later fired him.

**Meta Expects Massive Profits from Artificial Intelligence by 2035**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, expects to generate massive profits from its artificial intelligence products in the coming years. According to documents released by a court, Meta expects its revenue to reach between $2 billion and $3 billion in 2025, and between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion by 2035. The company's new strategy includes open-source tools like LLaMA, which relies on revenue-sharing agreements with hosting companies. Additionally, Meta's AI assistant, Meta AI, may be integrated with ads or premium services in the future, as mentioned by Mark Zuckerberg during the company's earnings announcement. The documents also reveal that Meta has allocated a huge budget for AI development, with over $900 million allocated for the AI team in 2024, and expected to exceed $1 billion this year. Furthermore, Meta plans to invest between $60 billion and $80 billion in building massive data centers by 2025. The documents also suggest that Meta considered purchasing training data worth over $200 million in 2023, including $100 million for book rights. However, instead of purchasing the data, Meta is accused of using it without a license. In response to the allegations, Meta emphasized that it has developed open-source models that have revolutionized innovation and productivity, and that fair use of copyrighted materials is essential for AI progress. Meta also stated that it disagrees with the authors' claims and will continue to defend itself and its right to develop its technology for the benefit of all.

**Everyone is bad in the head (and companies will take action) - The BRIEF Column**
The same mRNA technology that revolutionized COVID-19 vaccines is now being used to create personalized cancer vaccines. The pandemic accelerated this innovation by proving that vaccines could be developed quickly and effectively. The process is highly personalized, with scientists sequencing the patient's tumor and creating a unique vaccine to teach the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The UK aims to offer these treatments to 10,000 patients by 2030. The UK has also reduced the time it takes to recruit patients from years to just three months with infrastructure and digitalization. If the initial tests are successful, the first mRNA cancer vaccine is expected to be approved between late 2025 and early 2026. Meta has obtained an emergency decision to prevent the promotion of a book by its former public policy director, Sarah Wynn-Williams, which exposes the company's inner workings, including allegations of censorship in China, sexual harassment, and abusive behavior by executives like Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Joel Kaplan. The court ordered Wynn-Williams to suspend the publication and promotion of the book, but did not affect the publisher Macmillan, which continues to support the author. The book, described by the New York Times as 'a ugly and shocking portrait' of Meta, has become a public issue for the company. The company accuses the author of violating a confidentiality agreement, while Wynn-Williams defends the publication as a legitimate account of her experience at the company. The case reflects a pattern of accusations against Meta, which has faced allegations of prioritizing profits over user safety and allowing a culture of discrimination and silencing. The legal battle is far from over, but one thing is certain: trying to hide a story only makes more people want to read it. Starting May 26, companies in Brazil will be required to evaluate and mitigate psychosocial risks in the workplace. The change in NR-1 comes amid a 67% increase in mental health absences in 2024, totaling 472,000 licenses, according to the Ministry of Social Security. Now, harassment, overwork, and stress will not only be wellness topics, but also compliance and risk management issues. Experts warn of the risk of 'wellbeing washing,' when companies announce health initiatives only to improve their image without real changes. The enforcement will be strict, and those who do not follow the new rules may face fines, lawsuits, and even bans. Although the positive impacts will take years to consolidate, NR-1 pressures companies to stop talking and take action. After all, ignoring the mental health of the team is no longer an option.

**The Quest for General Artificial Intelligence: A Double-Edged Sword**
According to a survey by the Future of Humanity Institute, the median estimate for when General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) will be achieved is around 2040, although opinions vary widely. A Metaculus survey of nearly 1,500 predictors expects it to be achieved by 2030. The pursuit of AGI has become the new space race of the 21st century, with companies, governments, and experts worldwide competing to develop an AI that can equal or surpass human capabilities. However, the question remains whether humanity is close to achieving this milestone and whether it is prepared for its potential consequences. Miguel López, director for the South of EMEA at Barracuda Networks, shares this view: 'Achieving General Artificial Intelligence is a complex and ambitious goal. While we will undoubtedly see significant progress, achieving a complete AGI in this decade could be overly optimistic.' The current state of AGI is that it is closer than ever, but still far away, with major tech companies investing heavily in its development. However, Europe seems to be lagging behind, with López stating: 'Currently, our role in this technology is basically that of a mere consumer.' The European Union's investment in AI research and development is estimated to be only 3,200 million euros, compared to the 20,000-30,000 million euros invested by the US and China. The article also highlights the need for global coordination to ensure the safe and beneficial development of AGI, as well as the potential risks and consequences of its creation.

**Meta's Metaverse Ambitions: A $100 Billion Bet on the Future**
Meta is approaching the $100 billion mark in investments for the metaverse, and shows no signs of slowing down. Since Mark Zuckerberg announced the purchase of Oculus over a decade ago, the concept of the metaverse has gained traction, particularly in 2021 when Facebook, Inc. rebranded as Meta Platforms, Inc. Reality Labs, the division driving this initiative, is on track to burn $100 billion, and it seems there's still a long way to go before promises of incredible virtual worlds, where people can work, play, and socialize, become a reality. Virtual and mixed reality glasses, such as the Meta Quest Pro, Meta Quest 3, or Apple Vision Pro, are the gateway to these experiences. However, these devices are not yet powerful, lightweight, and affordable enough to gain traction in the general public. This reality is reflected in Tim Cook's statements last year, when the Apple CEO acknowledged that their glasses are 'an early adoption product' intended for 'people who want to have tomorrow's technology today.' Between 2014 and 2024, Meta has invested over $80 billion in its ambitions for virtual and augmented reality. The company's financials reveal a $19.875 billion expenditure and a $2.146 billion profit over the past year. In other words, Reality Labs closed 2024 with losses of $17.729 billion. Far from slowing down, the social media giant remains convinced that this is the right path, anticipating a 2025 with more investment and more losses in Reality Labs. Few companies in the world can afford to make such long-term bets. Meta, of course, is one of them: in 2024, it recorded net profits of $87.109 billion in Family of Apps (FoA), the segment that encompasses products and services like Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Although Reality Labs is closely tied to the metaverse, its scope goes much further. In the short term, this division is the epicenter of commercially successful products, such as the Meta Quest family of glasses and the Ray-Ban Meta, developed in collaboration with EssilorLuxottica. But it is also the laboratory where the company's future is being built. Last year, we saw Orion, a prototype of augmented reality glasses that, according to Zuckerberg, could one day replace the smartphone as we know it. At first glance, the Orion glasses appear more voluminous and robust than the Ray-Ban Meta, likely due to the internal components necessary for projecting images. They integrate Micro LED projectors, capable of overlaying information onto the real world. The idea is to use the physical environment as a canvas for 2D and 3D apps. But there's more. Reality Labs is working on the powerful, lightweight, and affordable glasses mentioned earlier. And that, of course, requires a lot of work. In terms of visualization, the goal is to achieve an experience that is almost indistinguishable from reality. But it's not just about high-resolution screens in next-generation glasses; it's also about developing technologies that don't yet exist to adapt to the complex human visual system. Additionally, the projects include the exploration of new interfaces, such as those based on electromyography, which allow devices to be controlled through neuromuscular signals. As the company acknowledges, its bet is on developing products that won't be seen soon, but will reach their peak in 'the next decade.' It remains to be seen if this goal will remain on track with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), a field in which Meta is investing billions and which, at some point, converges with its vision of the metaverse.

**Ten years later, Facebook's Oculus acquisition hasn't changed the world as expected | TechCrunch**
Ten years after Facebook's acquisition of Oculus, the company's metaverse division has lost $42 billion between 2020 and 2024, a significant amount considering the $2 billion price tag of the acquisition. Despite this, Meta believes it's playing the long game, hoping to saturate the market and corner content. The company sells its Quest headsets at a loss, but sees it as a necessary step to democratize access to virtual reality. Apple's recent entry into the VR market with the Vision Pro has been seen as validation for the space, and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has used this as an opportunity to highlight the superiority of his company's headsets. However, it's clear that the Vision Pro is a more impressive piece of technology, and the pricing gulf between the two products puts them into different categories. As the author notes, Zuckerberg was right about the content, but not necessarily the delivery mechanism, and the past four years have dramatically impacted how we interact with each other and the world.
