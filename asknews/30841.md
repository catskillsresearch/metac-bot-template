**Exclusive — Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso: Democrats Filibustering Trump Nominees in 'Petty Partisan Tantrums'**
Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-WY) will deliver a speech on Thursday, criticizing Senate Democrats for their 'petty partisan tantrums' and historic level of obstruction in confirming President Donald Trump's nominees. According to prepared remarks, Barrasso will say that Democrats are 'lacking direction and lashing out,' and have filibustered 67 of Trump's 68 nominees, with only Secretary of State Marco Rubio being an exception. Barrasso explained that Democrats have increasingly used the filibuster to frustrate the confirmation of Trump's nominees, including noncontroversial positions, and that this is 'not about qualifications or backgrounds, but all meant to obstruct President Trump.' Despite this, Senate Republicans plan to press on and confirm the president's nominees at a 'record-breaking pace.' Barrasso said, 'What Senate Democrats are doing is unprecedented in Senate history. It is not principled pushback. It is full-scale stonewalling. It may slow us down but it will not stop us.'

They're hoarding critical resources and weaponizing energy policy.'

**'The View's Joy Behar says missing New Orleans prisoners "could be in...**
On The View, Joy Behar joked that the 10 escaped inmates from a New Orleans prison 'could be in Trump's cabinet', referencing Trump's appointments of convicted felons. Behar also discussed the public's fascination with the story, saying 'people are thinking: I wonder if these guys really did what they did. It's like the government. We're confused. What's real? What's not real? What's true?' Alyssa Farah Griffin noted that most of the escaped inmates had convicted violent offenses, which may have contributed to public concern. The inmates were facing charges including aggravated assault, domestic abuse battery, and murder, and a maintenance man has been arrested for allegedly assisting in their escape after being threatened by the inmates.

**Trump's Nephew-in-Law Confirmed as Ambassador to France Amid Controversy**
Charles Kushner, a real estate businessman and former convict, was confirmed by the US Senate as the new ambassador to France and Monaco. Kushner, the father-in-law of Ivanka Trump and the father of Jared Kushner, pleaded guilty in 2005 to 18 charges, including tax evasion, lying to the Federal Election Commission, and retaliating against a witness. He served two years in prison and was pardoned in 2020 by then-President Trump. During his hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee, Kushner acknowledged his past mistakes but claimed he was prepared to represent the country. The appointment of Kushner is part of a trend by President Trump to appoint key positions to people close to him. Trump has also appointed Jared Kushner as his senior advisor in the White House and Massad Boulos, the father-in-law of Tiffany Trump, as his senior advisor on Middle East affairs. Despite criticism, the Senate vote showed a division that did not entirely respect party lines. Republican Lisa Murkowski voted against, while Democrat Cory Booker supported Kushner's nomination, highlighting his 'personal redemption' and philanthropic contributions. Trump publicly praised Kushner as a 'business leader, philanthropist, and negotiator', and his nomination letter to the Senate emphasized his experience in the private sector and management skills. However, critics inside and outside Congress question the suitability of appointing a former convict to an international representation position.

**The Absence of Accountability in Cyprus: A Reflection on the Dr. Mehmet Öz Case**
The Turkish-American cardiologist Dr. Mehmet Öz, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), was questioned by the Senate Finance Committee. The committee members asked about his personal financial assets, potential conflicts of interest, and his approach to Medicaid. Dr. Öz promised to fight healthcare fraud and improve the health of Americans. He was approved with 53 'yes' votes against 45 'no' votes. The author of the article reflects on the situation in Cyprus, where there is a lack of accountability and transparency in government appointments. The author suggests that politicians should undergo a 'political aptitude test' before being appointed to high-level positions. The author argues that this would promote accountability, transparency, and meritocracy in government appointments.

**Donald Trump's Turbulent Second Term Begins**
Donald Trump has started his second term as US President with a turbulent beginning. He has announced plans to build a new missile defense system, 'Golden Dome', which is expected to cost 175 billion dollars. Trump has also declared a state of emergency at the US-Mexico border and has vowed to stop all illegal border crossings. He has also repeated his promise to 'take back' the Panama Canal. Trump has signed dozens of executive orders in his first week in office, including the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the pardon of over 1,500 people who stormed the Capitol in 2021. Trump's cabinet includes Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser, and Scott Bessent as Secretary of the Treasury. The Republicans have regained control of the Senate, holding 53 seats to the Democrats' 45. Trump has also appointed Elon Musk as the head of a new Efficiency Department, which will oversee government spending. Trump won the election by a landslide, winning all seven swing states and receiving the popular vote. He has been praised for his ability to 'whisper' to young voters and has been criticized for his divisive rhetoric. Trump's cabinet has been criticized for its lack of diversity and its ties to special interests.

Mitch McConnell, who voted against four nominees, and Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who withheld their support from two nominees. Meanwhile, a handful of Democrats, including Sens. John Fetterman, Ruben Gallego, and Maggie Hassan, voted for 10 or more of Trump's nominees.

**Following key wins, Trump poised for cabinet completion in record time**
The Senate GOP has confirmed 18 of President Donald Trump's 22 Cabinet positions, outpacing his predecessors. According to Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, this is more than former President Barack Obama had in 2009 and more than former President Joe Biden had in 2021. Barrasso said, 'By the end of today, we will have confirmed 18 of President Trump's nominees. These nominees are bold and well-qualified.' The confirmation of Kash Patel as FBI director was a crucial accomplishment for the party, as they officially put in place each of the president's most controversial picks. Those still left to be confirmed to Trump's Cabinet are Lori Chavez-DeRemer for Secretary of Labor, Linda McMahon for Secretary of Education, U.S. Trade Representative nominee Jamieson Greer, and Elise Stefanik to be ambassador to the United Nations.

**EDITORIAL: Senate must push forward with Trump’s nominees**
The Senate has confirmed eight of President Donald Trump's Cabinet selections, but 14 nominees remain in limbo. Senate Democrats are using various tactics to slow the process, with Sen. Tom Cotton saying, 'What this is really about is trying to drag out all of these nominations, to play procedural games.' However, Republicans have a 53-47 Senate majority and only need a majority to confirm nominees. According to Chris Piper of the Center for Presidential Transition, 'The historical trends show that it is very difficult for any incoming president to get a Cabinet nominee confirmed within the first weeks of a new administration.' Despite this, Majority Leader John Thune should continue to press for timely votes, as Presidents deserve leeway when selecting their administration. The last Cabinet nominee to lose a confirmation vote was John Tower in 1989.

**Trump's cabinet selections are moving forward at a faster pace recently - Washington Examiner**
The U.S. Senate is confirming President Donald Trump's cabinet nominees at a faster pace than in his first term. Trump has received confirmations for 10 of his main Cabinet nominees, with Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins confirmed on Tuesday, and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott Turner confirmed today. Trump is well ahead of the pace of the previous two administrations, with five Biden nominees and four Trump 1.0 nominees being confirmed by February 5 of their first year. However, Senate Democrats seem to be selectively stalling on Trump's selections, with some nominees, such as Secretary of Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., being slow-walked through the process. Trump will likely have his full Cabinet sooner than during his first presidency, but may still have to wait several weeks for the rest of his nominees to be confirmed.

**US: Senate On Track To Confirm All Of Trump Executive Nominees**
The US Senate is on track to confirm two more of Trump's Cabinet nominees, Scott Turner and Russell Vought, this week. If confirmed, this would bring the total number of confirmed Cabinet members to 13 within the first three weeks of Trump's second term, surpassing the confirmation speed of his first term and that of former President Joe Biden's term. According to Politico, this is 'one of President Donald Trump's most stunning feats,' as he has 'finally broken the Senate' in confirming Cabinet officials who were once 'unimaginable' for their posts. Axios notes that all of Trump's nominees for senior government positions are on track to be confirmed, a 'rarity for any modern president.' Bettors at Polymarket now consider every Trump nominee to have a near 100% chance of confirmation.

**The U.S. Senate Is Dragging Its Feet**
The U.S. Senate is delaying the confirmation of President Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees, with only eight out of 22 individuals voted on and confirmed. This pace is slower than during the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush. The Senate has an obligation to promptly hold confirmation hearings and vote on Trump's picks, as delays impede the president's agenda and the service provided to the American people. According to the article, the current pace is 'needlessly slow and an injustice to our country.'

**How senators are voting on Trump's Cabinet picks**
The Republican-led Senate is moving quickly to confirm President Donald Trump's Cabinet picks, with over 1,300 positions requiring Senate approval. While many nominees are expected to face little opposition, some have been met with controversy and skepticism. For example, Pete Hegseth's nomination as Defense secretary was evenly divided, but ultimately confirmed by Vice President JD Vance's tie-breaking vote. Trump's first pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, withdrew after being told he wouldn't have Senate support. The Senate has already accumulated more 'no' votes than any previous administration in U.S. history, highlighting intensified partisan opposition. However, not every nominee is controversial, and many will receive some Democratic support. As of now, the Senate has confirmed 15 primary members of the Cabinet, with the process expected to take months. As Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell said, 'The Senate will continue to fulfill its constitutional role in advising and consenting on presidential appointments.'

**Trump's Cabinet Approval Process Slowed Down**
In the first week of his presidency, Donald Trump has seen only 3 of his 15 cabinet nominees approved by the US Senate. Marco Rubio (State), Pete Hegseth (Defense), and Kristi Noem (Homeland Security) have been confirmed and assumed their positions. Trump's strategy is to prioritize nominations in sensitive areas like security, followed by those with less opposition from Democrats. Despite the Republican majority in the Senate, some nominees have faced difficulties, even among Trump's own party. Hegseth, for example, received 3 votes against him from Republican senators, but was ultimately approved after a tiebreaker vote by Vice President JD Vance. This delay may slow down the cabinet approval process, which has been contentious in Trump's first term. In 2017, Trump's cabinet was not fully confirmed until 98 days after his inauguration, the longest in recent history. The Senate has historically approved cabinet nominees more quickly, with George W. Bush's cabinet being confirmed in just 12 days, and Bill Clinton's in 2 days. The process involves two Senate hearings, with the president typically naming nominees during the transition period. If a nominee is not approved within 210 days, a temporary secretary, a career employee of the department, must be confirmed by the Senate to remain in the position.

**Trump's Cabinet picks: Where they stand in the confirmation process**
President Donald Trump's cabinet appointees are facing a confirmation process in the Senate, with some nominees already cleared and others awaiting hearings. Republican senators are working to confirm the appointees, with a 53-seat majority that would require four GOP defections for a nominee to fail if all Democrats vote against them. Notable nominees include Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, who has faced allegations of sexual misconduct and has denied them, and Scott Bessent for Treasury Secretary, who would work closely with congressional Republicans on Trump's tax cuts. Other nominees include Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services, who will testify on his criticisms of vaccines and financial disclosures, and Kash Patel for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who has vowed to go after the media and the 'Deep State.'
