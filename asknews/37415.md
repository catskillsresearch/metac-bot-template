**NBA Sounds Alarm on Sports Prediction Markets**
The National Basketball Association (NBA) has expressed concerns about sports prediction markets like Kalshi, which offer contracts based on game outcomes without the same regulatory oversight as traditional sportsbooks. The league warns that these markets pose 'substantial integrity risks' to basketball, citing a lack of robust safeguards and the potential for game-fixing. The NBA emphasizes that protecting the integrity of the game is its top priority and is calling for a role in shaping regulatory standards for sports prediction markets. The league is particularly concerned about the rapid expansion of available contracts and the lack of age verification and geo-blocking technology in these markets. According to industry data, sports contracts now account for 78% of Kalshi's weekend trading volume, with NBA and MLB contracts significantly outperforming any non-sports markets.

**The Rise of Prediction Markets | The Motley Fool**
Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour discussed the rise of prediction markets with Motley Fool host Ricky Mulvey. Mansour emphasized that prediction markets are not a crystal ball, but rather a way to forecast the future with skin in the game. He explained that Kalshi's event contracts are different from traditional sports betting, as they have economic utility and are not just speculative. Mansour also discussed the importance of transparency in prediction markets, stating that Kalshi's platform is open-source and allows users to see live trades and market data. He cited an example of a random user from Kansas who became a successful trader on the platform, highlighting the potential for anyone to participate and succeed in prediction markets. Additionally, Mansour discussed Kalshi's experience with the 2024 presidential election, where they were the first legal market in the US to allow betting on the election. He noted that they learned valuable lessons about speculative behavior and market dynamics from the experience.

Additionally, Mansour talked about the company's experience with the 2024 presidential election, where they were the first legal market in the US to allow people to bet on the election. They saw unprecedented growth after winning a lawsuit against their regulator, with $2 billion in volume in a month and a half and 500 million unique visitors on election day.

**Prediction markets, odd alliances and a backdoor to legal sportsbooks**
The US Supreme Court's 2018 decision to legalize sports gambling has led to a new front in the industry's nationwide turf war: event-based prediction markets. These platforms, like Kalshi and Polymarket, offer futures contracts on various positions, from sports to politics, and are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, some states have issued cease-and-desist orders, and critics argue that these markets are a 'backdoor' to legalizing sports gambling without necessary safeguards. The Campaign for Fairer Gambling (CFG), led by Derek Webb, has endorsed prediction markets, citing their potential to squash the black market and protect consumers. However, some industry insiders question Webb's motives, given the CFG's efforts to combat addiction and the fact that prediction markets are open to anyone over 17. The CFTC is set to hold a roundtable on the subject, and President Trump's nominee for CFTC chair, Brian Quintenz, has ties to Kalshi. Major League Baseball has expressed concerns about the risks of sports prediction markets, and the outcome of this conflict may play out in the courts.

**Kalshi Says It Has User Protections as Sports Futures Scrutiny Grows**
Kalshi, a financial technology company, has announced plans to increase user protections on its platform amid concerns from MLB and other critics about its sports event futures. The company's measures include voluntary opt-outs, self-imposed trading breaks, and self-imposed deposit caps, as well as suspicious activity monitoring and preemptive bans of individuals with insider information. Kalshi's CEO said, 'The safety measures are unrelated to regulatory actions.' MLB had expressed concerns about Kalshi's internal protections, stating, 'As the resemblance between sports event contracts and traditional sports betting markets continues to grow, so too does the need to replicate the integrity and consumer protections that exist at the state level.' Kalshi is facing regulatory hurdles, including a cease-and-desist order from Nevada, but the company has denied any wrongdoing.

**Kalshi Files to Expand Sports Betting Offering to Include Single-Game Predictions**
Kalshi, a financial exchange market, has filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to expand its sports betting offering to include single-game predictions. The new binary option market, titled 'Will [team] win [event]', allows users to bet on the outcome of single sports events, such as which team will win an NBA game. However, Kalshi's expansion into moneyline-style betting raises questions about how far lawmakers will allow it to go. Kalshi operates under the CFTC and is not subject to the same regulations as sportsbooks, as its sports exchange market technically does not qualify as sports betting. This makes it legal in all 50 states, but it remains to be seen whether the CFTC will classify Kalshi's new offerings as 'gambling'.

**Kalshi Promo Code WTOP: Get $10 Bonus for Latest Sports Prediction Markets - WTOP News**
Kalshi, a prediction market platform, has gained popularity after the 2024 election and the Super Bowl. It offers over three dozen markets for various sports, including basketball, golf, tennis, soccer, and baseball. According to Kalshi, 'all competing players have a chance to win, and that percentage also determines how much a single contract will cost.' For example, if you buy $10 worth of contracts for Rory McIlroy at 13 cents, you'd have 77 contracts that would result in a $77 payout after a win. Kalshi is overseen by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, making it legal in all 50 states. Users can sign up and receive a $10 bonus after purchasing the minimum number of contracts. The platform offers a wide range of markets, including sports, politics, and entertainment, such as the Rotten Tomatoes score for Captain America and who will win the Oscar for best actor.

**Want to Bet on the L.A. Wildfires? Prediction Markets Are Getting Edgy**
Prediction markets, which have gained popularity in calling the 2024 presidential election, are now offering a wide range of betting contracts, including those related to the Los Angeles wildfires and Israel's war with Hamas. Platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are expanding into new territory, taking advantage of light-touch financial regulation under President Trump's administration. Kalshi, a regulated platform, has listed contracts on various events, including the Super Bowl and the guilty plea of a suspect in a fatal shooting. However, the platforms have also been criticized for listing contracts on questionable topics, such as the number of men an OnlyFans star would have sex with in a day. Economists developed the concept of prediction markets in the 1980s, but the commercialization of the idea has led to more sensationalized bets. As trading volumes have slumped since November, the platforms are seeking to drum up new business with 'buzzy, ripped-from-the-headlines' betting contracts.
