**UK Responds to War Threat: Up to 12 New Attack Submarines and £15 Billion for Nuclear Warheads**
The United Kingdom is responding to the threat of war by building up to 12 new attack submarines with nuclear propulsion but conventionally armed, as part of a comprehensive defense strategy review to be announced today by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The new vessels will replace the fleet of seven Astute-class submarines by the end of the 2030s. The review, led by former Labour Defense Secretary Lord Robertson, comes at a time of increasing global instability and invites the British armed forces to a level of 'military readiness', in response to growing international threats, with Moscow at the top of the list of concerns. Starmer told the BBC that 'the threat posed by Russia cannot be ignored' and that 'the best way to deter conflict is to prepare for it.' The Prime Minister will also confirm an investment of £15 billion to modernize the UK's nuclear warheads as part of the Trident program. According to the government, the new submarines, along with those armed with nuclear weapons, will ensure the security of the UK and NATO for decades to come. Starmer confirmed: 'the UK is entering a state of military readiness as part of a new defense strategy.' The document will present 62 recommendations, which Downing Street is preparing to accept in full. The plan also includes an increase in defense spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. However, there is controversy over reaching the 3% of GDP target, a goal that the current government commits to achieving only by 2034, after the next general elections. The Conservatives, on the other hand, ask to bring forward the deadline to the end of the decade, estimating an annual increase in spending of around £20 billion.

**Starmer Strengthens UK's Anti-Russia Stance: 'We Must Be Ready for War'**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has outlined a new military and defense strategy, focusing on the 'threat' posed by Russia. He stated, 'If we want to deter a conflict, the best way is to prepare for a conflict.' The strategy includes plans for 12 new nuclear-powered submarines, massive investments in munitions, and a command center for coordinating cyberattacks against Russia and China. The opposition Tory party and conservative media are skeptical, noting that Starmer remains vague on resources and has made a 'half-step back' on the timeline for increasing military spending from 2.5% to 3% of GDP, now aiming for 2034 instead of 2027. Starmer emphasized the need for national unity in the face of an increasingly unstable and dangerous world. The three main objectives of the new strategy are to make the country 'ready for war,' strengthen NATO, and accelerate military innovation to make the UK a 'leader among allies.' Specific plans include building six new munitions factories, creating a hybrid coordination center for the Royal Navy, and investing £15 billion in modernizing the nuclear arsenal.

**UK to build up to 12 new attack submarines**
The UK will build 'up to' 12 new attack submarines to replace the Astute class from the late 2030s onwards, according to the prime minister's announcement. The new submarines will be conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered, and will keep 'Britain and Nato safe for decades', as stated by Sir Keir. The government will also spend £15bn on its nuclear warhead program and commit to increasing UK defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027. The review will make 62 recommendations, which the government is expected to accept in full. The Labour party has committed to increasing defence spending to 3% of national income by 2034, but the Conservatives say this should be met by the end of the decade. The review will also include other announcements, such as £1.5bn to build six new factories for 'always on' munitions production capacity, building up to 7,000 long-range weapons, and setting up a 'cyber and electromagnetic command' to boost the military's defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace.

**UK Begins Preparing for War, Says Rishi Sunak**
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak stated during a press conference in Glasgow that Britain is preparing for war, saying 'We are moving to a posture of readiness for military action as the primary objective of our armed forces.' He also emphasized that the UK will never fight alone, as 'our defense policy will always be primarily focused on NATO.' Sunak described the alliance as 'a fundamental source of strategic power' for Britain. He promised to implement innovations in the armed forces 'at the speed of war' and vowed to make British forces 'ten times more lethal by 2035.'

**UK PM: We can't ignore Russian threat**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by Russia, citing the conflict in Ukraine as an example. The UK will increase military spending to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and create an army ready to fight a war in Europe. This move is part of a broader effort to deter Russia and bolster Europe's defenses. NATO chief Mark Rutte is expected to discuss a commitment to spend at least 3.5 percent of GDP on defense at an upcoming meeting. Robert Jenrick, a Conservative Party spokesman, called for the government to be more ambitious and raise spending to 3 percent of national income by 2029, stating, 'We think that 2034 is a long time to wait, given the gravity of the situation.'

**British Government's Defense Spending Ambitions in Question**
The British government's new defense strategy is in question due to the cabinet's inability to confirm their commitment to increasing defense spending to 3% of the UK's GDP by 2034. According to The Daily Telegraph, Defense Minister John Healey stated on May 31 that he has no doubts about increasing defense spending to 3% of GDP, but on June 1, he refused to confirm this position in an interview with BBC, saying that it's only an 'ambition' to reach this level. The Daily Telegraph notes that this 'change of position' raises doubts about the ministers' ability to fund the defense strategy. Shadow Defense Minister James Cartlidge from the Conservative Party believes that the Defense Minister 'backed down' due to pressure from Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, who is not willing to sign off on such an increase in spending. In February, Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that 2.5% of GDP will be allocated to defense needs by 2027, up from the current 2.3%.

**UK Prepares 'Message to Moscow' with New Defense Strategy**
The UK is preparing a 'message to Moscow' with a new defense strategy, announced by Prime Minister Kier Starmer. The plan includes investing £15 billion (approximately $20 billion) in developing new nuclear warheads and building up to 12 new attack submarines as part of the AUKUS partnership with the US and Australia. This will increase the country's military readiness and replace outdated Astute-class submarines by the end of the 2030s. Defense Minister John Gilly emphasized that this strategic review of defense is a clear 'message to Moscow' about the UK's determination to counter Russian aggression. He stated that modernized submarines and a nuclear program will strengthen the country's security at home and abroad. Additionally, the government plans to build six new ammunition factories to create a 'constant working' industrial base, purchase up to 7,000 long-range missiles, and invest in cybersecurity and auxiliary equipment. Gilly said that the factories will open 'very soon.' However, the goal of spending 3% of GDP on defense after the next elections remains ambitious. The government does not plan to increase the army's size before the new parliament, which has sparked criticism from the opposition. This defense initiative comes amid a period of underfunding, which has reduced the size of the British army to its lowest level since Napoleon's time. The increase in military spending coincides with budget pressure in the country, where many sectors need funding. Opposition politicians, including Conservative shadow defense minister James Cartlidge, express doubts about the government's ability to fund its promises. According to the Sunday Times, the Labour government also plans to purchase American fighter jets capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons and implement new defense systems for anti-missile protection and restore the internal civil guard. The change in the UK's defense policy occurs amid pressure from the US, where Donald Trump insists on increasing spending by NATO members. Prime Minister Starmer has already announced plans to raise the defense budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.

**PM Starmer:  warns UK must prepare for war to prevent it**
Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a significant shift in the United Kingdom's military strategy, prioritizing 'war-fighting readiness' and deterrence amid global instability and rising threats from Russia. Starmer unveiled plans to boost defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034 and 'innovate and accelerate at a war-time pace,' citing Russia's aggression and global tensions as reasons to invest heavily in military capabilities. 'We cannot ignore the threat Russia poses,' he said. 'To deter war, we must be prepared for it.' The strategy includes plans for new submarines, expanded munitions manufacturing, and reaffirmed NATO-first commitments. Opposition voices have emerged, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch challenging the adequacy of Starmer's budget timeline and the Liberal Democrats arguing the UK must move faster and spend more immediately.

**Labour accused of making an embarrassing retreat on defence spending**
Labour's Defence Secretary, John Healey, has been accused of making an embarrassing retreat on defence spending after downgrading a commitment to spend 3% of GDP on national security by 2034 to a mere 'ambition'. Just 72 hours after saying Britain 'will spend' such an amount 'in the next Parliament', Healey told the BBC that it was only an 'ambition'. Critics warn that the 10-year plan is likely to prove unaffordable without a hike to 3%. The Ministry of Defence has announced plans to build up to 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines to boost the Royal Navy's commitment to the Aukus Pacific defence partnership, but the first of these submarines is not expected to enter service before the late 2030s. Labour has been accused of weakening UK security by the Conservatives, who say that the promises on submarines are a 'fantasy fleet' without real money to back them up.

**Over 1,200 Migrants Cross English Channel in Record-Breaking 2025 High**
According to Defense Minister John Healey, the scenes were 'quite impactful' and occurred on the last day of May. Healey lamented that control of the borders has been 'lost' over the past five years. On Saturday, nearly 1,200 migrants crossed the English Channel, the highest number in 2025. This was achieved through 18 boats that were intercepted by the Border Force on the British coast. In May, 825 migrants passed through the Channel. The closest number to this was on September 3, 2022, when 1,305 arrivals were documented. Interior Minister Yvette Cooper agreed with French authorities in recent weeks to implement new measures to intercept organized crime groups that traffic migrants and improve coastal surveillance in France. The Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has promised to combat illegal immigration, as have previous Conservative governments. The Parliament is examining a law on border control that would give more power to the police against trafficking networks. Since January, 14,808 people have arrived in the UK through the Channel, a record level despite numerous measures implemented by the French and British governments to curb the situation. Migrant crossings plummeted in 2023, but surged to 36,800 last year, and the trend for this year suggests a new increase.

**UK strikes EU trade and defence reset in 'new era' for relations | Taiwan News | May. 20, 2025 08:58**
The UK has agreed to a significant reset of its defence and trade ties with the European Union, marking a 'new era' in their relationship. The deal includes a security and defence pact, fewer restrictions on British food exporters and visitors, and a new fishing agreement. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would 'correct some of the problems created by the Conservatives' original deal agreed after Brexit' and would benefit the UK economy. The agreement was denounced by the opposition Conservative Party and some fishing groups, but Labour member of parliament Chris Curtis said it would improve relations and correct some of the problems created by the original deal. The deal is expected to add nearly 9 billion pounds to the UK economy by 2040 and improve energy security. However, the UK's economy will remain significantly different from before it left the EU.

**UK and EU Sign Historic Agreement to Reboot Brexit**
The UK and the EU have signed a historic agreement to reboot Brexit. According to the NYT, the agreement will help both sides to work more closely together. The UK's Prime Minister said that the agreement will have a positive impact on workplaces, reduce bills, and strengthen borders. He also added that it will 'bring Britain back onto the world stage.' One of the most delicate issues in the trade negotiations was the extension of the right of European fishing boats to fish in British territorial waters in exchange for reducing trade barriers for British food products entering the EU's single market. After last-minute talks, both sides agreed to allow European boats to access British fishing waters until June 30, 2038, said a European diplomat who wished to remain anonymous. The agreement comes after the UK officially left the EU on January 31, 2020, following a referendum in which 51.9% of voters chose to leave the EU and 48.1% wanted to remain.

**PM defends 'common sense´ EU deal as critics condemn 'surrender´ to...**
The UK has signed a deal with the EU, which includes a 12-year extension of fishing arrangements, allowing European vessels to operate in UK waters until 2038. The deal also includes 'dynamic alignment' with Brussels on areas such as food standards and energy, and will cut red tape for travellers and businesses, boosting the economy by £9 billion by 2040. The Prime Minister said the deal 'gives us unprecedented access to the EU market, the best of any country' outside of the bloc or the European Free Trade Association. Critics, including Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK's Nigel Farage, have condemned the deal as a 'surrender' to Brussels, while business groups have welcomed it, with the British Retail Consortium's Helen Dickinson saying it 'will help keep costs down'.

**UK and EU Leaders Meet for Historic Summit to Strengthen Ties**
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is hosting European Union leaders in a historic summit aimed at paving the way for a closer relationship between the UK and the bloc after five years of Brexit. The meeting in London is expected to yield the first results of Sunak's 'reset' of relations with the EU, following years of tension since the UK's exit. Sunak said that the agreement would be 'good for our jobs, good for our bills, and good for our borders.' The talks continued until the last minute to resolve long-standing issues, including fishing rights and youth mobility programs, but negotiators hoped to sign a partnership in defense and security at least. This would be a symbolic step towards closing the page on the tensions that followed Brexit in January 2020. Sunak, who took office in July, wants a closer relationship with the EU than the one established by the Conservatives after tough negotiations with Brussels. However, he insists on red lines that he will not cross. There are still thorny points around some of the EU's demands, and the Conservatives have begun to criticize the reset as 'surrender.' If the negotiators can overcome the final obstacles, the signing of the 'security and defense partnership' will be the most prominent outcome of the Monday meeting between Sunak, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, and EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell. Two other documents are expected to be issued on Monday: a joint statement on European solidarity and a joint understanding that includes some measures to ease some of the trade barriers related to Brexit.

**Yes, Nigel Farage really could be prime minister in 2029**
Nigel Farage's Reform party has made significant gains in the recent local elections, winning 600 council seats and two mayoralties. According to John Curtice, Reform's share of the vote would need to reach 30% for the first-past-the-post voting system to work in their favor. Farage said, 'Today marks the end of two-party politics - it is finished.' However, experts believe that this breakthrough could mark a change in the dynamics of the two-party system, rather than its end. Conservative MPs are alarmed by the loss of Tory seats and the rise of Reform. Liz Truss has been in talks with Reform about taking on the system, but Farage is unlikely to invite her to join him due to her association with the Conservative party. If Reform wins 30% of the vote in the next general election, Farage could potentially become prime minister.

**PM to back ‘British brilliance’ with support for car industry in wake of tariffs**
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to support the UK's car industry in the wake of US President Donald Trump's tariffs, promising 'bold changes' to the rules around electric cars. He said, 'That means action, not words,' and announced a series of measures to help firms, including reinstating the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Regulations around manufacturing targets on electric cars and vans will also be altered, and new hybrids will be allowed to be sold until 2035. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said, 'Our ambitious package of strengthening reforms will protect and create jobs, making the UK a global automotive leader in the switch to EVs.' The Government is also making it easier for manufacturers who do not comply with Government-mandated sales targets to avoid fines, and the levies will be reduced. The Prime Minister has said that the Government is 'ready to use industrial policy' to help shelter businesses from the fallout from the tariffs, and that 'the world as we know it has gone' in terms of the economy. Labour has pledged to restore the 2030 date, after it was rolled back to 2035 by the previous Conservative government.

The UK government, led by Labour, plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander confirmed this plan in January, stating that it would 'restore clarity for manufacturers' and 'give confidence to consumers.' This move reverses the decision made by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to delay the ban to 2035, which was aligned with the European Union's timeline. The ban is part of Labour's manifesto and was re-committed to last Autumn.

**Labour Party Faces Energy Crisis Ahead of Elections**
The Labour Party in the UK is facing a political crisis due to rising energy bills, despite their promise to reduce them before the next election, according to Politico. The energy crisis in the UK is gaining momentum, causing concern within the government, Politico reports. Labour, which came to power promising to lower high energy bills, is now facing growing pressure from voters, the publication notes. Energy Minister Michael Shanks emphasized in parliament that the prime minister considers reducing bills to be 'critically important'. Experts point out that the rise in gas prices is the main cause of high bills, not Labour's climate policy, as their opponents claim. The party aims to reduce fossil fuel use to 2030, which should help lower energy costs, but this may not happen until the next election in 2029. The Conservative Party and Reform UK are intensifying their criticism of Labour, blaming their climate policy for high prices. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has already scrapped support for the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, claiming it will make families poorer. Labour is considering various measures to reduce bills, including possible redistribution of so-called 'green taxes'. However, this is fraught with political risks and may require tax increases. Other options include renegotiating renewable energy contracts and localizing electricity prices, but they require significant reforms. Earlier, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the European Commission plans to present a new energy plan, which would involve abandoning Russian gas and reducing energy prices in Europe; however, some European Union countries have refused to support the initiative to ban the import of Russian liquefied natural gas.

Sir Keir, writing in The Times, criticized the Conservative record on welfare, pointing to the 2.8 million working-age people out of work due to long-term sickness, calling it a 'damning indictment'. The Prime Minister responded, stating that the result is 'devastating for the public finances', with a projected £70 billion annual spend on working-age incapacity and disability benefits by 2030. He also highlighted the 'terrible human cost', including young people being shut out of the labor market and those with complex conditions being 'written off' by a single assessment. The Prime Minister added that this is 'happening at scale and it is indefensible'.

**British Prime Minister Attends EU Summit for the First Time Since Brexit**
British Prime Minister participated in the EU summit for the first time since Brexit. The event was a preparatory step for the May EU-UK summit, which is expected to give a new boost to relations between the two sides. It is known that the summit will take place in the UK. The UK left the European Union on January 31, 2020, after a referendum on the UK's membership in the EU, held in 2016 by the then Conservative government, in which 51.89% of participants voted in favor of leaving the EU. At the end of the 11-month transition period after the UK's departure, the UK also left the EU's customs union and its single internal market.
