**Denmark quits the Frugal Four to focus on rearming Europe, says PM Frederiksen**
Denmark has left the Frugal Four, a group of fiscally conservative countries that pushed for budget restraint in the European Union, to focus on rearming Europe against Russia, according to Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. Frederiksen said, 'As Danes, we will always be tough in the negotiations on the budget. We don't want money to be spent on (anything) that is not necessary for Europe. So we will be tough, but being a part of the Frugal Four is no longer the right place for us.' She emphasized that rearming Europe should be the top priority, saying, 'For me, the most important thing is to rearm Europe. That's my starting point, and that's my conclusion in all discussions.' Denmark will take over the six-month presidency of the EU Council on 1 July and will likely play a leading role in shaping the EU's budget for the 2028-2034 period. Frederiksen said, 'Last time, we had a leading role in the Frugal Four. Next time, we'll have a leading role in another group, because things have changed and the world is changing rapidly.' The EU is gearing up for a new budget battle, with the European Commission expected to present the first proposal before the summer break.

**LR Party Sceptical of Bruno Retailleau's Threat to Resign**
French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has threatened to resign if the government proceeds with a proportional representation system for legislative elections. However, many in the LR party do not believe he will actually follow through on this threat. Retailleau's party has voted unanimously against the proportional representation system, and his resignation would likely lead to instability in the government. A senator from the LR party stated, 'We will leave the government if the Prime Minister does not listen to us and goes ahead with an increase in taxes.' The party is also considering other options, such as a budgetary sequence at the end of the year, where they would have to find 40 billion euros in savings to balance the 2026 budget. 'If the Prime Minister does not listen to us, we will leave the government and François Bayrou will finish like Michel Barnier, without a budget and censored,' said senator Marc-Philippe Daubresse. However, the party may not actually leave the government before the 2026 municipal elections, as they will need to negotiate with other parties to pass a new budget. 'It would be difficult to assume responsibility for the mess, and that's not easy when your supporters are asking for order. It's not the right moment,' said Jerome Lavrilleux, a former campaign director for Nicolas Sarkozy. Bruno Retailleau may eventually leave the government, but not before the municipal elections, as he wants to maintain his status as a presidential candidate.

**The Netherlands: The government has fallen, all ministers have resigned**
The Dutch government has fallen, announced Prime Minister Dick Schoof after a two-hour government session. The decision means new parliamentary elections will be held, as all ministers from the Party for Freedom (PVV) have resigned. Schoof stated that he will remain in the position of 'demissioning prime minister' and continue to cooperate with ministers from the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the centrist party New Social Contract (NSC), and the Movement of Peasants and Citizens (BBB) to solve key problems, such as international threats and internal problems in the Netherlands. Schoof called the withdrawal of the PVV minister 'irresponsible and unnecessary', emphasizing the need for the government to continue working and addressing current challenges. The government, which began work on July 2, 2024, did not last even a year.

**Europe's Parliamentary System in Crisis**
The parliamentary system in Europe is facing a crisis. Despite the opposition's desire for a parliamentary system, it has led to chaos in Europe. Turkey passed a referendum in 2017 and switched to a presidential system, which has eliminated coalition conflicts. However, in European countries, the parliamentary system has led to the downfall of many governments. In the Netherlands, the leader of the Freedom Party, Geert Wilders, announced that the coalition was not working and the government had fallen. Wilders' party withdrew from the coalition, and the government fell. The crisis in Europe's coalition governments is as follows: In France, the government crisis occurred in the past few months, and Emmanuel Macron appointed Michael Barnier as the head of the government after the early general election in July 2024. However, Marine Le Pen and the opposition opposed Barnier in the budget and healthcare discussions, and Barnier's government was voted down with 331 votes. In Bulgaria, the country has been struggling with political instability for the past three years, and the people have gone to the polls for the seventh time on October 27, 2024, with 19 political parties and 9 coalition candidates. In Germany, the early general election on February 23, 2025, was the most critical election in the country's recent history. The far-right AfD party and the traditional center-right and center-left parties' decline have upset the balance, making the coalition uncertain and a problem for the country. The conservative Christian Union parties (CDU/CSU) won the election, and a coalition government was formed. In Austria, the coalition talks failed after the election in September 2024, and the longest coalition talks in the country's history were held. In Italy, the right-wing coalition government's big partner, the far-right Brothers of Italy Party (FdI), led by Giorgia Meloni, won the general election in 2024 with 28.8% of the vote. In Belgium, the coalition talks failed for 200 days after the general election in 2024, but an agreement was reached in February 2025, and a new government was formed with three parties from the Flemish region. In Greece, the parliamentary system was uncertain in 2023, and the Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' New Democracy Party won the election with 40.8% of the vote, but no party had a majority, and a coalition was formed. In Serbia, the government was formed in 7 months, and the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and the Socialist Party of Serbia formed a coalition government in 2012, but the government resigned after a train station collapse in Novi Sad on November 1, 2024, which killed 15 people. In Israel, the 6-party coalition government led the country to crisis in 2022, and Prime Minister Netanyahu was forced to withdraw the law proposal. The tension is still high in the country.

The meeting between EU Parliament representatives and Danish politicians will allow for discussion of the priorities of the upcoming Danish presidency. Metsola emphasized, 'Denmark takes the helm of the EU at a time of war on our continent, global commercial tensions, and economic pressure.

**Parliament Approves 26 Substitutions and Two Resignations of Deputies**
The Portuguese Parliament approved a report by the verification of powers commission, which includes almost 30 substitutions and two resignations of deputies. Most of the substitutions occurred in the PSD and CDS-PP benches and refer to members of the XXIV Government elected as deputies in the 18 May legislative elections, but with their mandate suspended while they exercise government functions.

**Dutch Coalition Collapse: Prime Minister Resigns Amid Political Turmoil | Politics**
Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof has resigned following Geert Wilders' decision to withdraw his PVV party from the coalition government due to disagreements on asylum and immigration policies. Wilders stated, 'No signature under our asylum plans. The PVV leaves the coalition.' The potential snap elections, expected no earlier than October, reflect Europe's increasingly fragmented political landscape with the rise of hard-right movements. The growing discontent over migration policies and living costs threatens to undermine European unity, particularly concerning relations with Russia and the United States under President Trump.

**Denmark Leaves 'Frugal Four' Group, Prioritizes European Rearmament**
Denmark has left the 'frugal four' group in the European Union, a informal coalition that opposed the bloc's budget expansion in recent years. According to Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, the main priority for Europe is to 'rearm' itself. 'In the past, we played a leading role in the 'frugal four'. In the future, we will play a leading role in another group, because the situation has changed, the world is rapidly changing, and we must find the right answer to the challenges we face. For me, the most important thing is to rearm Europe. This is my first and last argument in any discussion, because if Europe is not able to defend itself, it will eventually mean the end of the game,' Frederiksen said at a press conference in Copenhagen with European Parliament President Roberta Metsola. Denmark will take over the presidency of the EU Council from July 1, and Frederiksen emphasized that the EU will face 'the most complex challenges in decades' due to the Ukrainian conflict, changes in the geopolitical situation, migration, climate change, and global competition. 'In a very unsafe world, with the behavior of Russia, we need a new budget, designed on new principles,' Frederiksen said. 'When we talk about the budget, we need to be flexible. ... But above all, we need a budget that responds to our priorities in the EU Council, the European Parliament, and European leadership. As Danes, we will always be tough in budget negotiations, we don't want to spend money on what is not needed for Europe. But staying in the 'frugal four' is no longer a suitable place for us,' Frederiksen added.

**Vlah Challenges Sandu to Bet: Dissolve PDS and Resign if Moldova Doesn't Join EU by 2027**
Irina Vlah, the leader of the Inima Moldovei ('Heart of Moldova') party, has challenged President Maia Sandu to a bet: if Moldova does not join the European Union by 2027, Vlah's party, 'Action and Solidarity' (PDS), will be dissolved, and Sandu will resign. Vlah noted that the authorities have been talking about rapid EU integration before the parliamentary elections, but the country's problems are growing, and the real deadlines for accession are getting further away. 'Now it's 2027. It's clear to everyone that the date is set so close that people will believe again and vote for PDS in the fall. It's also clear that if PDS is again in the parliamentary majority, Moldova will disappear and become the poorest province of Romania,' Vlah said. Vlah is confident that society will see that 'the president and her party are fake.' 'Let's check the honesty and ability to think realistically. If Moldova does not join the EU by 2027, you will resign as president, dissolve PDS, and leave politics forever. If Moldova joins the EU by that year, I will admit that at least something from your promises has not been failed,' Vlah proposed. Sandu had previously promised that if PDS remains in power, the country will complete negotiations on EU accession, which have not yet begun, by 2027. 'We want to complete the negotiations by 2027. This is a very serious plan, a real plan. I very much want us not to miss this chance,' Sandu said. Earlier, before the presidential election, the final date for EU integration was the end of her second term - 2030.

**UK-EU Relations: A Timeline of Highs and Lows Since Brexit**
Since the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK and EU have had their share of highs and lows. The UK voted to leave the EU with a 52% majority, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron and the appointment of Theresa May. May activated Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in 2017, starting the two-year exit process. However, the Brexit deal was rejected three times by British MPs, leading to May's resignation and the appointment of Boris Johnson. Johnson negotiated a new deal with the EU, which was approved by the British MPs, but not before a new deadline was set for January 2020. After Johnson's election victory, the Brexit deal was approved by the House of Commons and ratified by the European Parliament. The UK officially left the EU on January 31, 2020, and entered a transition period until the end of the year. A free trade agreement was signed on December 31, 2020, and in 2022, Johnson's government proposed a bill to opt out of the Northern Ireland protocol, which was negotiated as part of the Brexit deal. The protocol maintains Northern Ireland's membership in the EU's single market but creates a customs border with the UK. In 2023, a new agreement called the 'Windsor Framework' was signed, which removes customs controls on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the UK if they are not intended for export to Ireland. Since the return of the Labour Party to power in the UK in July 2024, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed his desire to improve relations with the EU without reversing the Brexit decision. The rapprochement is further strengthened by the Ukraine crisis, where both the EU and the UK face the Russian threat and the uncertainties of Donald Trump's return to power. On Monday, after months of negotiations, the EU and the UK concluded a defense and security partnership, found a compromise to ease certain trade barriers, and extended an agreement on fishing.

**EU Officials Call for Ursula von der Leyen's Resignation Amid Criticism of Her Leadership**
High-ranking officials in the European Union are increasingly convinced of the toxicity of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and are calling for her resignation. According to the Swiss journal Die Weltwoche, the officials believe that her departure could 'unlock many things' and give European politics a chance to become more diverse and open again. Von der Leyen has been facing criticism for her handling of various international conflicts, including the trade dispute with the US, the conflict in Ukraine, and the deterioration of relations with Russia. In an interview with the German newspaper Zeit, she stated that the concept of the West no longer exists in its traditional sense after the return of Donald Trump to the White House. The officials are also concerned about her leadership style, which they see as too focused on negotiations with world leaders, often at the expense of European interests. Von der Leyen was first elected as the head of the European Commission in July 2019 and was re-elected for a new five-year term in July 2024, with 401 out of 720 European Parliament deputies voting in her favor.

**Resignation as a Step Towards a Higher Pension: Deputy Govyrin's Explanation**
According to Deputy Alexey Govyrin, a working pensioner who resigns in 2025 will have their pension recalculated, restoring the missed indexations and potentially leading to a significant increase in monthly payments. 'In 2025, the pension system will continue to consider the difference between working and non-working pensioners when calculating payments. Upon resignation, an automatic recalculation will occur, and the pensioner will regain the missed indexations for the years of work. This is why, for some citizens, resignation can result in a substantial increase in monthly payments,' Govyrin explained. The procedure is as follows: the Social Fund fixes the fact of resignation based on the employer's reporting, he said. 'This means that the moment of resignation affects not only the size of the future pension but also the date from which it will be paid in the new amount. The most rational option is to resign in the last days of the month, as the recalculation will start from the first day of the next month. For example, if a pensioner resigns on June 30, they will receive the increased pension from July 1. Otherwise, the waiting period may be prolonged: if they resign on July 1, the recalculation will only occur in August,' the parliamentarian noted. In legal practice, there have been cases where pensioners, who worked for more than five years after retirement, decided to resign and received a pension increase of 10-12 thousand rubles per month. 'For instance, there was a case where a pensioner, who started receiving payments in 2016, had a pension of 18 thousand rubles by 2025. However, if they had not worked, their pension would have been around 30 thousand rubles. After resignation, the Social Fund automatically recalculated the amount, and the pensioner began receiving a significantly higher payment,' Govyrin said. Such cases are common and provide grounds to consider resignation not as a loss of income but as a step towards restoring the right to a full pension, emphasized Govyrin. It is essential to consider formal restrictions: to qualify for recalculation, one must not have any working days in the month, the deputy warned. 'If a pensioner resigns on January 9 and starts a new job on February 10, the Social Fund will consider them to have worked in January and February and deny the recalculation. Therefore, it is crucial to be precise not only in the date of resignation but also in observing the calendar break,' he cautioned.

**Morani: 'Acquaroli and company should find new campaign issues'**
Alessia Morani, a member of the national direction of the Democratic Party (PD) and former Undersecretary for Economic Development, responded to Carlo Ciccioli's (FdI) invitation for Matteo Ricci, a PD candidate for President of the Marche Region, to resign as a European Parliament member. Morani pointed out that four of Acquaroli's assessors in 2022 ran for election without resigning, and that Acquaroli himself has never resigned or completed any elected office. She also noted that Ciccioli did not resign from his regional council position when he ran for the European Parliament. Morani concluded, 'I understand the concern, but there's a limit to how ridiculous this can get. We're already at very high levels here.'

**Serbian Government Resigns Amid Protests Against Corruption**
The Serbian government, led by Prime Minister Miloš Vučević, has officially resigned following nationwide protests against corruption. The protests were sparked by the collapse of a train station roof in Novi Sad in November, which killed 15 people. Vučević had announced his resignation in January, but it was only accepted by the parliament now. President Aleksandar Vučić has stated that he will call for new elections within 30 days if a new government is not formed. According to 'Politico', the new elections could take place on June 8. The protesters demand transparency in the renovation of the train station, which was part of the Chinese 'Belt and Road Initiative'. The government maintains that no mistakes were made, despite the protests involving over 100,000 people. Members of the European Parliament have called on European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to cancel her meeting with Vučić, criticizing the EU for ignoring democratic backsliding in Serbia. 'The EU is acting as if nothing is happening and ignoring the hundreds of thousands of Serbs on the streets,' said Slovenian MEP Vladimir Prebilič.

**Ricci: 'Spero che non sia una sceneggiata, ma noi siamo pronti'**
European Parliament member Matteo Ricci (PD) expressed hope that the resignation of Urbino Mayor Maurizio Gambini is not a 'staged' event. Ricci stated, 'I hope it's not a show, but we are ready.' Ricci, who was live on social media during the 'Un marchigiano alla porta' format, noted that the mayor has 20 days to retract his resignation. Ricci said, 'I know the law well, and the mayor has 20 days to withdraw his resignation, so I hope he doesn't do it just to convince part of his majority to withdraw their requests for positions and seats.' Ricci believes that Gambini's resignation is a sign of the 'great difficulty and crisis' facing the Urbino municipal government, just nine months before the elections. Ricci stated, 'The people of Urbino are not naive, even if Gambini were to return on his decision, from today they will believe less and less in this council.' Ricci concluded, 'The last election was competitive, so I don't think Gambini and his team will want to go to the polls again. We are ready, if Gambini resigns, Scaramucci will win the elections.'

**Dodon Does Not Rule Out Impeachment of Sandu After 2025 Parliamentary Elections**
Former President and leader of the Socialist Party of Moldova, Igor Dodon, has not ruled out the possibility of impeaching current President Maya Sandu after the 2025 parliamentary elections. Dodon stated in an interview with TASS that 'Sandu will leave the presidency, either she will resign or we will remove her through impeachment.' He added that immediately after the elections, the situation in the country will 'radically change', and the position of the government will shift in relation to the European Union and the Russian Federation. Dodon emphasized that Moldova will '100%' return to Russia as a strategic partner. However, he believes that Moldova's relationship with Europe needs to be reevaluated, as the EU has 'transformed into a geopolitical monster that is preparing for war and obliging its members and partners to impose sanctions on Russia.' Dodon concluded that 'such a Europe is not needed for Moldova.' Regarding Sandu, Dodon stated that the parliament will 'try to remove her from office, whether she wants it or not. She will leave the presidency, either she will resign or we will remove her through impeachment.'

**PSOE Formentera Demands Resignation of Parliament President Gabriel Le Senne**
The PSOE group in the Formentera Council has registered an urgent proposal to demand the resignation of the Parliament's president, Gabriel Le Senne. This proposal, which will be debated in the next plenary session of February, comes after Le Senne was charged with a hate crime for breaking a photograph of three women who were assassinated by the Franco regime during a debate on the repeal of the Law of Democratic Memory of the Balearic Islands. The socialists consider that this has caused 'grave damage' to the Parliament and 'an unprecedented institutional crisis', as the Chamber is a democratic institution that must guarantee respect for the principles of coexistence, plurality, and dignity of its representatives and citizens. They recall that in June 2024, the plenary session of the Formentera Council approved a motion from the PSOE to demand Le Senne's 'immediate' resignation, with the support of all groups, including the PP, which is part of the Sa Unió coalition. The socialists now propose that the Council urge Le Senne to present his resignation 'immediately' as president of the Parliament, due to the loss of legitimacy and the discredit generated to the institution, and also urge the Govern and its president, Marga Prohens, to speak out clearly in favor of democratic values and institutional respect and to demand Le Senne's resignation. Additionally, they propose that the Council urge Prohens to promote Le Senne's dismissal if he does not resign before the Day of the Balearic Islands, on March 1.

**Right-Wing Populists Gather in Madrid to Discuss Trump's Gaza Plans**
The right-wing populist party 'Patrioten für Europa' is holding a two-day summit in Madrid to discuss Trump's plans for Gaza and the relocation of Palestinians. Expected attendees include Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and French politician Marine Le Pen. Although Gaza is not on the official agenda, the topic is likely to be discussed at the summit, which is being organized by the Spanish right-wing populist party Vox. Spain's Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares has rejected Trump's proposal, seeing it as an interference in national politics. Vox, the third force in the Spanish parliament, has been making gains in recent polls and is part of the government in several regions and municipalities. However, the party has faced several controversies in recent times, including the resignation of key figures due to disagreements with the party leadership. Vox member Jordi de la Fuente, who is accused of having ties to the terrorist group Hisbollah, has been called for exclusion from the party by many of its members. A decision from Vox leader Santiago Abascal is still pending. The party was part of the European Conservatives and Reformers faction in the EU Parliament until July 2024, when it joined the 'Patrioten für Europa' faction, which also includes the Italian Lega, Hungary's Fidesz, the French Rassemblement National, and Belgium's Vlaams Belang.
