**Global Index of Rights 2025: Workers' Rights Decline in America and Europe**
The Global Index of Rights 2025, published by the International Trade Union Confederation (CSI), has reported a decline in workers' rights and freedoms in America and Europe over the past decade. Ecuador ranks third in a list of the 10 worst countries, with Argentina, Costa Rica, and Panama also experiencing a decline in their ratings. According to the CSI, 'If this rate of deterioration continues, there will be no country left in the world with the highest rating for respecting workers' rights in ten years. We are facing a global scandal,' warned Luc Triangle, the CSI's general secretary. The Index analyzed data from 151 countries and is based on a list of 97 indicators extracted from international conventions and the jurisprudence of the International Labor Organization (ILO). The study also highlighted the murders of trade unionists in Colombia, Peru, and Guatemala, among others. Additionally, it pointed to Argentina, Italy, Costa Rica, and Panama as countries where the situation has worsened compared to last year. The report noted that America obtained a 3.68 out of 5 in the barometer of the state of violation of workers' rights, the worst figure for the region since 2014. Europe, although still the least repressive region, has seen a decline in conditions, with more than half of European countries violating the right to collective bargaining (56%) and 54% of countries denying or restricting access to justice for workers in 2025, a significant increase from 32% in 2024. The report also highlighted that almost three-quarters of European countries have violated the right to strike (73%) and almost a third have arrested or detained workers (32%). 'The rise of extreme-right parties and movements in all of Europe has increased the risk of further erosion of workers' rights and trade unions,' the study warned, pointing specifically to the governments of Finland and Italy.

**Trump's Policy Undermines Global Image of the US, Study Finds**
A recent study by Morning Consult found that international perception of the United States has significantly deteriorated since Donald Trump's return to the White House and his efforts to impose tariffs. At the same time, sympathy for China has reached its highest level in five years, indicating a significant shift in global perception of the two superpowers. According to the study, which surveyed over 5,000 people in 41 countries, the US rating has plummeted since Trump's inauguration, despite a brief improvement after his election win. The study's methodology is impressive, with daily surveys of thousands of respondents in key economies. The analysis of data over the past 1.5 years reveals a striking dynamic: despite a brief improvement in attitudes towards the US after Trump's election, his inauguration marked a sharp decline in the rating. The rating of the US fell below zero in May, a worrying sign for American diplomacy. A temporary improvement in the ratings was observed after the agreement between Washington and Beijing to suspend tariffs and hold talks. However, the situation worsened again after Trump publicly accused China of violating the agreements. As a result, the US rating again fell into the 'red zone'. In contrast, attitudes towards China have shown a steady growth since July 2024. In January 2025, China's rating first entered the positive zone in five years. As of May 30, 2025, China's rating stood at 8.8 points, while the US remained at -1.5. 'Since January 2025, a significant deterioration in attitudes towards the US and an improvement in perception of China have been observed in most countries. Only in Russia has the attitude towards the US improved significantly. As perception of the US worsens, trade and investment opportunities for American companies may also decrease, as consumers avoid products and jobs provided by them,' said Jason McManus, an analyst at Morning Consult.

**Mongolia's Coalition Government on the Brink of Collapse: Economic Consequences Loom**
Mongolia is facing crucial parliamentary elections on Monday that could lead to the collapse of the coalition government. A new economic analysis by the Mongolian Economic Development Council warns that this could lead to a sharp decline in national income and foreign direct investment (FDI), as well as a rapid inflation. The political instability will put the country's economic progress at risk, which has been achieved over the past few years. According to the analysis, the disappearance of the government could lead to a contraction of the Mongolian economy by over 20% in six months and a 40% decline in FDI year-over-year. The prime minister, Oyun-Erdene, has called on the members of the State Great Khural to decide whether the coalition government, in power since the parliamentary elections last June, should remain in office to end the recent political instability. The prime minister is expected to address the Khural on Monday before a vote of confidence, which will likely be considered one of the most important moments in Mongolia's political history since its transition to democracy in the early 1990s. As the vote approaches, new economic data (available in full here) compiled by the Mongolian Economic Development Council warns of the magnitude of the economic impact that Mongolia could suffer, including: A 22% reduction in Gross National Income in six months A 12.2% increase in inflation over a year Unemployment rising to 2.5% The Mongolian tugrik depreciating by 17.9% against the US dollar by the end of 2025 An 18-point decline in the Mongolian Economic Stability Index. These predictions are in line with the experiences of other countries where political instability has had a negative impact on the economy, even after the collapse of a coalition government. According to data from the World Bank and other key sources, the breakup of the coalition in Estonia led to a 97% decline in FDI from 7.54% in 2021 to 0.74% in 2024, and a stagnation of economic growth from 7.3% in 2021 to -0.9% in 2024. A study that analyzed data from 169 countries between 1960 and 2004 concluded that high levels of political instability are associated with lower GDP per capita growth, particularly due to decreased productivity growth and lower accumulation of physical and human capital. Dr. Batnasan B., a professor at the National University of Mongolia's Business School and a member of the Economic Development Council, commented: 'The latest data clearly highlight the possible economic consequences of a collapse of the Mongolian coalition government: a sharp economic slowdown, rampant inflation, and rising unemployment. It is entirely appropriate that elected representatives decide who governs the country. But it is equally important that such decisions are made with full access to facts and a clear understanding of potential risks. The Economic Development Council's analysis, combined with lessons from other countries that have faced similar circumstances, presents a stark warning: all the economic progress that Mongolia has achieved with so much effort over the past few years could be compromised if Monday's vote generates further political instability.' This new analysis, along with precedents from around the world, clearly shows the magnitude of the decision that lawmakers will make on Monday and the danger that the country's significant economic progress since the COVID-19 pandemic, including the addition of $9 billion to its economy and a $2,400 increase in GDP per capita, could be put at risk.

**CSI Warns of 'Growing Global Crisis' in Labor Rights**
The International Trade Union Confederation (CSI) has warned of a 'growing global crisis' in labor rights, citing a decline in workers' rights and a worsening situation worldwide in its 12th Global Index of Labor Rights report. The CSI, the world's largest trade union confederation, points to a 'retrogression' of workers' rights and a degradation of their situation in 151 countries. The report, which is based on 97 indicators from international conventions and the jurisprudence of the International Labor Organization (ILO), notes a deterioration in Europe and the Americas, which have achieved their worst results since the index was launched. In Ecuador, which has been among the 10 worst countries for workers since 2023, 'conditions have continued to be hazardous for unions and workers,' the CSI said. According to the report, 'workers who try to organize are systematically threatened and fired, and in some cases, they even receive death threats.' The CSI also noted 'the deterioration of civil liberties and the coordinated attack on unions and workers under radical right-wing governments,' citing Argentina and the United States as examples. Only a handful of countries, including Australia and Mexico, have shown an improvement in workers' rights. The CSI also reported the deaths of unionists or workers in five countries in 2025: Cameroon, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru, and South Africa.

**Workers' Rights Face 'Growing Global Crisis', Says CSI**
The International Trade Union Confederation (CSI) has stated that workers' rights are facing a 'growing global crisis'. The CSI, the largest trade union federation in the world, has included Ecuador among the 10 worst countries for workers in its Global Index of Rights 2025. The CSI reports a 'retrogression' of workers' rights and a deterioration of their situation worldwide in its 12th edition of the report. According to the CSI, 'workers who try to organize themselves systematically face threats and dismissals, and in some cases, even death threats.' The CSI also notes the 'deterioration of civil liberties and the concerted attack on trade unions and workers under radical right-wing governments', citing Argentina and the United States as examples. Only a few countries, such as Australia and Mexico, have shown an improvement in workers' rights. The CSI also reported the deaths of trade unionists or workers in five countries in 2025: Cameroon, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru, and South Africa.

**Ethiopia's Economic Challenges: A Fragile Business Environment**
Despite a decade of sustained economic growth, Ethiopia faces structural difficulties, as illustrated by its social indicators. The agriculture sector remains the backbone of the country's economy. According to the IMF, the country's GDP growth rate was expected to decrease from 9.0% in 2018/19 to 6.2% in 2019/20, and further to 3.2% due to the pandemic. The country's external trade is also a concern, with a high risk of payment delays. The Ethiopian government has not ratified the New York Convention on International Arbitration, making it difficult to recognize foreign court decisions. The country's stability is fragile, with ongoing tensions between the federal government and the Tigray region. A peace agreement signed in November 2022 has given hope for a more stable future, but its effectiveness remains to be seen. The country's business environment is challenging, with a lack of reliable information on local businesses and a high risk of payment delays. The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia is one of the few reliable banks in the country. The government has taken steps to improve the business environment, but more needs to be done. The country's logistics and customs procedures are also a concern, with long delays and high costs. The Ethiopian government has implemented measures to improve the efficiency of customs procedures, but more needs to be done to reduce the risk of payment delays and improve the business environment.

**Afghans in the US Face Uncertainty as TPS Program Ends**
Thousands of Afghans in the US are living in fear and uncertainty as the deadline for the end of the 'Temporary Protected Status' (TPS) program approaches. The program, which allowed them to live and work in the US due to the impossibility of returning to their homeland, will cease to exist on July 14, 2025. This means that over 14,000 Afghans have lost this protection since May 20, 2024. The US Department of Homeland Security has justified the decision by citing a new assessment of the situation in Afghanistan, which shows a decrease in armed conflict, a slight decrease in humanitarian needs, and a 2.7% increase in GDP. However, human rights organizations and international organizations have emphasized that Afghanistan is still experiencing instability and a severe humanitarian crisis. The US government has offered alternative options, such as applying for asylum or seeking financial assistance for resettlement in a third country. However, many Afghans are concerned about the risks of returning to Afghanistan, where the security situation is still fragile, the economy is struggling, and poverty rates are high. The US government has been criticized for its decision, with some lawmakers calling for a more humane approach to the situation. The Afghan community in the US is calling for a coordinated political effort to pressure the US government to fulfill its promises to those who cooperated with the US in Afghanistan and to work towards a solution for their legal status.

**Russia's Financial Safety Net Shrinks by 75% in Less Than Three Years**
The Russian economy is deteriorating due to the ongoing war against Ukraine and Western sanctions. The National Welfare Fund (NWF), a key financial instrument for supporting the Russian budget, has shrunk almost fourfold since the start of the full-scale invasion. According to official data, the liquid part of the NWF was $145 billion at the beginning of July 2022, $78 billion a year later in July 2023, and only $39 billion as of May 1, 2025, resulting in a loss of around 75% of the financial cushion in less than three years. The main source of funding for the fund remains oil exports, but it is also under significant pressure. Due to sanctions, Russia has lost access to many traditional markets and new ones are more expensive and less efficient. The situation is complicated by the forecasted low price of Brent crude oil at $64 in 2025 and $60 in 2026. This creates critical risks for the budget, which is oriented towards oil and gas revenues. Already, problems are being felt in key sectors. For example, the state corporation 'Rosatom' projects for 2025 are underfunded by 80%, 'Russian Railways' is experiencing a decline in cargo volumes, and the metal, construction, and resource extraction industries are showing a decrease in production. Most corporations have stopped paying dividends, indicating a deep crisis. Despite this, Moscow is trying to maintain the appearance of stability, but real economic indicators suggest the opposite. If current sanctions and increased control over their circumvention are maintained, Russia may lose the remaining NWF by 2026. As a reminder, despite the Kremlin's confident statements about economic stability, the situation inside the country is rapidly deteriorating. The Russian economy is, in fact, becoming increasingly unstable due to military spending, international sanctions, and questionable state statistics. Experts from the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics (SITE) have prepared a document highlighting that the current financial model of Russia is maintained only by short-term injections into the military-industrial complex, but such support does not have a long-term perspective. 'It was a great day,' said no one, as the Russian economy continues to deteriorate.

**Death, Sexual Violence and Human Trafficking: Fallout From U.S. Aid Withdrawal Hits the World’s Most Fragile Locations**
The withdrawal of US aid by the Trump administration has led to a surge in violence and chaos in some of the world's most fragile locations. According to internal reports from the State Department, the sudden cut-off of humanitarian commitments has destabilized refugee camps and exacerbated humanitarian crises. Diplomats have warned that stopping aid may undermine efforts to combat terrorism and empower groups like the Taliban. The World Food Programme (WFP) has been forced to drastically slash food programs in countries such as Kenya and Malawi, leaving millions of people at risk of malnutrition. 'It is devastating, but it's not surprising,' said Eric Schwartz, a former State Department assistant secretary. 'I struggle for adjectives to adequately describe the horror that this administration has visited on the world,' he added. The State Department spokesperson responded by saying that it is 'grossly misleading to blame unrest and violence around the world on America.' However, the WFP's Kenya country director Lauren Landis said that the cuts will lead to a malnutrition crisis and that she is concerned about the security of her staff. 'We are living off the fumes of what was delivered in late 2024 or early 2025,' she said. 'We are deeply concerned that suddenly discontinuing all USAID counter terrorism-focused stabilization and humanitarian programs in Somalia … will immediately and negatively affect U.S. national security interests,' the U.S. embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia, wrote in February.

**Significant Economic Deterioration Ahead: Venezuela's Exchange Rate Crisis**
Economist Asdrúbal Oliveros warned of a significant economic deterioration in Venezuela, stating that the country lacks the necessary foreign exchange to stabilize the exchange rate. Oliveros, director of Ecoanalítica, explained that the current exchange system requires increasingly larger injections of foreign exchange to maintain stability, a condition he deemed unfeasible in the current context. He projected an inflation rate of 200% for 2025, significantly higher than the 48% reported officially in 2024. Oliveros warned that those most affected by this scenario will be Venezuelans who rely on a salary in bolívares, particularly public employees and the elderly. 'The numbers we're seeing for 2025 are a significant deterioration that will mainly harm those who depend on a salary in bolívares: the elderly and public employees,' he said. Additionally, Oliveros estimated a significant reduction in foreign exchange income for the Venezuelan state, predicting a decline of between 50% and 60%, far exceeding initial projections. 'The decline in foreign exchange income for the Venezuelan state could be in the order of 50 to 60%, much higher than initially estimated,' he concluded.

**The US Economy: A State of 'False Stability'**
The US economy is experiencing a state of 'false stability', according to Robert Armstrong, an economist at Bloomberg. Despite the ongoing trade war, the economy is showing signs of stability, with low unemployment and rising consumer spending. However, the situation is precarious, and the economy is vulnerable to shocks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is still within 10% of its all-time high, and the consensus is for a 10% increase in earnings this year. The price-to-earnings ratio for the index is 21, which is high and optimistic. The economic data is mixed, with some indicators showing weakness, such as the decline in retail sales and the increase in unemployment claims. However, the overall picture is one of stability, and the market is expecting a smooth transition. The administration's trade policies, including tariffs and quotas, are expected to be short-lived, and the market is anticipating a return to normalcy. Companies such as Colgate and Procter & Gamble are reporting mixed results, with some showing signs of weakness and others indicating a return to growth. The consumer is expected to return to normal behavior, and the market is anticipating a rebound in consumer spending.

**South Africa's Economy: Fragile but with Opportunities**
South Africa remains the continent's leading industrial power, but its economy is fragile due to persistent structural blockages. The country's growth slowed to +0.6% in 2023, hindered by chronic power outages (load-shedding) and infrastructure transportation dysfunctions. The 2024 forecast predicts a slight rebound, with a +1.1% GDP increase, provided that energy sector reforms are implemented effectively. The energy crisis remains a major obstacle to economic activity. The state-owned enterprise Eskom, structurally deficient, continues to face operational and financial difficulties. The aging of installations, lack of maintenance, poor governance inherited from the Zuma era, and corruption have contributed to large-scale power outages, heavily affecting industrial production. Eskom's debt, estimated at over 450 billion ZAR (more than 10% of GDP), represents a systemic risk to public finances. State-owned enterprises as a whole remain a point of fragility, both financially and economically. They impact the economy's competitiveness, in a context of internal demand stagnation and investment stagnation. The business climate remains degraded, particularly due to legal insecurity, corruption, and slow reforms. Private investment is struggling to recover, affected by weak growth, regulatory instability, and uncertain governance in key sectors. The budget deficit is expected to deepen to around 6% of GDP in 2024/2025, linked to the increase in public spending, particularly salaries in the public sector. The public debt exceeds 77% of GDP, mainly domestic, making the country vulnerable in case of local market tensions. The unemployment rate remains extremely high (around 32.1% by the end of 2023), affecting over 45% of young people. This situation fuels social inequalities, tensions, and risks of unrest. Sporadic urban violence, social tensions, and persistent inequalities also weigh on the country's stability. Despite these difficulties, South Africa retains several advantages: a solid and well-regulated banking sector, relatively resilient democratic institutions, abundant natural resources, and a diversified industrial fabric. Implementing the economic recovery plan and structural reforms, particularly in the energy sector, is essential to restore confidence, attract investments, and relaunch growth.

**Mexico's Interconnected Processes: A Global Deterioration, Economic Slowdown, and Political Decomposition**
The author suggests that Mexico is facing three interconnected processes: a global deterioration, an internal economic slowdown, and a political decomposition. The global deterioration, accelerated by Donald Trump's second presidency, has led to a recent surge in Trump's criminal behavior, including imposing arbitrary tariffs on all countries, which caused a market crash and a rapid increase in the US government's long-term interest rate. Trump's subsequent announcement to postpone the tariffs for 90 days led to a spectacular jump in stock prices. The author notes that Trump is a 'bandido' (thief) and that there was likely insider information before the announcement. The internal economic slowdown began with the cancellation of the airport construction project in 2019, which put Mexico in recession. The pandemic and lack of support plans during the confinement limited the post-pandemic recovery, and the economy soon returned to a negative trend. This led to the loss of the midterm election and the decision to increase government debt by 10% of GDP (4% in 2023 and 6% in 2024) to avoid losing the presidential election. The author notes that the economy has never recovered from the airport decision and is now experiencing a decline, which has been clear since July and has been in negative territory since October. The political decomposition is a result of the way Morena party achieved power in 2018 and 2024, by forming alliances with toxic groups, including politicians from other parties and leaders of criminal groups. The author notes that this has led to a loss of control over these alliances, the Congress, and the governors, and that the president may not have control over these groups. The author concludes that it is difficult to predict the stability of the political situation, just as it is difficult to predict the stock market, interest rates, or exchange rates.

**The Most Fragile Countries in the World: What Makes Them So Vulnerable?**
According to the Fragile States Index 2007-2024 by Found For Peace, the most fragile countries in the world are Somalia and Sudan, with scores of 111.3 and 109.3, respectively. This is due to the weak security of their inhabitants, social unrest, fragile economy, poor public services, economic inequality, and other factors. Colombia ranks 63rd with an average score of 75.6, indicating that it exhibits these characteristics to some extent. The OECD notes that the Fragile States Index considers a world of changing power dynamics, where the most severe impacts of crises, conflicts, and instability converge in the 61 contexts identified with high and extreme fragility. The 2 billion people living in contexts of high and extreme fragility represent 25% of the world's population, but 72% of global extreme poverty. Maintaining a focus on the most disadvantaged is more crucial than ever for development partners, as a global good and geostrategic necessity.

**Israel on the Brink of Collapse: A Comprehensive Crisis**
Israel is on the brink of collapse, facing a comprehensive crisis that includes economic, social, mental health, and political issues. While some media outlets downplay the severity of the crisis, the numbers and facts paint a dire picture of a country that was once considered invincible. According to data collected until March 21, 2025, Israel's economy is in shambles, with losses of $50 billion in military and economic costs, a budget deficit of $30 billion in 2023, and expected to worsen in 2024. Additionally, 40,000 small and medium-sized businesses have closed since the start of the war, and the tourism sector has declined by 60% in 2023, with continued deterioration in 2024. The construction sector has lost $3 billion in 2023. These numbers show that the Israeli economy is collapsing rapidly, threatening its ability to fund the war or even maintain its internal stability. Israel, which relied on external support and a strong economy, is now unable to face the increasing pressures. The war has not only destroyed the economy but has also forced the population to flee: 100,000 Israelis have left the country permanently since the start of the war, and 50,000 are still displaced due to fear of rocket attacks. This displacement is not just a temporary crisis, but it indicates a collapse of trust in the state's ability to protect its citizens. The mass migration threatens the demographic balance that Israel has relied on to maintain its identity, accelerating its internal decline. The Israeli people are living under the weight of unprecedented psychological trauma: 500,000 Israelis suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder due to the war, and there has been a 30% increase in sales of antidepressants, a 20% increase in alcohol consumption, and a 150% increase in sales of sleeping pills. The army is also struggling with a high number of suicides, with 15 cases reported in 2024, and reports suggest that the number may be higher. This psychological crisis weakens the morale of the society and the army, making it impossible for them to continue the war, which makes the collapse closer. Israel is no longer able to maintain its image as a strong democratic state: it faces increasing international condemnation and diplomatic isolation from its traditional allies. This political collapse deprives Israel of the external support it relied on to survive. Without allies, the state becomes more fragile in the face of internal and external pressures. The most critical crisis may be internal: there are criticisms from the elite, public protests, and a political split within the government, which threatens to collapse. This internal crisis reveals the breakdown of the Israeli political fabric. A divided government and a rebellious people cannot face the external challenges, pushing the state towards chaos.

**El Salvador's Economy Remains Fragile Amid COVID-19 Pandemic**
El Salvador has taken swift action to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including closing its borders on March 11, 2020, and declaring a national state of emergency on March 14, 2020. The measures have had a significant economic impact, with the IMF predicting a recession of 5.4% in 2020. The World Bank estimates that the poverty rate could increase to 29-40% of households. To mitigate the economic consequences, the government has implemented a comprehensive plan. The adoption of Bitcoin as the national currency has raised concerns among analysts, with the OECD downgrading the country's risk rating from 6 to 7 in October 2022. The IMF has also pressured the country to abandon Bitcoin, citing concerns about the currency's stability. The country's fragile economy and banking sector make it essential to exercise caution when negotiating commercial contracts. The risk of non-payment remains high, with Credendo rating the country F (worst rating) due to its fragile economy and lack of reliable statistics on payment delays and business failures.

**Afghanistan's Economy Remains Fragile: World Bank Report - Khaama Press**
The World Bank has reported that Afghanistan's economic recovery under Taliban rule remains uncertain due to political instability, financial isolation, reduced foreign aid, and weak trade ties with Pakistan. Despite some economic growth in 2023-2024, widespread poverty and high unemployment continue to impact millions of Afghans. The Afghani currency has suffered a 12% decline in value between November 2024 and January 2025, with the exchange rate falling to 74.8 Afghanis per US dollar. The Taliban has attempted to stabilize the currency by injecting $100 million into the market, but the depreciation persists. The World Bank urges economic reforms, financial transparency, and sustainable policies to reduce Afghanistan's dependence on imports and aid. Without reforms, economic instability may grow, increasing the risk of a worsening humanitarian crisis.

**Fragile States Index February 10, 2025 11:37 PM Subscribe**
The Fragile States Index is a website that compares the liveability and governance of countries. The higher the score, the more fragile the country is. Norway has the lowest score of 12.7, while the USA scores 44.5, ranking 141st. The index uses 12 metrics to measure country stability, including security apparatus, economic decline, and human rights. The USA scores low on group grievance and factionalized elites, but surprisingly scores poorly on state legitimacy and demographic pressures. A general observation is that smaller countries tend to have better governance.
