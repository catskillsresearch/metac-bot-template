**What is the real risk to stocks from elevated bond yields**
Goldman Sachs believes that despite elevated bond yields, the S&P 500 has a 10% return forecast over the next 12 months, targeting 6,500. The firm notes that the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is at 4.4%, with expectations of it reaching 4.5% by 2025 and 4.55% in 2026. Goldman emphasizes that the cause and pace of rising yields are more critical to equities than the absolute level. However, large, rapid moves in yields, such as more than 60 basis points in a month, have historically weighed on equities. Goldman believes that elevated yields alone are unlikely to derail earnings for the S&P 500, but may constrain valuation expansion. The firm advises avoiding weak balance sheet stocks in the current high-rate environment.

**Here's the Average Stock Market Return Over the Last 10 Years | The Motley Fool**
The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite have moved sideways in 2025, with the S&P 500 advancing less than 1%, the Dow Jones declining less than 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite declining about 1% year to date. However, over the last 10 years, the S&P 500 returned 235%, the Dow Jones returned 193%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 314%. This translates to an average annual return of 12.8% for the S&P 500, 11.3% for the Dow Jones, and 15.2% for the Nasdaq Composite. For example, investing $150 weekly in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would be worth $142,200 in 10 years, while investing in the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF would be worth $159,900 in a decade.

**Big Techs Lead S&P 500 Recovery, But Growth Rate Expected to Slow Down**
The tech sector has driven almost all of the growth in profits in the first quarter of 2025, according to a recent report by FactSet. The sector was responsible for more than half of the total growth of the S&P 500 in the first quarter, with a 25.6% increase in profits. On the other hand, sectors such as energy and materials pulled the index down, with declines of 25.4% and 13.7%, respectively. The big techs have also led the recovery of the S&P 500, which is now just 4% away from its historic high in February. According to Bloomberg, since the April 8 decline, the S&P 500 has accumulated a 19% gain, and the Magnificent Seven have accounted for almost half of that gain. Companies such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Microsoft have risen 56%, 40%, and 30%, respectively, in the period. The group has also returned to outperform the average performance of the index over the past eight weeks, although it is still behind in the year-to-date. Despite recent results, projections for the next quarters indicate a significant deceleration in the growth rate. FactSet expects the profits of the big techs to grow only 14% in the second quarter. For the following quarters, projections are even more modest: 8.9%, 10.6%, and 10.2%. Long-term projections shared by PS Lee, professor responsible for the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the National University of Singapore, also show this trend: 'The growth rate of the big techs is expected to slow down in the coming quarters, and the multiples of the market are still high.'

**If I Could Buy Only 1 High-Yield Dividend Stock in June, This Would Be It | The Motley Fool**
The author of the article recommends Brookfield Renewable (BEPC 1.57%) (BEP 0.73%) as the top dividend stock to buy in June. The company's shares have been drifting lower, resulting in a dividend yield of over 5%, which is several times higher than the S&P 500's dividend yield. Brookfield Renewable has a durable cash flow, supported by long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with an average remaining term of 14 years, and a strong investment-grade balance sheet. The company has a record of growing its dividend at a 6% compound annual rate since 2001 and aims to grow its high-yielding dividend at a 5% to 9% annual rate. Brookfield Renewable estimates that its inflation-linked PPAs will grow its funds from operations (FFO) per share by 2% to 3% annually, and expects to lock in higher rates on new PPAs, which will deliver an additional 2% to 4% in annual FFO per share growth. The company is also building new renewable power-generation capacity and routinely recycles capital by selling mature assets and redeploying the proceeds into new, higher-returning investment opportunities. As a result, Brookfield Renewable believes it can grow its FFO per share at a rate of more than 10% annually for the foreseeable future.

**S&P 500 Sees Largest Monthly Gain Since November 2023**
The S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since February, with a gain of 6.2% in May, according to Reuters. The index also saw its largest monthly gain since November 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also saw its largest monthly gain since November 2023, with a gain of 9.6% in May. The market was volatile in May, with investors on edge due to Trump's unpredictable trade policies. However, his softened stance on tariffs, combined with optimistic earnings and low inflation data, helped the S&P 500 recover from its lowest level in April. The S&P 500 ended the month with a slight gain, despite a volatile session on Friday, as Trump criticized China on his 'Truth Social' platform, but later expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal. Dollarhyde said, 'February, March, and April were the worst three months since COVID, so we needed some gains.' The US tariffs on imports have increased from 2-3% before Trump took office to around 15% currently, according to Oxford Economics. A court ruling could have lowered this rate to around 6%, but a stay of execution by the appeals court kept the higher rate in place. The market also digested data showing a 2.1% annual increase in US consumer spending in April, following a 2.3% increase in March. The Federal Reserve is monitoring personal consumption expenditure prices to determine its 2% inflation target. Investors also maintained their bets that the Fed will cut its short-term borrowing costs in September.

**Here's How Much a $500-per-Month Investment in the S&P 500 Could Grow Over the Long Term**
Investing in the S&P 500 index can be a simple and effective way to grow wealth over the long term. Historically, the S&P 500 has averaged annual returns of around 10%, which means an investment can double in value in about seven years. Over 25 years, an investment in an S&P 500 ETF, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), can grow to nearly 11 times its original value. Even investing $500 per month can lead to a significant portfolio balance, potentially reaching $1 million over time. The key to success is staying invested and trusting the process, as the power of compounding can lead to significant growth over the long term.

**Charlie Munger Once Said, 'The First Rule Of Compounding Is To Never Interrupt It Unnecessarily' -- Now His Wisdom Rings True As The S&P 500 Surges 220% Over 10 Years - Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), SPDR S&P 500 (ARCA:SPY)**
The S&P 500 index has yielded a 220% return in the last 10 years, according to data shared by Peter Mallouk, CEO of Creative Planning Inc. This is in line with the wisdom of veteran investor Charlie Munger, who once said, 'The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.' The data shows that investors who exited their positions on March 23, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, earned only a 17% return, representing an annualized return of only 1.6% over these same 10 years. Mallouk also shared data representing the growth of a $100,000 investment made in the S&P 500 Total Return index 50 years ago in 1974, which would stand at a staggering $15,347,191 in 2024. Munger's teachings emphasize the importance of patience, as he said, 'The big money is not in the buying and selling but in the waiting.' This is evident in the market's resilience despite falling into the bear market territory, with the S&P 500 index turning positive for the year with a 1.53% year-to-date return.

**Prediction: This Warren Buffett-Approved Index Fund Will Survive Any Recession or Stock Market Crash | The Motley Fool**
With recession concerns rising, experts predict a 60% probability of a recession in 2025, according to J.P. Morgan analysts. Despite this, Warren Buffett recommends the S&P 500 index fund as a safe and stable investment that has survived every recession, bear market, and crash. 'In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,' Buffett emphasized in 2020. The fund has a decades-long history of outperforming actively managed hedge funds and has produced a compound annual growth rate of around 10% per year over the past century. However, it can never earn above-average returns, as it aims to follow the market's performance. Despite this, it is a reliable investment that can help you accumulate wealth over time, especially if you start investing early.

**10 'pure value' stocks favored by analysts to soar 20% to 96% over the next year**
S&P Dow Jones Indices has identified 10 'pure value' stocks that are expected to soar 20% to 96% over the next year. These stocks are part of the S&P 500 Pure Value Index and are selected based on their value scores, rather than market capitalization. The list includes four oil producers, and experts believe that the industry's discipline around spending has left it in a stronger financial position than in 2015 and 2016. According to Nichole Hammond, co-manager of the Angel Oak High Yield Opportunities ETF, 'there has been massive discipline around spending' among U.S. oil producers. The 10 stocks are expected to increase their revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 11% from 2024 through 2026, compared to the S&P Composite 1500's expected CAGR of 5.5% for revenue and 12.6% for earnings per share.

**S&P 500: A Potential Double-Digit Comeback?**
According to FactSet, there are several indications that the S&P 500 may experience a significant comeback in terms of growth. Historically, reported earnings have exceeded expectations by an average of 6.9% over the past 10 years. If this trend continues, the actual growth rate could be 12.8% based on the current expectation of 7.2% earnings growth. In the past five years, the average deviation was even higher at 8.8%, which would translate to a potential earnings growth rate of 14.6%. As companies report actual earnings that exceed expectations, these higher values replace the original projections in the index aggregation, thereby increasing the overall growth rate. As more positive surprises occur, the growth expectation for the first quarter is likely to increase significantly. The historical pattern suggests a final earnings growth rate in the double-digit range.

**Could This Vanguard ETF Be Your Ticket to Becoming a Millionaire by 2035?**
A hypothetical investor could build a $1 million portfolio using the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) by considering two key aspects: the S&P 500's steady returns over the decades and a conservative estimate of its future growth. The S&P 500 has generated a 12.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 10 years, and an 11% CAGR over 30 years. Assuming an 11% CAGR over the next 10 years, an investor could potentially reach a portfolio value of $1 million by 2035.

**Treasury yields tick higher as investors navigate stagflation fears**
Treasury yields rose early Monday, rebounding from last week's lows, as investors await economic data amidst concerns about economic growth and inflation. The 10-year rate ended last week at its lowest point of the year, but investors are now seeking clarity on the outlook for economic growth. This comes after weak economic data and rising concerns about the U.S. consumer's health led to a decline in yields at the end of last week. The stock-market selloff on Friday, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 log their biggest one-day percentage falls of 2025, fueled flight-to-safety buying interest in Treasurys, further dragging down yields.

**Here's the Average Stock Market Return in the Past 10 Years, and What Wall Street Expects in the Future**
The S&P 500, a widely considered benchmark for the US stock market, has returned 192% over the past decade, excluding dividends, and 249% including dividends, with annual compounding rates of 11.2% and 13.3% respectively. However, the current forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22.2 is a significant premium to the 10-year average of 18.3, suggesting potentially worse returns in the future. Historically, a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22 has correlated with annualized returns between -2% and 2%. Despite this, Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the future, citing artificial intelligence as a tailwind, but also expecting elevated valuations to be a headwind. Forecasts from five Wall Street firms range from extremely bearish to extremely bullish.
