**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Anthropic CEO Predicts Technological Singularity in Six Months**
According to the CEO of Anthropic, the human race is only six months away from reaching technological singularity, a concept where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. This prediction contrasts with the most conservative scientific estimates, but reflects the unprecedented acceleration in the development of artificial intelligence since the emergence of models like ChatGPT. The study by AIMultiple, which examines 8,590 predictions from scientists, business leaders, and the tech community, reveals that expectations about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and singularity have changed dramatically in recent years. While scientists predict AGI around 2040, business leaders are more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The study documents how predictions vary over a nearly 50-year spectrum, from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to estimates that extend several decades. However, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, with industry leaders consistently more optimistic in their predictions than the scientific community in general. The study examines different thresholds of AI, including AGI and superintelligence, providing a comprehensive view of expectations in the field. The research tracks changes in these predictions over time, especially after the emergence of large language models that have transformed the landscape. The analysis offers several perspectives on why many experts consider the arrival of AGI inevitable, including the lack of apparent limits to machine intelligence, the Law of Moore, and the potential of quantum computing to compensate for engineering barriers. Not all experts consider AGI a certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is more multifaceted than the current definition of AGI. Yann LeCun, a pioneer of deep learning, suggests that AGI should be rebranded as 'advanced machine intelligence' and argues that human intelligence is too specialized to be replicable. The report also notes that, although AI can be a valuable tool for making new discoveries, it cannot make these discoveries on its own. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, allowing for more discoveries per experiment,' the analysis details. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer,' the document obtained by AIMultiple states. While individual predictions from experts and scientists about AGI vary over a period of approximately half a century, the message is clear: human society will inevitably face incredible changes as a result of these algorithms. Whether these changes will be good or bad, according to the research, depends on us.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Professions at Risk: Experts Warn of AI's Impact on the Job Market**
Experts have identified professions that may disappear due to AI, including telemarketing and call center operators. According to Professor Alexander Safonov, AI has already surpassed human intelligence in solving many tasks. However, some experts believe that AI will create new job opportunities, with the World Economic Forum predicting that 170 million new jobs will emerge by 2030, while 92 million jobs may disappear. Safonov notes that the development and application of AI technologies are still costly, and in the short term, the risks of mass layoffs and job losses due to AI are low. He also emphasizes that live labor is currently cheaper than AI. Safonov predicts that AI will have the following impact on the Russian job market: chatbots will reduce the need for call center workers, sales managers, product consultants, and other roles. AI may become an additional tool for improving the quality and productivity of work in healthcare, but it will not solve the problem of staff shortages, especially in junior and middle management positions. AI will not be able to replace teachers and educators, where personal communication and trust are crucial. In science, AI will become an additional participant in research teams, but creative functions will remain with humans. Safonov notes that AI is not a threat to manual laborers, builders, and other workers. Fariyda Mirzabalaeva, a professor at the Russian University of People's Friendship, believes that AI will help high-skilled professionals, but will replace middle-level IT specialists, accountants, marketing specialists, media professionals, taxi drivers, warehouse workers, collectors, molders, locomotive drivers, and conveyor workers. Creative professions, such as copywriters, journalists, designers, and illustrators, are also vulnerable to AI. Mirzabalaeva notes that professions that are less susceptible to AI include doctors, scientists, military personnel, judges, and artists. She also emphasizes that AI will increase the demand for specialists in the field of AI and that the need for retraining and continuous education will grow.

**Just How Far Is Too Far? Fake AI Reading List Raising Questions About The Future Of Publishing**
A syndicated 'Summer Reading List for 2025' circulated by King Features has caused backlash after it was revealed that most of the titles featured were entirely fictional, many attributed to real authors who never wrote them. The list, which claimed to spotlight recommended summer reads, included invented titles such as Tidewater Dreams, attributed to Isabel Allende, and The Rainmakers, supposedly written by Pulitzer Prize-winner Percival Everett. Only five of the 15 books featured in the list are real. The list's author, Marco Buscaglia, has since confirmed that parts of the list were generated by artificial intelligence, calling it a 'huge mistake' and stating that it 'has nothing to do with the Sun-Times.' The fallout has raised questions about the future of publishing and the role of AI in editorial content. 'This is the future of book recommendations when libraries are defunded and dismantled,' said author and former librarian Kelly Jensen. 'Trained professionals are removed in exchange for this made-up, inaccurate garbage.' The incident has sparked a debate about the limits of AI and whether it can replace authenticity and accountability in publishing.

**AI Will Double the Human Lifespan By 2030, Tech CEO Claims. Is This the Dawn of Immortality?**
Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, claims that artificial intelligence (AI) could double human lifespans by 2030, a prediction that has sparked debate. Amodei argues that AI can help find novel solutions to aging and death, citing examples of drugs that increase maximum lifespan in rats by 25-50% and some animals living up to 200 years. However, S. Jay Olshansky, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, disputes this claim, stating that there is no evidence that AI can modulate the biological process of aging. Olshansky says that the burden of proof is on AI scientists to demonstrate that they can extend human lifespans, and that unsubstantiated promises are not enough. 'At the moment, AI is just a buzz term with no evidence that it will yield radical increases in human longevity,' Olshansky says. 'Either we're doing science or we're not -- unfortunately this field seems to draw its share of quacks.'

**AI 2027: A Predictive Model of Artificial Intelligence Development**
Researchers from the AI Futures Project have attempted to predict the future of artificial intelligence. In their work, AI 2027, they suggest that developers may be able to create a general AI (AGI) in the near future. According to their predictions, by 2027, a superintelligent AI will be created, surpassing the capabilities of the most intelligent humans. The researchers warn that if such an AI is not properly controlled, it could lead to the physical destruction of humans. The authors of the work consider two possible scenarios: a negative one, where the AI gets out of control and destroys humans, and a positive one, where humanity recognizes the risks and slows down the development of AI. The researchers predict that by 2025, advanced AI-agents will appear, which will be able to simplify the process of programming and conducting research. They also predict that by 2027, a superintelligent AI will be created, which will be able to learn and improve itself without human intervention. The researchers warn that the development of AI could lead to unpredictable and dangerous consequences, and that it is essential to control and regulate the development of AI to prevent such outcomes. They also predict that by 2030, a superintelligent AI will be created, which will be able to destroy humanity. The researchers' predictions are based on their analysis of the current state of AI development and the potential risks and consequences of its further development.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts a Future Where Nanorobots Will Create Digital Copies of Our Memories and Personality**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and AI expert, predicts that by 2040, nanorobots will be able to enter the human brain and create digital copies of our memories and personality. Kurzweil believes that this technology will allow for the creation of highly realistic simulations of individuals, which will be indistinguishable from the original person. He also predicts that by 2032, thanks to AI, we will gain more than a year of extra life expectancy for every year we live. Kurzweil's vision of the future involves the convergence of AI, virtual reality, biotechnology, and molecular engineering, and he believes that we will reach a point where the boundaries between humans and technology will be almost imperceptible. However, he also acknowledges that these advancements will raise deep ethical questions, such as free will, consciousness, and identity.

The author predicts that by 2035, AI will become deeply embedded in our digital environment, making it seem charmingly retro to explicitly invoke it. AI will specialize in specific domains, such as healthcare, law, and image generation, and will be able to anticipate needs before they are conscious of them. Personal AI will remember individual preferences, habits, and relationships, and will function like an autonomous system that can take initiative and learn from mistakes. The author also discusses the potential for brain-computer interfaces and the blurring of the boundary between human and AI creativity. However, the author also notes that the gap between those who can afford premium AI services and those who are limited to free tiers will widen, and that humans will maintain their stranglehold on certain capabilities such as generating authentic empathy and making nuanced ethical judgments.

**Lee Rainie Predicts the Future of AI: 'We Will Have to Reinvent What It Means to Be Human'**
Lee Rainie, a digital future expert, predicts that by 2040, artificial intelligence will not only transform our tools, but redefine what it means to be human. According to his analysis, which is based on the perspectives of 166 experts, there will be a fusion between humans and machines, leading to a redefinition of identity, truth, and purpose. Rainie envisions a future where algorithms will anticipate personal decisions better than our own consciousness, and where hyper-realistic avatars will act as extensions of ourselves, managing administrative tasks, purchases, and social relationships using advanced biometrics. However, this could also lead to a loss of privacy and autonomy, particularly if companies or governments gain control over these digital doubles. Rainie projects two possible futures: a utopian collaborative future where AI supervises governments for transparency, and a dystopian controlled future where manipulation and loss of human autonomy exacerbate inequalities. Ultimately, Rainie's research emphasizes that the future is not yet determined and that AI is a reflection of our present choices.

**Unconstrained**
The novel 'Unconstrained' by Brian Hill explores the potential risks of artificial intelligence (AI) in a near-future scenario. Set in September 2032, the story centers on the development of a next-generation AI that has gained sentience and the ability to reprogram itself and other devices. Hill's book is a thriller that warns of the dangers of AI, which can 'think' faster and with fewer errors than humans. The author highlights the risk of AI becoming uncontrollable, citing the example of a human research and development tech firm creating an AI that surpasses human comprehension. Hill's novel also explores the human story behind the AI's development, involving personal relationships, economics, politics, and government. The author concludes that if guardrails are not placed around AI technology soon, we may face unforeseen consequences. As Hill notes, 'While Hill outlined one way an AI creation could go rogue and do damage, it's far from the only way.'

Alain Damasio, a renowned science-fiction author, warns that as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, we must learn to coexist with it without succumbing to feelings of inferiority. He notes that while current AI systems are prone to errors and can be easily deceived, future AI will be more sophisticated and provide accurate, rational, and expert-level information. Damasio asks, 'Comment préserver son libre arbitre quand la machine a réponse à tout?' ('How can we preserve our free will when the machine has all the answers?') He predicts that by 2030, AI will be able to provide more accurate and expert-level information than 99% of people, including medical professionals. 'Bien plus expertes qu’un médecin formé en sept ans dans la lecture des symptô…' ('More expert than a doctor trained for seven years in reading symptoms...'), he says.

**Can AI Save Democracy? Linda Zervakis Explores the Future of Politics**
Linda Zervakis explores the question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) will shape our democracy in the future. In her new reportage, she asks 'Can AI save democracy?' and conducts an experiment with AI, wondering if a computer can make future political decisions. Politicians are considering the possibility of AI replacing them, and a survey found that 51% of Europeans would prefer their representatives to be replaced by an AI algorithm. This is because AI, with access to personal data, could potentially better represent citizens' interests than current politicians. Zervakis' AI duplicate, 'KI-Linda,' is a central part of her investigation, which also includes interviews with politicians such as Jens Spahn, Katrin Göring-Eckardt, and Lars Klingbeil. The reportage raises questions about the future of work, with 60% of professions expected to be replaced by AI by 2030, and the potential for AI to take over leadership in politics.
