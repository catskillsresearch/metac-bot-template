**EPA's Energy Star is on the chopping block: Why experts say that's 'purposeless'**
Energy Star, a federal program encouraging consumers to buy energy-efficient products, is being cut, with experts calling it 'purposeless'. UCLA environmental economist Magali Delmas says most consumers need an extra reason to buy green, and Energy Star provided incentives like visible energy savings through yellow tags and blue logos. Eliminating the program will cost consumers more, says UCLA Professor Stephanie Pincetl, citing the government's own estimate that the program can save the average household $450 per year. Delmas and Pincetl are available for further commentary on the program's effectiveness and the need for energy conservation.

**EPA Announces Interim Rule Further Delaying TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting by Nine Months**
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced an interim rule that further delays the one-time reporting required under TSCA section 8(a)(7) for entities manufacturing or importing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) between 2011 and 2022. The reporting period, originally scheduled to run from July 11, 2025, through January 11, 2026, will now run from April 13 to October 13, 2026. The EPA states that the delay is necessary to prepare the reporting application to collect the data. The agency is also considering reopening public comments on certain aspects of the final rule in light of Executive Order 14192. A 30-day public comment period will follow the publication of the interim rule in the Federal Register on May 13, 2025.

**Uncertainty Surrounds the Future of Energy Star and its Impact on Global Energy Savings**
There is uncertainty about the future of the Energy Star program, a voluntary initiative launched in 1992 by George H.W. Bush to promote energy efficiency in a wide range of products, including computers, monitors, printers, and household appliances. The program has been a symbol of energy and economic savings, with an estimated savings of five hundred billion dollars. However, the program's existence is threatened by the current Republican administration's plans to restructure the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which oversees the Energy Star program. The Trump administration's 'climate crusade' aimed to put an end to the program, and there are concerns that the Biden administration may also consider eliminating the certification or restructing the EPA. The gas industry, represented by the American Gas Association, has strongly opposed the updates to the Energy Star standards, which aim to reduce competition and promote electric options. The industry has expressed notable dissatisfaction with the program's changes.

**New Tax Bill Threatens U.S. Clean Energy Boom**
The latest budget reconciliation proposal in the U.S. House of Representatives would roll back federal clean energy tax incentives and overturn critical EPA programs, threatening the American-made energy boom and domestic manufacturing. According to Environmental Defense Fund, the draft legislation would repeal or prematurely phase out critical incentives for clean energy deployment, manufacturing, energy efficiency, and clean transportation, which have catalyzed more than $400 billion in private investment since 2022 and supported hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide. 'This draft pulls the rug out from under businesses and consumers alike,' said Joanna Slaney, Vice President for Political and Government Affairs at Environmental Defense Fund. 'It would increase energy costs, jeopardize jobs, block innovation and cede U.S. manufacturing leadership to other countries while inviting more pollution into our communities.' Independent analysis shows that fully repealing the tax incentives could raise household electricity bills by as much as 20% in some states by 2026.

**As Trump Administration Seeks to Shut Down Energy Star Program, Industry Groups Call to Save It - Inside Climate News**
The Trump administration is seeking to shut down the Energy Star program, a voluntary initiative that has encouraged energy savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions over the past 33 years. The program, launched in 1992, has saved an estimated $500 billion and achieved 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas reductions. Industry groups and manufacturers have expressed opposition to the decision, citing the program's effectiveness and the potential loss of the Energy Star brand as a marketing tool. Joseph Goffman, a former EPA official, believes the decision aligns with the Trump administration's ideology of hostility to government actions that help people. Steven Nadel, a close observer, said, 'I'm not sure they totally thought it through.' The Energy Star program has been a way to encourage, but not force, energy savings, and its elimination would likely be supplanted by initiatives that drive results counter to the goals of the administration. 'Eliminating it will not serve the American people,' the industry groups wrote in a letter to Zeldin. 'In fact, because the Energy Star brand is highly recognizable to consumers, it is likely that, should the program be eliminated, it will be supplanted by initiatives that drive results counter to the goals of this administration such as decreased features, functionality, performance, or increased costs.'

**EPA Extends Submission Dates for the PFAS Reporting Rule**
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has extended the submission deadlines for the PFAS Reporting Rule. The new deadlines are April 13, 2026, to October 13, 2026, and replace the previous deadline of July 11, 2025. The extension will allow the EPA to further develop and test the software used to collect data from manufacturers. According to the EPA, this will provide critical feedback, including guidance for the reporting community. The EPA is also considering reopening certain aspects of the original rule to public comment in the future, consistent with the Administration's deregulation agenda. The PFAS Reporting Rule requires companies to submit information on manufacturing, use, disposal, and environmental and health effects of PFAS, as well as conduct a diligent inquiry into the presence of PFAS at their facilities and supply chains. Many states are also imposing PFAS reporting requirements on manufacturers and marketers, and some are restricting or prohibiting the use of PFAS in various product categories.

**Hosemann advocates cautious budget approach in light of federal funding cuts - Meridian Star**
Mississippi Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann has called for a cautious budget approach in light of federal funding cuts. He stated, 'It's a difficult budget this year for two reasons. One, the positive part, which is we have been exceptionally productive.' The state has been paying down its debt, cutting income and grocery taxes, reducing the size of government, and increasing pay for teachers. However, these positive changes add complexity to the budgeting process. Hosemann emphasized the need to factor in federal spending cuts, which will impact approximately $350 to $390 million in federal funds. He said, 'We have challenges and we need to recognize, I think, and be prudent and conservative about next year.' The state government's budget will be from July 1 to June 30, 2026, and Hosemann anticipates further federal cuts. He suggested prioritizing expenses, paying state employees, and maintaining assets, followed by spending to make the government effective and paying down debt. Any remaining funds can be put toward local projects. Hosemann acknowledged the need for federal spending cuts, citing the national debt of over $36 trillion and a spending deficit of more than $1 trillion.

**Column | How you can shop for money-saving appliances if Trump ends Energy Star**
The Energy Star program, which has been a huge success in saving American families about $450 annually, may be eliminated by the Trump administration. The program, which has been in place for about three decades, has shaved an estimated $500 billion off Americans' utility bills and prevented 4 billion metric tons of emissions. Christine Egan, head of CLASP, said 'It has brand recognition and consumer trust that only Santa Claus can compete with.' Without Energy Star, consumers will have to pay more and work harder to identify which appliances will use the least energy and save the most money. Researchers and policy experts suggest that consumers can DIY something like Energy Star by looking at federal minimum efficiency standards, EnergyGuide, or asking appliance retailers for their most efficient equipment. However, Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator, doubted that any nonprofit or industry group has the expertise, credibility, or funding needed to oversee Energy Star, and saving the program will probably require Congress.

**US Government Plans to End 'Energy Star' Program, Industry and Environmental Groups Protest**
The US government plans to stop the 'Energy Star' program, which has been in place for over 30 years and indicates that a product is energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. The program, which is voluntary, has been criticized by both environmental groups and industry associations. The 'Energy Star' label was introduced in 1992 and is awarded to products that meet the standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. However, the agency does not verify the claims made by manufacturers, and anyone can apply for the label. Despite this, the program has led to more energy-efficient products and has saved US consumers an estimated $500 billion in electricity costs over the past 33 years, according to Ars Technica. The program is now under threat due to the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Steven Nadel, director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said, 'I'm not sure if they've thought it through.' Joseph Goffman, a former EPA official, believes the plans are well-thought-out, saying, 'I think we're seeing a conclusion of this administration's ideology: a decided hostility towards anything the government does to help people.' Industry associations and the US Chamber of Commerce have also criticized the move, saying the Energy Star program is 'a model for a successful non-regulatory program and a partnership between the government and the private sector.' Environmental groups have also spoken out against the plan, with Paula Glover, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, saying, 'The elimination of the Energy Star program would directly contradict the promise of the government to lower household energy costs.'

**Trump Administration Plans to Eliminate Energy Star Program**
The Trump administration plans to eliminate the Energy Star program, a state-run initiative that helps identify energy-efficient household appliances. This decision could lead to increased electricity bills, despite the president's promise to lower them. Energy Star, launched in 1992, allows consumers to easily identify energy-efficient products, such as refrigerators, washing machines, and computers. According to internal sources, the program will be phased out in the coming months as part of a major EPA restructuring. The program's effectiveness is evident, with official figures showing that it saves consumers $40 billion annually, while costing only $32 million per year. Over 30 years, it has saved consumers over $500 billion. The decision has sparked widespread criticism, with over 1,000 companies, cities, and associations, including Samsung and the city of Seattle, writing to the EPA to defend the program. Even some Republican senators have expressed their support for Energy Star. Trump has promised to lower energy prices, but eliminating the program would also remove a valuable tool for helping households consume less energy. Officially, the administration aims to reduce EPA spending and 'recenter' its missions, with a goal of saving $300 million per year by 2026. However, many believe that this decision is primarily ideological and could have severe long-term consequences for families.

**EPA is reportedly killing Energy Star program**
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to eliminate the Energy Star program, a popular initiative that has saved consumers and businesses over $500 billion in energy costs since its launch in 1992. According to EPA Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection Paul Gunning, the office is being dissolved and the Energy Star program is being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' This decision has been met with criticism from lawmakers, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who argue that the program is essential for consumers to make informed decisions about energy-efficient appliances. In contrast, EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou claims that the reorganization will 'directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission.'

**Utility bills could rise as Trump's EPA to end Energy Star program, experts warn**
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to end the Energy Star program, which has certified energy efficiency on home appliances for over 30 years. Experts warn that this could lead to higher energy bills for US customers. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said, 'If you wanted to raise families' energy bills, getting rid of the Energy Star label would be a pretty good way.' Hundreds of companies and groups signed a letter urging the EPA to maintain the program, citing its popularity with consumers and manufacturers. The plans to close the program come amid reports of wider agency cuts and the dissolution of the EPA's office of atmospheric protection and the office of air quality planning and standards. Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen said ending the program would raise costs for consumers and benefit billionaires and utility companies.

The Trump administration plans to eliminate the 33-year-old Energy Star program, which has helped American consumers save over $500 billion in energy costs. The plan was announced at an Environmental Protection Agency meeting, where a chart marked the program for closure as part of a reorganization effort. The EPA said it is reorganizing the agency to 'Power the Great American Comeback,' but did not specifically mention the Energy Star program. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse called the move 'economic sabotage,' saying it will force Americans to buy appliances that cost more to run and waste more energy. The Energy Star program has helped prevent 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and has about $100 billion's worth of appliances bearing the Energy Star sticker sold each year.

**Report: Feds Are Killing Off Energy Star**
The Trump administration is reportedly planning to kill off the Energy Star program, a public-private partnership that certifies energy-efficient appliances and has saved consumers and businesses over $500 billion since its introduction in 1992. According to sources, the program will be eliminated as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Atmospheric Protection, which will be dissolved. Paul Gunning, the office's director, stated during an all-hands meeting that the Energy Star program and other climate work would be 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Critics, including Ben Evans from the US Green Building Council, argue that this would be 'incredibly shortsighted,' as the program saves consumers and businesses over $40 billion annually at a cost of just $32 million. Trade groups and companies have urged EPA chief Lee Zeldin to protect the program, calling it an 'effective non-regulatory program and partnership between the government and the private sector.'

**Shake-up at EPA threatens Energy Star, climate offices**
The Trump administration has proposed a reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that targets divisions housing climate change offices and Energy Star, a program designed to help lower energy costs for American households. The proposal, which aims to 'Power the Great American Comeback,' would eliminate Energy Star, a program that has saved $500 billion in energy costs over the past 30 years, according to Senator Ed Markey. The reorganization could also compromise other critical programs within the Office of Air and Radiation, such as monitoring trends in air pollution and providing energy resources to state and local governments. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the restructuring would bring the agency down to Reagan-era staffing levels, saving $300 million a year by 2026. However, critics argue that the cuts would roll back the U.S. fight against climate change and harm American families and businesses.

**Trump admin plans to shut down money-saving Energy Star program soon, sources say | CNN**
The Trump administration is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a public-private partnership that certifies energy-efficient appliances and helps consumers save money on energy-efficient products. According to sources, the agency is also planning to close its climate change division and climate protection partnership division. The Energy Star program, which was implemented in 1992, is 'nearly universally supported' by manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, said Joe Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under Biden. The program's certifications for appliances will likely stop, but the exact timeline is unclear. The changes are part of broader division closures within EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, which could represent a major blow for official government measuring of US fossil fuel emissions. 'With this action, EPA is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback,' said an EPA spokesperson. However, a spokesperson for Energy Star did not return CNN's request for comment. 'Energy Star ratings of appliances and electronics have been part of tens of millions of American households' purchases,' Goffman said, adding that energy performance ratings are now a built-in part of consumer shopping decisions.

**EPA Announces Major Shift in Enforcement Priorities for Energy Sector**
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a significant shift in enforcement priorities for the energy sector. According to a memorandum issued on March 12, 2025, the EPA will no longer take enforcement action that could shut down energy production or power generation unless there is an imminent threat to human health or a statutory requirement. The agency will also prioritize enforcement related to coal ash at active coal-fired power plants, focusing on imminent threats to human health. Additionally, the EPA will no longer prioritize enforcement related to methane emissions from oil and gas facilities, and any existing orders or settlements will require additional approval. The shift in enforcement strategy aims to promote energy sector growth, but considerable uncertainty remains as to its effectiveness.
