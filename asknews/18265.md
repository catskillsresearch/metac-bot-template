**The Rise of Mini-Companies: Can AI Replace Human Employees?**
Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, predicts that the first company to reach a valuation of over $1 billion with a single employee will emerge by 2026. This prophecy is backed by a handful of startups that are growing rapidly in revenue. The Y Combinator's first quarter 2025 promotion shows a 10% weekly growth rate, according to its director Garry Tan. In this cohort, 81% of the companies are related to artificial intelligence, and only 11% are focused on physical objects. Midjourney, an image editing platform, has reportedly reached $500 million in revenue without external capital, while Anysphere, the editor of the programming assistant Cursor, has reached $300 million. However, this hypergrowth is not always a guarantee of sustainability, as the market for AI tools is becoming increasingly saturated, leading to high churn rates. Additionally, the reliance on sophisticated language models from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can be costly, and there is a risk that these giants may try to compete with these startups.

**Open AI's $6.5 Billion Bet on KI Wearables: What's at Stake?**
Open AI has invested $6.5 billion in the development of KI devices, such as smart glasses and wearables, to track people's lives in real-time. Apple, Amazon, Google, and Meta are also investing in similar technologies. According to Christian Moser, a partner at Zühlke, Open AI's collaboration with Jony Ive is focused on developing KI devices that can understand the context of users. Moser notes that Google has integrated its Gemini AI into the Android system, while Meta is developing smart glasses with Ray-Ban. Amazon is also working on smart glasses with Alexa voice control. Apple is expected to launch a digital glasses product later this year, with smaller, more practical KI wearables to follow. Microsoft is taking a different approach, integrating its KI co-pilot into popular programs like Outlook, Word, and Teams. Nathaly Tschanz, a lecturer at the University of Lucerne, notes that Open AI's acquisition of IO is likely aimed at understanding users' context and reducing dependence on platforms like Apple or Google. Tschanz also highlights the potential risks of KI devices, such as ambient computing, which could lead to a loss of privacy. Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity, has stated that the company aims to collect as much data as possible to sell premium ads. Tschanz notes that young people are increasingly comfortable with sharing data for convenience, and may even view KI devices as a form of therapy. However, she also warns that this trend could lead to a loss of privacy and a lack of control over personal data. The development of intelligent glasses and wearables is accelerating, with all major tech companies investing in this area. According to Tschanz, the key to success lies in creating devices that are both functional and stylish, with Jony Ive's design expertise being a major asset for Open AI.

**AI Drives Demand for Computing Power: McKinsey Estimates 6.7 Trillion Dollars by 2030**
According to McKinsey, the global demand for data center capacity is expected to almost triple by 2030, reaching 6.7 trillion dollars. 70% of this demand will be attributed to AI, while the remaining 30% will be for traditional IT applications. McKinsey presents three scenarios for the evolution of computing power demand by 2030: Scenario accelerated: 205 GW of additional AI capacity between 2025 and 2030, with a total of 7.9 trillion dollars in capital investments. Scenario intermediate (based on the report): 125 GW additional in the same period, for 5.2 trillion dollars. Scenario contained: 78 GW additional by 2030, with a total demand of 3.7 trillion dollars. The predictions take into account two main uncertainties: AI use cases. The value of AI lies in its application level—i.e., the ability of companies to transform it into concrete impacts on business. If companies fail to generate real value, the demand for computing power may be lower than expected. On the other hand, transformative applications could fuel a higher demand than current predictions, with a reduction in training costs of around 18 times and inference costs of around 36 times compared to GPT-4. 15% of investments (800 billion) will be allocated to builders, for land, materials, and site development. An additional 25% (1.3 trillion) will be allocated to operators. Despite the expected demands, the analysis highlights that current investment levels remain below demand. In dozens of interviews with CEOs, it emerged that many leaders hesitate to invest maximally in computing capacity due to limited visibility on demand evolution, uncertainty on AI adoption rate, and long project implementation times. To guide strategic decisions and investments, companies can be classified into five main archetypes, each with a specific role in the AI infrastructure ecosystem: Builder: real estate developers, design firms, and construction companies involved in expanding data center capacity. Energizer: utilities, energy providers, cooling system and electrical equipment manufacturers, and telecommunications operators. Technology Developers and Designers: semiconductor companies and IT suppliers that produce chips and computational hardware. Operators: hyperscalers, colocation providers, GPU-as-a-service platforms, and companies that optimize their computational resources. AI Architect: AI model developers, foundation model providers, and companies that build proprietary AI capabilities.

**Tech Giants Plan to Invest Up to $320 Billion in AI in 2025**
Tech giants are planning to invest up to $320 billion in AI technologies and expanding data centers in 2025, according to comments from their CEOs during recent earnings calls. This represents a significant increase from $230 billion in capital expenditures in 2024, reflecting the intense competition among these companies to enhance their infrastructure and gain a larger share of the AI market. Since the launch of 'Chat GPT' in 2022, tech companies have poured billions of dollars into AI projects, including expanding data centers using massive amounts of NVIDIA GPUs, developing more advanced AI models, but the rise of Chinese company 'DeepMind' has sent a shockwave through the industry, with estimates suggesting that the cost of building its open-source tools was significantly lower compared to some of its American competitors. The CEOs of these tech companies are facing questions from investors about the need for such massive investments and whether they are necessary or excessive. Despite this, the companies have confirmed that they will not slow down their investments in AI. Amazon plans to invest over $100 billion in 2025, an increase from $83 billion in 2024, with most of this money going towards developing AI technologies in its 'Web Services' division, described by CEO Andy Jassy as 'a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'. Microsoft has announced that it will allocate $80 billion in its fiscal year 2025 to build data centers dedicated to AI workloads, with over 50% of this amount to be spent within the US, according to CEO Brad Smith. Alphabet targets $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, with expectations of spending between $16 and $18 billion in the first quarter of this year alone, with most of this money going towards 'technical infrastructure, particularly servers, followed by data center construction and network expansion'. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has set a budget of $60-65 billion for AI investments in 2025, describing the year as 'a critical year for AI', and in a Facebook post said that these investments will help 'unlock historic innovation and boost American technological leadership'. Apple's AI spending is difficult to measure, as it often appears in operating expenses, and the company relies on cloud providers to rent capacity for training its models, for example, models supporting 'Apple Intelligence' were trained on 'Google Cloud', as well as renting cloud capacity from 'AWS' and 'Azure'. Apple's CEO Tim Cook said in last year's earnings call, 'When it comes to capital expenditures, it's worth remembering that we're taking a hybrid approach, doing some things internally, while collaborating with external partners, making the spending appear in their financials rather than ours'. Tesla has reported that its AI-related capital expenditures were around $5 billion in 2024, out of a total of $11.34 billion, and expects its AI spending to remain stable in 2025. Tesla is currently building a 'training group' called 'Cortex' at its Texas facility, which will be used to train models for its autonomous driving and humanoid robots that are still in development. NVIDIA will not announce its results until later this month, and its capital expenditures are expected to be significantly different, as NVIDIA is the company that develops and provides AI technology rather than buying it. The customers are demanding more, and Amazon, Google, and Microsoft's AI spending is high, but it is expected to lead to significant benefits for their cloud businesses, which are key growth drivers. In the fourth quarter of last year, cloud numbers were weaker than expected, as the three companies failed to meet consensus estimates, and the main reason was a shortage of supplies. In Microsoft, the AI side of Azure was better than expected, but outside of AI, Azure fell short of internal expectations due to disappointing sales to customers through partners, according to CFO Amy Hood in the earnings call. Hood said that Microsoft is working on revamping its sales approach when it comes to balancing AI with traditional IT operations.

Despite the recent breakthrough by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which claimed to have created a competitive AI model at minimal cost, the companies are committed to maintaining their competitive edge in AI. Microsoft plans to invest $80 billion in expanding its Azure cloud platform, while Meta aims to invest 'hundreds of billions' of dollars in the long term, in addition to the $40 billion invested in 2024. Google plans to increase its investments to $75 billion in 2025, a 42% increase from last year's $53 billion. Amazon plans to invest over $100 billion in developing its infrastructure, mainly for expanding Amazon Web Services. The combined capital expenditures of these companies reached $246 billion in 2024, a 63% increase from the previous year. The investments are expected to exceed $320 billion in 2025. The success of DeepSeek has raised questions about the need for such massive investments by tech giants. However, the companies continue to actively invest in building data centers, acquiring specialized chips, and developing advanced language models to integrate AI into all aspects of their products and services.
