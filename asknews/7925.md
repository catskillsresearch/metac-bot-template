**Children Born in October to December Tend to Have Higher Intelligence, Study Finds**
A study by Harvard University found that children born in a specific time of the year tend to develop higher intelligence than others. The researchers followed the development of a large number of children from infancy to age 7 and found that those born between October and December tend to score higher in cognitive and intelligence tests. The phenomenon has been dubbed 'meses inteligentes' (intelligent months) by the researchers, who attribute it to the exceptional abilities of babies born in this period, such as problem-solving, learning, and analytical thinking. According to the study, children born in this period tend to develop skills such as adaptability, perseverance, and creativity, as well as exceptional social skills, as they have to work harder to make friends and keep up with their peers in school.

**China Accuses US of Violating Geneva Agreement**
China's Ministry of Commerce stated that the US's decision to impose export controls on artificial intelligence chips, ban the sale of software used in chip design to China, and cancel some Chinese students' visas, violates the agreement reached by the two countries' leaders during a phone call on January 17. The statement emphasized that these measures harm China's legitimate rights and interests. It also stated that the US is 'provoking new economic and trade frictions, exacerbating the uncertainty and instability in bilateral relations.' This comes after US President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs on trade partners, including China, on April 2. The trade dispute between the two countries escalated, with the US imposing a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and China imposing a 125% tariff on US goods. However, after negotiations, it was agreed that the US would reduce its tariff on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% and China would reduce its tariff on US goods from 125% to 10%, effective May 14. US President Donald Trump accused China of violating the majority of the agreement reached in Geneva, stating that he would discuss this with Chinese President Xi Jinping and hopes for a resolution.

**China Accuses US of 'Undermining' Commercial Truce**
China has responded to Donald Trump's accusations by accusing the US of 'undermining' the commercial truce. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the US has introduced a series of 'discriminatory and restrictive measures against China' that 'seriously undermine' the agreement. These measures include export controls on artificial intelligence chips, the suspension of the sale of chip design software to China, and plans to revoke Chinese student visas. The ministry stated, 'Instead of reflecting on their own actions, the US has falsely accused China of violating the consensus, which constitutes a grave distortion of the facts.' China has rejected these 'baseless' accusations. The ministry has called on the US to 'immediately correct its erroneous practices' and has promised to take 'firm and decisive measures' if Washington continues to act unilaterally and harm China's interests. This is the second consecutive day that China has criticized the US for its accusations against Beijing. China has also condemned the speech by Hegseth, who called on regional Indo-Pacific allies to increase their defense spending in response to what he sees as an 'imminent' threat from China to the democratic and self-governing island of Taiwan. Hegseth stated, 'It should be clear to all that Beijing is preparing in a credible way to use military force and alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.' China has described Hegseth's comments as 'provocative and intended to sow discord.' The US Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, stated on Sunday that China was 'retaining' exports of rare earths that it had committed to releasing as part of the commercial truce.

**US-China Trade Conflict Escalates: China Cites New AI Restrictions**
The US-China trade conflict has escalated again, with both sides making new accusations. The Chinese government has expressed concern over new restrictions on artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the US has 'continuously issued discriminatory restrictions against China' since the Geneva agreement in late March. Specifically, China mentioned restrictions on the sale of AI chips and chip design software to China, as well as the US's plan to cancel visas for Chinese students. This development has put the temporary trade agreement between the two countries at risk.

**Shenyang Kindergarten's Innovative Approach to Physical Development**
The first 'Cloud Ladder Crossing' competition was held at the Shenyang City Huanan District Ninth Elementary School's kindergarten, where 142 children from the big class were able to 'cross' an average of 131 rungs, with the highest reaching 566 rungs, equivalent to 'walking' 232 meters on the cloud ladder, surpassing the standard level of adults. The children's impressive performance was achieved through a series of games and courses designed to awaken their physical potential. 'The 3-6 year-old age group is a critical period for the development of children's muscles and bones,' said Hou Mingfei, the general manager of the Huanan Ninth Elementary School Education Group. 'Our kindergarten has been using games like the cloud ladder crossing, single bar suspension, and ring chain to gradually improve the children's upper limb strength and coordination, and the results have been positive.' The kindergarten has 12 classes, and each class has a single bar for the children to practice their grip strength. 'We start with hand and foot exercises to promote the children's physical development,' said teacher Lyu Jing. 'We record the suspension time for each child and evaluate their grip strength.' The annual ring chain competition has become a regular event, with the children creating a record of 480 consecutive rings. 'We had to carry him down because he was still enthusiastic,' said Hou Mingfei. The design of the ring chain project is based on the growth rule of prioritizing the development of children's upper limb strength, laying a foundation for their self-protection ability, physical coordination, spinal development, and intelligence development.

**Half of Students at Chiba High School are Chinese: A Coincidence of Needs**
A high school in Chiba Prefecture, Japan has seen a surge in international students, with over half of its 100 students being from China. The school's administration has set aside a quota for international students to ensure a stable student body, while also providing a free and flexible education environment that Chinese students are seeking. According to Ando, the school's director, they receive requests from brokers to accept 'tens of students' from China. The school conducts entrance exams and interviews to ensure that the ratio of international students does not exceed 50%. The school aims to provide a Japanese language environment and cultural experience for its students, and many of them are planning to work in Japan after graduation. As one student, Lin Jiaqing, said, 'I wanted to escape the intense competition in China's education system, where students are forced to study for long hours. I wanted to experience a more relaxed and free education in Japan.' Another student, Li Xinyin, said, 'I want to become a character designer in Japan, but the competition in China is too fierce. I hope to achieve my dream in Japan.'

**Hong Kong's first baby giant pandas named**
The first giant pandas born in Hong Kong, affectionately known as 'Elder Sister' and 'Little Brother,' have been officially named Jia Jia and De De. The names were chosen from over 35,700 entries in a naming contest and reflect the Chinese characters for 'support and family' and 'to succeed,' respectively. Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the names were chosen to follow tradition and incorporate Mandarin pronunciation. The cubs, who live with their mom, have attracted large crowds and raised hopes for a tourism boost in the city. According to Pong, the park recorded a nearly 40% growth in visitor flow and 40% increase in overall income during a recent holiday in mainland China, and hopes to continue this growth momentum through the summer, Halloween, and Christmas seasons.

**Looming Demographic Crisis in China: Repercussions of the CCP’s One-Child Policy - PML Daily**
China's birth rate remains low, with 9.54 million babies born in 2024, a slight increase from 9.02 million in 2023. However, young Chinese are increasingly treating pets as if they were their babies, with a booming industry catering to 'fur babies.' This trend raises questions about China's future: Is money the main obstacle to having children, or are deeper cultural and lifestyle changes reshaping what family means in modern China? The wealthier regions do not necessarily see more childbirths, and the economy is not the sole factor. Instead, cultural and traditional beliefs play a significant role. For instance, in Shanghai, a relatively economically affluent province, the birth rate is low due to the cultural belief that having large families is a sign of prosperity. In contrast, in remote Tibet, the birth rate is higher due to traditional beliefs. The trend of treating pets as babies is not limited to basic necessities but extends to luxury items and services. Pet owners are willing to spend money on high-end products and services, such as custom-designed pet outfits, pet spa treatments, and professional photoshoots. This shift in spending priorities raises questions about changing values in Chinese society. As young people increasingly refer to themselves as 'dog parents' and 'cat parents,' they're redefining what family means in contemporary China. Different from the parents' generation, where starting a family was a must, for modern China's generation, family formation is increasingly a choice rather than an expectation. The rise of pet parenting speaks to changing emotional needs in a fast-paced, often isolating urban environment. 'People are very willing to spend money on pets, especially Shanghai residents,' says Zang Shuo, a fashion design graduate who pivoted from human couture to pet clothing. 'They basically all take their pets out in little strollers, and every season they travel with their dogs. There are almost no 'naked dogs' here — they all wear clothes.'

**Rogue Scientist Who Gene-Hacked Human Babies Gear Up for More Human Experiments**
He Jiankui, the Chinese scientist who created HIV-resistant designer babies, is planning to conduct human gene-editing research to prevent Alzheimer's disease. He wants to conduct trials in South Africa, where the government has expressed openness to genetic editing. Before that, he plans to send colleagues to the US to conduct trials on mice and monkeys. He declined to reveal his financial backers and has no affiliations with academic institutions. His reputation as 'China's Frankenstein' has followed him since his release from prison last year. He claims that ethics are 'holding back' science and that 'health is the universal human right.' He is inspired by his mother's Alzheimer's disease and wants to mimic a genetic mutation found in Icelanders that protects them against the disease. He claims that the children born from his previous experiments are healthy, and he will only apologize if they have any health issues.

**Beijing Launches First Artificial Intelligence Pediatrician System in China**
Beijing has launched the first 'Artificial Intelligence Pediatrician' system in China, designed to assist doctors in clinical research, diagnosis, and treatment of rare and complex diseases. According to the China Central Television, the system showed remarkable effectiveness in its participation with experts in evaluating the cases of 10 sick children, providing treatment recommendations consistent with the decisions of the specialized medical team, and adding precise notes based on specific indicators from patient reports. Dr. Ni Sheng, Director of the National Center for Pediatric Medicine, said, 'We developed this system to establish the 'System of the Two Doctors' that combines the experience of human doctors with the capabilities of artificial intelligence as a tool to assist the medical team.' The system is based on a massive knowledge base that includes the experiences of over 300 specialist doctors and high-quality medical records spanning decades, ensuring the accuracy of diagnosis and the reliability of treatment recommendations. This development comes as part of China's efforts to harness artificial intelligence technologies to improve healthcare services and enhance the capabilities of doctors in the face of complex medical challenges.

**Designing babies**
In 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui sparked international outrage by editing the genes of human embryos using CRISPR, resulting in the birth of two girls with edited genomes. He was later sentenced to three years in prison for the illegal practice of medicine. The incident raised concerns about the ethics of germline editing, which involves making permanent changes to an embryo's DNA that can be passed on to future generations. Some argue that germline editing could be used to prevent genetic diseases, while others worry that it could lead to 'designer babies' and exacerbate existing inequalities. A recent paper in Nature discussed the potential benefits of polygenic embryo editing, which involves making multiple edits to an embryo's DNA. However, experts warn that the risks and unknowns associated with germline editing are significant, and that it may not be safe or effective. A less ethically fraught option, in utero genome editing, is being explored, which involves making edits to a fetus's DNA after it has developed but before birth. Early results have been encouraging, and this approach may offer a way to treat genetic diseases before they become more difficult to treat after birth. Despite the controversy surrounding germline editing, some scientists believe that it will continue to be pursued by rogue researchers and wealthy patrons, potentially leading to the creation of 'designer babies'.

**The Challenges of Computer Design and the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
The field of computer design has many specialties, and one of them is computer design, which includes all types of computers, from small devices used in the Internet of Things to supercomputers. The designer of a computer must consider several factors, including speed, moderate energy consumption, few faults, difficulty of hacking, and cost. Nico Schlotterbeck, a 24-year-old center-back for Borussia Dortmund, has not been selected for the German national team since Julian Nagelsmann became the coach. Nagelsmann has called for more consistency and fewer errors from Schlotterbeck. The recent performance of Borussia Dortmund, such as their 4-2 victory against Atlético Madrid, contrasts with the unreliable Wi-Fi in the press area of Signal Iduna Park during the game, which failed every two minutes. Consistency is a key theme around Dortmund, a term now more relevant than the previously discussed 'mentality', which was thought to be lacking. The field of computer design faces significant challenges in the current era. With the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) software, there is a high demand for more powerful computers, but designing and building these computers has become more difficult due to technical reasons. The development of AI software requires the collaboration of researchers from various fields, including computer science, engineering, physics, mathematics, and philosophy. The spread of AI on a popular level is due to two factors: the widespread use of AI in various aspects of life and the spread of social media platforms, which has made people exchange news about this technology, whether true or exaggerated. The competition between the United States and China in the field of AI is complex and multifaceted. The US has a strong advantage in terms of the availability of data, the presence of supercomputers, and the presence of large companies that conduct research and develop AI software. However, China has a more centralized government, which allows for greater coordination and cooperation among companies, giving it an advantage in this area. The Chinese AI program, DeepSeek, has been compared to the American program, chatGPT, and has been found to have similar capabilities, but at a lower cost. The Chinese program has been found to be more effective in certain areas, such as programming and logical thinking. The competition between the US and China in the field of AI is expected to continue, with both countries investing heavily in research and development. The Arab countries need three things to become a major player in the global technology scene: money to acquire technology, train on its use, and develop it; the ability to retain talent in technological fields; and a scientific policy that is implemented for at least ten years, with regular reviews.

**Pioneer of nuclear submarines passes away at 99**
Huang Xuhua, the chief designer of China's first-generation nuclear submarines, passed away at 99 in Wuhan, Hubei province. Born in 1926, Huang joined the Communist Party of China in 1949 and started his career in China's shipbuilding industry. He led the research and development of China's first nuclear-powered submarines, the Type 09I and Type 09II, despite facing significant challenges, including a lack of technical knowledge and resources. Huang and his team used abacuses and rulers to solve problems and relied on manual calculations. Their efforts paid off in 1970, when China built its first nuclear-powered submarine, becoming the fifth nation to have such technology. Huang's contributions were recognized with the Medal of the Republic, China's highest honor, in 2019. As late as his 90s, Huang continued to work and counsel young researchers, leaving behind a legacy in China's shipbuilding industry.
