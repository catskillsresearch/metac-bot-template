**Countdown to 2030: Achieving global targets on disaster displacement**
A new report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) reveals that disasters triggered 264.8 million forced movements of people across 210 countries and territories between 2015 and 2024. In 2024 alone, disasters forced people to flee their homes nearly 45.8 million times, the highest annual figure on record. IDMC director Alexandra Bilak said, 'Disaster displacement is not a future problem. It's happening now, it's happening more often, and it can happen anywhere, although it is hitting the poorest the hardest.' The report highlights that while climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense, lack of preparedness, inadequate infrastructure, and high exposure to risks are also major factors in disaster displacement. The IDMC warns that displacement risk is likely to grow, with 100 million people globally at risk of internal displacement caused by disasters in any given year under a pessimistic warming scenario. Bilak added, 'Our window to act is closing. It's time to turn what we've learned from the data into political solutions and financial commitments.'

**2025 Peace Report: The NATO on the Brink of Collapse?**
The 2025 Peace Report highlights a worsening global security situation and a lack of prospects for a turnaround. The report focuses on the US, where the Trump administration has transformed the country into an authoritarian regime, according to Christopher Daase from the Leibniz Institute for Peace and Conflict Research. Daase states, 'Trump and his administration have successfully transformed the oldest democracy in the world into an authoritarian regime in a short time.' The report also notes that the number of global conflict-related deaths has reached a record high, with over 122 million people displaced worldwide. The authors of the report, four leading German peace and conflict research institutes, call for Europe to invest more in its own security and to develop a European pillar of the NATO. However, they see little future for the transatlantic defense alliance as we know it, with the common value base with the US administration being 'long gone,' according to Daase. The report also criticizes the Israeli government's actions in Gaza, stating that they violate international law on a 'massive' scale. The authors call for the German government to reposition itself on the issue and to support a more critical stance towards Israel.

**UK 'must prepare for conflict to deter conflict,' says British premier**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned that Britain must prepare for the possibility of conflict to deter it, as he unveiled his government's defense spending review and outlined plans for a new generation of attack submarines. According to Starmer, 'if you want to deter conflict, then the best way to do that is to prepare for conflict.' The new defense spending plans include proposals for up to 12 new attack submarines, which will support 30,000 highly skilled jobs into the 2030s. Starmer emphasized the importance of the UK's role in NATO, saying 'NATO has been the single most effective alliance for keeping the peace for 80 years.' He also reaffirmed the government's support for Ukraine, calling its right to self-defense 'absolute.' The prime minister confirmed the government's commitment to increasing defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027/28, with the ambition to eventually reach 3% of GDP.

**Is Humanity Dead?**
The world is witnessing a sharp rise in armed conflicts and deaths, with over 200,000 people killed in 2022 alone. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the genocide in Gaza are two examples of devastating and unwinnable wars. The Gaza crisis is a symbol of moral collapse, with entire neighbourhoods flattened, families erased, and generations wiped out. The article argues that the global community has failed to act, with the media diluting the horror and institutions remaining paralysed. The writer calls for action, protest, and justice, and asks why Palestinian blood is treated as less sacred and their lives less worthy of outrage. The article concludes with a cry for humanity, urging the world to unite for justice, peace, and dignity.

**Over 120,000 Children Killed or Maimed in Conflicts Since 2005, Warns UN**
According to the United Nations (UN), more than 120,000 children have been killed or maimed in conflicts since 2005, while 473 million minors, 19% of the global child population, live in war-affected areas. The UN warns of a sustained increase in grave violations of children's rights. The number of children living in conflict zones has nearly doubled in the past three decades. In 2023, the UN documented 32,990 grave violations against 22,557 children, including killings, mutilations, forced recruitment, and sexual violence. Catherine Russell, UNICEF's executive director, stated, 'Children in war zones fight every day to survive. The world is failing these children.' Virginia Gamba, the UN's special representative, warned of the systematic use of torture and arbitrary detention against minors in conflict zones. Inger Ashing, from Save the Children, emphasized that the numbers will continue to rise unless urgent and coordinated measures are taken.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**Portnikov Predicts War to Continue Until 2032**
According to political observer Vasily Portnikov, the hot phase of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which typically lasts 7-10 years, may continue until 2032. After that, a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings may begin. Portnikov emphasized the need to prepare for a peaceful next phase of the conflict, which could last at least 10-15 years, by receiving help from the Americans and Europeans, improving Ukrainian policy and mobilization, and enhancing Ukraine's military-industrial complex. 'We need to prepare and prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective grounds for the war to end in the near future, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic situation and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he stressed.

**Portnikov Predicts War Will Last Until 2032**
According to political analyst Vitaliy Portnikov, the large-scale war between Russia and Ukraine may continue until 2032. He stated that the hot phase of the war, which has been ongoing for 7-10 years, will eventually give way to a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings. Portnikov emphasized the need to make efforts in the coming years to ensure that the next phase of the conflict is peaceful and lasts for at least 10-15 years. 'We need to prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict, very. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective preconditions for the war to end in the coming years, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic state and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he emphasized.

**UN says more than 36,000 civilians killed in conflicts in 2024, true toll 'likely far higher'**
The UN relief chief, Tom Fletcher, raised alarm over soaring civilian casualties in global conflicts, with over 36,000 civilians killed in 14 war zones in 2024. He warned that the real number is likely far higher and that the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law are unraveling. Fletcher also noted that the number of forcibly displaced people reached a new high of over 122 million, with most displaced within their own countries. He urged the Security Council to uphold legal protections and accountability, saying 'Some States tend to consider the law selectively, depending on the parties concerned or the interests at stake.' UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous warned that 'over 612 million women and girls are living in conflict zones,' and emphasized the urgent need for justice. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (ICRC) President Mirjana Spoljaric called for the defense of international humanitarian law, saying 'We face not only a crisis of compliance with the rules of war, but one of our collective conscience.' Janti Soeripto, head of Save the Children US, noted the unique vulnerability of children in war and said 'Children are not small adults.'

**Global conflicts reach highest level since WWII, data reveals**
According to the Global Peace Index, there were at least 56 active conflicts across 50 countries, with fewer conflicts being resolved, either militarily or through peace agreements. Clionadh Raleigh, the founder and director of ACLED, stated, 'The level of violence happening is certainly at one of its highs since the World War II.' Experts estimate that at least one in every six people is exposed to some level of conflict. The global death toll from armed conflict has increased significantly, with nearly 10.5 million fatalities between 2020 and 2024, compared to 953,000 between 2010 and 2019. The number of deaths dropped slightly in 2023, but rose again in 2024, with Europe, Africa, and Asia recording higher average death tolls over the past five years than at any other point since 1989. The Middle East, however, has not seen a significant increase in death tolls since the peak of the Syrian civil war. Raleigh explained that ACLED's data analysis includes factors such as dispersion, impact on civilians, and fragmentation, which can inform the severity of a crisis. The number of new armed groups in Myanmar has been estimated to be close to 3000 since 2021, and Gaza has been reported to be the 'most dangerous and violent place in the world in 2024'.

**Feasting on the Fallen**
The world is witnessing a rise in wars, terrorism, and cyberattacks, with a 25% increase in global political violence in 2024 compared to 2023. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) estimates that 2,23,000 people were killed in conflicts globally. The International Crisis Group has identified 10 current and potential wars in various regions, including Syria, Sudan, Ukraine, and European Security. The US is the largest military spender, accounting for 37% of global military spending, followed by China, Russia, Germany, and India. The US supplied major arms to 107 countries in 2024, with the top five arms importers being Ukraine, India, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. The global arms market is dominated by the US Military Industrial Complex, with the US emerging as the top supplier to 22 major arms importing countries. The world is also witnessing a surge in cyberattacks, with a 550% increase in web-based attacks in 2024. The US and Ukraine have signed a minerals deal, with the US agreeing to provide aid to Ukraine without demanding reimbursement. The deal gives the US preferential rights to mineral extraction in Ukraine and states that Kyiv will have the final say in what and where is being mined.

**Zhirinovsky Predicted Nuclear Conflict Between India and Pakistan in 2004**
In 2004, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the founder of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), predicted a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan. He stated that at least 200 million people would die in the conflict. Zhirinovsky also predicted that there would be over a billion refugees from Asia after the conflict. He believed this would happen within 20-30 years, which would be by 2034. The current escalation between India and Pakistan may lead to an armed conflict.

**The Aids crisis was set to end by 2030 - now Trump's cuts could mean 4 million deaths**
Donald Trump's cuts to foreign aid have derailed the projected end of the Aids pandemic, with new figures showing the number of Aids-related deaths could jump from six million to ten million in the next five years. The UN Aids agency (UNAIDS) forecasts that without funding, there will be 3.4 million more orphans, 600,000 more newborns infected with HIV, and a total of one million infant infections by 2030. Professor Francois Venter says, 'All the gains that we've seen over the last 20 years will start being steadily reversed.' The US-funded HIV programme, PEPFAR, has been severely disrupted, with some 35,000 estimated deaths linked to the freezes to HIV funding. UNAIDS data shows that by 2029, the number of Aids-related deaths could reach 1.6 million, three times higher than previous projections. Without PEPFAR services, the number of new annual infections will have doubled to 1.6 million by the end of this year. The UNAIDS projections are in the worst-case scenario, where the US-funded HIV programme is not reinstated and none of the work it currently funds is picked up by other donors or governments.

**US Think Tank Survey: Experts Fear Third World War in Next Ten Years**
A recent survey by the US think tank Atlantic Council has raised concerns about the possibility of a third world war in the next ten years. The survey, which polled experts from 47 countries, found that 40% of respondents believe a world war is likely to occur by 2035. The majority, 59.5%, disagreed, but the Atlantic Council still considers the findings 'alarming'. The survey, titled 'Global Foresight 2025', highlights the conflict between China and Taiwan as a particularly significant threat. As one expert noted, 'The conflict between China and Taiwan is a ticking time bomb that could lead to a global catastrophe.'

**Experts Warn of Imminent Third World War: 10-Year Forecast Predicts Global Chaos**
International relations experts believe that a Third World War is inevitable within the next 10 years. According to a survey of 357 political strategists and forecasters in the field of international relations, 4 out of 10 experts think that a major war involving major powers such as the US, China, or Russia will break out by 2035. The survey suggests that the war will likely involve nuclear weapons and space-based conflicts. Experts also point out that the US Space Force, established in 2019, could play a critical role in future war scenarios. Climate change is seen as the second biggest threat to the world, with 29.9% of respondents believing it will be the biggest threat by 2035. In contrast, 27.6% of respondents see a major war between global powers as a bigger threat. Only 1.7% of respondents believe that a new pandemic will threaten the global population, while 5.1% think that an economic crisis and debt burden will paralyze the world. The Atlantic Council, a think tank based in Washington, predicts that the world will become increasingly unstable economically and politically. 62% of respondents believe that the world will be worse off in 10 years, while only 38% expect improvement.

**Families Divided by War Find Hope in Acts of Faith in 2025**
In a world marked by 60 active wars, civilians face unprecedented levels of death and displacement. According to the World Economic Forum, armed conflicts have increased non-combatant fatalities by 30% in the last year. Religious organizations and local communities are emerging as support networks amidst the chaos, while global leaders fail to curb the violence. The Global Risk Report 2025 notes that conflicts have surpassed economic and environmental crises as the greatest threat to humanity. Regions such as the Sahel, Middle East, and parts of Asia are witnessing attacks on hospitals and schools, while arms trafficking fuels cycles of revenge. 'We're seeing children recruited as soldiers and entire villages erased from the map,' says a Red Cross volunteer in an interview with g1. In refugee camps, churches, mosques, and temples have become spaces of welcome. In Lebanon, Pastor Elias Haddad, who shelters 200 families in his parish, says that solidarity transcends religions: 'Here, Muslims and Christians share the same bread. War doesn't ask what you believe before destroying your home.' Initiatives like the 'Peace Network,' which connects religious leaders from 15 countries, aim to mediate local ceasefires. Behind the numbers are stories like that of Amina, a 32-year-old Syrian who lost her parents in a bombing and now cares for her younger brothers in a Turkish shelter. 'I pray that my brothers don't grow up with hatred in their hearts,' she says. Psychologists warn of a 'traumatized generation,' while NGOs denounce the lack of access to medicine and therapy in war zones. As governments discuss economic sanctions, civilians are building alternatives. In Colombia, former guerrillas and victims have created a cooperative agricultural project to revitalize rural communities. 'Peace is like a plantation: it requires patience and daily care,' reflects Carlos Márquez, one of the founders. For experts, popular pressure for diplomacy – and not arms – is the last hope to prevent 2025 from becoming the year of global rupture.

**Global Violence on the Rise: IISS Report 2024**
The 2024 report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) reveals a disturbing trend towards increased global violence. There are over 130 active armed conflicts worldwide, many of which are becoming more intractable and prolonged. The report highlights a 40% increase in total deaths and a 72% increase in civilian deaths from 2023 to 2024. The conflicts are becoming increasingly deadly, with a 20% annual increase in fatalities per event. The report also notes that the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance has nearly doubled, from 168 million in December 2023 to 300 million by the end of 2024. The report's author says, 'It is indispensable to look at the bigger picture. The world had significant advances in peace and institutions after World War II and the Cold War. What is happening now is that many of those arrangements are showing their exhaustion, partly due to internal factors and partly due to external factors, such as the actions of superpowers and various actors.' The report suggests that the world needs to work together to strengthen global institutions and launch global schemes to reverse the trends of violence and conflict.

**Telegram-канал «Мастер пера»: The Longer the Conflict, the Greater the Fear**
A recent survey found that 37% of Russians are concerned about the possibility of an uncontrollable and negative scenario in the ongoing geopolitical conflict, with this number increasing from 19% in 2021, the last peaceful year before the current events. As the conflict drags on, the level of fear among Russians is growing. However, daily life has somewhat stabilized, and concerns about personal safety have decreased, with only 43% of respondents now considering health concerns a major threat, down from previous years. The survey also found that fears of death and poverty remain stable and relatively low, indicating that the population has adapted to the new challenging conditions. Nevertheless, the current agenda includes working to overcome the remaining fears that still linger in the minds of Russians. However, this is a long-term project, and it's unclear whether it will be possible to achieve by 2030.
