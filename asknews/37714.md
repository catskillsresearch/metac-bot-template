**Reforestation Efforts Underway in Karabük After 2024 Forest Fire**
A 88-hectare area in Karabük's Ovacık district, which was damaged in a forest fire in August 2024, is being reforested as part of the 'Geleceğe Nefes Cumhuriyete Nefes' project. The reforestation efforts are expected to be completed by the end of the year. According to AK Party General Secretary Assistant and Karabük MP Cem Şahin, 'We are starting the reforestation work after cleaning up the area with the General Directorate of Forestry, as part of our 'Green Country' project initiated by our President. The 88-hectare area damaged in the forest fire in Ovacık district last year will be replanted with trees suitable for the soil type. The reforestation work will be completed by the end of the year. Thus, the burned forest area will be green again. We will not only breathe for the future, but also create a green homeland.' Şahin also stated that the damaged trees were sold to the economy, and that the entry ban to the forests in Karabük has been implemented due to the increased risk of forest fires in the summer months. He warned the citizens to be careful and cautious, saying 'Our forests are not only our own, but also the common heritage of future generations. It is the responsibility of all of us to protect each tree and every forest area. We expect everyone to be sensitive to the forest entry ban decision. Even the smallest negligence can lead to great disasters. I invite all my fellow citizens to be careful and cautious.'

**Evacuation Orders Lifted for Palisades Fire-Affected Area**
The evacuation orders for the area affected by the Palisades fire have been completely lifted, authorities announced on Sunday. The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) announced the final lifting of the order on Sunday at 1190 N. Piedra Morada Drive. According to a spokesperson for the LAFD, the order was maintained because the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other agencies monitoring air and soil quality, as well as hazardous debris, had recommended that people stay away from the area. However, it was also noted that people had already begun to return to the area before Sunday, ignoring the evacuation orders. Additionally, all traffic restrictions in the area have been lifted. The fire, which was fueled by historically strong winds, burned 23,448 acres and destroyed a significant portion of the exclusive coastal community, killing 12 people on January 7. The Pacific Coast Highway was largely closed to traffic after the fire, except for residents, first responders, and cleanup crews, but reopened to traffic on May 23. The Getty Villa, which has been closed since the fire invaded its property in January, will reopen to the public on June 27.

**Brazil's Burned Area Surpasses Historical Average in 2024**
According to a report by MapBiomas, approximately 30 million hectares of land were affected by fires in Brazil in 2024, which is 62% above the historical average of 18.5 million hectares burned per year. The data, obtained from satellite image mapping, showed that the fire action in the Brazilian territory concentrated between August and October, with 72% of the area burned in the country. The Brazilian Amazon recorded the largest area burned in the year, with approximately 15.6 million hectares burned, a value 117% higher than its historical average. Felipe Martenexen, coordinator of Amazon biome mapping at MapBiomas, stated, 'The fire is not a natural element of the ecological dynamics of Amazonian forests. The areas burned in 2024 are the result of human action, especially in a scenario aggravated by two consecutive years of severe drought.' He added, 'The combination of highly flammable vegetation, low humidity, and the use of fire created the perfect conditions for the propagation of the same on a large scale, leading to a historic record of burned area in the region.' The report also highlighted that a quarter (24%) of the Brazilian territory has burned at least once between 1985 and 2024, a period in which 206 million hectares were affected by fires with different intensities in each of the six Brazilian biomes. Additionally, in the last four decades, 69.5% of the burned area in the country's territory occurred in native vegetation (514 million hectares). However, in 2024, this percentage increased to 72.7% (21.8 million hectares).

**Brazilian Federal Police to Announce Operation Queimadas to Combat Wildfires**
The Brazilian Federal Police (PF) will announce this week the Operation Queimadas, aimed at monitoring and combating criminal fires in the Pantanal and Amazon biomes. The operation will have joint action poles installed in the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Acre, Rondônia, Amazonas, and Pará. According to the PF, the operation will intensify investigations, following a model adopted by the institution last year. The PF will provide details of the operation during the announcement to be made this week. The PF's actions against illegal deforestation and wildfires have resulted in a significant increase in police investigations, from 42 in 2023 to 130 in 2024. Additionally, the 272 operations carried out in 2024 by the PF's Amazon and Environment Department (Damaz/PF) resulted in the decapitalization of criminal organizations, valued at over R$ 2 billion. The operations also led to the issuance of 862 search and seizure warrants and 136 arrests, as well as the destruction of 978 machines and 675 draglines in the Amazon region. According to MapBiomas, over 30.8 million hectares were burned in Brazil between January and December 2024, an increase of 79% (or 13.6 million hectares) compared to 2023. The data from the Fire Monitor of the organization also shows that three-quarters of the burned area (73%) was native vegetation. The Amazon biome was the most affected, with 17.9 million hectares burned, representing more than half of the total area burned in Brazil in 2024 and an extension greater than the total burned in the country in 2023. The Cerrado biome registered 9.7 million hectares burned in the same period. Although the Pantanal was the least affected biome, the 1.9 million hectares affected by fires represented a 64% increase compared to the average of the last 6 years.

**'It's a miracle' no more than 13 homes have burned in fast-moving Pine View fire, Cox says**
Utah Governor Spencer Cox said 'it's a miracle' that no more than 13 homes have burned in the Pine View fire, which has ravaged parts of southern Utah's Pine Valley Mountains. Cox attributed the low number of destroyed homes to 'great work' and 'a little bit of luck, but I believe it's divine intervention as well.' He noted that 50-60 mph winds and dry conditions have given the fire 'voracity,' but brave firefighters have prevented it from spreading further. Cox also praised forest treatments such as grazing and logging that have protected some areas. He warned that extreme fire conditions and 90-degree days are expected in the state, and urged people to be safe and follow evacuation orders. The fire remains 0% contained and has burned 5,660 acres. Cox asked people to pray for rain next week and noted that the fire was caused by lightning about 10 days ago. He also warned that 2025 could end up like other bad fire years in Utah, such as 2012, when almost half a million acres burned across the state.

**The woman who fought giant wildfires and became a hotshot - Kathleen Schuster**
Kathleen Schuster, a woman who fought giant wildfires, became a hotshot. She and her crew, including Ramsey, drove six hours to reach the 'August Complex' fire, which had burned through one million acres. The crew had to be vigilant due to the arid conditions, as an accidental fire start could add another 50,000 acres to the inferno. Ramsey recalled the experience, saying, 'I knew it was coming. We all knew it was coming. Almost every crew in California was getting called to this fire at some point.' The crew saw towering trees resembling charred matchsticks and flames that turned the heads of even the most seasoned crew members, leaving them with a feeling of 'Oh my God.'

**The Future Of Fighting And Preventing Forest Fires : 1A**
Forest fires have been a natural part of the landscape for millennia, but climate change is making them bigger and more destructive. Last year, wildfires consumed 8.9 million acres across the U.S., with the LA County fires in January being the costliest so far, estimated to be around $250 billion in damages. According to experts, adapting to living with massive fires and finding effective ways to fight and prevent them is crucial. As Smokey the Bear's message has evolved over the years, it's clear that the approach to forest fires needs to change to address the growing threat of climate change.

**Wildfire forecast: Drought & above average temperatures lead to significant wildfire threat for U.S. West Coast this summer**
The US West Coast is facing a significant wildfire threat this summer due to drought and above-average temperatures. Last year, nearly 9 million acres were burned, and the Southwest saw the most damaging fires. Already in 2025, wildfires have ravaged parts of the US, including the Los Angeles fires in January, which burned 50,000 acres and killed 30 people. The long-range weather outlooks show all 50 states with above-normal temperatures for the summer, with the East Coast expected to have above-normal rainfall and the Southwest forecast to get drought relief. However, intensifying drought is expected to enhance wildfire risk in central Oklahoma and Texas throughout the summer, and dry conditions will increase wildfire risk in Hawaii starting in July. In Canada, the wildfire season saw over 5 million hectares burned in 2024, and much of the country is seeing 'conditions not favorable to support significant wildland fire activity' this year. Europe experienced a typical wildfire season in 2024, but dry or drought conditions are occurring over much of northern and eastern Europe, and the forecast for the summer calls for above-normal temperatures and dryness in central and southern Europe.

**2025 "Blessing or Curse**
The year 2025 has been marked by devastating natural disasters and conflicts. In January, a series of destructive wildfires swept through California, resulting in 30 deaths, over 200,000 evacuations, and 57,000 acres burned. In March, a series of wildfires broke out in South Korea, killing 32 people, injuring 51, and burning approximately 94,876 hectares of land. Additionally, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Tibet, killing at least 126 people, and a 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit Myanmar, resulting in 3,800 deaths. The article also mentions a 6.2 magnitude earthquake in Turkey and a conflict between India and Pakistan. The author reflects on the destruction caused by humans and the importance of self-reflection. 'Haven't we lost our own land in reaching this sky?' the author asks, highlighting the need for people to understand that they are the cause of their own destruction.

**How bad will wildfire season be in the US this year? 2025 got off to a deadly start**
The 2025 US wildfire season is expected to be severe, with up to 9 million acres of land potentially burning, according to AccuWeather. This is more than the historical average of 7 million acres. As of now, nearly 1 million acres have already burned across 20 states. AccuWeather meteorologist Paul Pastelok stated, 'Families and businesses need to prepare for yet another active year of wildfires in America.' The risk of fires is highest in the southern Plains and interior Southwest due to drought conditions, and also in the Eastern Seaboard, particularly in the Carolinas, where trees knocked down by Hurricane Helene last year are drying out and acting as fuel for fires. Summer is expected to see a surge of wildfire activity in the Northwest, northern Rockies, Southwest, and south-central states. 'While the season may start slowly, there is strong potential for rapid escalation as drought conditions and heat set in,' Pastelok said. It's worth noting that roughly 90% of all US wildfires are caused by humans, including sparks from downed power lines, discarded cigarettes, and other human activities.

**Fire country: Here's the national spring and summer wildfire forecast**
According to AccuWeather, wildfires are expected to burn more land across the U.S. than the historical average in 2025, with up to 9 million acres expected to burn. This is more than the typical 7 million acres charred in a typical year. 'Families and businesses need to prepare for yet another active year of wildfires in America,' said AccuWeather meteorologist Paul Pastelok. The fire danger is expected to be highest this spring in the drought-plagued southern Plains and interior Southwest, and abnormally dry conditions and warm weather could increase fire danger along the Eastern Seaboard. The Carolinas are of particular concern due to the devastation from Hurricane Helene last year, which left behind piles of timber that act as fuel for any fires that spark. A surge of wildfire activity is expected this summer in the Northwest, northern Rockies, Southwest and south-central states. 'While the season may start slowly, there is strong potential for rapid escalation as drought conditions and heat set in,' Pastelok said. It's worth noting that roughly 90% of all wildfires in the US are caused by humans, including sparks from downed power lines, discarded cigarettes, campfires, fireworks, lawn equipment, trains and vehicle backfires.

**UK wildfires push records in first four months of 2025**
According to satellite data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), over 110 wildfires have burned across the UK since January 1, 2025, covering an area of nearly 24,500 hectares. This is higher than the average for this time of year and surpasses the same period in 2024. The National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) reported that fire and rescue services have responded to 380 wildfires in England and Wales so far this year, more than double the number in 2022. The NFCC attributed the increase in wildfires to a particularly dry March and warmer-than-average temperatures in April, stating, 'A number of significant wildfires across the UK over the last fortnight.'

Oregon firefighters have been dispatched to the Carolinas to help combat ongoing wildfires that have burned over 6,000 acres in areas recently devastated by Hurricane Helene. This is the second time this year that Oregon has sent firefighters to help other states, following a similar deployment to California in January. According to the Oregon Dept. of Forestry, this kind of mutual aid is part of longstanding agreements between states, allowing them to share resources and learn new techniques. As Jessica Neujahr explains, 'It creates an expanded cache of reciprocal resources,' enabling states to help each other during times of need. Neujahr adds, 'It teaches them new techniques that they might not have learned before from different firefighters,' and helps them prepare for their own peak fire season. The assignments are set to last two weeks, with the option to extend if needed.

**New Jersey is entering an especially risky wildfire season, officials say**
New Jersey is entering a high-risk wildfire season, with a 266% increase in wildfires this year compared to 2024. The state has been in a drought since last fall, and January was the third driest on record. Fire officials are concerned about the limited time and manpower for controlled burns, which are crucial for preventing fires in vulnerable areas. Bill Donnelly, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, said that the agency aims to burn 20,000 to 25,000 acres per year, but is only at 10% of that target for 2025. Memo Cedeño Laurent, assistant professor at Rutgers School of Public Health, said that the risk of devastating fires similar to those in Los Angeles is 'highly unlikely,' but not 'completely zero.' The research found that the wildfire smoke in New Jersey in 2023 was uniquely toxic, with particles that can travel to the deepest parts of the lungs and affect every single organ of the body. 'This is by no means safe smoke,' Cedeño Laurent said. 'Let's be sincere. The weather is in many cases unpredictable. You see it from the frequency of these 100-year floods, 500-year floods,' he added.
