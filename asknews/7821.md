**2026 Budget to Focus on Supporting Families with Children**
The 2026 budget will focus on supporting families with children, youth, and pensioners, according to Minister for Economy Márton Nagy. In his speech to the parliament, he stated that the budget will ensure the security of every Hungarian family and enable them to take another step forward. Key measures for next year include 'Europe's largest family tax reduction program', doubling the family allowance for children and the income tax exemption for mothers of two children under 40 years old. Additionally, the budget will maintain the reduction of ancillary costs, guarantee the payment of the 13th month's pension, protect and create jobs, and support wage increases. The budget for 2026 is expected to have a 4.1% GDP growth, an inflation rate of 3.6%, and a deficit of 3.7% of GDP. The minister also emphasized the importance of preventing the forced and accelerated EU membership of Ukraine and protecting the planned tax reductions. He also mentioned that the minimum wage will increase by 13% in January 2026 and that six months of subsidies for law enforcement and defense equipment will be included in the budget. The government is working to grow the Hungarian economy as quickly as possible, and to combat price increases, introduce margin cuts, and limit the prices of services by banks, insurers, and telecommunications companies. Furthermore, negotiations to reduce the prices of non-subsidized medicines have been initiated.

**Korea's birth crisis far from over**
South Korea's total fertility rate reached 0.82 in the first quarter of 2025, a 7.4% year-on-year increase, the highest since records began in 1981. Experts are cautiously optimistic, but warn that even if the government's target of a 1.0 fertility rate by 2030 is met, Korea would still be at the bottom globally in terms of fertility. The prolonged low birthrate has eroded the population of people capable of having children, and an increase in fertility rates may not translate into more births due to a smaller base population of parents. According to Statistics Korea, even under the agency's high-fertility projection scenario, the national population will fall to the 30-million range within 45 years. Complacency is not an option, and a fertility rate must rise to two or three children per woman to avoid a shrinking society. 'We must remember that we have merely bought a little more time to prepare for the demographic shock ahead,' said a warning from the article.

**UK Ranks High in Promoting Women's Rights in the Workplace, While Hungary Regresses**
The Economist's 'glass ceiling index' ranks countries based on their performance in promoting women's rights in the workplace. The index combines 10 criteria, including average salary, parental leave, representation in politics and business, and access to education. According to the index, the UK has made the most progress in the past 8 years, moving from 22nd to 14th place, while Hungary has regressed from 9th to 24th place. The UK's improvement is attributed to 'policies promoting gender equality and parental work', says The Economist. The Nordic countries generally perform well, with Sweden taking the top spot this year. France ranks 5th, along with Portugal and New Zealand. The average representation of women in company boards has increased from 21% in 2016 to 33% today, with countries like New Zealand, France, and the UK having nearly equal numbers of female and male administrators.

**Can Nigel Farage really boost Britain's birth rate?**
Hungary's fertility rate has declined to the European average, despite Prime Minister Orbán's focus on large families. However, this policy has led to an increase in households with three or more children. In Finland, family-friendly policies such as parental leave and affordable childcare have been associated with higher fertility rates, but these measures are not enough to address the current demographic situation. Anna Rotkirch of the Family Federation of Finland's Population Research Institute notes that 'there's no silver bullet policy' and that government spending and proposed policies may not have a significant demographic impact, but can help reduce child poverty. 'The cost of parenting is real and it is also economic,' she adds. 'Why do we have a society where you get poorer if you have a child?'

**Choosing dogs over having children is a symptom of a cultural crisis**
A recent Hungarian study suggests that people are choosing dogs over having children due to a cultural crisis, not because dogs are causing lower fertility rates. According to Prof Enikő Kubinyi, declining fertility rates may be increasing the importance of dogs in people's lives, filling the emotional space left by fewer children and more fragile family networks. Kubinyi notes that family relationships create 'closed triangle' connections, which are less common in friendships. Dog ownership can increase the number of closed triangles, as people develop relationships based on their mutual love of pets. The study highlights the decline in birth rates and the rise of pet ownership, with China's pets expected to outnumber children under four by a ratio of two to one by 2030. Kubinyi suggests that humans are hard-wired to exist in small yet dense human networks, and that companion animals like dogs are being used to fill this need. However, the author argues that expecting dogs to function as substitutes for unconditional love or as babies is unfair to dogs and not great for human prospects.

**Russia Celebrates International Children's Day with Progress in Child Protection and Support for Families**
Russia celebrates International Children's Day on June 1st. The country has made significant progress in protecting children's rights, with the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 and the establishment of the institution of the Ombudsman for Children's Rights in 2009. The government has also implemented various measures to support families with children, including the introduction of the Maternity Capital program in 2007 and the extension of the program until 2030. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed an order establishing the status of multi-child families and defining measures to support them. The number of children in Russia has been declining, with a total of 25.5 million children under the age of 15 as of January 2023. The birth rate in Russia has also decreased, with 1.222 million births in 2024, a 3.4% decrease from 2023. The government aims to increase the total fertility rate to 1.6 by 2030 and to 1.8 by 2036. The country has also seen a significant decrease in child mortality, with a rate of 4.0 per 1,000 live births as of December 2024. The number of children in foster care has also decreased, with 340,055 children as of 2024. The government has also launched a unique program for screening reproductive health for women and men aged 18-45 in the framework of dispensary examination. Russia has declared 2024 as the Year of the Family, with key objectives including creating conditions for the birth of the first children in young families, strengthening reproductive health, supporting multi-child and multi-generational families, and forming a healthy trend towards multi-child families.

**Hungary's Viktor Orban Exempts Mothers with at Least 2 Children from Taxes for Life**
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has introduced a measure to stimulate birth rates: mothers with at least two children will be exempt from taxes for life. According to CNews, the Hungarian Parliament has adopted a package of measures, including a lifetime tax exemption for mothers with at least two children, as part of Orban's natalist policy. The measure will first apply to women under 40 years old from next year, and will gradually extend to mothers over 60 years old by 2029, as stated in the text voted by a large majority. Since 2020, only mothers of four or more children have been exempt from taxes in Hungary. Orban aims to combat the demographic decline, as the population has decreased from 10.7 to 9.5 million since 1980. Free nurseries, housing aid, or 'baby loans' are among the incentives, but their effects are limited and their cost is high, estimated at 2.3 billion euros by 2029. Orban believes that this tax reduction program, presented as 'the most ambitious in Europe', will transform Hungary into a tax haven for families and will be a strategic lever to stop the demographic decline and strengthen traditional family values. The goal is to reach a fertility rate of 2.1 by 2035, considered necessary for the renewal of generations. Currently, the rate is 1.52 children per woman, below that of countries like France (1.79) but higher than that of Quebec (1.38).

**Hungary Introduces Lifetime Tax Exemption for Mothers with Two or More Children**
Hungary has been experiencing a continuous demographic decline for over 40 years, with its population decreasing from 10.7 million in 1980 to approximately 9.5 million today. To address this issue, the government of Viktor Orbán has launched an ambitious natalist policy, including a recent measure that exempts mothers with at least two children from lifetime taxes. This exemption, initially applicable to women under 40 from next year, will be gradually extended to women up to 60 by 2029, expanding a previously reserved tax benefit for mothers of four or more children. The goal is to encourage births and slow down the demographic decline that has affected Hungary for decades.

**Hungary Extends Lifetime Tax Exemption to Mothers with Two or More Children**
The Hungarian Parliament has adopted a new law that extends the lifetime tax exemption to mothers with at least two children, effective from 2025. Previously, this benefit was only available to mothers of four or more children. According to Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, this move is part of his strategy to support fertility in a country that has been experiencing a continuous demographic decline for over 40 years. The population of Hungary has decreased from 10.7 million in 1980 to 9.5 million today. Despite the government's efforts to encourage childbirth, including free childcare, housing subsidies, and reduced-interest loans for family cars, the results have been limited. The estimated cost of the new measures is 2.3 billion euros by 2029, which could exacerbate the budget deficit and inflation. The fertility rate in Hungary has dropped to 1.31 children per woman in March 2025, still far from the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.

**Hungary Expands Lifelong Tax Exemption to Mothers of Two Children**
The Hungarian Parliament has expanded the lifelong tax exemption to mothers of two children, in an effort to boost the country's birth rate, which has been declining due to demographic decline. The measure, which was previously only available to mothers of four or more children, will be extended to mothers under 40 from 2025 and to women over 60 by 2029. This move is part of Viktor Orbán's strategy to support natalité, as the country's population has decreased from 10.7 million in 1980 to 9.5 million today. Despite the government's efforts, including free childcare, housing aid, and reduced-interest 'baby loans', the birth rate remains low, with an index of 1.31 children per woman in March 2025, compared to a European average of 1.53. Orbán notes that the birth rate had reached a historic low of 1.23 when he took office, but the country still lags behind the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.

**Hungary Introduces Tax Incentives to Encourage Women to Have More Children**
The Hungarian parliament has approved a new tax incentive package aimed at encouraging women to have more children. Starting next year, all mothers with at least two children will be exempt from taxes for life. This is part of a campaign by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to boost birth rates. Currently, only mothers with four or more children have benefited from this tax exemption since 2020. Orbán, a conservative leader known for his strong defense of 'traditional' values, is trying to reverse the country's declining population. Hungary has been experiencing a decline in population since more than 40 years ago, with a current population of 9.5 million people compared to 10.7 million in 1980. The government has been offering a range of benefits to encourage childbirth, from free childcare to housing assistance and car loans to cover childcare costs. However, this strategy, which has attracted attention from conservative circles in the US, is costly and has mixed effects. The government estimates that the cost of this package will be 2.3 billion euros by 2029. Economists are concerned about the impact on the country's high budget deficit and inflation. The government aims to achieve a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman by 2035, but the current rate is 1.31 children per woman, down from a peak of 1.61 in 2021.

**Hungary Exempts Mothers of Two or More Children from Taxes for Life**
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has introduced a new measure to encourage population growth by exempting mothers of two or more children from taxes for life. Currently, only mothers of four or more children benefit from this tax advantage. Starting in 2026, mothers under 40 will be eligible, and the exemption will be extended to mothers over 60 by 2029. This move is part of Orbán's natalist policy, which aims to counter the decline of Hungary's population due to aging. The country has been losing inhabitants for over 40 years, with a current population of 9.5 million compared to 10.7 million in 1980. The government estimates that the new measure will cost 2.3 billion euros by 2029, which has raised concerns about the country's already high deficit and inflation. While Orbán claims that this program will transform Hungary into a 'tax haven for families,' the effectiveness of this policy in increasing birth rates is uncertain. According to official statistics, the total fertility rate has decreased to 1.31 children per woman in March, down from a peak of 1.61 in 2021. Orbán, who has five children himself, argues that the rate was at a historic low of 1.23 when he took office, but it is still far from the 2.1 needed to sustain population growth. The government now aims to reach this target by 2035.

**The radical European country handing mothers tax breaks for life**
Hungary is implementing radical new plans to combat its plummeting fertility rate, which is expected to fall to 8.5 million by 2050. Under the new laws, mothers with one child will be exempt from income tax until they turn 30, while those with two or more children will pay no income tax for life, as stated by the Hungarian Research Network. This move aims to address the country's demographic pressure, despite generous incentives already in place to encourage having children. 'The country's population decline has been a concern for decades,' according to the article. International immigration somewhat offsets the declining population, but Hungary still faces immense demographic pressure.

**EU Fertility Rate Hits Record Low in 2023**
According to Eurostat, 3.67 million babies were born in the European Union (EU) in 2023, a 5.4% decrease from 2022. This represents the largest annual decline since 1961. The average number of children per woman in the EU was 1.38 in 2023, down from 1.46 in 2022. The countries with the highest fertility rates were Bulgaria (1.81 births per woman), France (1.66), and Hungary (1.55). In contrast, the lowest fertility rates were observed in Malta (1.06), Spain (1.12), and Lithuania (1.18). In Belgium, women had an average of 1.47 children. Eurostat notes that the fertility rate in Europe has been declining for decades, with nearly twice as many children born in the EU in the 1960s as in 2023. The EU's fertility rate of 1.38 children per woman is below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman, which is necessary to maintain a stable population in the absence of migration.
