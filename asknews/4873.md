**What the AI Revolution Means for the Future of Energy**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, predicts that the cost of AI will converge with the cost of energy, and that the abundance of energy will limit the abundance of AI. This is supported by various reports from government analysts, investment bankers, and news organizations, which acknowledge that the digital economy runs on hardware that consumes a lot of energy. The latest giga-scale data centers require massive amounts of materials and energy to build and operate, with a single data center consuming as much natural gas as a single SpaceX rocket launch. The IEA estimates that a single large AI data center can use as much electricity as 2 million households, and that lighting up digital infrastructures will entail demands equivalent to reliably powering hundreds of millions of new households. The leading Big Tech firms have announced $300 billion in AI infrastructure spending this year, and BlackRock forecasts that annual spending could approach $1 trillion by 2030. Energy efficiency gains in digital hardware will not be enough to tamp down rising power demand, and the intersection of growing demand for bits and energy-efficiency gains will lead to a net increase in power demands. Society's demand for harvesting and consuming bits is the prime driver of all things digital, and there is no limit to how much we want to and need to know about everything in our society. The consequences of AI delivering on its promises of a productivity boom will be tectonic, and will induce growth in energy demand.

**Wedbush Identifies Top AI Stocks for Second Half of 2025**
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that the AI boom will accelerate in the second half of 2025. Despite concerns about the potential impact of Trump's tariffs on the global economy, Ives remains optimistic that AI will drive a 'once-in-a-century industrial revolution'. He predicts that the semiconductor market will reach a value of up to $2.4 trillion by 2040. Ives recommends investing in Nvidia, Baidu Inc (BIDU), and Snowflake Inc (SNOW) to profit from the growing applications of AI, the introduction of new Large Language Models (LLMs), and increasing demand from businesses. Baidu is well-positioned to benefit from the AI market due to its comprehensive platform and recent advancements in AI models, including DeepSeek. Snowflake is also a strong candidate, with its user-friendly GenAI solutions and expanding KI pipeline. Both companies have positive ratings from other Wall Street analysts, with Baidu's rating being 'overweight' and Snowflake's rating being 'overweight' as well.

**OpenAI Criticized by Tech Personalities for Financial Struggles and LLM Flaws**
OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT, is facing criticism from tech personalities. Gary Marcus, a prominent AI critic, has accused OpenAI of struggling financially, with a valuation of $300 billion despite losing money. He believes that the company's reliance on foreign funding is a sign of 'desperation'. Marcus also criticizes the flaws in large language models (LLM), which he claims are 'intrinsically defective' and will never live up to their promises. He warns that the LLM will inevitably be used to exploit user data for profit, and that investors will demand returns, leading to the sale of private data for surveillance purposes. Mary Meeker, a well-known tech analyst, has also raised concerns about the competition from Chinese models and the risk of 'banalization' of LLM. She notes that the costs of developing these models have increased significantly, and that the competition from cheaper national models and foreign groups like DeepSeek is putting pressure on pricing power. Luc Julia, a French engineer and former father of Siri, believes that the future of AI lies in specialized, low-energy models that can perform useful tasks, rather than general-purpose LLM. He also dismisses the idea of creating a general AI that can surpass human intelligence, calling it 'God'. 'It's clear that those who believe in this are either delusional or cynical, like Sam Altman, who are just looking to raise billions of dollars for their companies.'

**Silicon Valley venture capitalists sit back from investing in AI**
Silicon Valley venture capitalists have been left behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) investment frenzy, with only the deepest pockets remaining in the game. The generative AI revolution, sparked by ChatGPT in 2022, has led to unprecedented valuations for companies like OpenAI, which raised US$40 billion at a US$300 billion valuation, and Anthropic, which now commands a US$61.5 billion valuation. 'The stakes have grown so high that even major venture capital firms can no longer compete,' according to the article. Big Tech companies, Japan's SoftBank Group, and Middle Eastern investment funds are now the primary players in AI investments.

**Anthropic Revenue Soars to $3bn as Enterprise Demand for Generative AI Surges - Tekedia**
Anthropic, an artificial intelligence startup, has reached an annualized revenue of $3 billion, a significant increase from its $1 billion run-rate just five months ago. This growth is attributed to its enterprise-grade AI models, particularly in the code generation space, and its platform Claude, which businesses are adopting to build custom AI tools and automate tasks. While Claude trails OpenAI's ChatGPT in consumer popularity, it has become the go-to model for many large companies seeking reliable and secure AI infrastructure. Anthropic's enterprise-first approach is paying off, with investors such as Amazon and Alphabet committing billions to ensure the integration of Claude into cloud platforms. According to Meritech Capital General Partner Alex Clayton, Anthropic's growth is exceptional, surpassing the growth rate of Snowflake in a single quarter. The global generative AI industry is projected to grow into a $1.3 trillion market by 2032, with AI contributing up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

**The Rise of Mini-Companies: Can AI Replace Human Employees?**
Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, predicts that the first company to reach a valuation of over $1 billion with a single employee will emerge by 2026. This prophecy is backed by a handful of startups that are growing rapidly in revenue. The Y Combinator's first quarter 2025 promotion shows a 10% weekly growth rate, according to its director Garry Tan. In this cohort, 81% of the companies are related to artificial intelligence, and only 11% are focused on physical objects. Midjourney, an image editing platform, has reportedly reached $500 million in revenue without external capital, while Anysphere, the editor of the programming assistant Cursor, has reached $300 million. However, this hypergrowth is not always a guarantee of sustainability, as the market for AI tools is becoming increasingly saturated, leading to high churn rates. Additionally, the reliance on sophisticated language models from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can be costly, and there is a risk that these giants may try to compete with these startups.

**Silicon Valley Investors Navigate the Fog of AI**
The Silicon Valley venture capital investors are facing a challenge in finding viable opportunities in the rapidly evolving and expensive AI market. The market has been dominated by a few large players, such as OpenAI, which has raised $40 billion in its latest funding round, valuing the company at $300 billion. Emily Zheng, a PitchBook analyst, notes that there is a clear divide between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' in the AI market. Simon Wu, from Cathay Innovation, believes that clients are demanding new AI products, but most of the spending is going to the largest players. The real challenge, according to Andy McLoughlin, from Uncork Capital, is to determine where the opportunities lie, beyond the dominant players like OpenAI and Anthropic. The giants of AI, including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, are launching new products at an incredible pace, making it difficult for investors to find new ideas that can survive the competition. The uncertainty of AI's profitability is also a concern, with even the largest players struggling to find a clear path to profitability.

**Silicon Valley VCs navigate uncertain AI future**
Silicon Valley venture capitalists are navigating an uncertain future for artificial intelligence (AI) as the market becomes increasingly dominated by a few large players. OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI have received massive funding, with OpenAI's latest round valuing the company at $300 billion. However, this has left many venture capital firms struggling to compete, with only the deepest pockets remaining in the game. Emily Zheng, senior analyst at PitchBook, notes that there is a clear split between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' in the AI market. Simon Wu of Cathay Innovation believes that there is clear customer demand for AI improvements, but the real challenge is determining where the opportunities are against the mega platforms. Andy McLoughlin, managing partner at Uncork Capital, notes that finding a 'moat' - a unique feature or breakthrough - is crucial for startups in the AI market. Despite the uncertainty, McLoughlin predicts that AI will become a fabric of how everything gets built in five years. However, who will be building remains an open question.

**OpenAI Plans for Future IPO as it Renegotiates Microsoft Partnership**
OpenAI and Microsoft are renegotiating the terms of their partnership. OpenAI has recently announced a significant change in its restructuring plans, with one of the goals being a potential initial public offering (IPO). According to Sam Altman, the company's CEO, OpenAI will become a public benefit corporation (PBC) controlled by the non-profit organization, OpenAI, Inc. This type of entity seeks both profit and social good, similar to rivals like Anthropic or xAI. The PBC structure will allow OpenAI to offer its investors a stake in the business in exchange for their investments, and it will also enable the company to go public. Microsoft is renegotiating the terms of its alliance with OpenAI, which has invested $13 billion in the company. Microsoft is willing to cede part of its stake in the new for-profit corporation to gain access to OpenAI's models and technology beyond 2030. OpenAI is valued at $260 billion, but its recent investment from SoftBank has increased its valuation to $300 billion. The company needs to complete its transformation into a for-profit entity to secure future funding rounds, as investors expect to recover their investment with significant profits. OpenAI is still burning money to train its generative AI models, but it expects to generate $125 billion in revenue from its new products and agents by 2029.

**OpenAI negotiates with Microsoft for new funding and future IPO, FT reports**
OpenAI and Microsoft are renegotiating their multibillion-dollar partnership, aiming to allow OpenAI to launch a future IPO while protecting Microsoft's access to cutting-edge AI models. A key issue is the equity stake Microsoft will receive in OpenAI's new for-profit business, with Microsoft offering to give up some of its equity in exchange for access to new technology developed beyond 2030. OpenAI has told investors it will share a smaller fraction of revenue with its largest backer as it moves ahead with restructuring. 'The Financial Times reported on Sunday that OpenAI and Microsoft are rewriting the terms of their partnership in a high-stakes negotiation,' according to the report. 'A critical issue is how much equity in OpenAI's new for-profit business Microsoft will receive in exchange for the more than $13 billion it has invested in the company to date,' the report said. 'It said Microsoft is offering to give up some of its equity stake in exchange for access to new technology developed beyond the 2030 cutoff.'

**OpenAI wants to cut Microsoft's revenue share by half by 2030  --  following Sam Altman's botched for-profit restructure plan**
OpenAI is reportedly planning to cut Microsoft's revenue share from 20% to 10% by 2030, according to financial projections shared by investors. This comes after OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, announced that the company would no longer pursue a for-profit structure. Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor with a $13.5 billion stake, had a multi-billion dollar partnership agreement with OpenAI that was set to run through 2030. However, OpenAI's recent moves, including the Stargate project, have raised concerns among investors and consumers, and Microsoft has begun to distance itself from the partnership. As Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff predicted, Microsoft is now developing its own in-house AI models, and has reportedly dropped plans to facilitate additional training support for OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to OpenAI, 'We continue to work closely with Microsoft, and look forward to finalizing the details of this recapitalization in the near future.'

**OpenAI Breaks Record with $40 Billion Funding Round, but Must Become Profitable by Year's End**
OpenAI has announced that it has completed a $40 billion funding round, making it the largest investment in a private technology company. The company's valuation has tripled. However, there is a catch: OpenAI must become profitable by the end of this year for the investment to be realized by SoftBank. The process began last year when the company announced it wanted to become profitable to cover the costs of developing AI. However, it still faces challenges, including disagreements with Elon Musk, who is a co-founder. OpenAI must become a profitable company to meet the conditions of the investment, which was led by SoftBank and included other major investors such as Microsoft, Altimeter, Thrive, and Coatue. If OpenAI meets its goal of becoming profitable by December 31, 2025, SoftBank will invest the remaining $30 billion. Otherwise, the investment may decrease to $20 billion. After the funding round, data from PitchBook revealed that OpenAI's valuation reached $300 billion, making it the second most valuable private company in the world, behind SpaceX and tied with ByteDance.

**OpenAI Raises $40 Billion in Largest Private Funding Round in History**
OpenAI has completed the largest private funding round in history, raising $40 billion. This is in addition to the $6.6 billion raised in October 2024 and the 'multimillion-dollar' investment made by Microsoft in January 2023, estimated to be $10 billion. The company will receive $10 billion immediately, with $7.5 billion coming from SoftBank and $2.5 billion from a 'syndicate of investors'. The remaining $30 billion will be received by the end of the year, but only if OpenAI successfully transitions to a 'for-profit' company. If they fail to do so, they will lose a quarter of the investment. According to CNBC, $18 billion of the total round will be dedicated to the Stargate project. The funding round values OpenAI at $300 billion, making it comparable to companies like Coca-Cola, Novo Nordisk, and Chevron. OpenAI currently has 500 million weekly users of ChatGPT, a notable figure that shows the technology's growth. However, the company is still not profitable, with estimates suggesting it won't be until 2029. OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, but it will still be losing money. The ultimate goal of OpenAI is to develop a general artificial intelligence (AGI) that surpasses human intelligence, but it's unclear if they will be able to achieve this. SoftBank has become OpenAI's new key ally, replacing Microsoft, which has taken a secondary role in this funding round.

**OpenAI Secures $40 Billion Funding Round, Valuing Company at $300 Billion**
OpenAI has secured a massive $40 billion funding round, valuing the company at $300 billion. SoftBank, a Japanese investment firm, will be the primary participant in this funding round, the largest ever for a non-listed technology company. The funding will be used to accelerate OpenAI's growth, which is expected to triple its revenue to $12.7 billion in 2025. However, the company does not expect to become profitable until 2029. The funding round has been met with criticism from some co-founders, including Elon Musk, who has sued the company to prevent a change in its non-profit status to a for-profit company. Musk has also offered to buy out the non-profit organization for $97.4 billion, but the offer was rejected by the OpenAI board. The change in status is seen as a potential threat to the company's mission and values, with some critics arguing that it will prioritize profits over reliability and security.

**OpenAI Completes $40 Billion Funding Round, Valued at $300 Billion**
OpenAI has completed a $40 billion funding round, making it the largest private tech company funding in history. This deal values OpenAI at $300 billion, second only to SpaceX's $350 billion and ByteDance's $315 billion. SoftBank Group led the round with a $30 billion investment, with other participants including core investors Microsoft, Coatue, Altimeter, and Thrive. According to a blog post, OpenAI plans to use the new funds to 'further push the frontier of AI research' and expand its computational infrastructure. CNBC reported that around $18 billion of the funds will be used for OpenAI's commitment to 'Stargate', a joint venture with SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle. The initial $10 billion will be paid by the end of 2025, with the remaining $30 billion to be paid by the end of 2025, but with a condition that OpenAI must be converted into a for-profit organization by December 31st, or the investment may be reduced by up to $10 billion. This condition increases the pressure on OpenAI to transform. The transformation plan requires the approval of Microsoft and the California Attorney General, but co-founder Elon Musk is trying to block OpenAI's transformation into a fully for-profit company through legal means. The company currently has a hybrid structure, including a limited partnership with profit limits created in 2019. The initial non-profit organization is the controlling shareholder. If the company is restructured, the non-profit organization will be spun off as an independent entity. OpenAI's venture capital investors have received convertible notes, which will be converted into stocks later.

**OpenAI funding round could be cut by $10 billion if for-profit conversion doesn't occur by year-end**
OpenAI's private funding round could be reduced by $10 billion if the company doesn't convert to a for-profit entity by December 31. The round would decrease from $40 billion to $30 billion, with SoftBank's contribution shrinking from $30 billion to $20 billion. Investors will receive convertible notes that convert into traditional equity after the restructuring. OpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025. The company is under pressure to convert to a for-profit entity, a plan that requires the approval of Microsoft and the California Attorney General, and has been challenged in court by Elon Musk.

**OpenAI Bets on the Future with Data Center Plans and Shift Away from Microsoft**
OpenAI is making a bet on the future with plans to build data centers and shift away from Microsoft. According to investor documents, by 2030, OpenAI plans to get 75% of its computing power from the 'Stargate' data center, a joint venture with SoftBank and Oracle, effectively replacing Microsoft as its primary infrastructure partner. OpenAI aims to build data centers with a total capacity of 8 gigawatts, putting it on par with the largest cloud providers. However, this transition does not mean cutting costs on Microsoft. According to current contracts, OpenAI's expenses on Microsoft will increase from $13 billion this year to $28 billion in 2028, with potential for further growth if Microsoft provides additional resources. As Microsoft is a major investor, OpenAI's profit also brings revenue to Microsoft. OpenAI predicts its revenue will triple, from $3.7 billion this year to $12.5 billion, planning to reach $28 billion by 2026. SoftBank is expected to contribute a third of the growth this year through the use of OpenAI's products. The company's expenses are also increasing sharply, from around $2 billion last year to nearly $7 billion this year, peaking at $20 billion in 2027. Profitability is expected to emerge only by the end of the decade. These expenses are largely related to investments in computing technology. Between 2025 and 2030, OpenAI plans to spend over $320 billion on training and operating AI models, with half of the funds going towards training. It is expected that after 2030, operational expenses will exceed training costs. To fund these initiatives, OpenAI is preparing a $40 billion funding round, with SoftBank potentially contributing $30 billion. This will value OpenAI at $260 billion, with the first $10 billion to be received by the end of March. The total cost of the 'Stargate' project is estimated at $500 billion. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella takes a more cautious approach to investing in computing power, predicting a surplus of computing resources by 2027/2028, which could lead to lower prices, and stating that he would 'be happy to rent them out' when the market softens. In contrast, OpenAI appears to be less cautious, recently announcing over 400 million active users per week, an 8% increase in just a few weeks. According to the company, since the release of o3-mini, API usage has grown fivefold. GPT-4.5 is expected to be released in the coming days, and GPT-5 is planned for May. In an effort not to fall behind competitors, OpenAI began collaborating with Oracle in July 2024 to find additional computing resources. By October, CEO Sam Altman reportedly became concerned that Microsoft would not be able to supply servers quickly enough to keep up with xAI, a model recently released by Elon Musk. Musk is not standing still either. His data center in Memphis already has 200,000 Nvidia chips installed, and the number is growing. The second data center being built in Atlanta currently has 12,000 graphics processors installed.
