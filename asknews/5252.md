**Democratic Party Criticized by Its Own Member: 'Roadkilled' and Losing Its Progressive Image**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has criticized the Democratic Party, saying 'we need to get worse' if Trump is being aggressive. He stated, 'if Trump is being a bully, then you need to be even more aggressive.' Walz, who was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in the 2024 US presidential election, made the comments at a party event in South Carolina and California. He said, 'when people ask me how they see the Democratic Party, I say it's like a deer in the headlights.' He added, 'no one votes for a party that's been roadkilled.' Walz praised the party's historical achievements, such as the social safety net, but criticized its inability to deliver big changes after winning elections. He said, 'the party used to be bold and daring, but it's become a party that can't deliver after winning elections.' He also criticized the party's loss of its 'progressive' image, saying it has become a party that only cares about the interests of the elite and the powerful. The Washington Post analyzed Walz's comments as a reflection of Bernie Sanders' criticism that the Democratic Party has failed to meet the expectations of working-class voters. The article also noted that Walz's comments are a clear signal that he is considering running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.

**The 2028 podcast primary is underway as Democrats try to reshape their image**
The 2028 Democratic presidential primary is underway, with potential contenders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg using podcasts to connect with voters and showcase their personalities. Newsom has been criticized for giving a platform to conservative critics, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, while Beshear has been praised for his authenticity and willingness to engage with his audience. Buttigieg has used his podcast appearance to discuss his personal life and criticize Trump's economic policies. The use of podcasts by Democratic candidates is seen as a way to connect with younger voters and showcase their human side, following the lead of President Donald Trump's successful use of podcasts during his 2024 campaign. 'The way that politicians communicate and need to be seen by their audience is changing,' said Liz Minnella, a liberal strategist. 'I hate to give him credit, but he found a way to connect with people, talk to them like human beings in non-political speak.'

**'Extreme buffoonery and a mean spirit': Top Republican strategist singles out 'toxic brew' of likely 2028 Dem contender * WorldNetDaily * by Harold Hutchison, Daily Caller News Foundation**
Republican strategist Scott Jennings expressed doubt about the chances of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to lead the party, calling him a 'toxic brew' of 'extreme buffoonery and a mean spirit'. Jennings made the comments on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday. Walz, who was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in 2024, spoke at an event hosted by Democratic Rep. James Clyburn in South Carolina on Friday. Jennings also praised Democratic Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland as a 'pretty talented communicator', but criticized the party's current leaders, saying they are 'not for anything that's on the right side of any of the 8020 issues that are driving this cultural divide in America.' Walz responded to Jennings' comments by saying that Democrats need to be 'a little meaner' and 'ferociously push back' against President Donald Trump.

**AOC viewed positively by more Americans than Trump or Harris, poll finds**
Despite being a polarizing figure, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) is viewed more positively by Americans than most currently active U.S. politicians, according to a recent poll by AtlasIntel. AOC ranked third in popularity, with a 46% positivity rating and a net positivity rating of 2 points. She was only beaten by former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama. The poll, which included responses from 3,469 participants, found that AOC's popularity may be due to her active and vocal role in Congress, as well as her efforts to 'rally against oligarchy' alongside Senator Bernie Sanders. Some supporters have urged AOC to consider a 2028 presidential run, but she has remained quiet on the matter, focusing on current issues such as protecting people's rights and preventing deportations. As Monica Crowley, a former Treasury Department official, noted, 'Do not underestimate AOC. She's young, she's vibrant, she's attractive.'

**Democrats made themselves toxic  --  now they're addicted to their own...**
A few Democratic officeholders and pundits are acknowledging that their party's brand has become toxic to a majority of Americans. The Biden administration's serial lying about President Joe Biden's health and the use of him as a 'moderate' cover for radical policies have contributed to this perception. The Democrats' attempts to brand Donald Trump as 'Hitler' and his supporters as 'fascists' have also backfired. The party's nomination process has been rigged, with insiders forcing out leading contenders and coronating Biden as the 2020 candidate. The author argues that the party's radicals, including AOC and her Squad, would demonize any Democrat who proposed a sane reboot, including measured immigration, meritocracy, and school choice. The party is now addicted to its own toxic ideology, including DEI, and cannot survive without it. 'The left created DEI -- the use of race to adjudicate every political issue. And like any addictive, toxic drug, they now can neither survive with DEI -- nor without it.'

**Surprising Candidate Emerges As Clear Democrat Frontrunner for 2028 (It’s NOT Kamala Harris Or AOC) - Conservative Angle**
A new poll has emerged showing Pete Buttigieg as the clear frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential election, surpassing Kamala Harris and AOC. According to the poll, Buttigieg has 32% of the vote, with AOC at 20% and Harris at 15%. However, Buttigieg has stated that he is undecided about running for president in 2028, saying 'there are times I follow that process and decided to run, and there are times I followed that process and decided not to run — and the process can lead you to surprising places.' If Buttigieg does decide to run, he may face off against JD Vance, the current Republican frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election.

**There's a Surprise Leader in Polling for Next Democrat Presidential Nominee -- and It's Not Kamala Harris**
A recent national poll has found that former Transportation Secretary and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the current leader among potential Democratic candidates for the 2028 presidential election, with over 31% of Democratic-identifying respondents supporting him. This puts him ahead of prominent party figures such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former Vice President Kamala Harris. However, the article also highlights Buttigieg's questionable record as Transportation Secretary, including his failure to visit East Palestine, Ohio, after a chemical spill and his oversight of an EV charging station project that burned through billions with little output. The article concludes that it is unlikely that Buttigieg will become the next President, citing the Democrat Party's declining popularity and voters' rejection of their globalist agenda.

**Carville suggests he'd support Ocasio-Cortez as Democratic nominee**
Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville expressed support for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) as the party's presidential nominee in 2028, despite previously criticizing the progressive lawmaker. Carville stated, 'If AOC wants to run for president and she gets the [nomination], then God bless you. You are the leader of the Democratic Party.' He also acknowledged that the Democratic Party is not in as 'nearly as bad shape as it's being portrayed' after suffering losses in the 2024 election. Carville's comments came after he criticized the party's lack of a message and leader, saying, 'It's not going to be picked by the press, it's not going to be picked by polling. It's going to be picked by Democratic voters, and that'll have to come in due time.'

**AOC teases White House run in 2028 and takes shot at ICE Barbie**
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 35-year-old New York Democrat and leader of the progressive 'Squad', is considering a potential White House bid in 2028, according to a source familiar with her thinking. She has been teasing a potential run, refusing to rule it out, and has been raising her national profile with a countrywide 'Fighting Oligarchy' tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders. AOC has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration, particularly on immigration, and has accused Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan of breaking the law. She warned the Trump admin officials, 'You lay a finger on someone... we are going to have a problem.' AOC is the second most likely candidate to become the Democrat's 2028 presidential nominee, according to prediction market Kalshi, with California Gov. Gavin Newsom being the only other candidate with better odds.

**Top Pollster Calls It: AOC Will Be Democrats' Next Presidential Nominee**
Pollster Nate Silver has predicted that Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee.

In a mock draft, both Silver and Druke picked Ocasio-Cortez as their first pick, followed by Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and other prominent Democrats under the age of 65.

**Polling guru reveals likeliest Democrat to take on MAGA in 2028**
Polling guru Nate Silver predicts that Democrats will choose Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as their 2028 presidential nominee. Silver cited her progressive lane, youth, and media savvy as reasons for his pick. He pointed to polls showing her leading Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in a potential New York Senate seat challenge. Journalist Galen Druke argued that AOC has broad appeal across the Democratic Party, with a 62% positive rating among Democrats in a recent Yale poll. Druke noted that AOC has fervent support and has learned to stick to kitchen table issues, avoiding social issues that conservatives have maligned as 'woke.' Silver and Druke agreed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is their second-place pick, while Silver chose Sen. Cory Booker and Druke chose 2024 nominee Kamala Harris as their third picks.

**Bill Maher slams Democrats for embracing AOC as a 2028 candidate - Washington Examiner**
Bill Maher expressed his disapproval of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being the Democratic Party's nominee for president in 2028, stating 'It shouldn't be her, it shouldn't be her.' Sen. Tina Smith also echoed this sentiment, saying 'No' when asked if she thought Ocasio-Cortez should be the nominee, before clarifying that it wasn't her job to decide. Maher also criticized the 'Fighting Oligarchy' tour by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, saying they were chasing 'shiny objects' by seeking large crowd turnouts. This sentiment was shared by Democratic strategist James Carville, who suggested the pair should 'split off' from the Democratic Party if they continue to criticize establishment figures instead of focusing on attacking Republicans.

**How AOC Can Win the Democratic Nomination and Become the Next U.S. President**
Nate Silver has dubbed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) the frontrunner for the Democratic Party's 2028 presidential nomination. AOC's path to the nomination is relatively easy due to her ability to inherit Bernie Sanders' national network of socialist activists and her strong support from the left wing of the party. Her greatest danger is another Democrat running to her left, but her large base of support among leftists could give her a plurality in the primaries. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has shifted its focus to supporting progressive candidates, and AOC's path has already been cleared. However, as Robert Burns said, 'The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry,' and anything can happen before the 2028 election.

**US Presidential Election 2024: How it Works**
The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024. The winner of the election will be determined by the Electoral College system, where the candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes. In most states, the candidate who wins the most votes gets all of the state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, where the electoral votes are allocated proportionally. To be eligible to vote in the US, one must be a US citizen and at least 18 years old. The candidates will finance their campaigns through donations and the 'Citizen-United-Urteil' allows for indirect campaign support with few restrictions. The election process is complex, with multiple stages, including the nomination convention, debates, and the final election. The winner of the election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. As of now, the candidates for the election are Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with the first debate scheduled for September 10, 2024. The election will be a crucial moment in US history, with the winner determining the course of the country's future.
