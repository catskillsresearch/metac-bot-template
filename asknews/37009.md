**Trump vs. the arts: Fresh strikes against PBS and the NEA**
President Trump has launched a fresh attack on PBS and NPR, calling for a cessation of federal funding to both media nonprofits. However, experts argue that Trump may not have the authority to end the $500 million in annual congressional funding that flows to PBS and NPR. The cut would disproportionately affect rural stations, which rely heavily on federal funding. Trump's team has also proposed a federal budget that would zero out funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities. Arts organizations have begun receiving emails informing them that grants they'd been promised would not be honored. Critics argue that the move is 'cruel' and 'un-American,' and that the tax savings would amount to just over $2 per American. The pushback against Trump's move is 'occasionally hilarious,' with some arguing that NPR and PBS are not independent news sources, but rather 'demanding a monopoly' with taxpayer funding.

**Newsom asks lawmakers to fast-track Delta tunnel project**
California Governor Gavin Newsom is asking state lawmakers to pass a trailer bill to fast-track the Delta Conveyance Project, a $20 billion, 45-mile long tunnel through the Delta. Newsom has called the project 'key to the state's climate adaptation' as it faces a 10 percent reduction in water supplies by 2040. He aims to finish the project's permitting by the end of his term in early 2027. Newsom has sought to show off his efforts to increase water storage and supplies in the state. However, environmental and tribal groups are fighting the project, citing concerns about habitat loss and construction impacts, and have filed a petition asking the State Water Resources Control Board to cancel the hearing if more information about the project's historic water use is not provided.

**Do Federal Funding Cuts Spell the End for 'Sesame Street'?**
The Trump administration's decision to cut federal funding for PBS and NPR has sparked concerns about the future of Sesame Street. However, Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit that produces the show, receives only 4% of its revenue from government funding. The majority of its revenue comes from distribution fees, royalties, and licensing. While the 'Ready to Learn' grant, which provided $23 million in funding, has been terminated, Sesame Workshop will not be directly affected. The show's production rights have been owned by HBO since 2015, and new episodes have been airing on the streaming service since 2020. However, the current season will be the final one to be released on HBO, and Sesame Workshop is looking to strike a new deal with a streaming service company to fund new episodes. The nonprofit has been in discussions with companies like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and YouTube. Despite the uncertainty, Sesame Workshop's 2024 tax returns show that it is on track to run a $40 million deficit next year, a significant increase from its 2023 deficit of over $5 million.

**Trump again tries to defund NPR and PBS, sparking a new congressional battle • New Hampshire Bulletin**
President Donald Trump has once again requested that Congress eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which supports NPR and PBS. The CPB receives less than 0.0001% of the federal budget, and its funding is seen as crucial for local radio and television stations. Katherine Maher, president and CEO of NPR, stated that ending funding for the CPB would have a negligible impact on the federal budget. However, some lawmakers, such as Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy, argue that the American taxpayer should not be subsidizing media. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski pushed back against defunding, citing the importance of local programming and emergency alerts in rural communities. The Senate is likely to resist Trump's efforts, while the House may propose phasing out CPB funding. A final resolution is far off, with Congress expected to begin work on its appropriations bills this summer.

**Xalapa's Avenida Murillo Vidal Project: Timeline and Details**
The Xalapa city government has announced a new program of 60 projects, with 27 in the first phase, to be completed by the end of 2025. The Program General de Inversión (PGI) includes works in various parts of the city, with a total investment of 450 million pesos. The project on Avenida Murillo Vidal is expected to be completed on July 30, 2025, and has been ongoing since March 3, 2025. According to the Sistema de Consulta de Obras y Acciones Municipales de Veracruz, the project's duration will be almost five months. The city government aims to mitigate traffic congestion during peak hours by implementing measures such as one-way streets and alternative routes. 'We are working to minimize the impact of these works on the population,' said the city government. The project is funded by the Fondo de Aportaciones para el Fortalecimiento de los Municipios y de las Demarcaciones Territoriales del Distrito Federal (FORTAMUNDF), with an allocation of 11,797,033.40 pesos.

**L9 Metro Line in Barcelona: Tunnel Boring Machine to Resume Work in Fall**
The tunnel boring machine for the L9 metro line in Barcelona has been stopped in Mandri due to a mechanical issue and will not resume work until the summer. However, the L9 line is still advancing in other areas. The regional minister for Territory, Sílvia Paneque, visited the future Plaça de Maragall station, where the civil work is almost complete. The goal is to have trains run from Sagrera to Guinardó-Hospital de Sant Pau by 2027. If the tunnel boring machine resumes work in the fall, the regional government will meet its announced deadline of August 2024. The machine was originally expected to arrive in Sant Gervasi-Bonanova in the summer of 2023, but it arrived in Mandri in the summer of 2024. The L9 and L10 lines currently have 35 stations, 38 kilometers of track, and 27 million annual validations. The project is expected to be completed with 15 more stations, and the goal is to reach 113 million annual trips, four times the current number. The next section to be completed is 3.6 kilometers between La Sagrera TAV and Guinardó-Hospital de Sant Pau, which is expected to be operational in 2027. The regional minister said, 'The will of the Govern is that from the Sagrera stop, the trains advance to Guinardó-Hospital de Sant Pau in 2027.'

**Berlin Senate Stops Kiezblock Project Due to Concerns Over Resident Needs**
The Berlin Senate has stopped the Kiezblock project in the Mitte district, which aimed to reduce car traffic and increase the attractiveness of the neighborhoods. The project, which was planned to be completed by spring 2026, has been canceled due to concerns that it did not adequately consider the needs of residents, including the necessary traffic and delivery routes, waste collection, and emergency services. Verkehrssenatorin Ute Bonde stated, 'Important aspects of social coexistence and the daily needs of the affected residents were not sufficiently taken into account.' The project's budget of around 500,000 euros will be withdrawn. Existing Kiezblocks will not be dismantled, and there is a possibility of revising and continuing the project in the future.

**Under attack, public media makes its case to Congress and the courts**
Public media officials are lobbying Congress to preserve federal funding despite pressure from President Trump, who has called NPR and PBS programming 'radical propaganda' and characterized federal spending on public media as a waste of taxpayer dollars. The White House has also asserted its power to fire three of the five board members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and decreed that it should stop subsidizing NPR and PBS. CPB officials say the order is invalid and illegal and plan to ignore it; PBS and NPR say they will fight it. Local public broadcasting stations rely heavily on federal funding, with some receiving up to 25% of their annual revenues from the federal government. If the funding is cut, stations could face the choice of losing a significant amount of revenues or a huge chunk of their programming schedule. A federal judge has heard a legal challenge to Trump's firing of the CPB board members, and the nonprofit corporation contends that those firings are illegal because CPB is not part of the federal government. 'I'm extremely worried about it,' said Dina Polkinghorne, the interim co-general manager of a station in rural Philo, Calif. 'I've never seen community radio in such a perilous situation.'

**Executive order directs cancellation of federal funding to PBS, NPR**
The federal government has allocated $535 million to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for the current fiscal year, fully funding it through September 30, 2027. However, the administration has attempted to cancel federal funding to PBS and NPR, which serve as key components of emergency and disaster response systems and reach more than 99 percent of the population. The CPB board has filed a lawsuit against the administration, stating that 'CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority.' According to the CPB board, Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government. The CPB board also cited a congressional provision that prohibits the federal government from exercising direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over CPB or its grantees or contractors.

The Trump administration has issued an executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Board of Directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease Federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order requires the CPB Board to ensure that licensees and permittees of public radio and television stations do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS. The heads of all agencies must also identify any remaining grants or funding instruments with NPR or PBS and determine whether they are in compliance with the terms of those instruments. Additionally, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must determine whether NPR and PBS are complying with the statutory mandate against employment discrimination and take corrective action if necessary.

**Trump executive order strips federal funds from NPR, PBS. What does that mean in MS?**
President Donald Trump signed an executive order to stop providing federal funds to National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order claims that the organizations provide left-wing biased news and donate to the Democratic party. However, NPR and PBS have vowed to challenge the order, citing the law that created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) as a private nonprofit that manages federal public broadcasting investment. The CPB disburses public funds to PBS, NPR, and local public TV and radio stations. The organizations argue that the order threatens their ability to serve the American public with educational programming. According to NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher, 'NPR programming is essential to the economic viability of its 246 Member organizations, generating on average 50% of all public radio listening, despite only accounting for roughly 25% of station programming.' The CPB receives $535 million in funding for fiscal year 2025, which is a small fraction of the federal budget. The order is part of a long-term push to get rid of public broadcasting, with the Project 2025 authors arguing that it only provides content for the very left. Mississippi Public Broadcasting, which is owned by the Mississippi Authority for Educational Television, receives about 18% of its budget from federal funding, and a decrease in funding would adversely affect its operation.

**Donald Trump seeks to cut public funding for NPR and PBS**
US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to stop all public funding, direct or indirect, to NPR and PBS, the US public radio and television networks. Trump's order asks the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to review the current year's funding and prohibits all federal agencies from financing PBS and NPR's activities. Trump claims that the two networks spread biased content using taxpayer money, including programs about racism, social inclusion, and gender identity, which he considers 'illegal' according to his administration. However, it is unclear how the executive order will affect the networks immediately, as the funding for CPB is allocated every two years by Congress and the current funding for NPR and PBS is already set until 2027. Paula Kerger, CEO of PBS, stated that about 15% of the public network's budget comes from public funds, while the rest comes from donations or sponsors.

The order, issued on May 1, 2025, directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to cease all federal funding for NPR and PBS by June 30, 2025. The CPB, which disperses $535 million in taxpayer funds annually, is emphasizing its independence from federal control as it challenges the legality of the order and the actions taken against its board members.

**Donald Trump Orders End to Federal Funding for PBS and NPR**
US President Donald Trump has signed a decree ordering the federal government to stop funding two public media networks, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the National Public Radio (NPR), which he accuses of being biased. 'I instruct the CPB board of directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease federal funding of NPR and PBS,' the text states, adding that 'no media enjoys a guaranteed right to public funding under the Constitution.' The CPB is the manager of federal investment in public broadcasting, and its budget has already been approved by Congress until 2027, raising doubts about the decree's effectiveness. The decree demands that the CPB 'cancel existing direct funding to the extent authorized by law and refuse to provide future funding.' 'The order requires the CPB to revise its 2025 general provisions to explicitly prohibit direct or indirect funding of NPR and PBS,' according to a White House document. This is the largest escalation yet of the White House's attack on the media, estimates Politico. The decree, which will likely be challenged in court, is the latest in a series of attacks on traditional media by the Trump administration. The White House claims that NPR and PBS have used taxpayer money to promote left-wing activism and propaganda, citing an example where the PBS News Hour used the term 'far-right' 162 times in six months, but 'far-left' only six times.' The decree also argues that federal funding of media is 'outdated, unnecessary, and corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence' in a 'rich, diverse, and innovative' media landscape. Over 40 million Americans listen to NPR each week, and 36 million watch PBS each month, according to estimates from the networks. The NPR director, Katherine Maher, estimated in March that the radio would receive around $120 million from the CPB in 2025, 'less than 5% of its budget.'

**Trump Signs Executive Order to End Funding for NPR and PBS**
US President Trump has signed an executive order to end federal funding for public media NPR and PBS, claiming they spread 'radical propaganda'. The order states that with the current diversity of media, 'government funding of the media is not only outdated and unnecessary, but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence'. Trump argues that 'taxpayers have a right to expect that if their taxes fund public radio and television, it will be with fair, accurate, impartial, and non-partisan news'. The order also accuses NPR and PBS of not presenting 'an equitable, precise, or impartial portrait of current events to citizen taxpayers'. To enforce the order, the CPB Board will review the eligibility criteria for community television and radio subsidies by June 30, 2025, to prohibit direct or indirect funding of NPR and PBS. Additionally, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will determine if the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio comply with the law requiring equal employment opportunities, and take corrective measures if necessary.
