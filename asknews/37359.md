According to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce, US new home sales increased by 10.9% in April 2025, with a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 74.3 million, exceeding market expectations of 69.3 million.

Market analysts believe that if interest rates do not rise further, new home sales are likely to maintain steady growth in the coming months.

**Trump's Plan to Restore US Manufacturing**
US President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claim that high tariffs can restore US manufacturing, creating enough jobs to employ all federal workers being laid off by Elon Musk. However, according to Investopedia, the US would need 22 million additional workers to reach 1970s manufacturing levels, with 7.2 million unemployed Americans in April 2025. This would require Trump to find 14.8 million additional workers, or 11.8 million if he fires all federal workers. The article suggests that the only way to achieve this is through mass immigration, which Trump's base opposes. The article implies that the true motivation behind Trump's plan is to benefit the oligarchy with a massive tax cut, and that the tariffs are a ruse to maintain a 'kayfabe' of job creation.

**France's Restaurant Industry Faces Chronic Labor Shortage**
The French restaurant industry is facing a chronic labor shortage, with 336,000 job openings expected in 2025. According to France Travail, these positions are in contracts with a duration of more than six months or indefinite contracts. This shortage is due to a high turnover rate, difficulties in attracting workers, and constant pressure on recruitment. The French administration has published a list of 80 jobs in high demand, including cooks, servers, kitchen assistants, and dishwashers, which will allow foreign workers to regularize their status if they have at least 12 months of pay stubs and three years of residence in France. Employers are forced to stabilize their workforce, as many restaurateurs are struggling with a chronic lack of staff. Laurent Frechet, manager of a Parisian establishment and president of the GNI's restaurant branch, says that he has accompanied several employees in their regularization process, which allows him to retain experienced staff and avoid service disruptions. Didier Roeckel, owner of the La Couronne restaurant in Scherwiller, confirms this trend, stating that the lack of official recognition of the tense nature of these jobs until recently has penalized recruiters. However, the list has some limitations, as only the job of cook is recognized as being in high demand in the Île-de-France region, while other functions such as dishwashers, chefs de rang, and maîtres d'hôtel are not included. This restriction is difficult to understand for restaurant managers, who are struggling to recruit certain profiles essential to their daily functioning.

**20,000 Layoffs Amid â€œStrongâ€ Jobs Report? What Wall Street Isn't Telling You**
The US economy added 177,000 jobs in April, keeping the unemployment rate at 4.2%. However, beneath the surface, the job market is showing signs of softness. Manufacturing output dropped to its worst level since 2020, and job losses in that sector are increasing. Wage growth is slowing, and job openings are at their lowest level since last fall. Companies are bracing for the impact, with United Parcel Service (UPS) planning to lay off 20,000 workers, citing weaker e-commerce demand. Economists warn that the real impact of Trump's tariffs and federal belt-tightening hasn't even hit yet. The Federal Reserve is holding rates steady, but investors should watch the second half of 2025 closely, as the layoffs we're seeing today might be the opening act.

**April Jobs Report Belies Democrats' Doom-and-Gloom Narrative on Economy, Tariffs, and Recession**
The April 2025 jobs report showed a strong economy, surpassing expectations with 177,000 new jobs added, beating Wall Street forecasts. The labor force participation rate increased to 62.6%, and the household employment survey revealed a surge of 436,000 more employed workers. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, 'This is the second month in a row where the jobs report has beat expectations. Wages are continuing to rise and labor force participation is increasing.' Economist Steve Moore praised the report, saying, 'This is an amazing report. The labor force participation rate rose. So, this is a really strong number.' The report also showed a surge in native-born employment, which soared by more than one million, and hourly earnings increased to $36.06, showing that American workers are taking home bigger paychecks under Trump's policies. Annual wage growth held steady at 3.8%, maintaining a healthy pace in line with inflation targets.

**US Job Openings Fall, Raising Chances of Interest Rate Cut**
The number of job openings in the US fell to 7.2 million in March, below the revised 7.48 million in February (previously reported as 7.5 million). According to the US Department of Labor's Jolts report, this is below market expectations of 7.48 million job openings. The decline in job openings is seen as a sign of a slowdown in economic activity, increasing the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Investors are betting on four 0.25 percentage point cuts in 2025, which would bring the interest rate to between 3.25% and 3.5% by the end of the year. This has led to increased interest in risk assets, such as stocks, with the Ibovespa index rising 0.74% to 136,013 points. The dollar has also fallen 0.36% against the real, trading at R$ 5.62.

**US Job Openings Decline, but Layoffs Fall, Suggesting Resilient Labor Market**
The number of job openings in the US decreased by 7.192 million in March compared to 7.480 million in February, according to the latest 'Jolts' report from the US Department of Labor. However, the decline in layoffs suggests that the labor market remains solid despite concerns over US trade policy. Economists had predicted 7.480 million job openings in February. Hiring increased by only 41,000 to 5.411 million, showing that companies are hesitant to expand their workforce due to the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Layoffs decreased by 222,000 to 1.558 million, indicating a resilient labor market. Economists expect the tariffs to drive up prices and disrupt supply chains, which will likely impact the job market in the coming months. The freeze on hiring and mass layoffs of federal employees as part of the Trump administration's unprecedented campaign to drastically reduce government staff will also weaken the labor market's resilience. According to a Reuters survey, the upcoming employment report on Friday is expected to show a non-agricultural employment increase of 130,000 in April, following a 228,000 increase in March, with the unemployment rate remaining stable at 4.2%.

The US job market showed a slight decline in February, with 7.6 million job openings, down from 7.8 million in January and 8.4 million a year earlier. The number of vacancies has been steadily decreasing since peaking at 12.2 million in March 2022. Despite the slowdown, the job market remains healthy, but the outlook for hiring is uncertain due to factors such as trade wars, federal workforce purges, and immigration policies. As stated by the article, the American job market has proven 'surprisingly durable' but has 'clearly lost momentum' from the previous hiring frenzy.

**February US job openings slip to 7.6M, consistent with a healthy but decelerating job market**
The number of job openings in the US fell to 7.6 million in February, down from 7.8 million in January and 8.4 million a year earlier, according to the Labor Department. This decline is consistent with a healthy but decelerating job market. Economist Robert Frick noted, 'The jobs market remains the economy's bulwark, and while it's eroding slowly, it's not showing cracks that foreshadow recession.' However, economists are cautious about the outlook for 2025, citing concerns that President Trump's trade wars will push up prices and stunt economic growth. The unemployment rate is forecast to tick up to 4.2% in March, according to a survey of forecasters by FactSet. Employers are expected to add 125,000 jobs last month, down from 151,000 in February and an average of 168,000 a month in 2024.

**Will a labor crunch derail plans to upgrade US infrastructure?**
The US construction industry is facing a historic and widening labor shortfall, with over 440,000 job openings in April 2024. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is expected to create hundreds of thousands of additional jobs each year, peaking at over 300,000 in 2027 and 2028. However, the industry is struggling to find qualified workers, with a shortage of materials and labor at various points along the construction value chain. McKinsey research suggests that the labor strain caused by the BIL could be disproportionately concentrated in states that manufacture and export materials to states with limited manufacturing capacity. To address this challenge, the industry could focus on reskilling and upskilling existing workers, attracting new people, and pulling people currently on the sidelines back into the labor force. Additionally, companies could improve productivity by adopting technology, such as digital design and automation of material production processes, and by streamlining their operations through centralized procurement planning and 'dig once' approaches.

**US job market likely began the year strong, but faces cloudier future**
The US labor market likely started 2025 with decent job growth, but faces a cloudier future due to potential trade wars and a federal hiring freeze. According to a survey of economists, the Labor Department's January employment numbers will show 170,000 new jobs, a downshift from 2024's average of 186,000. The unemployment rate is expected to remain low at 4.1%. However, economists are concerned about the impact of tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico, which could rekindle inflation and affect economic growth. The job market has already cooled from the red-hot days of 2021-2023, with American payrolls increasing by 2.2 million last year, down from 3 million in 2023. Employers are posting fewer jobs, and the number of people quitting has fallen from a record 4.5 million to 3.2 million. As the labor market cools, workers are losing confidence in their ability to find better pay or working conditions by changing jobs. 'The economy is kicking off 2025 in good shape,' said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. However, the future is uncertain, and the Labor Department's revisions to job creation from April 2023 through March 2024 will show that job creation was not as strong as originally reported.
