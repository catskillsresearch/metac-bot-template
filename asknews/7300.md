Bill Gates announced that he will donate 99% of his fortune, worth approximately $200 billion, to Africa by 2045. The funds will be invested in projects promoting health and education, particularly in areas such as maternal and child well-being, nutrition, and healthcare system strengthening. Gates encouraged young Africans to innovate and use Artificial Intelligence to improve healthcare, citing Rwanda as an example where AI-powered ultrasound is used to identify high-risk pregnancies.

**Bill Gates to Donate Majority of Wealth to Improve Healthcare and Education in Africa**
Bill Gates, the 69-year-old co-founder of Microsoft, announced that the majority of his wealth, estimated at around $200 billion (750 billion Saudi riyals), will be invested over the next two decades to improve healthcare and education services in Africa. Gates stated, 'Liberating human potential through health and education paves the way for the prosperity of all African countries,' and called on young innovators to think about how to use artificial intelligence to improve healthcare across the continent. Gates also announced his intention to donate 99% of his wealth by 2045, the year his foundation plans to complete its activities. Graca Machel, the wife of Mozambique's former president, welcomed this announcement, considering it a crucial support in 'a time of crisis,' emphasizing the need for Gates to continue supporting development and transformation efforts in Africa. Gates' foundation will focus on promoting primary healthcare, particularly maternal health and nutrition before and during pregnancy, as well as ensuring child nutrition during the first years of life. Gates encouraged African youth to benefit from digital revolution experiences, citing the role of mobile phones in transforming the financial services sector, and urged them to introduce artificial intelligence into modern healthcare systems. He provided an example of this in Rwanda, which uses artificial intelligence in ultrasound tests to detect high-risk pregnancies early. Gates' foundation has identified three main priorities: eliminating preventable maternal and child deaths, protecting future generations from deadly infectious diseases, and lifting millions of people out of poverty. The foundation plans to complete its activities by the end of 20 years from now.

**CriteriaCaixa Reviewing Strategic Plan to Align with Fundación La Caixa's Needs**
CriteriaCaixa, the largest private holding company in Spain, is reviewing its strategic plan to align it with the needs of Fundación La Caixa and its extensive social work. The company's president, Francisco Reynés, who was recently appointed vice president of CriteriaCaixa, is studying to adapt the plan, which is expected to be completed before the end of the year. The new plan will be presented once the Fundación La Caixa has outlined its own roadmap, and it will be subject to this. Fundación La Caixa is currently developing a plan for the period 2025-2030, which will analyze what has been achieved so far and what is still valid, and will adapt the social programs to the new needs of society. CriteriaCaixa has assets of 30,400 million euros and participates in CaixaBank, Naturgy, Telefónica, ACS, and Colonial, among others. The Fundación La Caixa, presided over by Isidro Fainé, is the third-largest private foundation in the world in terms of assets and social work, after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. CriteriaCaixa manages the business assets of the Fundación and has as its priority to provide the economic resources that allow its social action. Its social budget is already 655 million euros annually. Fainé has reorganized the Fundación and Criteria to ensure the social work, which is the legacy of the old savings bank La Caixa, will endure over time. The new plan will be adapted to the new environment and will be aligned with the Fundación's plan, not the other way around. The Fundación's plan is being developed in a participatory manner, with the involvement of workers and the patronage, assisted by an external advisor to dynamize the discussion.

**Bill Gates to Donate 99% of His Wealth to Philanthropy by 2045**
Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and a billionaire, plans to donate 99% of his wealth, approximately $200 billion, to support the world's poorest people by December 31, 2045. After that, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will cease operations. According to Reuters, Gates stated that his foundation will complete its activities by the end of 2045, having spent all its funds on philanthropy. This initiative is a response to the global aid reduction, particularly due to the US USAID funding cuts and similar initiatives being wound down by other countries. Gates is concerned about the rising mortality rate due to resource shortages and is prioritizing the fight against polio, where his foundation is the largest donor, and the US was the second-largest funder. 'We need them to recommit to this cause, or else the disease will spread again,' Gates emphasized.

**Bill Gates Pledges to Donate Entire Fortune by 2045**
Bill Gates announced that he will donate his entire fortune by 2045. Since its inception in 2000, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has channeled over $1 billion in global projects, particularly in healthcare policies. According to the United Nations, one of its major achievements has been the reduction of nearly 50% in preventable infant deaths between 2000 and 2020. Gates recognized that the foundation's work has been 'more impactful than I expected', describing this stage of his life as his 'second and last career'. However, the foundation has faced criticism from experts and academics who questioned the power of a private fortune like Gates' over global health and development priorities. Gates responded, 'As any private citizen, I can decide how to spend the money I earned. Is it bad? Is it not a worthy cause? People can criticize it'. The foundation's internal structure has undergone significant changes, including the departure of Warren Buffett as trustee in 2021 and Melinda French Gates' exit in 2024 to focus on Pivotal Ventures. The new executive director, Mark Suzman, emphasized the focus on projects with proven impact and avoiding resource dispersion. Gates expressed concern about the decline of international aid, conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and global economic instability, saying, 'The greatest uncertainty is the generosity towards global health. Will it continue to decline or can we restore it?' The foundation's plan for the next 20 years includes eradicating polio, combating malaria, and reducing malnutrition, which exacerbate vulnerability in childhood. Gates stated, 'Acting now not only saves lives but also enables future philanthropists to address emerging challenges'. He emphasized the importance of developing low-cost solutions and making them accessible to those who need them. Despite the challenging context, Gates and Suzman reaffirmed their faith in the transformative power of philanthropy: 'It requires renewing the commitment of those who have the means to help the most vulnerable', concluded Gates.

**Bill Gates Announces Plans to Donate Nearly All of His Fortune by 2045**
Bill Gates has announced that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will cease operations by 2045 and has pledged to donate nearly all of his fortune by that date. He has encouraged wealthy individuals to take his place in philanthropy, noting that large fortunes are no longer being used for charitable and humanitarian work as they were 20 years ago.

Gates also emphasized the importance of using artificial intelligence for the greater good, saying 'it can provide an excellent personal doctor in a remote area of the world, which could be better than what rich countries have.' The foundation plans to spend over $200 billion in the next 20 years, accelerating its mission to improve public health before closing in 2045.
