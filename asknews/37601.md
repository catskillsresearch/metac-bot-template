**Unicaja Forecasts 2.4% Regional GDP Growth for Castilla-La Mancha in 2025**
Unicaja forecasts a 2.4% increase in the regional GDP (PIB) for Castilla-La Mancha in 2025, along with a 1.9% increase in employment, and a unemployment rate of 12.1%. According to the bank's seventh edition of its 'Previsiones económicas de Castilla-La Mancha' report, the regional economy has grown by 3% in 2024. For 2026, the first estimates place the regional GDP growth rate at 1.9% and employment growth at 1.6%, with an unemployment rate of 11.2%. At the provincial level, the growth rates for 2025 are expected to range from 1.9% in Cuenca to 2.8% in Guadalajara, with Toledo (2.6%) and Ciudad Real (2.5%) also exceeding the regional average. The report notes that the economic prospects for the next quarters are 'uncertain' and that one of the main risks to growth projections is a 'greater fragmentation of the global economy'. According to Unicaja, a significant increase in global trade barriers would affect global growth and increase inflation, leading to a more restrictive monetary policy. In the case of Castilla-La Mancha, the report highlights that, according to estimates from the Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal (AIReF), the regional economy maintained a stable growth rate in the second half of 2024, with the PIB growing by 0.7% in the third quarter and 0.9% in the fourth quarter, and an annual growth rate of 3.4%.

**OECD Lowers Global Growth Forecast: 2.9% GDP Increase Predicted for 2025**
The OECD has revised downward its forecast for global economic growth, predicting a 2.9% increase in the world's GDP in 2025. The organization warns that if current trends persist, they could significantly slow down economic prospects. Higher-than-expected inflation is also expected, with a 4.2% inflation rate predicted for 2025 and 3.2% for 2026. The OECD highlights the main risks as 'further escalation of commercial tensions, sudden changes in economic policies, and a more cautious behavior from families and businesses.' Italy's growth prospects are also less encouraging, with a predicted 0.6% increase in GDP in 2025 and 0.7% in 2026. The report explains that the global slowdown in trade and the weakness of demand from major European partners will negatively affect Italian exports. However, some positive factors could support domestic growth, such as the increase in real wages, which should support family consumption, and the acceleration of projects under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, a program financed by the European Union to support post-pandemic recovery.

**OECD Projects Lower Growth and Higher Inflation for Argentina in 2025**
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has projected a 5.2% economic growth for Argentina in 2025, below the previous estimate, and an inflation rate of 36.6%, higher than the previous calculation. The OECD's forecast implies a worsening of the projections made in the last report in March, when it expected a 5.7% GDP growth and an inflation estimate of 28.4%. The new report reflects a decline in economic growth of five-tenths below the expected in March and an inflation of 8.2 percentage points above the previous forecast. For 2026, the OECD projects a 4.3% GDP growth, and a deeper deceleration of price variation, predicting a rise of 14.9%. The OECD supports the direction of the libertarian government led by Javier Milei, and indicates that the recovery of economic activity will be driven by the recovery of private consumption and investment, sustained by an increase in real disposable income, more favorable financing conditions, and an improving business environment. The OECD also suggests increasing taxes on individuals, proposing to replace distorting taxes with broader bases on income and consumption. 'Ampliar la base imponible del impuesto sobre la renta de las personas físicas podría aumentar la recaudación de forma progresiva y permitiría reducir los impuestos distorsionantes e ineficientes que obstaculizan la inversión', they said. 'Eliminar las exenciones del IVA podría generar ingresos adicionales'.

**Analysts Lower GDP Forecast Due to Economic Uncertainty**
Analysts surveyed by the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) have lowered their forecast for the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) due to the likelihood of economic contraction between the second and third quarters of the year, as well as public insecurity and a slower growth rate in the United States. The consensus of 44 economic analysis and consulting groups adjusted their estimate for the GDP this year from 0.20% to 0.18%. For 2026, the estimate was revised from 1.50% to 1.41%, while for 2027 it remained the same at 1.80%. However, the forecast improved for the next 10 years, reaching 1.85%. The analysts weighed both internal and external factors in a context of great local and global uncertainty. The incidence of public insecurity as a limiting factor for economic activity increased from 13.7% to 15.9%, while the uncertainty about the internal economic situation advanced from 5.4% to 9.8%. As a result, the consensus reduced the projection of the US GDP for the third time this year, from 1.70% to 1.45% for 2025. The lowest projection points to a minimum growth of 0.60%, while the highest projection is 2%.

**Germany Ranks Third from Last in OECD's Growth Forecast for 2025**
According to the OECD, Germany will be one of the slowest-growing industrial nations this year, with a GDP growth of 0.4%. This is despite the country's economy starting the year with a strong growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. Germany ranks third from last in the OECD's growth forecast for 2025, along with Mexico. Austria and Norway are behind them. The OECD expects a growth of 1.2% in 2026, up from the previously expected 1.1%. Isabell Koske and Robert Grundke, OECD experts for Germany, said, 'The relatively quick formation of a functional government and the reform of the debt brake have reduced political uncertainty and improved investor and consumer confidence.' They added, 'We also expect public investments in defense and infrastructure to increase strongly this year and next year, which will contribute to an economic boost.' However, they noted that these positive signals are offset by high trade policy uncertainty, citing the announced high tariffs by US President Donald Trump. The OECD forecasts global economic growth of 2.9% in both 2025 and 2026, down from 3.3% last year. The organization had previously expected 3.1% and 3.0% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The OECD also expects the US economy to grow by 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026. For their calculations, they assume that the tariffs introduced in mid-May will remain in place.

**Argentina's Economy Shows Signs of Recovery, According to OECD Report**
According to the OECD, Argentina's economy began to recover in the third quarter of 2024, after a strong contraction in the first half of the year. The rebound was reflected in an annualized growth of 18% in that quarter, followed by a rise above 5% in the fourth quarter. In the fiscal area, the government achieved a financial surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2024 and maintains its commitment to achieving a primary surplus in 2025. The monetary policy also changed, with the elimination of monetary emission and the adoption of a currency band regime that contemplates a monthly depreciation of 1%. The OECD projects an inflation rate of 36.6% for 2025, above the 29% previously estimated, but considers that the disinflation process will continue. For 2026, it expects a price increase of 14.9%, still high compared to the G20 average. The OECD also expects fixed investment to grow by 21.7% in 2025 and 14.9% in 2026, while exports will increase by 11.2% next year and 6.4% the following year. Imports will also rise, reflecting a recovery of purchasing power and a decrease in state intervention in trade. Despite the optimism, the OECD warns about certain structural challenges pending: a real exchange rate that could affect external competitiveness, the need to expand the tax base, reduce subsidies and fiscal distortions, and advance in a greater opening of the services sector. Finally, the report notes that the improvement in the business climate, the recovery of private sector credit, and the increased confidence of consumers mark a path of recovery that, although uncertain, shows positive signs in the medium term.

**BBVA Forecasts 2.8% GDP Growth and 40,000 Jobs in Castilla-La Mancha by 2026**
BBVA forecasts a 2.8% growth in the GDP of Castilla-La Mancha and the creation of 40,000 jobs until 2026. The macroeconomic evolution for the region predicts a 2.8% growth in GDP this year and 1.6% for next year. The unemployment rate in the autonomous community is expected to drop to 11.6% by 2026. According to Miguel Cardoso, chief economist of BBVA Research for Spain, the improvement in the regional economy is due to 'heterogeneity' and is particularly significant in the provinces of Toledo and Guadalajara, which are bordering Madrid and benefiting from the 'border effect'. The economist notes that the job market in certain areas of both provinces is growing at a rate of 3% per year, 'even above the Spanish average'. However, there is 'weakness in employment' in the provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real. Approximately half of the created jobs have been taken by workers born in third countries, whose presence has been decisive in the development of the services sector. Cardoso estimates that 70% of the improvement in GDP between 2019 and 2026, a growth rate of 2.5% per year, is due to the increase in population. The internal demand, the pull of the public sector, services, and tourism expenditure drive a growth that, according to BBVA's forecast, exceeded the national average in 2024, with a 3.4% annual growth in the GDP of Castilla-La Mancha, two-tenths more than the Spanish average.

**OECD says India's real GDP projected to grow by 6.3% in this fiscal year**
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has projected India's real GDP to grow by 6.3% in fiscal year 2025-26 and 6.4% in 2026-27. The growth is expected to be driven by private consumption, which will be strengthened by rising real incomes and moderate inflation. Investment will also be supported by declining interest rates and public capital spending. However, higher US tariffs will weigh on exports. The OECD noted that private consumption is supported by rising real incomes and lower personal income taxes, and investment will remain strong, bolstered by easing financial conditions. Headline inflation is projected to average 4.1% in FY2025-26 and 4.0% in FY2026-27. The central bank may reduce the policy rate towards a more neutral level, with a further 25-basis point cut expected by the end of 2025.

**Banxico Lowers Economic Growth Forecast for 2025**
The Bank of Mexico (Banxico) has lowered its economic growth forecast for 2025, expecting a 0.1% increase in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), down from the previous estimate of 0.6%. The bank also revised its forecast for 2026, expecting a 0.9% growth rate, down from the previous estimate of 1.8%. According to Banxico, the economic weakness is due to the significant challenges posed by the change in commercial policy in the United States, including the imposition of tariffs on most imports and the possibility of additional measures. Banxico stated, 'Los pronósticos para la inflación en general y subyacente publicados en el anuncio de política monetaria del 15 de mayo de 2025 se mantienen vigentes para este informe trimestral.' (The forecasts for general and underlying inflation published in the monetary policy announcement on May 15, 2025 remain valid for this quarterly report.) The bank also maintained its inflation target of 3% for the third quarter of 2026.

**GDPNow Forecast Jumps to 3.8 Percent on Improved Trade Data**
The GDPNow forecast has surged 1.6 percentage points to 3.8 percent due to improved import-export data. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025 is 3.8 percent, up from 2.2 percent. The nowcast of the contribution of net exports to second-quarter real GDP growth increased from -0.64 percentage points to 1.45 percentage points, while the nowcasts of second-quarter real personal consumption expenditures growth and second-quarter real gross private domestic investment growth declined. The decline in imports fueled contributions to GDP, with the GDPNow model expected an even better result. According to the article, 'When I saw these details, I was pretty certain GDP forecasts would surge, and they did.' The author notes that GDPNow has had a 'very hot hand with its model,' and it will be interesting to see next month's revisions as well as upcoming retail sales numbers.

**JPMorgan Cuts US GDP Growth Projections Amid Trade Uncertainty**
JPMorgan has revised down its growth projections for the US economy in a report called 'Segure o champanhe'. The bank has reduced its estimate of real GDP growth in 2025 by 0.3 percentage points, projecting growth at 1.6%. Michael Feroli, the bank's economist, notes that the uncertainty surrounding trade policy has been a major factor in the revision. He states, 'In retrospect, we may end up waiting too long. However, this in itself is a reason to reduce the growth outlook, as the greater uncertainty in trade policy should weigh on activity growth, especially for capital expenditures.' Feroli also notes that existing tariffs on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican imports, as well as those on steel and aluminum, will increase overall inflation and reduce consumer purchasing power. He expects these measures to increase consumer prices by 0.2 percentage points for the year, with most of the effect concentrated in the second quarter. The economist believes that this increase in inflation will be partially offset by a decline in savings rates. The third and final channel through which the trade conflict will weigh on activity growth is through retaliatory measures by foreign trading partners, which will harm the growth of exports. The combination of these three effects has led the bank to reduce its estimate of real GDP growth in 2025 by 0.3 percentage points, projecting growth at 1.6%. The bank has also revised down its employment growth forecast by 25,000 jobs per month, to around 100,000 per month. As a result, the bank now expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.4%, 0.2 percentage points higher than its previous forecast. Feroli concludes, 'The combination of higher inflation and weaker employment growth creates a dilemma for the Fed.'

**What the recent GDP data revisions reveal**
The National Statistical Office (NSO) released revised GDP data for 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25, showing an upward revision in real GDP growth rates. The third quarter growth of 6.2% is a clear improvement over the second quarter growth of 5.6%. However, the required growth in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) for the implied fourth quarter GDP growth of 7.6% seems difficult to achieve. The contribution of investment to growth can also be measured, and the required contribution of 2.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter would depend largely on government investment growth. The Government of India has incurred ₹7.57 lakh crore of capital expenditure up to January 2025, but an additional ₹2.61 lakh crore needs to be spent in the remaining two months to reach the revised estimate level of ₹10.18 lakh crore. If the government's investment expenditure falls short, the implied fourth quarter GDP growth of 7.6% may not be realised. The full year growth of 6.5% as per the second advance estimates may have to be revised downwards. The Economic Survey has given a range of 6.3%-6.8% with a mid-point of 6.55% for real GDP growth in 2025-26, which appears feasible provided government investment shows healthy growth. As of now, the medium-term potential growth appears to be 6.5%. It is argued that the PFCE to GDP ratio should rise to increase growth, but this overlooks the fact that investment demand will fall. The medium-term growth strategy should focus on increasing saving and investment rates.

**India's growth becoming more balanced as private consumption's share in GDP rises 2025: Report**
According to a Crisil report, India's growth is becoming more balanced as private consumption's share in GDP rose in fiscal 2025. The expected real GDP growth this fiscal is revised to 6.5%, taking it closer to the pre-pandemic average of 6.6%. Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, Crisil, said, 'We expect the GDP growth at 6.5 per cent next fiscal, supported by normal monsoons, lower food inflation and rate cuts of 75-100 basis points in the current cycle.' However, Joshi also mentioned that the complexity of risks from tariff actions creates a downside bias to their forecasts. The GDP growth accelerated to 6.2% in the third quarter of 2024-25, up from 5.6% in the second quarter. The growth rate for 2024-25 is now estimated at 6.5%, while the economic growth rate for 2023-24 has been revised to a 12-year high of 8.2%.

**GDP grows 6.2% in Q3; FY25 output still seen at a four-year low of 6.5%**
India's economy showed steady progress in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25, with real GDP increasing by 6.2 per cent, according to the National Statistics Office (NSO). However, despite this positive momentum, the full-year GDP growth forecast is projected to be at a four-year low of 6.5 per cent, indicating a moderation in the post-pandemic recovery. The construction industry experienced significant growth of 8.6 per cent, while manufacturing and the financial sector also showed positive growth. The services sector and private final consumption expenditure also continued to recover, with a 7.6 per cent increase in PFCE. Economists suggest that factors such as declining external demand, tighter monetary policy, and cautious business sentiment contribute to this relative slowdown. Nevertheless, sustained government spending on infrastructure, digitalisation, and financial inclusion is expected to cushion external pressures.

**Q3FY25 GDP Estimates | Was Q2 Slowdown A One-Off? Q3 GDP To Show Real Economic Trend**
The Indian economy is expected to show a tepid growth of around 6% in the third quarter of the current fiscal year, with improvement in capital expenditure, government spending, and strong rural demand. Most analysts estimate GDP growth in the range of 6.2% to 6.4% for the October to December 2024 quarter, with a slight increase from the previous quarter. According to a poll of 13 economists, GDP growth is expected to be 6.4% for the final quarter of 2024, a one percentage point increase from the previous quarter but still below the 8.6% growth recorded a year ago, as said by Siddharth Zarabi, Editor, Business Today, in conversation with Indranil Pan, Chief Economist at YES Bank, and Sunil Sinha, Economist. 'This marks a one percentage point increase from the previous quarter but remains over 200 basis points below the 8.6% growth recorded a year ago,' said Zarabi. The National Statistics Office will release the second advance estimates of annual GDP for FY2024-25 and the quarterly GDP estimates for the quarter October-December of 2024-25 on February 28.
