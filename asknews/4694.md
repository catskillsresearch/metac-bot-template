**As upbeat Indian economy closes gap with Japan, Germany, the real test will be at the podium**
India's economy is expected to surpass Japan's and close the gap with Germany, becoming the third-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP. According to the IMF, India's nominal GDP is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by FY26, while Germany's is expected to be $4.74 trillion. India's growth is driven by domestic consumption, services, and digitization, with a robust current account buffer and a rising trade surplus. However, challenges such as job creation, fiscal slippage, and institutional bottlenecks loom large. Experts warn that India must invest in human capital, strengthen its fiscal fundamentals, and deepen financial inclusion to truly consolidate its position in the top three. If India can achieve an 8% nominal GDP growth rate and maintain a stable rupee, its economy could cross $6.8 trillion-$7 trillion by 2030, firmly establishing it as the world's third-largest economy.

**By focusing on GDP, India misses the point**
India has been claimed to have overtaken Japan as the world's fourth-largest economy by the Indian policy think tank NITI Aayog, citing International Monetary Fund (IMF) data. However, according to the IMF's World Economic Outlook report, India is still behind Japan's economy, with the leapfrogging expected to happen in 2026. The IMF estimates India's GDP to reach $4.187 trillion in fiscal year 2026, marginally higher than Japan's $4.186 trillion. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to make India a 'developed country' and a global manufacturing hub by 2047, with a per capita income of over $14,005. However, experts argue that India's real challenge is to increase per capita GDP, which is about $2,500, and pursue qualitative and sustainable development instead of quantitative growth.

The trade war between the United States and China is escalating, with both countries vying for economic supremacy. The US has a gross domestic product of over $29 trillion, while China's is over $18 trillion. China is the world's biggest exporter of goods, with the US being the biggest importer. The US has a significant trade deficit with China, reaching $355 billion in 2024. The two countries have also clashed over climate change, with the US withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and China committing to carbon neutrality by 2060. In the tech sector, the US has its 'GAFAM' group of giants, while China has its 'BATX' group. The rise of artificial intelligence has opened a new front in Sino-American tech rivalry, with China's DeepSeek start-up shaking up the AI world with its R1 chatbot. The two sides have also clashed over TikTok, with the US threatening to ban the app due to national security fears. The US is the world's biggest spender on defense, earmarking $916 billion in 2023, while China ranked second with $296 billion. China has invested heavily in its space program, with plans to send a manned mission to the Moon by 2030 and build a lunar base.

Experts suggest that India could add $1 trillion to its GDP every 1.5 years at the current pace, potentially becoming a $10 trillion economy by the end of 2032.

**Women's Increased Presence in the Workforce Could Add Up to 20% to Global GDP**
A Bank of America Institute study found that the gap in annual income growth between men and women is decreasing, from 6.5% in 2022 to 4% in 2024. The study estimates that closing the employment gap between men and women could add $1.1 trillion to the US GDP. If there were also equal pay, the annual impact would be $866 billion. In an ideal scenario, where both inequalities are eliminated, the economic growth could reach $2.1 trillion, a 7.5% increase in GDP. The study also found that achieving parity in employment and salaries could add up to 20% to the global GDP per capita. The study highlights the 'Great Transfer of Wealth', where $124 trillion in wealth will be transferred in the US by 2048, surpassing the 2023 global GDP. $54 trillion will be inherited by widows, and $47 trillion will go to younger women. This phenomenon will transform the economy, as women will have more control over investments and consumption patterns. They are also more financially literate and investing in long-term assets, such as real estate and companies. The study notes that the increase in female wealth has already modified various economic sectors, such as sports, travel, and health. As women have more disposable income, the demand for previously undervalued products increases. 'However, these expenses do not need to come at the expense of men. As women become richer, it helps to 'increase the pie' of total affluence, expanding opportunities for everyone,' say the Bank of America Institute researchers.

**Latin America's Rise to Global Power: Brazil and Mexico to Join the Elite by 2050**
A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Standard Chartered predicts that four Latin American countries will join the United States and China as global powers by 2050. The report, 'The Long-Term Vision: How the Global Economic Order Will Change by 2050,' used the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) as key metrics to examine the projected growth. According to the study, Brazil and Mexico are the only Latin American economies that will make it to the top 10 globally by 2050. Brazil is projected to have a GDP of $7.54 trillion in PPP, ranking fifth, while Mexico will be seventh with a GDP of $6.863 trillion. The report also highlights two groups of global powers: the G7 (the world's largest advanced economies) and the E7 (the world's largest emerging economies). The projections suggest that China, India, and the United States will lead the global ranking in 2050, with China maintaining its status as the largest economy, followed by India and the United States. The study concludes that global economic growth will come from emerging markets, which will increase their share of the world's GDP over time.

According to a report by Bain & Company and Nasscom, India is expected to transform into a high-income country with a GDP of $23-$35 trillion by 2047.

Sangeeta Gupta, Senior Vice President at Nasscom, said, 'By investing in digital and transport infrastructure, enhancing domestic manufacturing, and driving collaborative R&D, we can position India as a leader in future technologies and global trade.' The report predicts that India's share of renewables in overall energy generation will rise from 24% in 2023 to 70% in 2047, and the country will transition from a net energy importer to a net exporter.
