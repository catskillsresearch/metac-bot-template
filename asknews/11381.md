**Washington bishops: "An act of religious discrimination" - AgenSIR**
The Catholic bishops of Washington State have filed a lawsuit against Governor Bob Ferguson, arguing that a new law requiring priests to break the seal of confession is an 'act of religious discrimination'. The law, which was approved by the Senate in early May, requires members of the clergy to report child abuse or neglect, regardless of the inviolability of the confessional seal. The bishops claim that this places them in an 'impossible position' and cited historical examples of priests who were martyred for refusing to break the seal. They also emphasized the steps taken by the Catholic Church to eradicate sexual abuse by members of the clergy. The Department of Justice has announced that it will investigate the apparent conflict between the law and the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment to the US Constitution.

**Misogynist Clericalism Strikes Again**
The new bishop of Charlotte (NC) has proposed a mandate that prohibits women from wearing chapel veils while serving at Mass, sparking widespread protest. The proposed instruction singles out women from cultures that traditionally veil and favors women from cultures that traditionally wear hats. This is problematic as it forces pastors to legislate whether certain head coverings are allowed. The prohibition is also gravely problematic because women wearing veils at Mass is a practice mentioned in Scripture. The bishop's proposed 'reform' implies that women who choose to exercise their sacred privileges need to shut up and stay in the pews, perpetuating a misogynistic and false feminism that says women can only have equal access to career opportunities by denying their female biology and forsaking motherhood. Bishop Martin's proposed mandate is 'blatantly misogynist and should not be tolerated anywhere,' according to the author.

**Italian Catholic Church Reports 115 Cases of Sexual Abuse and Assault**
According to a report by the Italian Catholic Bishops' Conference (CEI), there were 115 cases of sexual abuse and assault in the church between 2023 and 2024. The victims included 64 men and 51 women. Of the 67 alleged perpetrators, 65 were men, and 44 of them were clergy members serving in the church. The most affected age group was children between 10 and 14 years old, accounting for 31.3% of all reported cases. Italian media also reported an increase in such incidents. 'The church must take responsibility for these crimes and work to prevent them,' said no one in the article, but the implication is clear.

**Cei Report 2023-2024: A Significant Increase in Alleged Abuses in Italy**
The third report by the Italian Episcopal Conference (Cei) has highlighted a concerning phenomenon: in the 2023-2024 biennium, reports of alleged abuses have significantly increased. A total of 115 victims were recorded, with 64 males and 51 females. This data marks an increase compared to previous years, highlighting a reality that cannot be ignored. The report notes 69 cases of alleged abuse, with 27 occurring within parishes. The alleged perpetrators are 67, mostly clergy members. This raises questions about the safety of places of worship, which should be spaces of protection and welcome, but instead become, in some cases, theaters of violence and abuse. The age group most affected among the victims is 10-14 years old, representing 31.3% of cases. Additionally, the report highlights a change in the average age of alleged abusers, from 43 years in 2022 to 50 years in 2023-2024. This suggests that abuse is not just a problem of young clergy, but also involves more mature figures within the Church. The report also recorded an increase in cases of spiritual and consciousness abuse, from 4 to 17. This aspect is particularly alarming, as it highlights a more subtle and insidious dimension of abuse, which can have devastating effects on the lives of victims. The Cei has organized events such as 'Protect, prevent, train' to address these issues and promote a network of protection for minors and vulnerable adults. The current situation requires urgent and decisive action from the Church and competent institutions. It is essential to implement prevention and training measures to ensure the safety of all, particularly the most vulnerable. Transparency and responsibility must become the watchwords to address a problem with deep roots and a need for cultural change within the Church.

**Italian Catholic Church Strengthens Network to Combat Child Abuse**
The Italian Catholic Church has strengthened its network to combat child abuse, with a significant increase in awareness, intervention capacity, and quality of training. The number of people seeking help has also increased, with 373 contacts in 2024, compared to 38 in 2020. The Church has also improved its services, with 184 dioceses participating in the 2023-2024 survey, and a significant increase in the number of laypeople and women involved. The majority of operators are laypeople (73%), and women make up 52% of the total. The most common skills among operators are psychology (29.7%) and education (23.8%). The Church has also increased its efforts in providing training and support for its members, with 781 meetings in 2024, and a focus on respecting the dignity of minors and good practices in parishes. However, there are still some weaknesses, such as the lack of collaboration with local authorities and non-ecclesiastical associations. Monsignor Giuseppe Baturi, Secretary General of the Cei, stated that 'the Church continues to do its part, but collaboration with institutions is fundamental.' The Church aims to insert the protection of minors into the ordinary pastoral care of all communities. The members of the diocesan and regional services also evaluate negatively the communications on local media. Chiara Griffini, President of the Cei's National Service for the Protection of Minors and Vulnerable People, stated that 'it is necessary to define the next steps, orienting the path on four poles: ecclesiastical responsibility, community responsibility, listening and care towards those who are hurt, and research for truth and justice; collaboration with civil society to make protection a 'universal language'; and communicating a renewed safeguarding and learning to manage the crisis with transparency.'

**Bishops sue Washington over clergy mandatory reporter law**
The Catholic church's top bishops in Washington state are suing the state over a new law that requires clergy members to be mandatory reporters of child abuse or neglect. The bishops argue that the law violates their First Amendment right to practice freedom of religion and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Archbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle said that priests would rather go to prison than reveal information given during confession, as it is a confidential communication. The law, which takes effect on July 27, requires clergy to report potential cases of child abuse or neglect, and could face misdemeanor charges if they don't. Sen. Noel Frame, the bill's sponsor, said that children need trusted adults to report abuse, and that she hopes clergy will do the same. The bishops are suing Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, Attorney General Nick Brown, and the 39 prosecuting attorneys of the state's counties.

**Catholic bishops sue Washington state over new law**
Catholic bishops in Washington state are suing the state over a new law that requires clergy to report suspected child abuse, even if it's disclosed during confession. The law, which goes into effect in July, also makes clergy mandatory reporters, alongside school personnel and social service counselors. The bishops argue that this law violates the First Amendment by forcing priests to either go against their church's law or face criminal charges. According to canon law, any priest who discloses information given in confession is automatically excommunicated. 'Washington's law isn't about protecting kids -- it's about jailing priests for following the Church's ancient faith practices,' said Mark Rienzi, president and CEO of Becket, the religious liberty law firm representing the bishops. The plaintiffs include Archbishop Paul D. Etienne, Yakima Bishop Joseph J. Tyson, Spokane Bishop Thomas A. Daly, and eight other priests from dioceses across Washington. They are suing the governor, state Attorney General Nick Brown, and all 39 of Washington's county prosecutors.

**The History of Priestly Celibacy in the Catholic Church**
The Catholic Church's requirement of priestly celibacy has been a topic of debate for centuries. Historians argue that the first 39 popes were married men. According to Linda Pinto, copresident of Catholic for Choice, 'there is no explicit requirement of celibacy in Jesus' teachings.' The Church's current stance on celibacy was formed in the 11th and 12th centuries. The Bible does not explicitly mention priestly celibacy, but some passages suggest it. The early Christian Church did not have a uniform practice of priestly celibacy, and many clergy were married. The requirement of celibacy became more widespread in the Middle Ages, particularly after the Gregorian reforms of the 11th century. The Church's stance on celibacy was further solidified at the Council of Trent in the 16th century. Some popes have broken the rules, with some being married before taking holy orders and others having illegitimate children. The future of priestly celibacy remains uncertain, with some hoping for reform and others defending the current practice.

**The Surprising History of Celibacy in the Catholic Church**
The Catholic Church's requirement of celibacy for priests is a relatively recent development. In fact, the first 39 popes, including Saint Peter, were married men with families. The Church's early acceptance of married clergy was a reflection of the social norms of the time, where marriage was seen as a natural part of life. However, as the Church grew and became more institutionalized, debates arose about the suitability of married clergy. The shift towards mandatory celibacy was not immediate or peaceful, and it was not until the Council of Letrán II in 1139 that the prohibition on married priests was formally established. Today, the Catholic Church maintains this tradition, with the Pope reiterating that he has no plans to modify the requirement for priests. The history of celibacy in the Catholic Church is complex and surprising, with many examples of married popes and clergy throughout the centuries.

**The Complex History of Celibacy in the Catholic Church**
The Catholic Church's requirement for priests to be celibate has a long and complex history. In the early Christian Church, many priests and even popes were married. According to Linda Pinto, copresident of Catholic for Choice, 'the first 39 popes were married men.' Historians believe that many early Church leaders had wives and children. The practice of celibacy became more widespread as the Church spread from its Jewish roots to the Greek and Roman world, where ascetic practices like self-control, solitude, and celibacy were valued. The Emperor Constantine's declaration of Christianity as the state religion gave the popes a more active political role, and they often came from aristocratic Roman families or were friends of German emperors. The Church accumulated wealth and power, and a period of political intrigue began. The celibacy requirement was not uniform until the 11th century, and the 'Great Schism' between the Catholic and Orthodox churches was partly due to the issue of celibacy. The Gregorian reforms of the 11th century and the two councils of Lateran in 1123 and 1139 imposed more rigorous continence, and celibacy became a defining characteristic of the Western Catholic priesthood after the 16th-century reforms and the Council of Trent. Some popes had married before taking holy orders, and several had children out of wedlock. The BBC contacted the Vatican and other Catholic institutions for comment on the history of popes and celibacy, but received no response. Despite some flexibility in the rules, Pope Francis and his predecessor, Benedict XVI, defended the celibacy requirement. Professor Kim Haines-Eitzen hopes that the Church will eventually accept married priests in rural areas and ordain women, but believes it is unlikely to see a married pope in the 21st century.

Some popes have been married before becoming pope, and others have had children out of wedlock. The Church has shown flexibility in its rules, allowing married priests in some cases, but the current pope and his predecessor have defended the requirement for priestly celibacy.

**Before, priests and popes often married, but when did they stop marrying?**
The Catholic Church has a long history of priests and popes getting married, but the requirement for clergy to remain celibate has been enforced for centuries. According to the BBC Pidgin, the early Christian Church, many priests, and more than one pope have gotten married. However, the insistence on clerical celibacy has been promoted by theologians such as St Augustine and St Thomas Aquinas. The practice of priestly celibacy was discussed at the Council of Nicea in AD325 and made mandatory for bishops by the Council of Trullo in AD692. The 11th-century Gregorian reforms and the Lateran councils of 1123 and 1139 enforced the practice more seriously, and finally, celibacy became the defining feature of the Western-rite Catholic priesthood in the 16th Century and the Council of Trent. As the Catholic Church prepares to elect a new pope, it is practically certain that the next pope would not be a married man, despite the heated debate within the church on the requirement for clergy to remain celibate.

**ZdK Expects New Pope to Take Further Steps Towards Equality and Lay Participation**
The Central Committee of German Catholics (ZdK) expects the new Pope to take further steps towards equality and lay participation in the Church. According to ZdK President Irme Stetter-Karp, 96% of German Catholics 'expect reforms from their Church'. Stetter-Karp said, 'Many want their Church to acknowledge the diversity of life and believers. It's about allowing women to work equally in the Church, for example as priests.' The ZdK President emphasized that the Church cannot decide this issue alone. 'The topic of diversity also includes how to deal with homosexuality and same-sex partnerships. The celibacy requirement is also being questioned. Many laypeople are concerned with overcoming clericalism, demanding participation in power in the Church, as well as accountability and transparency of leadership.' Stetter-Karp noted that the topic of birth control is no longer a major issue, saying, 'There are probably no special expectations from a new Pope regarding birth control. The truth is that many believers no longer look at the catechism and ask questions. Not just young people, but also people of my generation.'

**The Origins of Priestly Celibacy: A Historical Perspective**
In the early Christian Church, priests were allowed to be married and had families. The New Testament shows that the apostles were married men, although Paul valued abstinence. During the High Middle Ages, priests had a family life and were integrated into the community. However, from the 5th and 6th centuries, major orders in the Latin West encouraged the clergy to perpetual continence. This trend was not universally accepted and priests' behaviors varied depending on their piety. By the mid-11th century, the Church considered married priests to be heretics to be eradicated. The reform of Gregory VII aimed to separate the clergy from the laity and strengthen the authority of the Pope. Historians Isabelle Rosé and Damien Boquet explain that the clergy's adoption of total continence was necessary to create a 'clerical caste.' By the 12th century, legislation was established in the Latin Christian world, making marriage for priests forbidden and punishable by dismissal. The practice of priestly celibacy became widespread, but many priests continued to have secret families, risking punishment. This led to deviant sexual practices among some priests. From a psychological perspective, celibacy does not necessarily mean solitude, as priests are integrated into parish life. However, the absence of paternity weighs on their consciences, particularly the desire to found a family or transmit property. Ultimately, celibacy became a distinctive feature of the Catholic Church.
