**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**Elon Musk's Ambitious Plan to Colonize Mars**
Elon Musk's SpaceX has been working towards establishing a human settlement on Mars, with the goal of making humanity a multi-planetary species. Musk has stated that he believes it is essential for the survival of humanity, and that Mars can serve as a backup plan in case of a global catastrophe on Earth. However, experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of establishing a human settlement on Mars, citing the planet's harsh environment, lack of water, and extreme temperatures. Musk's plan involves using his Starship spacecraft to transport people and cargo to Mars, with the goal of establishing a permanent human presence on the planet by 2028. However, many have questioned the practicality of this plan, and whether it is worth the estimated billions of dollars that Musk is investing in it. Other billionaires, such as Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, are also working on space-related projects, with Bezos' Blue Origin aiming to establish a human settlement on the moon. Musk's motivations for pursuing this goal are unclear, but some have speculated that it is a way for him to gain attention and build his brand, rather than a genuine scientific or humanitarian pursuit.

**Trump Withdraws Nomination of Isaacman as NASA Head, Deal Blow to Elon Musk**
A surprise turn of events has dealt a setback to Elon Musk. Trump had nominated a close friend of the tech billionaire, Isaacman, as the new head of NASA, but Trump has now withdrawn his nomination. Trump did not comment on the reasons for his decision, but it is believed that Isaacman's past donations to the Democratic Party and his close ties to Musk may have been factors. Musk is stepping down as a special envoy to the US government. This comes at a bad time for Musk, as the US government plans to cut NASA's budget by a quarter and reduce its staff by a third. The government also plans to redefine NASA's mission, with a focus on missions to the moon and Mars. This is important for SpaceX, which is developing the Starship rocket, capable of carrying up to 100 tons of cargo and potentially enabling a manned mission to Mars in a few years. Musk aims to send a million people to Mars by 2050. However, SpaceX has faced repeated setbacks in the development of the Starship, including a recent test flight that ended in a crash in the Indian Ocean. Musk remains undeterred, and has outlined an ambitious plan for a Mars mission, including a unmanned flight in 2026, a crewed flight in 2027, and the establishment of a Mars station in 2029, with the help of Optimus robots built by Tesla.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**Musk retains plan to fly Starship to Mars in 2026 despite setbacks**
Elon Musk has reaffirmed his plan to send Starship to Mars in 2026, despite recent setbacks in test flights. Musk stated that the success of this mission depends on Starship's ability to accomplish several challenging technical feats, including a post-launch refueling manoeuvre in earth orbit. He gave SpaceX a 50% chance of meeting the deadline. If not, the company will wait two years before trying again. Musk envisions launching 1,000 to 2,000 ships to Mars every two years to establish a self-sustaining human settlement. NASA plans to return humans to the moon aboard Starship in 2027, with the goal of launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Musk has previously aimed to send an uncrewed vehicle to Mars by 2018 and a crewed mission by 2024, but has since pushed back the timeline.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**🔒 The Economist: Musk's Mars mission - A race against time and physics**
Elon Musk's plan to send humans to Mars is facing significant challenges, including physical constraints and delays in the development of the Starship spacecraft. The US risks falling behind China in lunar exploration and space dominance. Musk's Starship, which is designed to carry up to 100 people to Mars, is still in the testing phase and has experienced several setbacks, including a recent explosion during a test flight. The company has applied for a license to conduct 25 launches at its Texas site, but the pace of testing has slowed down. As a result, the launch window for Mars is rapidly closing, and it is becoming increasingly unlikely that uncrewed launches for Mars in 2026 will be possible. The delays are also affecting the Artemis Moon-landing program, which relies on the Starship for lunar missions. China's plans to land people on the Moon in 2030 are simpler and more straightforward, and the US may be at risk of being beaten to the Moon. Musk's ambitions for Mars are not limited to his current term in office and he is working to future-proof SpaceX and ensure that his successors are pro-Musk and Mars-curious. However, the risks of an already perilous mission to Mars are significant, and the alternative of sending the first pioneers to a place with no existing fuel cache would increase those risks even further.

**Musk Predicts 1 Million People on Mars in 20 Years, Establishing a Self-Sufficient City**
Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has predicted that humans will establish a self-sufficient city on Mars within 20 years, with a population of 1 million people. He also revealed that 2029 will be a historic moment when humans first set foot on Mars. According to Deutsche Welle, Musk stated on X platform that SpaceX plans to execute a landing mission in 2026, aiming to send Tesla's humanoid robot 'Optimus' to Mars using the 'Starship' rocket. If the mission is successful, he estimates that humans will complete their first Mars landing in 2029, but the most likely implementation time is 2031. Musk emphasized the importance of establishing a self-sufficient Martian city for the continuation of human civilization, saying, 'Even if Earth faces a disaster, Martian residents can survive independently.' He added, 'We need to build a self-sufficient city on Mars as soon as possible, which is the key threshold to ensure the survival of civilization. Even if Earth's supply ships stop flying or a major disaster occurs, the Martian civilization can continue.' Musk also mentioned that building a self-sufficient Martian city requires rebuilding all industrial foundations on Earth, and the primary task in the harsh Martian environment is to build a living module similar to a glass dome to provide a suitable space for human habitation. The 'Starship' rocket, developed by SpaceX, is considered the core of Musk's Mars plan. This reusable heavy-lift rocket will not only support NASA's 'Artemis' program to help humans return to the Moon but also undertake the mission of humans setting foot on Mars.

**Elon Musk's SpaceX to Send Advanced Rover to the Moon**
SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, is set to send a special rover to the moon's surface as part of the Artemis program. The Lunar Outpost, a company supported by NASA, has developed a Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) that will allow astronauts to drive around the moon's rugged terrain. The LTV is designed to operate on the moon's south pole, one of the most extreme regions in the solar system, and will be equipped with autonomous driving capabilities. According to Justin Cyrus, the CEO of Lunar Outpost, the LTV will be the backbone of future moon operations and will play a central role in research, infrastructure, and resource extraction. He stated, 'We are confident that SpaceX has developed the most advanced launch system ever and will safely land our Eagle vehicles on the moon's surface.' The Artemis program aims to re-establish a human presence on the moon and eventually pave the way for a manned mission to Mars. The first manned landing is planned for mid-2027 with Artemis III, and the LTV is expected to be a key part of Artemis V, which will send four astronauts to the moon's south pole in 2030.
