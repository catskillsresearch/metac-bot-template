3M has reached an agreement to settle all historical claims related to the Chambers Works site in Salem County, New Jersey, as well as broader state-wide claims regarding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The agreement, pending judicial approval, includes a commitment of approximately $210 million in present value before taxes for the Chambers Works litigation and an additional $75 million to address current and future claims from 2030 to 2050. According to InvestingPro's analysis, the stock appears slightly overvalued at current levels. 3M has provided PFAS to DuPont at the Chambers Works site until 2001 and has since taken steps to withdraw from PFAS manufacturing, planning to stop all PFAS production by the end of 2025. The agreement does not constitute an admission of liability by 3M, but aims to bring finality and prevent further litigation. If the agreement does not receive court approval or certain conditions are not met, 3M is prepared to continue its defense. Financially, 3M will record a charge before taxes of approximately $285 million in the second quarter of 2025, reflecting the impact of the agreement. The payment structure is designed to align with the company's other financial obligations, ensuring a predictable cash flow over the next 25 years. The company maintains a strong financial position with an EBITDA of $5.328 billion and a general liquidity ratio of 1.66.

**Expert: Russia to Go Bankrupt in 2026**
Russian expert Malcolm Dixelius predicts that Russia will go bankrupt in 2026. He believes that Russia's President Vladimir Putin is now in need of a peace agreement, more than Ukraine. 'Russians are exhausted. The country is heading towards national bankruptcy in 2026. It's the Russians who are under the greatest pressure,' Dixelius said to Swedish Aftenposten. He points to US President Donald Trump's recent shift in stance, which appears to be more in favor of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky than Putin. 'The US has not completely changed course, but they have become much more accepting of Ukraine's description of reality. Russian attempts to take advantage of the opening Trump gave them have failed,' Dixelius said. Russia's poor economy and US support for Ukraine are two factors contributing to Russia's struggles. However, Ukraine has also managed to hit critical Russian infrastructure. China still has influence over Putin, and it's difficult to assess the impact of Chinese President Xi Jinping on Putin, as China is the only country that can lend Russia money.

**VTB Bank Sues Perm Pharmacy Chain Owners for 2.13 Billion Rubles**
VTB Bank has initiated a lawsuit against the owners of the Perm pharmacy chain 'Apteka ot Sklada', Nikolai Shavrin and Andrei Godovolov, seeking 2.13 billion rubles.

The company announced its liquidation, and the 'Apteka ot Sklada' network ceased operations. Godovolov acknowledged a debt of 4.27 billion rubles. Later, Shavrin filed a bankruptcy declaration, and Godovolov followed suit. The entrepreneurs were recognized as bankrupts. According to the SKR, the former owners of 'Apteka ot Sklada' may have hidden around 233.5 million rubles.

**Every 3M Investor Should Keep an Eye on These 3 Numbers**
3M's stock has surged by over 50% in the past year after a large settlement related to PFAS production. However, the company still faces potential lawsuits, which could impact its financial stability. 3M's return on assets (ROA) has jumped back to historical levels, but its return on equity (ROE) has rebounded due to increased debt levels. This dynamic is crucial for investors to understand, as high debt levels can be unsustainable and potentially lead to bankruptcy. 3M's debt-to-equity levels have risen substantially since the PFAS legal troubles began, and additional litigation could lead to financial instability in the next few years.

The festival has been struggling financially for years, with TRF Board President Sarah Roach stating that the organization has not made money in almost all of those years. Some board members still have hope for the festival's future, with Cowan suggesting a smaller scale event highlighting local businesses and Campbell looking for outside funding.

The company's chairman, Niyazi Durgun, stated that they aimed to invest the income they planned to obtain through the public offering, but due to difficulties in accessing cheap financing and the economic conditions in Turkey, they decided to file for bankruptcy. The report prepared by the concordato commissioner board will be crucial for the company's future. In April, the court will evaluate the report and decide whether to grant the company an additional moratorium or declare bankruptcy if the economic obligations are not fulfilled.

The company remains under the reorganization process of Law 1116.

As stated by Lizcano, 'If the company had gone bankrupt, we would have all been left without resources. Even the government, which was in fourth place among the creditors. Now, with this new agreement, we are in second place in terms of payments and resources that the government is deferring, because they will receive them in 2029 indexed to the constant value, which could be around $150 million. We could say that the government is indirectly saving the company in this way.'
