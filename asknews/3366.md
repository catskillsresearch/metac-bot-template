**Trump pushes for $1 billion for private-sector-led Mars exploration - TechStory**
U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed a $1 billion initiative for Mars exploration through a public-private partnership model, as part of the White House's 2026 federal budget proposal. The Commercial Mars Payload Services Program (CMPS) aims to fund and support companies developing critical infrastructure for Mars missions, including human-rated landers, advanced spacesuits, and long-distance communications systems. The approach echoes the success seen with the development of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft. However, the proposed NASA budget for 2026 stands at $18.8 billion, a 25% reduction from the previous fiscal year, with much of the cuts targeting NASA's science programs. SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, stands to benefit significantly from the new direction, with Musk's plans for Mars colonization potentially being fast-tracked through the CMPS initiative. However, the proposal has drawn sharp criticism from the broader space science community, with concerns about the impact of reduced science funding and the planned phase-out of NASA's legacy systems.

**Trump Scraps NASA Nomination for SpaceX-Linked Jared Isaacman as Musk Exits DOGE**
President Donald Trump has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman, a billionaire tech entrepreneur closely aligned with Elon Musk's SpaceX, as NASA administrator. The decision comes after renewed scrutiny of Isaacman's past political donations to Democratic candidates. Trump stated that he will prioritize a new nominee who is 'mission aligned' and can put America 'first in space.' Isaacman, who has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion, has been a prominent figure in private space exploration and has invested in SpaceX. He expressed his optimism about the future of space exploration, saying, 'I have not flown my last mission -- whatever form that may ultimately take -- but I remain incredibly optimistic that humanity's greatest spacefaring days lie ahead.' Trump's decision has been met with mixed reactions, with some calling it 'bad news' for NASA and others speculating that it was an effort to damage ties between Trump and Musk.

**What the AI Revolution Means for the Future of Energy**
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, predicts that the cost of AI will converge with the cost of energy, and that the abundance of energy will limit the abundance of AI. This is supported by various reports from government analysts, investment bankers, and news organizations, which acknowledge that the digital economy runs on hardware that consumes a lot of energy. The latest giga-scale data centers require massive amounts of materials and energy to build and operate, with a single data center consuming as much natural gas as a single SpaceX rocket launch. The IEA estimates that a single large AI data center can use as much electricity as 2 million households, and that lighting up digital infrastructures will entail demands equivalent to reliably powering hundreds of millions of new households. The leading Big Tech firms have announced $300 billion in AI infrastructure spending this year, and BlackRock forecasts that annual spending could approach $1 trillion by 2030. Energy efficiency gains in digital hardware will not be enough to tamp down rising power demand, and the intersection of growing demand for bits and energy-efficiency gains will lead to a net increase in power demands. Society's demand for harvesting and consuming bits is the prime driver of all things digital, and there is no limit to how much we want to and need to know about everything in our society. The consequences of AI delivering on its promises of a productivity boom will be tectonic, and will induce growth in energy demand.
