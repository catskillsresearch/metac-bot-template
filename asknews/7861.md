**Balochistan Engages Religious Scholars To Promote ‘Family Planning’ Efforts - Daily Parliament Times**
The Balochistan government has launched a new initiative to promote family planning efforts by engaging 150 religious scholars across 31 districts. These scholars, designated as Family Planning Assistants, receive honorariums and Islamic literature emphasizing the Islamic legitimacy of responsible family planning, reproductive health, parental responsibility, and child welfare. Maulana Mula Dad, one of the scholars, says, 'We deliver our message through the lens of Islamic values – that every individual is entitled to a healthy life, proper education, and financial stability.' The initiative aims to promote healthier families and create a sustainable balance between population growth and available resources. The province's population has grown from 1.2 million in the early 1950s to 14.8 million in 2023, with an annual growth rate of 3.2%. If this trajectory persists, the population could double by 2045, placing unsustainable pressure on employment, housing, education, and healthcare services. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns that if growth remains above 2%, the province will require 6.5 million new employment opportunities, one million homes, and over 7,000 educational institutions by 2040.

**Russia Agrees to Nominate Taliban as Ambassador to Moscow**
Russia has officially agreed to nominate the Taliban as its ambassador to Moscow, as the economic and political relations between the two countries, both affected by sanctions, continue to develop. This move comes after Russia lifted its ban on the Taliban in April, which had been in place for over two decades, classifying them as a terrorist organization. No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which took control of Afghanistan in 2021 after the US withdrawal. Amir Khan Muttaqi, the acting foreign minister of the Taliban government, said, 'We hope that this new phase will allow the two countries to expand cooperation in various fields.' China became the first country to accept diplomatic representation at the level of ambassador from the Taliban in 2023, and several other countries, including Pakistan, have since followed suit. Diplomats say that presenting the ambassador's official credentials to a foreign head of state represents a step towards recognition. Meanwhile, Afghanistan welcomed the decision to raise diplomatic relations with Pakistan, which is expected to be visited by the Taliban's foreign minister in the coming days, according to his office. This move indicates a easing of tensions between the two neighbors, which have been strained in recent months due to security concerns and Islamabad's campaign to expel tens of thousands of Afghans. Pakistan's foreign minister announced on Friday that the chargé d'affaires in Kabul will be upgraded to ambassador, and Kabul later announced the upgrade of its representative in Islamabad. The Afghan foreign ministry said on X that 'raising diplomatic representation between Afghanistan and Pakistan paves the way for enhancing bilateral cooperation in multiple areas.' The ministry's spokesperson, Dzia Ahmad Tkal, told AFP that the Afghan foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is expected to visit Pakistan 'in the coming days.' Muttaqi had previously met with Pakistan's foreign minister, Ismail Dar, in Beijing in May, as part of a trilateral meeting with their Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. Wang later announced the intention of Kabul and Islamabad to exchange ambassadors, and expressed Beijing's readiness to continue helping to improve Afghan-Pakistani relations. Dar praised the 'positive trajectory' of Afghan-Pakistani relations on Friday, saying that raising the level of representation 'will enhance exchanges between the two brotherly countries.'

**Good ties with Kabul must for growth: Fazl**
Maulana Fazl Rehman has emphasized the importance of maintaining good ties with Afghanistan for regional economic growth. He announced plans to launch a movement against the child marriage law in Islamabad, which he believes is against the Constitution and the spirit of Islam. Fazl also suggested that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) could be further linked with Iran and Central Asian countries, which would connect Pakistan with these countries through mutual interests and economic relationships. He praised the armed forces for defending the country against India, but expressed hope that both countries would resolve their issues peacefully. Fazl also mentioned that his party, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, would suggest that Pakistan join the Asiatic federation to make it more powerful, rather than looking towards the West.

**Fazl rejects child marriage bill, announces protest across country**
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUIF) chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman has rejected the Child Marriage Restraint Bill, calling it a means to promote adultery and erode the Islamic identity of the country. He claimed that the legislation is against the teachings of the Holy Quran and Sunnah, and that it would make the process of nikah more difficult, leading to an increase in adultery. Maulana Fazlur Rahman also criticized the rising number of mega-corruption scandals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the PTI government, and called for a judicial probe into the corruption scandals. He further stated that China is rapidly emerging as a regional power and that the region could be plunged into chaos due to the 'insane decisions' of Indian rulers. He urged the Indian people to think about the policies of Modi administration and stressed the need for improved relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

**Afghanistan Denies Reports of Ban on Poetry Nights**
The Ministry of Information and Culture of Afghanistan has denied reports of a ban on poetry nights in the country. According to the ministry's press service, a traditional festival 'Aнар Голь' (Granate Flower) took place in the Kandahar province on Saturday night, attended by dozens of Pashto-language poets from various provinces, artists, and hundreds of local residents. High-ranking government officials from Kabul also attended the event. Deputy Minister of Information and Culture Atilkulla Azizi addressed the gathering, saying, 'Recently, several biased media outlets spread false stories claiming that poetry meetings were canceled. However, we are now witnessing a colorful and culturally significant event in historic Kandahar. Isn't this a strong and worthy response to these unfounded accusations?' Azizi also confirmed Afghanistan's commitment to promoting poetry and literature, stating that the government does not aim to suppress literature, but rather supports poets and organizes poetry festivals. 'The Islamic Emirate does not aim to restrict or suppress literary expression. On the contrary, we actively work to support poets and organize more effective poetry festivals. In accordance with the directive of the Supreme Leader of Afghanistan, the Ministry of Information and Culture is authorized to annually evaluate the work of poets, their contribution to national literature, and award those who have made significant contributions,' Azizi emphasized.

**Pakistan Upgrades Diplomatic Ties with Afghanistan**
Pakistan has upgraded its diplomatic ties with Afghanistan by appointing a full ambassador in Kabul, signaling an improvement in bilateral relations and a desire to pursue deeper cooperation on regional security and economic integration. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar attributed the decision to the momentum generated during his visit to Kabul on April 19, 2025, saying 'Pakistan-Afghanistan relations are on a positive trajectory.' Dar expressed confidence that the appointment of a full ambassador would catalyze high-level engagement and bolster cooperation in critical areas such as counter-terrorism, border security, trade, and economic development. The move comes amid a notable shift in regional dynamics, with Pakistan pursuing simultaneous diplomatic overtures to both China and Afghanistan, even as it remained locked in a tense standoff with India earlier this month. A recent China-Pakistan-Afghanistan trilateral meeting held in Beijing on May 21, reviving a dialogue mechanism last active in 2023, further underscored this pivot. Both Kabul and Islamabad, with Beijing's backing, expressed a clear willingness to exchange ambassadors 'as soon as possible,' according to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Beijing also announced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), would now extend into Afghanistan, linking the landlocked country to broader regional infrastructure and trade networks. Senior Pakistani officials confirmed that another round of trilateral consultations is expected within weeks, aimed at building on the progress made in Beijing. The officials also said Afghan Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was expected to visit Islamabad soon. 'The dates for this (possible three-day) visit are being finalised. We are heading to closer cooperation,' one official said.

**China Vows to Seriously Help Afghanistan in Healthcare, Agriculture, and Energy**
China has pledged to seriously help Afghanistan in healthcare, agriculture, and energy. This was stated by the head of the 'Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan' Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amir Khan Muttaqi, during a meeting with the head of the Chinese International Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), Lo Zhaohui. Muttaqi expressed hope for deeper cooperation between Kabul and Beijing, particularly in the sectors of agriculture, energy, and long-term infrastructure development. He called China a vital partner in development in the country's economic recovery and state services. Lo Zhaohui promised assistance in developing healthcare, agriculture, infrastructure, and energy. He also expressed interest in launching technical and economic feasibility studies for oil and gas exploration and supporting initiatives to increase capacity. Muttaqi presented specific proposals from CIDCA, describing areas where Chinese support can accelerate Afghanistan's recovery. The talks took place against the backdrop of China's diplomatic activity in the region. Earlier, Muttaqi met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss strengthening political and economic ties between the two countries. Analysts say that China's expanding role in Afghanistan reflects its strategic bid to ensure regional stability and protect its interests in connectivity, energy, and trade. Afghanistan's geographical location makes it a crucial link for the 'Belt and Road Initiative' (BRI) and potential connections with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, experts warn that without broad international recognition, Afghanistan's development is impossible. While China's involvement signals a shift in regional dynamics, the sustainability of such support remains uncertain due to ongoing security and governance issues.

**Islamic Emirate Rejects Pakistan's Claims Over Balochistan Attack**
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has rejected Pakistan's claims that the recent attack on a student transport vehicle in Balochistan was linked to Afghanistan. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Islamic Emirate's spokesman, stated, 'We have declared the position of the Islamic Emirate and condemned this attack. It is truly regrettable, and there is no justification for taking the lives of civilians, especially children. Furthermore, the claims by Pakistani officials connecting this attack to Afghanistan are unfounded and baseless.' Experts have called on Pakistan to change its approach towards Afghanistan, emphasizing that defending its citizens is the responsibility of the Pakistani government, not Afghanistan. 'Unfortunately, Pakistan has always maintained a hostile policy toward Afghan governments,' said Mohammad Zalmai Afghanyar, a political analyst. 'The question now arises whether Pakistan can assure us it does not have intelligence operations against Afghanistan?' China's efforts to improve ties between Kabul and Islamabad have been noted, amidst deteriorating relations between the two countries due to security challenges and the forced deportation of Afghan migrants.

**Amir Khan Muttaqi Set to Visit China and Iran in the Coming Days**
Amir Khan Muttaqi, the acting foreign minister of Afghanistan, is set to visit China and Iran in the coming days, according to a senior official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Muttaqi has received official invitations from both countries and is expected to participate in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit and the Tehran Dialogue Forum. Political analysts view these trips as part of the Islamic Emirate's efforts to gain recognition on regional and international levels, saying that participation in diplomatic gatherings allows them to share their views directly with the Islamic Emirate. As one analyst noted, 'Countries have their own interests, but the Islamic Emirate should act wisely to make the most of Afghanistan's security, geography, and weak economy through the support of countries like China, Russia, and Iran.' Despite some improvement in Afghanistan's relations with regional and global players, no country has yet officially recognized the interim government of Afghanistan.

**Afghanistan  --  the perils of cuddling India**
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) is seeking to diversify its foreign relations and economic ties, a strategy known as 'hedging diplomacy'. The IEA is looking to China, Russia, and Iran for economic collaboration, border security, and counter-terrorism cooperation. However, these relationships are complex and nuanced, with each country having its own interests and concerns. China is interested in extracting Afghanistan's mineral resources, estimated to be over $1 trillion, but is cautious due to concerns about the Taliban's religiosity and the potential impact on its Xinjiang Muslim region. Russia aims to extend intelligence and security cooperation with the IEA to safeguard its Central Asian soft underbelly from IS-K operations. Meanwhile, India is seeking to re-insert itself into Afghanistan, which is seen as a 'red line' by Pakistan. The IEA's foreign relations are complicated by an insecure position, as countries approach Afghanistan in self-interest only. The article concludes that Pakistan's goodwill towards Afghanistan is at risk if the IEA does not salvage it with wise diplomacy.

He warned the US that the IEA will not follow the previous administration's orders and that Western interference in Afghan affairs is increasing day by day. Mujahid claimed that the IEA has diplomatic relations with 40 countries and that the current tense atmosphere is due to media propaganda.
