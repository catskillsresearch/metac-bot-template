**China's Potential Attack on Taiwan: A Global Economic Catastrophe?**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan 'may be inevitable'. According to economic analyst Vyacheslav Shiryayev, a Chinese attack on Taiwan would be 'much more powerful' for the global economy than Trump's tariff war. Shiryayev noted that Taiwan is connected to hundreds of major companies that produce computers, household appliances, and other goods, and that a disruption would be a 'shock' to the global economy. He also stated that Taiwan has not had time to relocate its production to the US, and that a blockade of nearby shipping lanes could cost the economy billions of dollars daily. Shiryayev believes that China would likely be excluded from many economic chains and would likely face sanctions. He also stated that restricting China's economy would have 'more devastating consequences than a nuclear explosion' and that he does not expect China to take any action against Taiwan. 'It's not in China's interests to break everything it's trying to preserve in its standoff with Trump,' Shiryayev said. Shiryayev noted that China is acting 'very delicately, diplomatically, and patiently' in the trade dispute with the US, and that it is not escalating the rhetoric. 'Although I don't know how much the Chinese Communist Party evaluates the risks of instability due to economic problems and thinks about whether they need a small victorious war to consolidate power now,' Shiryayev said. He concluded that the motivations behind regimes' foreign policy adventures are often hidden from the public, and that from an economic perspective, this would be a 'true catastrophe' for China and Southeast Asia, and a 'serious shock' for the West.

**Foods for Survival: Scientists Identify the Most Suitable Crops for a Global Catastrophe**
A study by a team of scientists from the University of Otago in New Zealand has identified the most suitable foods for surviving a global catastrophe. The researchers focused on finding crops that, due to their properties, could guarantee human survival in extreme climate conditions. The study, published in the journal PlosOne, examined the crops that could be most effective for feeding the population in case of global disasters, and it did so by conducting a meta-analysis of previous research on urban agriculture. The scientists found that, in normal scenarios, beans and legumes in general stand out as the most efficient crops, while in a nuclear winter, spinach and beets are the best candidates. The study reveals that the most effective crops are not necessarily those that require large areas of land or have a pleasant taste. According to the researchers, spinach and beets are the best options for facing a nuclear winter, as they are resistant plants that can withstand colder temperatures and, in most cases, do not depend on direct sunlight to grow. In a nuclear winter, the sky would be covered with a layer of smoke and ash, blocking sunlight and making photosynthesis difficult. This would have a devastating impact on conventional crops, but spinach and beets have a higher tolerance for adverse conditions. Additionally, they are plants that provide a good amount of nutrients and are relatively easy to cultivate. Their ability to grow in less fertile soils makes them a viable option in scenarios where resources are limited. The study also highlights the efficiency of crops in terms of space required. In a scenario of global disaster, such as a nuclear war or the impact of a large meteorite, the available space for cultivating food could be extremely limited. For this reason, the University of Otago team focused on finding crops that not only provide nutrients but also can grow in reduced areas. For example, beans turned out to be one of the most efficient crops in an urban environment in normal conditions. This crop only requires 292 square meters of land to feed a person for a year, making it an ideal option for areas where space is limited. However, as beans are not resistant to cold and their viability decreases in a nuclear winter. In a nuclear winter, a combination of wheat and carrots is more effective, as these plants have a higher tolerance to cold temperatures. Specifically, a mixture of 97% wheat and 3% carrots is the most efficient for this type of scenario. Wheat, being a cereal crop, provides a large amount of carbohydrates, while carrots provide essential vitamins and minerals. This type of combination is crucial because, in an apocalypse, the variety of available foods can be very limited. People may have to resort to a more monotonous diet, making nutritious options even more valuable. Additionally, both wheat and carrots have the advantage of not requiring large areas of land to cultivate them, making them a viable option even in reduced spaces. The study led by Matt Boyd not only offers an answer to the question of what foods could save us in a scenario of global catastrophe, but also opens the debate on how societies can prepare to face these challenges. Resilience, security, and the well-being of the population must be considered when making decisions about land use and food production.

**WHO Reopens Debate on Health Consequences of Nuclear War**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to resume a topic that had been left untouched for almost four decades: the analysis of the effects that a nuclear war would have on human health and healthcare systems. The last time it did so was in 1987. The decision, approved on Monday in the World Health Assembly, was promoted by 86 member states, although not without controversy. The resolution had to be put to a vote, something unusual in this forum, which usually operates by consensus, due to the strong opposition of some countries. Russia, supported explicitly by North Korea, requested the vote, in which 14 countries voted against and 28 abstained, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Pakistan, and India. The promoters of the report argue that scientific and technological knowledge has advanced enough to allow for a new and more complete analysis of the impacts of a nuclear conflict. Between them are island nations such as the Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu, some of the most affected historically by nuclear tests in the 20th century. The WHO had stopped elaborating reports on these risks since the nuclear threat of the Cold War faded in the 1990s. However, the deterioration of the geopolitical landscape - with direct threats, modernization of arsenals, and new nuclear-armed powers - has reactivated global concern. The critics of the countries opposed to the resolution argue that this task exceeds the WHO's health functions and represents an excessive financial burden, just at a time of crisis for the organization. But civil organizations such as the International Association of Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War - awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 - have celebrated the decision as a necessary and urgent step. 'We are pleased that the vast majority of nations recognize the importance of updating these fundamental studies,' said Charles Johnson, director of policies for the association. For him, recent events highlight the need for the WHO to provide 'authorized and updated evidence on the risk that a nuclear war poses to human survival and the stability of terrestrial systems.' The message is clear: while the world redoubles its tensions, the international community begins to recognize that looking the other way is not an option. Reopening the debate on the health consequences of a nuclear war is not alarmism, it's prevention. A nuclear war would have devastating consequences for human health in the short, medium, and long term. People exposed directly to the explosions would suffer severe thermal burns, eye injuries from intense light, hearing and lung damage from shock waves, and a lethal exposure to ionizing radiation. Those who survive the initial impact would face a chaotic situation: collapsed healthcare systems, destroyed hospitals, lack of essential medicines, and affected or disappeared healthcare professionals. The risk of massive infections, respiratory diseases from inhaling radioactive particles, and the impossibility of receiving adequate medical attention would turn any wound or common pathology into potentially lethal. At a long-term, the population would suffer an exponential increase in cancer cases - especially leukemias, thyroid, lung, and breast cancer - as well as cardiovascular and neurological disorders induced by radiation. Pregnant women exposed would have high rates of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformations in newborns. It is estimated that food insecurity caused by water, soil, and crop contamination would give rise to prolonged famines, severe malnutrition, and massive migrations. The psychological sequelae, such as post-traumatic stress, chronic anxiety, and depression, would mark entire generations, especially children who would grow up in an environment without resources, without basic services, and with a collective trauma of destruction and loss.

**God of War's Next Game Can't Close One Pandora's Box Ragnarok Opened**
The Valhalla DLC for God of War: Ragnarok was a creative pivot that introduced roguelike progression and introspective storytelling to the series. This type of experience should be included from the start in future God of War games, not as a post-launch bonus. The next game could be set in Egypt, Greece, or a new location, but it should build on the roguelike formula introduced in Valhalla. This would raise the baseline expectations and make the roguelike system feel like an essential design feature. The article suggests that the next God of War game should focus on emotional reckoning and legacy, using the roguelike format to explore themes of failure and growth. Santa Monica Studio should embrace Valhalla as a core feature going forward, rather than leaving it behind as a one-time success.

**Four Psychics Predict a Catastrophic 2025: A Devastating War and Global Chaos**
Four well-known psychics, including Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, French astrologer Nostradamus, Brazilian psychic Atos Salome, and London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, have made a chilling prediction that 2025 may be a catastrophic year for humanity. According to them, the world may be shaken by a devastating war that will lead to catastrophic consequences. Baba Vanga, known as the 'Balkan Nostradamus', has previously made accurate predictions, including the 9/11 attacks, the death of Princess Diana, and China's rise to power. She warned that Europe will be engulfed in a destructive war in 2025, marking the 'fall of humanity' and 'devastating' the population. Interestingly, her predictions about devastating earthquakes in 2025 have already begun to come true, as Myanmar and Thailand were hit by destructive tremors last month. Nostradamus, in his famous 'Book of Prophecies', written in 1555, also warned of a great war that will affect Britain. He wrote: 'When those who come from European lands see how England has established its throne behind. With its flanks, fierce wars will arise.' He said that 'the kingdom will be marked by fierce wars, enemies will arise from within and without. The great sea from the past will return, there is no more deadly enemy under the sky.' Atos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian psychic, known as the 'Living Nostradamus', also predicts an inevitable Third World War. Salome is known for accurately predicting the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of Queen Elizabeth II, and a global Microsoft system failure. He warned that 'the worst is yet to come' and noted the growth of problems related to cyberwar and the use of technology as the main forms of combat in the 21st century. 'This is a war not just of people, but also of machines,' he said. London hypnotherapist Nicolas Aujula, also 38, agrees that 2025 will be 'a year when the world will lack compassion.' He expects 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence against each other - in the name of religion and nationalism,' predicting that the Third World War may occur before mid-year.

**Explosion in Russian Electronics Factory Raises Questions About Nuclear Facilities**
A large explosion occurred at an electronics factory in St. Petersburg, which was a subcontractor to the Russian military. Ukraine conducted a major special forces operation earlier this spring, which included infiltration of operators using Blackhawk helicopters. Danish and German media have revealed that Russian nuclear facilities are deteriorating, raising further questions about the functionality of Russia's intercontinental missiles.

A Russian electronics factory in St. Petersburg was hit by an explosion and fire last night. Film on the fire can be seen here here here. Helicopter 16 Blackhawk or sometimes called Svarthök. Not necessarily just filming as you see, but rather focusing on the chaos. Ukraine conducted a major special forces operation in the spring to stop the Russian offensive over the Oskil river, which included infiltration of operators using Blackhawk helicopters. According to United24 Media, special forces operations should be characterized by the unexpected and unpredictable, which is a foundation for successful operations. Russia probably did not expect air landings over the Oskil river and, based on the losses, appears to have been taken by surprise, which has contributed to the difficult Russian losses. The date of the operation is not specified, but based on the footage, it was early in the spring or late in the winter. Russian nuclear facilities The Russian nuclear system is deteriorating, revealed Danish Danwatch and German Der Spiegel in a large investigation based on leaked documents. Kyiv Insider summarizes in an article: “For the international community, the takeaway is clear: Russia’s nuclear posture may appear formidable on paper, but behind the curtain lies a state increasingly unable to manage the vast arsenal it inherited. In the age of cyberwarfare and digital espionage, incompetence is a liability no superpower can afford—and Russia, it seems, is learning that too late.” Even United24 Media has an article, and the facilities are being rebuilt from the ground up as they have deteriorated. Modernization attempts will be made with imported material from the West, as Russia cannot produce it itself and the German company Knauf is pointed out. The leak now means that Russia will likely need to rebuild further as the weaknesses in the constructions are now revealed and can be used to disable the nuclear weapons. COMMENTARY One can reasonably question whether Russian nuclear weapons even work. Considering that they constantly threaten to use them and even said they would cancel the nuclear test ban treaty, but never manage to conduct a successful test, their functionality is highly questionable. It costs huge amounts of money to maintain nuclear weapons and their facilities, and as an oligarch and responsible for the industry that does this, it should be easier to just send the money to their Swiss or Cypriot bank accounts and pretend to do the work. As long as it does not become a nuclear war, they will not be discovered. The US conducted a successful test shot just last week and thus proves that their missiles work. The article is updated.

**Who will win if the war happens in between India and Pakistan?**
A full-scale war, especially a nuclear war, between India and Pakistan would result in unimaginable loss and catastrophic consequences for the world. Both countries possess nuclear weapons, and the retaliation would be devastating, killing millions of civilians and destroying major cities. Experts warn that a 'limited' nuclear war in South Asia could kill 50 to 100 million people and cause a global nuclear winter. The fallout would not be limited to the region, and would lead to refugee crises, humanitarian disasters, economic ruin, social chaos, and political instability. As the world is interlinked, a war between India and Pakistan would challenge global peace structures and undermine decades of non-proliferation efforts. According to experts, 'no one wins in a nuclear war,' and peace is always the better path. Diplomacy, dialogue, and international mediation must prevail to prevent such a disaster. As the article states, 'this isn't just about two nations -- it's about the survival of humanity in a nuclear age.'

**India and Pakistan: The Worst-Case Scenario Threatens Global Catastrophe**
A prominent physicist has warned that a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan could lead to a global catastrophe that threatens human civilization, due to the entry of the Earth into what is known as 'nuclear winter'. Professor Brian Tun, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, explained during a scientific conference that the effects of a regional nuclear war could exceed the boundaries of South Asia and include the entire planet. According to Tun, 'the smoke from the nuclear explosions will cover the Earth within two weeks, rising to the upper layers of the atmosphere where it does not rain, meaning that this smoke will remain suspended in the atmosphere for years, causing a decrease in temperatures and a lack of sunlight'. He added that 'even farmers in Europe or America, thousands of kilometers away from the conflict zone, will see a sky filled with smoke and stand on crops that have been damaged due to the cold and lack of light'. Tun warned that the agricultural consequences will be catastrophic, pointing out that major crops such as wheat, corn, and rice may see a 40% decrease in production for several consecutive years. He cautioned that 'we are not talking about a local war, but an existential crisis that could lead to the extinction of 90% of the world's population', emphasizing that the effects of the war will not exclude anyone, including those in non-nuclear or non-participating countries. The escalation of the conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors on Tuesday night was announced by India, which said it had launched airstrikes against militant infrastructure inside Pakistan and in the part of Kashmir under Islamabad's control. The Indian military said it had carried out a precise strike on what it described as 'terrorist camps in Pakistan'. India said it had targeted 9 'terrorist infrastructure sites' in Pakistan, some of which were linked to an attack by militants on Hindu tourists, which killed 26 people in the Indian part of Kashmir last month. Islamabad described the Indian attack as 'a war crime' and said it had 'informed the UN Security Council that it reserves the right to respond appropriately to the Indian aggression'.

**Nuclear Winter: A Global Catastrophe Threatens Human Civilization**
A prominent American physicist has warned that a nuclear war between India and Pakistan could lead to a global catastrophe that threatens human civilization, due to the entry of the Earth into what is known as the 'nuclear winter', coinciding with a dangerous escalation of military action between the two nuclear powers in South Asia. According to Professor Brian Tun, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, a regional nuclear war could have consequences that go beyond the local conflict and affect life on the entire planet. Tun said, 'The smoke from the nuclear explosions will cover the Earth within two weeks, and rise to the upper layers of the atmosphere, where it will not rain, meaning that this smoke will remain suspended for years.' He explained that these dark clouds will block sunlight, leading to a significant drop in temperatures on the surface of the Earth, to the point where farmers in Europe and the United States, despite being thousands of kilometers away from the battlefield, will suffer a catastrophic agricultural failure due to the cold and lack of sufficient light for crop growth. Tun predicted that the productivity of essential food crops such as wheat, corn, and rice could decrease by up to 40% for several consecutive years, leading to global famines. He added, 'We are not talking about a local war only, but an existential crisis that could lead to the extinction of 90% of the world's population,' emphasizing that the effects will not exclude any country, whether nuclear or non-nuclear, participating in the conflict or not. This warning comes as tensions on the ground between India and Pakistan are escalating. On Tuesday-Wednesday, the Indian Ministry of Defense announced the launch of air strikes against what it described as 'infrastructure for militants' within Pakistani territory and in the part under the control of Islamabad in Kashmir. The Indian army said that the strikes targeted nine sites said to be linked to 'armed groups responsible for a bloody attack on Hindu pilgrims last month, which killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir.' New Delhi confirmed that 'the strikes were precise and aimed at preventing the recurrence of similar attacks.' In response, Islamabad was outraged, describing the Indian bombing as 'a war crime,' and assured that it had informed the UN Security Council that it 'retains the right to respond at the right time and place.' After an emergency meeting of the cabinet, the Pakistani side announced that 'the Indian missile strikes are an act of aggression, and the armed forces are responsible for a decisive response.'

**A Terrifying Scenario: How the World Could End Before 2045**
According to scientific estimates and security studies, several scenarios are possible for the end of human civilization, including deadly pandemics, major climate disasters, economic system collapse, and a more frightening threat: a global nuclear war. If environmental, political, and economic crises continue to escalate over the next two decades, the world may find itself on the brink of collapse. Climate change, resource depletion, armed conflicts, and pandemics could combine to create a fertile ground for a catastrophic event. In this scenario, major powers would lose their ability to control, and the global system would begin to shake and eventually collapse completely, according to the Daily Mail. A nuclear war could spark a chain reaction of automatic responses that cannot be controlled. Imagine a massive cloud of smoke blocking the sun and engulfing the planet in a dark, lasting environmental disaster. A nuclear winter: an era of artificial ice. If a nuclear war were to occur, scientific estimates suggest that global temperatures could drop catastrophically, plunging the world into a nuclear winter, where agriculture would collapse, supply chains would stop, and food security, which relies on billions of people, would disappear. In such a situation, famine and extreme cold would be common enemies for those who remain alive. On the other hand, with the breakdown of global trade chains and production, the international economy could collapse completely, with banks closing, currencies becoming worthless, and communities turning to bartering or controlling resources through force. The global financial system we rely on today could become a distant memory, replaced by a constant struggle for survival. Pandemics and health collapse. In a post-catastrophe world, diseases are expected to spread rapidly, and with the destruction of medical infrastructure and air and water pollution, new diseases will emerge that are difficult to treat. Human survival would depend more on avoiding infection than adapting to economic or political situations. However, even with the bleakness of this scenario, there is still a chance to avoid the catastrophe, where countries can work on signing new agreements to limit nuclear weapons, intensify efforts to combat climate change, and rebuild international trust.

**Nuclear War: 5 Billion People Could Die Within 72 Minutes, Expert Warns**
According to expert Annie Jacobson, if a nuclear war were to occur, it would lead to the deaths of 5 billion people within 72 minutes. The effects of a nuclear war would not be limited to the initial blast, but would also lead to a catastrophic situation where people would struggle to survive. The entire world would be covered in a thick layer of ice, the sun's rays would become deadly, and the ozone layer would be destroyed. Annie Jacobson, an expert on nuclear war and investigative journalist, said that the effects of a nuclear war would be so devastating that it would be impossible to imagine. She cited the research of Professor Brian Tun, an atmospheric scientist, who warned that a global climate disaster would occur. Annie Jacobson said that after a nuclear war, the entire world would be covered in ice, especially in the middle latitudes. Crops would be destroyed, and people would struggle to survive. She said, 'The sun's rays would become deadly. The ozone layer would be destroyed, and radiation would become toxic. People would have to live underground, and even small amounts of food would lead to fights between people. However, there would be two countries that would be unaffected by this catastrophic situation - New Zealand and Australia.' Professor Brian Tun also said that only Australia and New Zealand would be able to escape the cold caused by a nuclear war due to their geographical location and stable climate, which would allow them to preserve their food production systems.

**Iran on the Brink: A Potential War with the US and Israel**
The situation on the Middle East is nearing a critical point, with ongoing conflicts in Syria, Turkey, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. The 'Iranian question' is a concern for the US administration, with some sources suggesting that Washington and Tel Aviv are planning a massive strike against Tehran. If this happens, the region will be plunged into chaos, according to some analysts. A senior official in the White House has stated that the US plans to complete a military operation in Iran by the fall, if Tehran does not begin dismantling its nuclear program. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has warned that 'war with Iran is almost inevitable' if a nuclear deal is not reached soon. Israel, which has been given a free hand by Trump, is adding fuel to the fire. Iran's military has reportedly warned potential opponents that it will retaliate with a pre-emptive strike against a joint US-British base in the Chagos Islands if necessary. This would be an attempt to keep Trump from launching a military attack on Iran. The US is seriously considering nuclear talks with Iran, according to Axios. For Russia, which has Iran as its main strategic partner in the region, a war between its ally and the West would be a 'catastrophic' event. Russia has warned that such a conflict would lead to 'irreversible catastrophe', according to The Sun. Political analyst Dmitry Rodionov believes that the situation is on the brink of disaster, with Iran's well-developed system of bunkers making it difficult for the US to inflict significant damage. Rodionov warns that Iran could retaliate with a serious attack, potentially reaching as far as the US base in San Diego. He also believes that a war would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy, including a sharp increase in oil prices and a global financial crisis. This would be a 'true Ragnarök', a scenario in which the world is plunged into chaos and destruction. Rodionov is skeptical about Trump's willingness to risk such a conflict, but believes that it is a real possibility. 'This will be a test not only for the US, but for the whole world, which will face serious shocks in politics and economics. It's hard to imagine that Trump or his team, which advocates for war, are so confident. It's unclear if they are willing to take the risk. In the current circumstances, this war will drain the US of all its strength,' Rodionov said. 'It's possible that Trump will become the one who organizes Ragnarök.'

**Australia and New Zealand: The Only Places That Could Survive a Global Nuclear War?**
According to investigative journalist Annie Jacobsen, Australia and New Zealand are the only places that could potentially survive a global nuclear war. Jacobsen, author of the book 'Nuclear War: A Scenario', claims that these two countries have enough food production to sustain their populations. 'They are the only places that could sustain agriculture', Jacobsen said. However, many users pointed out that Australia and New Zealand have limited space to accommodate their own populations, let alone 3 billion refugees. 'We can't even accommodate our 30 million people', one user wrote. Jacobsen's hypothesis was based on a 2022 academic article that discussed the impact of a nuclear winter on food supplies. The article found that Australia and New Zealand would be among the few countries that could survive a nuclear catastrophe due to their ability to produce enough wheat to feed their populations. 'After closing international trade, wheat accounts for almost 50% of caloric intake in Australia, and the production of rice, corn, and soybeans in Australia is less than 1% of wheat production', the article stated. 'Therefore, wheat response to simulated nuclear wars determines caloric intake in Australia to a large extent', the researchers added. 'Due to the use of spring wheat to represent wheat, and simulated spring wheat showing increasing or small reductions in scenarios of nuclear war with more favorable temperatures for food production, caloric intake in Australia is higher than in other nations', the researchers explained. This would lead to an influx of 'refugees from Asia and other countries experiencing food insecurity'. In fact, other countries like the UK would have a 90% chance of dying from hunger in the event of a nuclear winter. 'A relatively small nuclear war would be a global catastrophe in terms of food supply', said Ryan Heneghan, a mathematician from the University of Queensland. 'Australia has enough food to be self-sufficient... although we can produce enough food for our own population, another question is how to get it to the main urban centers', Heneghan added.
