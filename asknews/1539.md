**Arctic warming seen at three times global average in years ahead, UN weather agency says**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has predicted that the Arctic will warm at a rate of over three times the global average in the next five years. This accelerated warming is expected to lead to increased ice melt, impacting global weather patterns significantly. The WMO report states that there is an 80% chance of at least one record-breaking heat year in the next five years, with a high likelihood of average warming exceeding 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels. The organization warns that every additional fraction of a degree of warming will drive more extreme weather events, including heatwaves, droughts, and rising sea levels. In the Arctic, the projected warming is expected to be 4.32 degrees Celsius above the average temperature during the most recent 30-year baseline period. Above-average rainfall is forecast in parts of the world, including the Sahel, northern Europe, and Alaska, while drier-than-average conditions are expected in the Amazon. Overall, global temperatures are expected to remain at or near record levels until the end of the decade.

**UN: The World Approaches a New Climate Threshold**
The United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a report warning of a high probability of the global average temperature exceeding the critical threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2025 and 2029, with a 70% chance. This report highlights the world's approach to breaching the climate limit set by the Paris Agreement in 2015, which aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, with a goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. The report notes that the past two years have seen record-breaking temperatures, with 2023 and 2024 being among the hottest years on record. According to the latest data, the average temperature in 2024 exceeded pre-industrial levels by 1.45 degrees Celsius, with a 80% scientific probability that one of the next five years will be warmer than 2024. The report predicts that temperatures will rise between 1.2 and 1.9 degrees Celsius between 2025 and 2029 compared to the mid-19th century, with a 1% chance of exceeding a 2-degree Celsius threshold during the same period, a scenario that was considered unlikely a decade ago but is now a looming reality. These numbers are not just statistics, but reflect an escalating reality of climate change impacts, where temperatures have risen by 40 to 50 degrees Celsius in regions such as China and the UAE, while Pakistan has suffered from drought and strong winds, and Europe and Canada have experienced devastating floods and fires. Rising temperatures also contribute to the melting of permanent ice and the reduction of sea ice coverage, as well as exacerbating droughts and increasing the risk of heavy rainfall. Climate scientists warn that continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions make achieving the ambitious goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius less likely over time. According to the Copernicus program of the European Union, the current warming has reached 1.39 degrees Celsius, and it is likely to exceed the 1.5-degree threshold before the end of the 2020s. The Arctic remains the fastest-warming region compared to the rest of the world, with a clear reduction in sea ice coverage in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas. Studies predict an increase in rainfall rates in coastal areas, Alaska, Siberia, and northern Europe, while the Amazon basin is expected to experience drier conditions in the near future.

**2024 on track to be the hottest year on record, warns Copernicus Climate Change Service**
The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) has warned of a 1.5 °C increase in temperature this year, surpassing previous records. According to the C3S, it is 'practically certain' that 2024 will be the hottest year on record, with a global annual temperature that is expected to be 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. The data from the C3S shows that the global temperature average during the first ten months of 2024 was 0.71°C above the reference period of 1991-2020, which is the highest recorded in this period. C3S subdirector Samantha Burgess stated that the trend marks 'a new milestone in global temperature records', and urged taking action before the next United Nations Climate Change Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. The C3S predicts that the annual temperature in 2024 will be 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and is likely to exceed 1.55 °C.

**Unprecedented Arctic Warming: Implications for Global Climate Patterns**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned of continued global warming in the next five years, with temperatures expected to remain at record-breaking or near-record levels. This will exacerbate climate-related risks to global communities and economies, and threaten sustainable development pathways. The report highlights several key messages, including: There is an 80% chance that one of the next five years (2025-2029) will be the 'hottest year on record', surpassing the record set in 2024. There is an 86% chance that one of the next five years will see a temperature increase of 1.5°C compared to the pre-industrial average (1850-1900). The report shows that there is a 70% chance that global warming will exceed 1.5°C during the period (2025-2029). Despite these alarming forecasts, the report notes that long-term warming, measured over decades, has not yet reached the 1.5°C threshold agreed upon in the Paris Agreement. However, the continued upward trend in temperatures suggests that it may be exceeded in the near future if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. There is an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years (2025-2029) will break the record for the hottest year on record since temperature records began (set in 2024). There is an 86% chance that temperatures will rise by at least 1.5°C in one of the next five years compared to the pre-industrial average. The report does not provide global predictions for each year individually. Breaking any additional degree of warming will lead to more severe heatwaves, extreme weather events, and glacier melting, as well as rising sea levels and ocean temperatures. The Arctic region is expected to continue to experience higher rates of warming than the global average, which may lead to significant environmental changes, including sea ice melting and rising sea levels. The region is expected to experience temperatures 2.4°C above the global average during the next five winters (November to March), which is more than three and a half times the global average. The predictions for sea ice show a decrease in sea ice concentrations in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas from March 2025 to March 2029. The report notes that precipitation patterns will show a clear variation between geographical regions, with some areas expected to become wetter, while others may experience more severe droughts, directly affecting agriculture, water, and food security. South Asia has experienced above-average rainfall in recent years, except for 2023, and forecasts suggest that this trend will continue during the period 2025-2029. However, this may not apply to all seasons in each year of these five years.

**World Meteorological Organization Issues Urgent Climate Warning for Next Five Years**
The World Meteorological Organization (OMM) has released an urgent statement warning of the next five years' global climate projections. According to the report, the average annual global surface temperature is expected to be higher than the 1850-1900 average. The organization warns that for every additional fraction of a degree, 'more damaging heatwaves, extreme precipitation events, intense droughts, melting of ice caps, sea ice, and glaciers, warming of the oceans, and sea level rise' will occur. The OMM emphasizes that these consequences will be more severe with each additional degree of warming.

**Earth on Fire: Why the Next Five Years Could Be the Hottest Ever**
According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the next five years (2025-2029) are expected to be the hottest on record, with global temperatures projected to remain at or near record levels. This forecast underscores the urgency of addressing climate change and its far-reaching impacts. The WMO's 'Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update' outlines several key projections, including a significant increase in risk, with the likelihood of the five-year average exceeding 1.5°C increasing to 47% from 32%. The Arctic region is projected to warm more than three and a half times faster than the global average over the next five extended winters. 'The next five years could be the hottest ever,' the report warns, emphasizing the need for immediate action to mitigate the effects of climate change.

**Arctic warming seen at three times global average in years ahead: UN agency - The Weather Network**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a report predicting that the world will experience more record temperatures over the next five years, with Arctic warming expected to be over three times the global average. There is an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years will see record heat, with a high likelihood that average warming will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. The WMO warns that this warming will fuel more extreme weather, including heatwaves, extreme rainfall events, and rising sea levels. According to the WMO, 'Every additional fraction of a degree of warming drives more harmful heatwaves, extreme rainfall events, intense droughts, melting of ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, heating of the ocean, and rising sea levels.'

**Global Temperature Expected to Reach Record High Over Next Five Years**
According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global temperature is expected to reach a record high or near-record high over the next five years. This will lead to increased climate risks and negative consequences for society, economy, and development. The WMO report states that the global annual average surface temperature for each year from 2025 to 2029 is expected to be 1.2-1.9 degrees Celsius higher than the pre-industrial era (1850-1900). There is an 80% chance that at least one of these years will be the hottest year on record, surpassing 2024. The five-year average temperature is expected to exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold set by the Paris Agreement with a 70% probability, up from 47% in the previous report. Each additional degree of warming will lead to more severe heatwaves, extreme rainfall, droughts, melting of glaciers, warming of oceans, and rising sea levels. The WMO also predicts that the next five winters (November to March) will see a 3.5 times faster warming in the Arctic than the global average. The report warns that there will be no slowdown in the warming trend in the coming years, which will have negative impacts on the economy, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet. 'We have already experienced the hottest ten years on record. Unfortunately, the WMO report suggests that there will be no slowdown in this process, and this will lead to more negative impacts on our economy, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet,' said Ko Barrett, the WMO's Deputy Secretary-General. 'Monitoring and forecasting the climate is essential for decision-makers to adapt to the changing climate, and we need to provide them with science-based tools and data,' he added.

**Climate change: No reprieve from heat this decade as globally agreed 1.5°C limit looms**
The global temperature has been 1.5°C hotter than the pre-industrial average for almost two years, mainly due to record-high greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and forests. According to the World Meteorological Organization, global average warming will remain above 1.5°C for the rest of this decade. Climate scientists, including Richard P. Allan and Simon H. Lee, argue that human-driven ocean warming is overwhelming natural climate patterns, leading to extreme weather events. The ocean has absorbed most of the excess heat, but this 'blue buffer' is showing signs of fraying, with a record-hot Atlantic Ocean posing a risk to people living in the Caribbean and southeast North America. The rapidly changing climate means scientists have not experienced the extremes that modern-day atmospheric and oceanic warmth can produce, making long-range forecasting increasingly difficult. By 2100, Earth is on track to be 2.7°C hotter than its pre-industrial baseline, according to an annual report by leading experts of Earth system science. This conclusion is based on governments meeting their emissions goals, which may already be out of date given the unexpectedly hot first half of 2025.

**Climate Predictions Show Temperatures Expected to Remain at or Near Record Levels in Coming 5 Years**
A recent report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicts that there is an 80% chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be warmer than the current warmest year on record (2024). Additionally, there is an 86% chance that at least one year will be more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level. The report also forecasts a 70% chance that the five-year average warming for 2025-2029 will be more than 1.5°C. WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett stated, 'Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet.' The report also warns that every additional fraction of a degree of warming drives more harmful heatwaves, extreme rainfall events, intense droughts, melting of ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers, heating of the ocean, and rising sea levels.

**Next Five Years Will Be the Hottest in History, Warn Climate Experts**
Climate experts are sounding the alarm. According to a report, there is an 86% chance that the global temperature will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level of 1850-1900 in at least one of the next five years. Additionally, there is a 70% probability that the average temperature for the five-year period of 2025-2029 will be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than the pre-industrial levels. The Arctic region is expected to warm at a rate 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world, which could lead to rapid ice sheet melting and sea level rise. The UK's Met Office, which prepared the report for the World Meteorological Organization, warned that for the first time, there is a very small probability that the average temperature will exceed the pre-industrial level by 2 degrees Celsius in one of the next five years. According to researchers, more than 2.3 million people will die between 2015 and 2099 due to rising temperatures. 'The next five years will be the hottest in history,' the report states. 'It's a matter of time before we see the devastating consequences of climate change.'

**WMO Predicts Unprecedented Warming**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicts that the global average temperature will exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2025-2029 with a 70% certainty. This is based on the analysis of 10 international centers, as reported by the WMO. The planet will remain at historic levels of warming after the two hottest years ever recorded (2023 and 2024) and even the hottest decade, concludes the UK's Met Office. 'We have just lived through the 10 hottest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report does not suggest any respite,' said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett. The 1.5°C target is calculated relative to the period 1850-1900, before humanity began burning fossil fuels, which emit carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. Climatologist Peter Thorne commented, 'This is entirely consistent with the fact that we are close to exceeding 1.5°C in the long term by the end of the 2020s or early 2030s.' According to Christopher Hewitt, Director of Climate Services at the WMO, several methods evaluate long-term warming by smoothing out natural climate variations. One approach combines observations from the past 10 years with projections for the next 10 years, taking the central estimate. This gives a current average warming of 1.44°C over the period 2015-2034. However, Hewitt warns, 'There is no consensus.' The estimation is of the same order of magnitude as that of the European Copernicus observatory (1.39°C). Although this is 'exceptionally unlikely' according to the WMO, there is now a non-zero probability (1%) that at least one of the next five years will exceed 2°C of warming. 'This is the first time we see this in our predictions,' observed Adam Scaife, of the Met Office. 'It's a shock' even if 'we had thought it was plausible at this stage.' Scaife recalled that a decade ago, the predictions had first shown a very low probability that a year would exceed 1.5°C, which was the case for the first time in a calendar year in 2024. Each fraction of a degree of additional warming can intensify heatwaves, extreme precipitation, droughts, glacier and ice sheet melting, and more. The climate of 2025 offers no respite. Last week, China recorded over 40°C in some areas, the UAE near 52°C, and Pakistan was hit by deadly winds after an intense heatwave. 'We have already reached a dangerous level of global warming' with recent 'fatal floods in Australia, France, Algeria, India, China, and Ghana' and 'forest fires in Canada,' emphasizes Friederike Otto, climate scientist at Imperial College London. 'Continuing to bet on oil, gas, and coal in 2025 is absolute madness.' The Arctic warming is expected to continue to exceed the global average over the next five years, predicts the WMO. Sea ice concentration is expected to decrease in the Barents, Bering, and Okhotsk seas, while Asia's South is expected to receive more precipitation than normal. More humid conditions are expected in the Sahel, northern Europe, Alaska, and northern Siberia, as well as drier conditions in the Amazon basin.

**Sea level will rise fast even if we limit global warming to 1.5°C**
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C above the pre-industrial baseline won't be enough to stop sea levels from rising by several metres over the coming centuries, according to a review of all the latest evidence. Chris Stokes at Durham University says, 'I think sometimes there's a misunderstanding that 1.5°C will mean all our problems go away.' The world is currently on course for roughly 2.9°C of warming by 2100, which would lead to the loss of both the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, resulting in over 12 metres of sea level rise. Satellite observations show that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are responding rapidly to warming, with some mass loss being 'really quite staggering' and 'unprecedented' compared to computer models. Studies of previous warm spells during the past 3 million years show that the sea level was many metres higher during these periods. To merely slow sea level rise from the melting ice sheets to a manageable level, the average global temperature needs to be reduced to around 1°C above the pre-industrial baseline, the team estimates.

**2025 May Become One of the Warmest Years in History, Says Hydrometcenter**
According to the Hydrometcenter, 2025 may become one of the warmest years in history. The high temperature of the world's oceans is also affecting the state of the atmosphere, reports TASS. Director of the Institute of Earth Sciences at Tyumen State University, Vasily Khorochev, notes that the warm winter of 2024/2025 is a result of the influence of the atmosphere's state on air temperature. 'There are about a thousand predictive models that forecast an increase in air temperature for the entire Earth in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at the UN is a widely recognized forecast, which predicts a 2-degree increase in air temperature by 2100. However, 2024 was recognized as the hottest year in 175 years of observations, and the first year when the average temperature on the Earth's surface was 1.5 degrees higher than in the pre-industrial period. The summer of 2024 also entered history as one of the hottest on the territory of the Earth,' said Vasily Khorochev in an interview with 'Nash Gorod'. According to Alexander Shuvaylov, head of the predictive center 'Meteo', in the next 30 years, there may be a 2-3 degree increase in winter temperatures and a 1-1.5 degree increase in summer temperatures.

**This is what your life will be like when the world hits a dangerous climate tipping point**
The scientific community has reached a consensus that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, as set out in the Paris Agreement, is unlikely to be achieved. The world has already experienced a year beyond this threshold, with a global average temperature of 1.6 C higher than the preindustrial era. Researchers predict that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the world will be about 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in 2100 than it was at the turn of the 20th century, or about 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it is today. Climate scientists agree that a warmer future is a more dangerous one, with Luke Jackson stating, 'We're widening the goal posts' in terms of extreme events. 'I like to think of good analogies,' says Jackson, 'so, if you imagine that scoring a goal represents an extreme event, then the larger the goal, the more likely you are to score.'

**Scientists: Earth May Have Entered 1.5°C Warming Era**
Scientists say that last year's record-breaking temperature may indicate that the Earth has entered a new era of warming above 1.5°C, a situation that humans have never experienced before. According to the World Meteorological Organization, 2024 is the first year to have a global temperature above 1.5°C. However, exceeding the limit for a single year does not mean violating the Paris Agreement, as the agreement is calculated through a 20- or 30-year rolling average to eliminate annual temperature fluctuations. Scientists estimate that the global temperature has risen by about 1.3°C, higher than the average temperature of the past 125,000 years. A team from Germany and Austria used observational data and computer models to evaluate whether a single year's temperature increase above 1.5°C could be an 'early warning' of long-term risks to the temperature limit. They found that, based on historical patterns, the first year to cross a specific temperature threshold often falls within the 20-year period when the global temperature reaches that level of warming. The authors stated, '2024 being declared the first year to exceed 1.5°C shows that the Earth is likely to have entered the 20-year period of warming above 1.5°C.' They warned that unless 'strict' measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the midpoint of this period, around 2034, will formally violate the Paris Agreement's target. The authors wrote, 'A year with a temperature above 1.5°C is not a time to despair, but a call to action.' In a second study, Canadian Environment and Climate Change Department's Alex Cannon used a slightly different method but reached a similar conclusion. Cannon said that the short-term crossing of 1.5°C in 2024 represents a possible long-term crossing before 2029, but emphasized that real-world factors in the coming years will play a crucial role in determining when the long-term crossing will occur. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate expert said that the possibility of exceeding 1.5°C by the early 2030s is 50/50. The IPCC stated that setting a target to limit warming to 1.5°C, rather than the less ambitious 2°C, can significantly limit the most catastrophic consequences.

**World Enters 1.5°C Phase of Global Warming, Arctic May Be Unrecognizable by 2100**
Two studies suggest that the world has now entered the 1.5°C phase of global warming. The majority of countries that signed the Paris Agreement have missed the deadline for submitting new climate goals, and the Arctic may be barely recognizable by 2100. The current year, 2024, is the warmest on record, with extreme weather events increasing globally. According to a study by the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, the average temperature has exceeded 1.5°C for 20 consecutive years. Another study by the Climate Research Division in British Columbia, Canada, found that if a certain temperature is exceeded in more than 12 consecutive months, the world has likely reached this temperature threshold. The consequences of a 1.5°C temperature increase include 'high risks' for plants, animals, and humans, with more frequent heatwaves, droughts, and floods. Study author Emanuele Bevacqua said, 'Every tenth of a degree counts, because the consequences only get worse.' UN Climate Chief Simon Stiell stated that the 'majority of countries have indicated that they will submit new plans this year' and that it would be 'sensible to take a bit more time' to ensure the plans are more ambitious. A study published in the journal 'Science' found that the Arctic will be barely recognizable by 2100, with the ice-free North Pole in the summer months being a 'unique event in modern human history.' The consequences of a 2.7°C temperature increase include the loss of half of the permanently frozen permafrost soils, the release of additional CO2, and a 20 cm rise in global sea levels. The initiative 'Klima vor acht' is trying to buy airtime on ARD to broadcast a climate format before the 'Tagesschau' news program.
