**João Campos: 'Pulling the Center Closer' is Key to Lula's Re-election**
João Campos, the 31-year-old mayor of Recife and soon-to-be president of the PSB, believes that the key to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's re-election in 2026 lies in 'pulling the center closer' and engaging in a more inclusive dialogue with the country's center-left and center-right. Campos, who was re-elected as mayor with 71% of the vote in 2023, emphasizes the need for a more rational and less polarized approach to politics. He supports the maintenance of Geraldo Alckmin as vice-president and aims to expand the PSB's presence in the electoral arena while maintaining its progressive identity. According to Campos, the party sees itself as a priority ally of the government and is committed to working internally to build a stronger coalition. He also suggests that the government should adopt a more conciliatory approach to attract sectors that are currently distant, such as the agronegócio, autônoms, and churches. 'We need to understand what they think to represent them,' he said. Campos also believes that the left has struggled to understand the recent transformations in Brazil and that the next election will be marked by a continued polarization. However, he argues that the solution lies in competing for the center, not just the parties, but also the center of society. 'What's at stake is the center. Neither the right nor the left wins alone,' he said.

**Gleisi: Lula is the only option for the left in 2026 presidential election**
Minister Gleisi Hoffmann believes that the left wing in Brazil has no other option for the 2026 presidential election than President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT). According to her, Lula is the only one who can 'win against the extreme right' and is the only one who can challenge former President Jair Bolsonaro and any potential right-wing candidate. Gleisi defended Lula, saying 'He's fine, but he also knows that if he's not fine in terms of health, he can't run. It's him we'll have to compete with in the 2026 election.' She also justified the alliances made by Lula's government with center and right-wing parties, such as União Brasil, MDB, PSD, PP, and Republicanos, stating that the goal was to 'isolate the extreme right' and gain support from the right. A survey by Estadão indicates that the PT may form an alliance with MDB or PSD in at least ten states next year, either by supporting their candidates or nominating names for vice or Senate. However, this strategy carries risks, as local agreements can collapse if one of the parties decides to go its own way in the presidential election.

**Trump Administration Predicts Lula's Defeat in 2026 Presidential Election**
The government of Donald Trump predicts a landslide victory for a right-wing president in the 2026 Brazilian presidential election, with Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) expected to lose in the first round. According to the US government, Lula's disapproval ratings are high, and he is unlikely to make it to the second round. The Trump administration believes that a conviction of Jair Bolsonaro in the Supreme Court would lead to a short prison sentence, and that a right-wing president would have enough popular support to grant Bolsonaro an amnesty. Bolsonaro was convicted of electoral crimes and is currently ineligible to run for office until 2030.

**Lula's Health Issues and Bolsonaro's Family: A Complex Election Ahead in Brazil**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula) has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2026, despite his health issues. Lula has been hospitalized several times in recent months, including a recent incident where he fell and suffered a head injury. However, he remains confident in his ability to win the election, saying 'I will run in 2026. The only person who can beat me is me.' Lula has also begun to build alliances with other parties, including the Democratic Movement of Brazil (MDB), in an effort to secure his re-election. Meanwhile, former President Jair Bolsonaro's family is also eyeing the presidency, with his wife Michelle and son Eduardo emerging as potential candidates. Bolsonaro's allies, including Governor Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas, are also considering running for the presidency. Lula's health issues and the rise of Bolsonaro's family as potential candidates make the 2026 election a complex and unpredictable contest.

**Lula Calls for Commitment and Dignity in 2026 Presidential Election**
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that the population cannot vote for 'anyone who is a troublemaker' to govern the country in the 2026 elections. During an official event in Salgueiro (PE), Lula attacked former presidents Jair Bolsonaro and Michel Temer, saying, 'We cannot vote for anyone who has no commitment, no dignity, and no right to look you in the eye.' Lula also criticized Bolsonaro for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying, 'He spent four years lying on television, spreading fake news, and lying to the people. He even managed to lie about a cure for COVID, and 700,000 people died as a result, when we could have prevented the death of at least 50% of those people.' Lula is currently the only candidate considered by the PT for the 2026 presidential election, despite being ineligible until 2030. Bolsonaro is trying to reverse the decision of the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) to run in the election.

**Lula says God left the sertão without water because he knew he would be president**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that 'God left the sertão without water' because he knew he would be elected president. Lula made this declaration during an event to sign a contract for a branch of the São Francisco River transposition project in Cachoeira dos Índios, in the sertão of Paraíba. He emphasized the importance of the project for the Northeast region and said that the decision to undertake it was 'the most important one he has ever made in his life'. Lula also stated that voters should not vote for 'anyone who is just a politician', but rather for someone who has a commitment to the country's future. 'We cannot vote for anyone who is just a politician to govern the country. We need to vote for people who have a commitment, who have dignity, who have the right to look you in the eye', he said.

**Lula's Comparisons to God and Jesus Christ: A Repeated Theme in His Public Statements**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has made several statements comparing himself to God and Jesus Christ. In a recent speech, he said, 'God left the sertão without water because he knew I would be elected president and bring water to the region.' This is not the first time Lula has made such a statement. In 2016, he said, 'I tell my son, don't get angry, it's like this, my son, we'll endure. Jesus Christ suffered more than us. Tiradentes was crucified, and only after more than 100 years was he transformed into a hero.' He also said, 'I have a public history known. I think only Jesus Christ beats me in popularity in Brazil. Because, think, a well-known and marked man in this country.' Lula has made similar comparisons in the past, including during his 2022 presidential campaign, where he said, 'The human race has been following the polarization between God and the Devil for centuries and has never had a third option.'

The newspaper considers 49-year-old Tarcisio Gomez de Freitas, Governor of the state of Sao Paulo, to be Lula da Silva's main competition. Gomez de Freitas, who served as Infrastructure Minister under President Jair Bolsonaro, could potentially be the right wing's candidate in the next election, replacing Bolsonaro, who has been barred from running for president until 2030.

Metrópoles notes that Gomes de Freitas could become a replacement for Bolsonaro as a candidate from right-wing parties, as the former president is banned from running until 2030.

**Lula Considers Re-election Bid in 2026, But Prioritizes Health**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, 79, has expressed his willingness to run for re-election in 2026, but only if his health allows it.

Recent polls have shown him as the favorite to win, despite a fragmented right-wing opposition.

Lula has had some health issues since taking office, including a recent surgery to drain a subdural hematoma caused by a fall at home. He has also had a bronchitis and a vocal cord polyp removal in the past. Lula has also warned that Brazil will respond with 'reciprocality' to any trade measures taken by the US, including tariffs on Brazilian steel, which was announced by US President Donald Trump.

**Lula Considers 2026 Re-election Bid, But Only If He's in Good Health**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, 79, has expressed the possibility of running for re-election in 2026, but only if he is in good health. Lula stated, 'If I'm feeling fine and think I can be a candidate, I can be a candidate.' He emphasized the importance of his health, saying, 'I have to be honest with myself, I'm 79 years old, I have to be aware of my own limitations.' Lula also mentioned a recent head injury in October 2024, which he said has improved his mental clarity and positivity. He concluded, 'If I'm in good health, with 100% energy, I can be a candidate in 2026, but it's not my priority now.' Lula also noted that it's 'too early' to discuss the next election.

**Lula da Silva Considers Re-election in 2026, But Only if He's '100% Healthy'**
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that he will run for re-election in 2026 if he is '100% healthy' and 'has the same energy' as he does now. Lula, who is 79 years old, emphasized that he needs to be 'conscientious' of his age and 'cannot lie to anyone, including himself.' He also noted that being a candidate involves 'a discussion with many political parties and Brazilian society.' Lula is currently in his third year of a four-year term and will be 81 years old when the 2026 presidential elections take place. According to recent polls, Lula is the favorite to win, despite being part of a fragmented right-wing opposition. The Workers' Party (PT) has already decided that Lula will be their candidate for 2026, but Lula has not yet made a final decision. Lula has had some health issues since taking office, including a recent surgery to drain a brain hemorrhage caused by a fall, and a hospitalization for a vocal cord procedure in 2022.
