**Powerful Dahlonega state Sen. Steve Gooch jumps into 2026 Georgia lieutenant governor race • Georgia Recorder**
Georgia Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch has announced his candidacy for the 2026 lieutenant governor race. Gooch stated, 'I'm running for Lieutenant Governor because Georgia deserves bold leadership that will stand up to the insanity of the Democrat Party, protect our families from the invasion of criminal illegal aliens and keep our economy vibrant and strong.' He aims to make Georgia a 'gold standard' for the country, securing borders, stopping violent crime, and abolishing the state income tax. Gooch has served in the Senate since 2010 and is a 'die-hard MAGA supporter' and 'MAGA champion.' He faces a potentially crowded GOP primary, with several powerful Senate Republicans reportedly considering runs. Democratic rival Sen. Josh McLaurin stated, 'The Majority Leader appears to have made his MAGA license plate bill the centerpiece of his campaign launch. I think that choice makes the point about how the GOP primary is going to go: it's going to be about who can suck up the most to Trump.'

**6 Democrats want to be Va.'s lieutenant governor. Here's what to know.**
Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary to become the party's nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor. The candidates agree on many issues, including repealing Virginia's right-to-work law, increasing the minimum wage, and protecting abortion access. However, they differ on specific policies and issues, such as gaming and education. Alex Bastani, a retired economist and lawyer, is running to the left of the other candidates, proposing a slate of pro-worker policies, including raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour and providing free college to all Virginians. State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, a former literature professor and community college administrator, touts her six years of experience in the Senate and has already carried legislation to advance many shared Democratic priorities. Babur B. Lateef, a prominent Northern Virginia eye surgeon, has made opposition to a Northern Virginia casino a prominent issue and calls for eliminating skill games. State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored high-profile legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market. Victor Salgado, a former federal prosecutor, opposes the Northern Virginia casino and skill games, saying they would feed crime and addiction. Levar Stoney, the former mayor of Richmond, positions himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families and people in need.

**Pennsylvania Perspective for Thursday, May 22, 2025**
Pennsylvania's 2025 primary elections were 'relatively calm and successful,' according to Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt, with minor issues reported statewide. Republican candidates Matthew Wolford and Maria Battista won their respective primaries for the Commonwealth and Superior Courts, and will face Democratic nominees Stella Tsai and Brandon Neuman in the general election. Pennsylvania lawmakers narrowed a proposed hospital merger oversight bill to focus on private equity, and awarded $22.5 million in Solar for Schools grants to 73 schools statewide. A new report reveals that opioid use disorder cost Pennsylvania over $232 billion in 2024, and a treatment combining behavioral therapy and medication could save up to $295,000 per case. Starting June 5, Pennsylvania will ban handheld cell phone use while driving, and District Attorney Larry Krasner is on track for a third term after winning the Democratic primary. Allegheny County Controller Corey O'Connor won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, defeating incumbent Ed Gainey, and the U.S. House narrowly passed President Donald Trump's major tax-and-immigration budget bill, which now moves to the Senate for expected revisions.

**Zohran Mamdani makes up ground in NYC mayoral race  --  but still...**
A new internal poll shows Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani gaining ground on Andrew Cuomo in the NYC mayoral primary race, but the ex-governor still maintains a 12-point lead. According to the poll, Cuomo would win the June 24 primary with 56% of the vote, while Mamdani would end with 44%. Mamdani's campaign said, 'With still a third lower name recognition than Cuomo and millions in cash on hand, Zohran is nowhere near his ceiling.' Cuomo's spokesman Rich Azzopardi pointed out that the results mirror recent independent polls, including one that had Cuomo winning 61% to 39% in the seventh round. The poll surveyed 500 likely voters between May 14 and 18.

**The Democratic Party is not dying  --  it's evolving | Blaze Media**
Contrary to popular opinion, the Democratic Party is not dying, but rather evolving. Despite low party approval ratings, Democrats are still winning elections, such as Rep. Abigail Spanberger's (D-Va.) bid for Virginia governor. Spanberger, a liberal Democrat, is running away in her race despite the party's poor national standing. The article argues that voters often treat parties as abstractions, but candidates as individuals, and that Democrats are skilled at presenting themselves in a way that appeals to voters. The author also notes that Democrats have a strong ground game, with support from teachers' unions, public sector workers, and other groups, and that they enjoy bountiful donations from wealthy donors. The article concludes that the Republican National Committee should stop pretending that the Democratic Party is in its death throes and start focusing on winning elections.

**Arlington Dems: “The Republican Lt. Governor nominee in Virginia is justifying the murder of George Floyd” (who was asphyxiated to death in cold blood 5 years ago)**
The Arlington Democrats have criticized the Republican Lt. Governor nominee in Virginia for justifying the murder of George Floyd. The nominee's argument is seen as insensitive and unjustified, as Derek Chauvin, the police officer who killed Floyd, was found guilty of all three murder and manslaughter charges. Sen. Tim Kaine expressed concern that the DOJ's decision to halt ongoing investigations and drop police agreements put in place after Floyd's death is 'dangerous.' The Arlington Democrats also pointed out that the nominee's comments are reminiscent of Donald Trump's own history of serious crimes, and that the use of the term 'urban society' is code for the African-American community.

**Democratic lieutenant governor candidates clash over economy, education and DEI at Woodbridge debate**
Six Democratic candidates for Virginia's lieutenant governor debated on federal job cuts, economic uncertainty, and culture war clashes in public education. The candidates, including state senators Ghazala Hashmi and Aaron Rouse, former Richmond mayor Levar Stoney, and labor economist Alex Bastani, largely aligned on core values but offered different approaches to governing. They proposed measures such as expanding unemployment benefits, increasing support for small businesses, and shoring up public services. The candidates also expressed support for DEI initiatives and called out Republican efforts to revise Virginia's learning standards. Hashmi criticized the Youngkin administration's rollback of inclusive curriculum, saying students must be 'educated broadly, comprehensively.' Rouse vowed to fight efforts to censor books and restrict classroom discussion, saying 'We are more than just athletes... We are intelligent.' Bastani argued that strengthening the labor movement is key to advancing DEI, saying union membership fosters solidarity and reduces bias. The debate highlighted the candidates' differing views on issues such as the Tysons Casino proposal, with Salgado and Lateef standing out as the strongest opponents.

**Virginia Democratic Lt. Governor Candidates (Alex Bastani, Ghazala Hashmi, Babur Lateef, Aaron Rouse, Victor Salgado, Levar Stoney)  Debate Tonight at 7 pm on Live TV**
The Virginia Democratic lieutenant governor candidates, Alex Bastani, Ghazala Hashmi, Babur Lateef, Aaron Rouse, Victor Salgado, and Levar Stoney, will debate tonight at 7 pm on live TV. The debate comes after a recent controversy surrounding a question asked by a Sinclair-owned station's anchor, Dave Lucas, to a Muslim candidate, which was deemed 'inappropriate' by Virginia politicians and prominent Muslims. The question was whether the candidate could assure voters that they would 'represent all of them, regardless of faith and beliefs.' The debate is expected to be a crucial moment in the campaign, with many Virginians planning to watch and make their decision on who to support for the 2025 Democratic LG nomination.

On the Democratic side, six candidates are competing, including former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and State Sens. Ghazala Hashmi and Aaron Rouse. On the Republican side, radio host John Reid is running after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity dropped out due to health reasons.

**MAGA rabble-rouser Dave LaRock forced to drop out of 2025 Republican governor race**
Dave LaRock, a former state legislator and college dropout, has been forced to drop out of the 2025 Republican governor race in Virginia after failing to gather enough signatures to get on the June primary ballot. LaRock said he was able to collect 9,000 signatures, but fell short of the 10,000 required. LaRock's departure leaves Winsome Earle-Sears, the sitting lieutenant governor, as the sole Republican challenger to presumptive Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger. LaRock's campaign was seen as a threat to Earle-Sears' chances, with LaRock's statement highlighting his support for President Trump's policies and his desire to work closely with the Trump administration. According to LaRock, 'The Commonwealth of Virginia faces some complex challenges... It excites me to see the Trump administration's commitment to efficiency and commonsense values. This moment should be embraced, as it creates a unique opportunity for Virginia.'
