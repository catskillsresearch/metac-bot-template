**Incidence of recurrence and development of polypoidal lesions following half-dose and two-thirds dose photodynamic therapy for pachychoroid neovasculopathy - Scientific Reports**
A study of 105 patients with pachychoroid neovasculopathy (PNV) treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) found that reduced-dose PDT was effective in reducing symptoms and recurrence rates. The study, published in Scientific Reports, found that 21% of patients in the half-dose group and 31% in the two-thirds dose group experienced recurrence. The median recurrence duration was 1021 days in the half-dose group and 1127 days in the two-thirds dose group. The study also found that patients with a larger pre-treatment macular neovascularization (MNV) area were more likely to develop recurrence. Additionally, the study found that polypoidal lesions developed in 7% of patients during a mean follow-up of 588 days, with no significant difference in incidence between the half-dose and two-thirds dose PDT groups. The study's findings suggest that reduced-dose PDT is a viable treatment option for PNV, but further research is needed to fully understand the causes of polypoidal lesion development and the long-term effects of PDT on macular atrophy.

**Anti-Ageing Drug Combo Extends Mouse Lifespan By 30%, Sparks Hope For Human Longevity**
A study by the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing found that a combination of two FDA-approved drugs, rapamycin and trametinib, can extend the lifespan of mice by up to 30%. The treated mice showed improved health markers, including reduced inflammation, delayed tumor progression, and enhanced physical function. While rapamycin alone extended lifespan by 17-18% and trametinib by 7-16%, their combination achieved a remarkable 26-35% increase. Researchers plan to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of trametinib to maximise its health and life-prolonging effects while minimising unwanted side effects. As trametinib is already approved for human use, it is possible to test it in clinical trials. According to co-senior author Professor Dame Linda Partridge, 'While we do not expect a similar extension to human lifespans as we found in mice, we hope that the drugs we're investigating could help people to stay healthy and disease-free for longer late in life.' These findings suggest potential for developing anti-aging therapies in humans, but further studies and clinical trials are necessary to determine safety and efficacy in humans.

**Russia Develops New Cellular Products for Healthy Longevity**
Russian Vice-Premier Tatyana Golikova announced the development of new cellular products for extending healthy life. These products are part of the 'New Technologies for Saving Health' national project, which includes 5 federal projects. According to Golikova, the first product is a biomedicine cellular product for treating male infertility. The product is expected to be available by the end of 2025. The second product is for treating burns and wounds, with over 200,000 people affected annually. The third product is for regenerative medicine, including the restoration of cartilage in large joints. This product is already included in clinical recommendations and can be used by medical organizations. Golikova also announced the development of a device for correcting cognitive and stress disorders, which is expected to be registered in early 2026. Additionally, panels and test systems for determining biological age and aging processes in organs and tissues are planned to be developed in the medium term. 'We are working on developing medications that restore aging cells and functions,' said Golikova. 'This is not a distant future, but a reality that we are working on.' Golikova also emphasized the importance of making medicine for healthy longevity accessible and available at the place of residence. She proposed the creation of a new position - a doctor of healthy longevity, who would work in the new type of health centers. 'These centers will not only conduct dispenzerization, but also work with pre-risk factors,' said Golikova.

**Extended Follow-Up Results of the CheckMate 274 Trial: Adjuvant Nivolumab for Resected Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma - Matthew Galsky**
The CheckMate 274 trial has released extended follow-up results, showing the effectiveness of adjuvant nivolumab in treating muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. According to Matthew Galsky, the co-primary endpoints of the study were disease-free survival in the all-comer population and in patients with tumor PD-L1 expression greater than or equal to 1%. The study also explored secondary and exploratory endpoints, including non-urothelial tract recurrence-free survival. Galsky noted that while adjuvant therapy aims to eradicate micrometastatic disease and translate a non-curative situation to curative, the duration of treatment remains to be determined. 'If you just continue treatment, you might show that you can delay recurrence, but not necessarily prevent recurrence,' he said.

**Scientists Find Way to Extend Life and Delay Aging by 26-35% in Mice**
Scientists have found a way to extend life and delay aging by combining two drugs, which not only prolonged the life of mice by 26-35%, but also significantly improved its quality. According to Science Alert, the study showed that animals remained active for longer, with lower levels of chronic inflammation and delayed cancer development. The team from the Max Planck Institute (Germany) used rapamycin (immunosuppressant) and trametinib (anticancer drug). Individually, each of them had already demonstrated an effect of slowing down aging, but in combination, their impact was synergistic. Researchers tested the drugs separately and together. Rapamycin increased lifespan by 17-18%, trametinib by 7-16%. Combined use prolonged life by 26-35%. The animals remained active for longer, with less inflammation and later cancer development. Researchers note that these results do not mean that similar treatment will extend human life to 130 years. However, the drugs may become the basis for future therapy that will help people age slower and maintain quality of life. 'We do not expect the same increase in human life as was demonstrated in mice, but we hope that the drugs will help people stay healthy in old age. Further research on humans in the coming years will help us determine how these drugs can be beneficial for people and who they can be beneficial for,' said co-author of the study Linda Partidge.

**How Talking Therapy Can Change Your Life**
BBC News followed 12 people who participated in a series called 'Change Your Mind, Change Your Life' and received six sessions of therapy from mental health professionals. The participants were suffering from various mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The therapy used a combination of different talking therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on changing the way we think and behave, as well as other techniques to improve relationships and process trauma. The results showed that the therapy was effective in helping the participants to understand and manage their mental health. One of the participants, James, learned to think differently about himself through the therapy. He had been suffering from anxiety, particularly anxiety about making mistakes at work, which had been holding him back from going to work. After the therapy, he was able to see himself in a different light and felt more confident. Another participant, Angali, was struggling with anxiety and depression after the sudden death of her mother when she was 15. She had been feeling overwhelmed and was having trouble sleeping. Through the therapy, she was able to process her trauma and learn to cope with her emotions. She said that the therapy had helped her to 'reconnect with the girl I was at 15' and that she was now able to understand and manage her emotions. The therapy was also effective in helping the participants to develop a more positive self-image and to learn how to manage their emotions. Overall, the results of the therapy were positive, and the participants reported feeling more confident and in control of their lives.

**Kurzweil Predicts 'Time Travel' by 2029: Can Humanity Achieve It?**
Renowned futurist and engineer Ray Kurzweil predicts that humans may achieve 'time travel' by 2029, referring to the concept of 'escape velocity from aging'. According to Popular Mechanics magazine, this concept means that medical progress will increase the average life expectancy at a rate faster than human aging. In other words, every year we live, we will add more than a year to our age, potentially leading to unprecedented life extension. Kurzweil based his prediction on the rapid development of modern medical technologies, particularly the COVID-19 vaccine, which was developed in less than a year using the analysis of billions of mRNA sequences in just a few days. The magazine also noted that artificial intelligence and biological simulation have become crucial tools in accelerating the discovery of new treatments. However, Kurzweil warned that this progress does not mean immortality. In every moment, accidents or diseases like cancer can occur, leading to death, according to the magazine. Kurzweil said, 'A 10-year-old child may have decades of life, but may die tomorrow', highlighting the limitations of predictions based on statistics. The magazine also points out that the real challenge lies in the global disparity in access to these advanced technologies. Despite the existence of effective treatments for old diseases like tuberculosis, they still cause thousands of deaths in some countries, reflecting the gap between innovation and its implementation in reality. Kurzweil expects technology to continue driving up human lifespan, but the biggest challenge remains ensuring that these medical benefits are accessible to all fairly, to achieve the true benefit of humanity, not just a limited group, according to the source.

**Are We the Generation that Will Never Die?**
The author explores the theme of accelerating human progress and its consequences. They argue that our capacity for external transformation has become exponential, while our internal capacity for adaptation remains linear. This dissonance is visible in the rise of mental health disorders, collective anxiety, and the erosion of shared truth. The author also discusses the implications of longevity escape velocity, where our ability to extend the human lifespan increases faster than we age. They question whether we should pursue immortality and how it would affect our values and meaning. The author draws parallels between the themes explored in the essay and the TV show Black Mirror, which critiques the consequences of technological advancements on human society. They also reference economist Noah Smith's blog post, 'Welcome to the Future,' which argues that the cyberpunk future has quietly arrived. The author concludes that we are no longer anticipating the future, but living in it, and that we must recognize it for what it is and shape its trajectory rather than passively inhabit it.

**The Singularity Is Near: Why We Must Shift from Revenge to Rehabilitation  --  and from Retribution...**
Futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts that by 2029, humans may reach 'longevity escape velocity' where medical advancements extend life expectancy faster than time passes. This could enable individuals to live beyond 100 years, potentially reaching 500 years or more. However, advancements in biotechnology and artificial intelligence have exposed a fatal flaw: our emotional evolution has not kept pace with our technological growth. We risk creating a world where people never die, but never heal. The article argues that we need to shift from revenge to rehabilitation and from retribution to redemption. This requires building systems that allow people to evolve and providing access to life-extending medicine. The author suggests that we need emotional engineers, trauma technologists, and generational therapists to rehabilitate long-lived individuals. The article concludes that if we want to survive the singularity, we must learn to redeem what we once condemned, forgive what we once feared, and repair what we once erased.

**Aging and the Quest for Immortality - First Things**
The quest for immortality has long been a topic of interest, with many people seeking to extend their lifespan beyond a century. While some argue that nature has a genetically wired 'hard stop' for the human lifespan, others believe that science can make it possible to live indefinitely. The anti-aging movement has gained momentum, with scientists focusing on ways to slow or shut down the aging process. However, the debate surrounding the effectiveness of current medicinal products and the feasibility of achieving indefinite life extension remains. Google futurist Ray Kurzweil, a prominent advocate for life extension, believes that 'longevity escape velocity' is imminent, where scientific progress undoes the passage of time. He envisions a future where people can download their consciousness into new bodies, effectively achieving immortality. However, others, like bioethicist Leon Kass, argue that science cannot produce purpose and that humans cannot live without a higher purpose that gives life meaning. Kass writes that we are 'adrift without a compass' and that the attempt to escape death is both 'wicked because unnatural' and 'silly because death is a gift of God'.

**The Quest for Eternal Life: Is 'Escape Velocity of Longevity' Within Reach?**
The quest for eternal life has been a human obsession for centuries, and recent scientific advancements suggest that we may be closer to achieving it than ever before. The concept of 'escape velocity of longevity' refers to the possibility of extending our lifespan by one year every year, effectively achieving immortality. According to Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, we may reach this milestone as early as 2029. Kurzweil predicts that in just five years, we will be able to rejuvenate faster than we age, citing exponential growth in scientific development as the driving force behind this progress. While this may seem like science fiction, the data suggests that our lifespan has increased significantly over the past few centuries, with many countries doubling their average lifespan in recent decades.

**Scientists Predict Reversing Time in 5 Years: The Future of Longevity**
According to Nils Behrens, Chief Brand Officer of Sunday Natural and host of the HEALTHWISE podcast, scientists predict that we could reverse time in 5 years. Behrens emphasizes that technologies like simulating biological processes will play a key role. By analyzing billions of mRNA sequences in a short amount of time, we can develop personalized and effective treatments that could slow down or even reverse aging. Another example is the development of self-driving cars, which could minimize the risk of fatal accidents and contribute to a longer lifespan. However, Behrens notes that achieving Longevity Escape Velocity does not automatically mean immortality, as unpredictable events like accidents or currently incurable diseases can still shorten life. Furthermore, the question arises whether these technological advancements will be accessible to everyone worldwide or only to a privileged minority. The prospect of extended life raises ethical questions, such as how resources will be distributed and how this will impact the environment and global economy. It is essential to address these questions to ensure that technological progress benefits humanity as a whole.

**The Longevity Economy**
The concept of Longevity Escape Velocity suggests that medical advancements will soon be able to extend human life faster than we age, giving people more than a year of additional life for every year they live. Pioneering researchers like Dr. David Sinclair, Dr. Aubrey de Grey, and Professor Vera Gorbunova are proving that aging is a biological condition that can be slowed down, prevented, or even reversed. However, human behavior is not keeping up with human potential, and governments must act to ensure that medical advances are accessible to all, not just the privileged few. A cultural shift is happening, with public interest in healthspan and longevity skyrocketing, and it is a pivotal moment for the global awakening to longevity.
