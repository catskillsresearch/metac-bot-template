**Von der Leyen speaks with Trump: 'A good conversation'**
EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen announced on Sunday evening that the parties have spoken after US President Donald Trump's surprise statement about a potential 50% tariff on the EU. Trump made the statement during a press conference at the White House on Friday, saying he 'does not see an agreement with the EU, and a 50% tariff will be introduced from June 1.' However, he added that 'there will be no tariff if they choose to build a factory here.' Trump also stated that 'they have not treated us right,' when asked if there was anything the EU could do. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre described Trump's statement as 'very dramatic' and 'very serious for our economy.' Von der Leyen stated that the EU and US share the world's most important trade partnership, and that Europe is ready to hold direct and decisive talks. She also noted that if the parties are to reach a good agreement, they need time until July 9. Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on most goods, as well as a 25% tariff on cars and some car parts, before pausing the tariffs for 90 days. Von der Leyen was not lenient towards Trump when he initially threatened a trade war in early April, stating that 'Europe started this confrontation, we think it's wrong. But we have everything we need to protect our people and our prosperity.' EU economist Harald Magnus Andreassen told E24 that Trump's statement about a 50% tariff is likely a negotiating statement, saying that 'the costs for both the EU and the US will be very high and completely unnecessary.'

**Accusations of Coup Attempt at 'Fred og rettferdighet' National Meeting**
The 'Fred og rettferdighet' (Peace and Justice) party, which gathered the 5000 signatures needed to participate in the Norwegian parliamentary election in January, held its first ordinary national meeting over the weekend. The meeting was marked by long debates about the order of business, strong characterizations, and three different proposals for a party program. The election committee had proposed a central committee of 15 members, all from Oslo or surrounding areas, citing the need for frequent meetings and district representation to be handled by the national board. This led to accusations of a coup attempt orchestrated from the eastern region and a democratic deficit. A compromise was reached, with two additional district representatives being elected to join the original 15. One of the program proposals was withdrawn, and the other two were shortened and merged. The adopted program is brief and will be expanded next year. The party, now known as For, will participate in the election for the first time in the fall and aims to pass the 4% threshold. Many delegates, including the party leader, have a background in the Red Party, but others come from various parties, including the Progress Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Labour Party, the Green Party, and peace and anti-nuclear organizations. The party gained attention with a campaign on the Oslo tram calling for a stop to financial support for Ukraine, funded by a one million kroner donation from billionaire Atle Berge. Party leader Leraand told TV 2 that the party has received promises of further private donations and may use more controversial advertising in the campaign. 'We are Norway's only peace party, and we will use the money for welfare,' Leraand said. Professor Glenn Disen, the party's first candidate in Akershus, was not physically present but sent a digital greeting, apologizing for his absence due to high pressure in the past week, including his appearance on NRK, and the need to care for his family.

**Moldova's EU Accession: A Politicized Process?**
Moldova's President Maia Sandu has promised to complete negotiations for the country's accession to the EU by the end of 2027. However, this goal seems unrealistic given Moldova's current economic situation. The country's poverty rate has increased by almost 10 percentage points over the past four years, reaching 33.6%. The number of people living in absolute poverty has grown by 170,000 people, reaching 814,000. The EU's Commissioner for Expansion, Maroš Šefčovič, has stated that the EU may consider accelerating Moldova's accession process, separate from Ukraine's. However, this decision is seen as an attempt to influence the upcoming parliamentary elections in Moldova, which are scheduled for September 28. The ruling party, PDM, is trying to secure its position by promising a quick accession to the EU. The EU's involvement in Moldova's internal affairs is seen as an interference in the country's democratic process. The article suggests that the EU's goal is to ensure the victory of the ruling party in the elections, rather than promoting the interests of the Moldovan people.

**Center Party Faces Crisis Ahead of Norwegian Parliamentary Election**
The latest NRK poll shows a significant decline in support for the Center Party (Senterpartiet) ahead of the Norwegian parliamentary election. In Møre og Romsdal, the party's support has dropped from 17.5% to 7.5%. Party leader Geir Inge Lien has held his seat, but is concerned about the party's prospects. 'We will stand firm and convince people in Møre og Romsdal that the Center Party's policy is good for the county,' he said. The party is facing a crisis, with support halved in 15 of 19 electoral districts since 2021. Several high-profile members are at risk of losing their seats, including former ministers. The party has made the question of Norwegian EU membership a key campaign issue, hoping to regain support by opposing the EU. Party leader Trygve Slagsvold Vedum has visited Sunnmøre, promising to include the Ishavsmuseet in the revised national budget. This could be a boost for Geir Inge Lien, who is fighting to retain his seat in Møre og Romsdal. 'Every day is an eternal election campaign,' Lien said. 'We want to achieve things, and this will not be less important now ahead of the election.'

**Union Blocks AfD Representatives in Parliamentary Committees**
The Union party has decided to block the election of AfD representatives in parliamentary committees. The decision was made by the Union's parliamentary business manager, Steffen Bilger, who stated that it is 'not acceptable' to have AfD representatives in committees given their right-wing extremist stance. However, the election is secret, and each MP will decide individually. The AfD had previously failed to win any committee chair positions, despite having the right to propose candidates in six committees. The Union's decision is seen as a continuation of the party's efforts to isolate the AfD. Meanwhile, the new government is facing criticism for its handling of the climate and energy policy. The Greens have accused the government of breaking its promises on climate protection, and the SPD has criticized the government's plans to reduce funding for the climate and transformation fund. The government has also been criticized for its handling of the refugee crisis, with over 6,000 people being deported in the first quarter of the year. The AfD has announced plans to challenge the decision to allocate a smaller committee room to the party. The party's parliamentary business manager, Bernd Baumann, has stated that the party will take 'all necessary steps' to challenge the decision. The government has also been criticized for its handling of the G7 finance ministers' meeting, with the new finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, being seen as lacking in expertise. Klingbeil has met with his US counterpart, Scott Bessent, to discuss trade issues, but the meeting was seen as lacking in substance. The government has also been criticized for its handling of the Holocaust, with the education minister, Karin Prien, calling for schoolchildren to visit concentration camps as part of their education. The minister has stated that the visits should be part of a broader education program, but critics have argued that the visits alone are not enough to prevent extremism. The government has also been criticized for its handling of the military, with the new defense minister, Henning Otte, being seen as lacking in experience. Otte has been appointed as the new Wehrbeauftragter, a position that is responsible for overseeing the military. The appointment has been seen as a continuation of the government's efforts to centralize power.

**Norway Begins Talks with EU on Health Preparedness**
Norway has started negotiations with the EU on health preparedness. The EU Commission informed NTB that also Iceland and Liechtenstein, the other two EEA countries, are participating in the negotiations. 'But it's Norway that's pushing for it,' said a Commission spokesperson. Health and Care Minister Jan Christian Vestre (Ap) was in Brussels on Friday for talks with EU Health Commissioner Hadja Lahbib. In January, Vestre stated that he would 'not sleep well at night' until the agreement on health preparedness was in place. Since the corona pandemic, Norway has been trying to get into the EU's health preparedness agency (HERA), which is outside the EEA agreement. However, just before the new year, it became clear that Norway would not become a full member, but would instead get a kind of B-status with limited cooperation, focusing on acute health preparedness and vaccine cooperation. Norway currently has observer status in HERA. Norway is also participating in the European Vaccine Hub (EHV) initiative, which aims to significantly reduce the time it takes to develop new vaccines. Four months from the discovery and DNA sequencing of a new virus or bacteria, it should take. Vestre also discussed crisis preparedness cooperation with Lahbib, and Norway is currently participating in the EU's crisis mechanism. This means that if a natural disaster were to occur in Norway, the country can request assistance from the EU. Conversely, Norway can also offer help if a crisis were to occur in an EU country.

**Vedums warning: 'Yes' side will use security situation to lure Norway into EU**
Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the leader of the Norwegian Progress Party (Sp), has expressed concerns that the 'yes' side in the upcoming EU referendum will use the current security situation to lure Norway into the EU. He warns that the 'yes' side will wait for a brief moment when there is a majority in favor of EU membership and then push for a referendum. Vedum has made it clear that his party will only support a government budget after the election if there is a guarantee that a referendum on EU membership will not be held in the next parliamentary period. He also notes that the 'yes' side has already started planning for a new EU debate and that Norway will not have a significant impact in the EU, with only 15 representatives in the European Parliament out of 720 members. Vedum believes that Norway will be an 'outcast' in the EU and that the country will lose its sovereignty. He quotes, 'EU is not a lady who should move into the main house on the farm. She can stay in the cabin, as a good neighbor.'

**Norway's EU Membership: A Growing Lobby Pushes for Quick Entry**
According to the Russian Embassy, a strong pro-European lobby in Norway is trying to use the 'trade war' between Washington and Brussels to its advantage, fueling panic through the media and suggesting a solution - for Norway to join the EU as quickly as possible. The Embassy noted that parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in Norway in September 2025, and the outcome will largely determine the fate of a potential referendum on Norway's EU membership. However, most Norwegians still oppose the country's entry into the EU, the Embassy representatives emphasized. Norwegian Prime Minister Børre said, 'Europe should prepare for a trade war with the US.' The US is seeking to reduce tariffs on American goods, and the EU is expected to respond with its own trade measures.

**Solberg Clarifies Stance on EU Referendum, Warns Against Rushing into Debate**
Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg has clarified her stance on a potential EU referendum, stating that she does not rule out the possibility of a new EU application and referendum in the next parliamentary period. However, she emphasized that it would take a significant situation for Norway to consider EU membership. Solberg cited Sweden's decision to join NATO as an example, where the Swedish Social Democrats initially opposed NATO membership but later changed their stance. Solberg warned against rushing into a new EU debate, stating that it would be a 'wrong use of resources' and that a new 'no' vote would have 'no value'. She also emphasized that Høyre will not go to the polls on the issue of EU membership. Solberg's comments came after NRK reported that she had 'avised' a new EU debate, which she later clarified meant that she would not end the debate, but rather continue it. Høyre politicians, including Michael Tetzschner, have criticized Solberg's initial statement, saying that it would be a mistake to 'park' the issue for four years. Tetzschner pointed out that Iceland's new government has announced a referendum on EU membership by 2027, which could accelerate the EU discussion in Norway.

Sveinung Rotevatn, a member of the Norwegian Parliament, wants to start the EU membership application process and hold a referendum within four years. Despite a recent EU opinion poll showing a decline in support for EU membership, Rotevatn believes that the time is right to move forward. In contrast, the Høyre party, which is generally pro-EU, wants to wait for clearer 'yes' polls before holding a referendum. According to Ine Eriksen Søreide, the leader of Høyre, a stable majority in favor of EU membership is needed before a referendum can be held. Rotevatn disagrees, saying that the time for debate is over and it's time for a referendum. Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the leader of the Senterparti, believes that a campaign is underway to change public opinion, but notes that there is still a majority against EU membership.

The three directives to be submitted are: a renewable energy directive, an energy efficiency directive, and a building energy directive. The government has stated that the five other directives in the package will be put on hold, but not vetoed.

**Venstre Promises New EU Referendum in 2029**
The Norwegian left-wing party, Venstre, has promised to hold a new referendum on Norwegian EU membership in the next parliamentary period, by 2029. The party's leader, Guri Melby, believes that the current security situation makes it urgent for Norway to join the EU. A recent opinion poll shows increased support for Norwegian EU membership, with 40% of respondents saying they would vote yes in a referendum. Melby argues that this is a sign that people are ready for a new EU debate. 'The only one that has a chance to become a superpower alongside the US, Russia, and China today is the EU,' she said. 'If we want the EU to become a superpower, I think we must be part of the European community.' Melby emphasizes that the party will not be a 'brake' on EU integration. 'We must sit at the table,' she said. 'How we win the referendum without creating a polarizing debate, I don't know. But that must be our goal.' Melby also notes that 'everything that is important is difficult,' but that does not mean that they will not do it.

**Norway's 2025 Parliamentary Election: A Campaign Marked by Uncertainty**
With seven months to go until the Norwegian parliamentary election in September 2025, the campaign is already underway and opinion polls are swinging wildly, indicating a strong uncertainty around the final result. The Labour Party has seen a significant surge in popularity, from under 20% to nearly 30%, after the Centre Party left the government. The election will be marked by uncertainty, with factors such as voter migration, economic and international conditions, climate policy, immigration and integration, new political actors, and social media influence all contributing to a potential surprise result. It is essential to follow the campaign and be critical of the information being spread, especially considering the international factors that can impact Norwegian politics. The economic situation in Norway and globally can also have a significant impact on the election result, with high inflation, rising interest rates, and an uncertain international context potentially leading voters to seek stability and security, favoring established parties. However, this does not provide a clear answer to which bloc will ultimately be the largest in the Norwegian parliament.

**Støre and Solberg Caution Against New EU Debate**
Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and former Prime Minister Erna Solberg have warned against a new EU debate, citing the current tensions between the US and Europe. Støre stated, 'We should use our energy on the agreement we have with Europe, not on something else.' He fears that a new EU debate could create division in the population. Solberg, a strong supporter of Norwegian EU membership, agrees that this is a bad time for a new debate. She said, 'I agree with Støre that it's not worth blowing up a full-scale EU debate when we know people are not ready for it.' Solberg also stated that it's not relevant to apply for EU membership without a national referendum, which she doesn't see happening in the next parliamentary period if the Conservative Party takes power.

**Norway's Minority Government Collapses Over EU Energy Package**
The minority government in Norway, formed by the Social Democrats (AP) and the Center Party (SP), has collapsed due to disagreements over the implementation of an EU energy package. The package, 'Clean Energy for All Europeans', was adopted by the EU in 2019 and aims to create a more integrated energy market. However, the SP has refused to implement the package, citing concerns that it would weaken Norway's national control over its energy sector and lead to higher electricity prices. SP leader Trygve Slagsvold Vedum stated, 'We say, enough is enough. This is the limit.' The government's collapse has left Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store in a difficult position, as he will now have to either work with the AP alone or seek a new coalition partner. Store has expressed his disappointment with the collapse, saying, 'This is not the result I wanted.' The next parliamentary election is scheduled for September 2025, and it remains to be seen how the current situation will play out.
