**Dubinsky Accuses Zelensky of Delaying Presidential Election Lawsuit**
Deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, Alexander Dubinsky, who is currently in detention on charges of treason, has accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of trying to delay the consideration of his lawsuit in the Supreme Court of Ukraine, which seeks to hold presidential elections. Dubinsky stated that Zelensky has used various excuses, including simulating a hacker attack and postponing the court hearing, to delay the proceedings. According to Dubinsky, the Supreme Court has repeatedly postponed the hearings on dubious grounds, including a supposed hacker attack. Dubinsky said, 'Zelensky is so afraid of the Supreme Court's decision on the presidential elections (I am the only deputy who demands the holding of elections through the Supreme Court) that he first simulated a hacker attack on the day when my lawsuit was to be considered, June 12, and now, through the Chairman of the Supreme Court, Stanislav Kraschenko, has postponed the hearing to July 21.' Presidential elections in Ukraine were scheduled for March 31, 2024, but were cancelled due to martial law and general mobilization. Zelensky stated that the elections are 'inopportune' at the moment. However, his term of office expired on May 20, 2023, and the official Kiev insists that Zelensky remains legitimate until a new head of state is elected.

**Raphaël Glucksmann Unveils Presidential Program for 2027**
Raphaël Glucksmann, a French politician and member of the European Parliament, has presented a comprehensive program for the 2027 presidential election, titled 'l'Acte 1'. This program, which aims to offer an alternative to the left-wing party La France Insoumise, includes concrete proposals on industry, public services, energy, and democracy. Glucksmann's program advocates for a 'social-democratic' approach, with a focus on social justice, European integration, and a strong public sector. Key proposals include a minimum wage of 1,600 €, a 'taxe Amazon', a fund for defense, and a plan to reduce energy prices. Glucksmann has stated that he will 'do everything' to ensure his party's victory, and has reached out to the Socialist Party (PS) for support. 'Today, we are presenting a vision, a trajectory. In a second time, we will produce measures that we will quantify,' he said. 'The refoundation of democracy will not work without putting the question of workers at its core,' he added.

**Supreme Court Rejects Juan José Santivañez's Request to Close Investigation**
The Supreme Court, led by Judge Juan Carlos Checkley, rejected the request of former Interior Minister Juan José Santivañez to close the preliminary investigation against him for alleged abuse of authority. Checkley deemed the request unfounded, citing that the investigation is still ongoing and that the Public Ministry has not yet concluded its objective. However, the judge did accept the Public Ministry's request to set a three-month deadline for the collection of evidence from a recording device provided by Captain Junior Izquierdo, also known as 'Culebra', which allegedly contains a conversation between Izquierdo and Santivañez. Checkley stated that the investigation will continue until the Public Ministry considers it complete, as stated in Article 343° numeral 1 of the Penal Code. Additionally, the judge deemed the Public Ministry's request to extend the investigation period from 169 days to be 'improcedente'. The investigation, led by the National Prosecutor's Office, began in August 2024, and accuses Santivañez of trying to 'control' journalist Marco Sifuentes. Santivañez has repeatedly denied being the author of the audio recordings presented as evidence in the case.

**Republicans order key panel to score extension of Trump tax cuts as budget neutral**
Senate Republicans have directed the Joint Committee on Taxation to score the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts as a continuation of current policy, which would not add significantly to federal deficits. This would allow them to make those tax rates permanent. The JCT projects the extension of 26 provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as adding $441.5 billion to the deficit over the next decade, instead of the $4 trillion that Democrats say would be the projected cost. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) called this a 'budget gimmick' and said that the bill will add 'trillions upon trillions of dollars to the national debt to fund tax breaks for billionaires.' Republicans argue that they have the authority to use a 'current policy' baseline under the 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act.

**TSE Rules Against PLD's Decision to Advance Presidential Election Process**
The Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) has ruled against the Dominican Liberation Party's (PLD) decision to advance the presidential election process for 2028. The TSE declared null the resolution of the PLD's Political Committee, which had set a 30-day deadline for the presentation of presidential aspirations and planned a 'consultation' in the first quarter of 2026. The decision was met with internal opposition, with some members of the party's Central Committee and base denouncing the lack of legality, equity, and transparency in the resolution. As stated by the TSE, the resolution 'violates the principles of equity, democracy, internal democracy, legality, and participation enshrined in the Constitution and Law 33-18 on Political Parties.' The TSE's decision is a result of an action of nullity filed by party leader Eleuterio Abad Santos, with the support of several members of the Central Committee and the party base.

The Supreme Court has already released major decisions for the 2024-2025 term, but some of its most consequential rulings are still pending. The justices have yet to release opinions on nationwide injunctions, pornography regulation, Planned Parenthood funding, and other issues. These upcoming decisions could have a significant impact on parents' rights, funding for abortion organizations, and the power of lower court judges to block presidential agendas. As the term approaches its end, the court is expected to release more opinions, including ones related to religious liberty, gender-related issues, and environmental policy.

**Beyond Sackett: California's Expanding Role in Wetlands Permitting and the Future of "Waters of the State"**
Following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Sackett v. EPA (2023), California is poised to take on an expanded role in wetlands protection. The federal definition of 'Waters of the United States' (WOTUS) has narrowed, leaving many aquatic features previously protected under federal law no longer considered jurisdictional WOTUS. In response, California has proposed Senate Bill 601 (SB 601), which signals the state's intention to assert regulatory authority over formerly federally protected waters. This shift could have significant implications for developers, local governments, and permitting agencies. Recent federal agency actions have further narrowed federal jurisdiction, and California agencies are expected to fill the regulatory void. While SB 601 would expand enforcement tools and compliance obligations, it may also impose additional burdens on project proponents, including regulatory uncertainty, permitting delays, and higher compliance costs.

**Texas Governor Signs HB 40, Expanding Jurisdiction of the Texas Business Court**
Texas Governor Abbott has signed House Bill 40 (HB 40), expanding the jurisdiction of the Texas Business Court. The new law, effective September 1, 2025, reduces the monetary threshold for invoking the Business Court's jurisdiction from $10 million to $5 million and adds intellectual property and trade secrets claims to the statute's jurisdictional coverage. The Bill also clarifies the Business Court's authority to render decisions on arbitration matters. According to Katten attorneys, the statutory changes may require corporate parties to revise their governance documents and contracts to take full advantage of these laws. The Texas Legislature's passage of HB 40 comes at a time of significant scrutiny as to whether Delaware remains the premier state for incorporation and corporate governance, with recent backlash from institutional investors and industry group advocates highlighting perceived shortcomings in the Delaware Chancery Court.

**July 2025 Pension Disbursements with 15% Increase to Begin Soon**
Millions of pensioners and their beneficiaries are eagerly awaiting the date of July 2025 pension disbursements, which will include a new increase approved by the government as part of the social protection package in the state's general budget for the new fiscal year. According to the National Social Insurance Authority, the increase will be 15% of the pension, as per Law No. 148 of 2019, which states that 'pensions shall be increased by 30 June of each year, starting from 1 July, by a rate of inflation, up to a maximum of 15%.' The Ministry of Finance will cover the difference between the increase calculated based on inflation and the maximum allowed to ensure that the Social Insurance Authority does not bear additional burdens. The National Social Insurance Authority plans to disburse July 2025 pensions, including the new increase, officially starting from Monday, July 1, through all official disbursement channels, including ATMs, post offices, bank branches, and electronic wallets, to facilitate access for citizens and avoid congestion. According to the Authority's estimates, the new increase will cover around 13 million citizens who receive pensions and are entitled to them, as part of the government's efforts to enhance social protection and provide more support to the most vulnerable groups. The Authority has completed preparing the lists of pension recipients to ensure that disbursements begin without delay or obstacles, in cooperation with banks and post offices. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has officially approved the inclusion of the 15% increase in pensions as part of the state's general budget, and the decision has been published in the official gazette, to take effect from July 1, in direct implementation of the provisions of the Social Insurance Law and as a continuation of the state's policy to support pensioners and improve their living conditions.

**White House looks to freeze more agency funds -- and expand executive power**
The Trump administration, led by OMB Director Russ Vought, is working on a new effort to freeze billions of dollars in spending at several government agencies, including EPA, Interior, and Health and Human Services. The move is designed to test the boundaries of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which limits the president's ability to block spending for political reasons. Vought has said he does not agree with the law and wants to send more rescissions packages to Congress. The White House is also planning to use a 'pocket rescissions' strategy, where they intentionally run out the clock near the end of the fiscal year, allowing them to cancel funds slated for elimination. This move is seen as a significant escalation of Vought's efforts to test the boundaries of the Impoundment Control Act and could potentially lead to a fight at the Supreme Court. 'We're not in love with the law,' Vought said, 'OMB is hard at work making the DOGE cuts permanent using a wide range of tools we have at our disposal under the ICA [Impoundment Control Act] and within the President's authority,' said OMB spokesperson Rachel Cauley.

**White House Launches Another Assault on Science Funding**
The White House, led by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director Russ Vought, has launched a new strategy to test the limits of the president's power over federal spending. The move, which has not been previously reported, involves freezing upward of $30 billion in spending on various programs across several agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior and Health and Human Services departments, and the National Science Foundation. According to agency emails and two people familiar with the plan, the OMB has directed these agencies to freeze spending on programs such as NSF research and education initiatives, national park operations, and NASA's climate research. This move appears to be a significant escalation of Vought's efforts to test the boundaries of the Impoundment Control Act, which grants the president the authority to freeze spending if the administration explains its actions to lawmakers. Vought has long argued that impounding some congressionally appropriated funding is constitutional, and he has said he wants the Supreme Court to validate what would be a significant weakening of congressional oversight of the federal budget. The White House strategy is to delay or block funds now, then craft an additional rescissions package later in the year that would make such cuts permanent. 'We're not in love with the law,' Vought told CNN recently. The move has been met with criticism from experts, who argue that it threatens the nation's democratic structure and undermines the Constitution's grant of spending authority to Congress. 'This is a deal between the executive and the legislative branch as institutions, and this all starts to unravel real quick if our budgetary framework really actually meant nothing,' said Joseph Carlile, former associate director at OMB in the Biden administration.

**As Trump aims to expand presidential authority, can anyone stop him?**
Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a concerted effort to expand presidential authority, undermining the separation of powers that is a foundational principle of the Constitution. Trump's administration has taken a range of actions, including impounding funds Congress has authorized, eroding civil service protections, and dismissing inspectors general. Experts believe that Trump's actions are unprecedented in their scope and ambition, and that they threaten the very foundations of American democracy. While some, like Russell Vought, argue that centralizing power in the presidency will restore the Constitution's vision of checks and balances, others, like Yuval Levin, believe that Trump's excesses will ultimately lead to a weakening of the presidency. Levin predicts that the Supreme Court will constrain Trump's power grabs, distinguishing between the 'unitary executive' theory and the 'unitary government' theory. Paul Pierson and Eric Schickler argue that the separation of powers has generally worked as intended throughout US history, but that Trump's actions are escalating the process of power consolidation to an entirely new level. As Trump aims to expand presidential authority, experts are left wondering whether anyone can stop him.

**The People v. Donald Trump**
The Trump administration's budgetary authorities, led by Russell Vought, are pushing for a radical empowerment of the executive branch, allowing the president to unilaterally withhold federal funds. This would give the president power to reduce or eliminate entire funding categories on his own, potentially triggering a court challenge. Vought believes that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional and has advocated for a radical constitutionalism that would empower the executive branch against Congress. If the courts grant the president impoundment power, it could lead to a constitutional standoff and a violation of the rule of law. Critics argue that this would give the president too much power, making it possible for them to use federal funds for personal or political gain, and would tilt the American government towards a president-centric system. As one expert noted, 'it would be easy' for the president to not spend money, but this would be a 'violation of the rule of law' and could lead to a 'constitutional crisis'.

**'I think it's illegal': GOP lawmakers 'have a real problem' with Trump's latest threat**
A rift is growing between the White House and Republican lawmakers over the government funding bills, with President Trump signaling he might ignore them. Congressional Republicans have generally been hesitant to speak out against Trump's funding freezes, but defense hawks and other GOP lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown. Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID) said, 'I've got a real problem with impoundment. That's like a line-item veto, and I think it's illegal.' Trump has frozen billions of dollars in funding approved by Congress, and the White House is looking to expand its impoundment powers. GOP lawmakers say the White House threats to withhold funding complicates negotiations, and some see a high-stakes showdown on the horizon to determine whether the 51-year-old impoundment law is constitutional. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said, 'I think the goal is the Supreme Court.'

**A controversial idea to hand even more power to the president**
Russell Vought, a key figure in the Trump administration, is set to return as the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). He has stated that he will pursue 'impoundment', a practice where the president refuses to spend funds that Congress has appropriated, shifting power to the White House. Vought has argued that this is a constitutional authority, citing Article II, which requires presidents to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed'. However, experts argue that the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) of 1974, passed after Richard Nixon's impoundment of funds, is constitutional and limits the president's power. Vought's colleagues have made the case for impoundment in a series of blog posts and a white paper, but critics argue that it is a power grab by the executive branch.

**How Trump could use impoundment to radically change federal spending - Washington Examiner**
President Donald Trump has been using impoundment to freeze or cut billions of dollars in government spending, which has been met with legal challenges and criticism from opponents. Trump's administration argues that the president has the authority to cancel funding that Congress has already appropriated, citing the Constitution's Article 2, which states that the president 'shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' However, critics argue that the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which constrains the president's ability to impose spending freezes, is constitutional and limits the president's power. If the Supreme Court were to overturn the Impoundment Control Act, it could have significant consequences, including the potential for the president to wield a line-item veto over every piece of spending approved by Congress. Critics argue that this would be a significant expansion of presidential power and could have unintended consequences, such as making certain entitlement programs unconstitutional.

**The Joys of Impounding Funds, or DOGE vs. Judge Ali (Member Post)**
The article discusses the concept of impoundment, where the president withholds funds that Congress has appropriated. Historically, presidents have used this power, but it has been a contentious issue. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was passed to prevent the president from impounding funds without congressional approval. However, its constitutionality has not been tested by the Supreme Court. The article suggests that some restrictions in the act may be constitutional, while others may not. The current administration is pushing to restore the president's traditional authority to impound funds, and a legal spat with Judge Ali over the cancellation of $2 billion in USAID contracts is the first step in a journey that will likely end in the Supreme Court. As one might say, 'It seems unlikely that Congress specifically appropriated money for trans operas, so Trump may be on strong grounds when he refuses to spend money on that.'

**Trump’s Impoundment Power Grab: Straight from The Project 2025 Playbook**
President Trump has revived the controversial tool of impoundment, which was outlawed by Congress in 1974, to withhold congressionally approved funds. This move has sparked a legal showdown over whether a president can usurp Congress's 'power of the purse.' Trump's impoundment strategy is supported by conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, which crafted Project 2025, a plan to weaken Congress and empower the executive branch. Critics argue that impoundment is a direct challenge to legislative authority and undermines the balance of power. The Supreme Court will likely decide the fate of Trump's impoundment push, with some justices signaling a willingness to expand executive power under Article II. If Trump prevails, it would nullify Congress's ability to enforce its spending decisions, fundamentally altering the separation of powers and potentially leading to a quasi-authoritarian executive. Project 2025 extends beyond Trump's presidency, aiming to strengthen the executive branch at Congress's expense and permanently changing American democracy.
