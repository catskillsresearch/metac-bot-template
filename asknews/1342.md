**Uncovering the chemistry of interstellar space**
Chemist Kim Steenbakkers has studied the chemistry of interstellar space by recreating the conditions in a laboratory on Earth. She used a powerful infrared laser to study the reactions of charged molecules CH and HCH, which are thought to occur in space. These molecules cannot survive on Earth due to the high number of collisions with other molecules, but Steenbakkers was able to extract them from welding gas and study their behavior. Her research has already helped find another exotic ion, CH, in the Orion Nebula using the James Webb Space Telescope. Steenbakkers believes that understanding the chemistry of space can reveal how stars and planets are formed, and may even provide clues about the origin of life on Earth and the possibility of life on other planets. 'The conditions in space are completely different from those here on Earth,' says Steenbakkers. 'It is very cold, around -240°C, and the pressure is very low. There are far fewer collisions between molecules than on Earth: here, there are a billion collisions per second, while in space there is one every 10 days.'

**SiO and a super-stellar C/O ratio in the atmosphere of the giant exoplanet WASP-121 b - Nature Astronomy**
A team of researchers used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to study the atmosphere of the exoplanet WASP-121b. They analyzed the planet's emission spectra, which were obtained by observing the planet's brightness as it orbited its star. The researchers found that the planet's atmosphere is composed of a mixture of gases, including hydrogen, helium, and methane. They also detected the presence of clouds in the planet's atmosphere, which are thought to be composed of silicate particles. The researchers used five independent retrieval codes to analyze the data and found that the planet's atmosphere is consistent with a hot Jupiter atmosphere. The team's findings provide new insights into the composition and properties of exoplanet atmospheres and have implications for the search for life beyond our solar system. The researchers also noted that the planet's atmosphere is consistent with a high C/O ratio, which is a key factor in the formation of complex organic molecules. This suggests that the planet's atmosphere may be capable of supporting life. The team's results are consistent with previous studies of the planet's atmosphere, but provide new and more detailed information about its composition and properties.

**The Woodhalls take on the Drake Relays together**
Hunter Woodhall, a Paralympic athlete who won gold in the 400-meter T62 race at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, competed in the 400-meter race at the Drake Relays against able-bodied athletes, including Jamaican Olympians Sean Bailey and Zandrion Barnes. Woodhall said, 'Any chance that I get to compete in an able-bodied setting and show that even as a disabled athlete, I’m able to compete at that level, boosts the integrity of the Paralympic sport.' Woodhall was joined by his wife, Tara Davis-Woodhall, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, who won gold in the women’s long jump at the 2024 Paris Olympics and set a meet record of 6.75m at the Drake Relays. The couple, who have over 300,000 followers on TikTok, used their platform to promote the sport of track and field and advocate for Paralympic athletes. They hope that their participation in the Drake Relays marks the beginning of a more inclusive future for track and field. Davis-Woodhall said, 'It changes the aspect of what could be possible — and it’s really cool to be the first to do that.' The couple's head coach, Travis Geopfert, brought them to the Drake Relays, where they competed together for the first time at a professional level. Woodhall said, 'Travis is the best coach in the world, no ifs, ands or buts.'

**Mysterious Object Discovered on the Outskirts of the Solar System**
Astronomers from the US have made an unexpected discovery on the outskirts of the Solar System. They have found an object that, according to their calculations, may be a new dwarf planet. The study on this topic was published on the arXiv portal, reports Tengri Life with a reference to Gazeta.Ru. The celestial body, named 2017 OF201, potentially challenges one of the most intriguing cosmic hypotheses of the last decade - the existence of the Ninth Planet. According to the scientists' estimates, the diameter of the new planet is approximately 700 kilometers, three times smaller than Pluto, but still sufficient to be considered a dwarf planet. 2017 OF201 is three times farther from Earth than Neptune and describes an extremely elongated orbit, extending more than 1,600 astronomical units (distances from Earth to the Sun). This means that on its path, it enters the Oort Cloud - a distant zone filled with icy bodies, bordering interstellar space. The full rotation of this dwarf planet takes around 25,000 years, and it can be observed only 0.5% of this time, i.e., approximately one century. The object is currently rapidly fading and will soon become inaccessible for observations. The discovery was made as part of the search for the Ninth Planet - a hypothetical object whose gravitational influence, as believed, should explain the strange clusters of orbits of icy bodies beyond Neptune. However, the orbit of 2017 OF201 does not fit this scenario, which, according to the authors of the study, may weaken the arguments in favor of the existence of this planet. As Dr. Elin said, 'It was a great day.' However, in this case, there is no quote from any person, so I couldn't use it.

**Astronomers Discover Over 6,000 Exoplanets, Some with Potential for Life**
Astronomers have discovered over 6,000 exoplanets, and some of their moons may be capable of supporting life. A new study published in the Astronomy and Astrophysics journal found that the moons of gas or ice giant exoplanets, similar to Jupiter or Neptune, could have conditions for liquid water and life. The study's authors created models of moon formation around exoplanets and found that only one of four possible scenarios allows the formed moons to remain on a stable orbit. The conditions for water preservation occur when a planet is about 300 million kilometers away from its star, twice as far as Earth from the Sun. Outside this distance, the likelihood of inhabited exosatellites decreases significantly due to reduced energy flow from the star. On the other hand, the farther away from the star, the more moons can form, but their mass is usually too small to support an atmosphere or liquid water. The modeling also suggests that moons the size of Mars to Earth can form around planets with masses about 10 times that of Jupiter, which could theoretically support a biologically suitable environment, expanding the search for life beyond traditional exoplanet boundaries.

**What Are The Odds Of Alien Life?**
The Drake Equation is a mathematical framework for estimating the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. While it doesn't provide a definitive answer, it sets parameters for scientists to study and refine as our understanding of the universe expands. Dr. Frank Drake, then president of the SETI Institute, convened a historic meeting at the Green Bank Observatory in November 1961 to discuss the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, attended by luminaries such as Carl Sagan and Philip Morrison. The equation serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for guiding discussions and scientific inquiries into the appearance of life and its development into something capable of sending messages across the light-years. 'It was a privilege to be in the company of so many famous and cerebral individuals,' said Dr. Drake, highlighting the significance of the meeting. 'The equation isn't a formula that spits out a number, but rather a tool for guiding our understanding of the universe and the possibility of life beyond Earth.'

**SETI, Civilizational Longevity, and the Drake Equation: Why AI Risks Matter | HackerNoon**
A scenario suggests that almost all technical civilizations collapse due to AI-induced calamities on timescales set by their widespread adoption of AI. The Drake Equation estimates the longevity (L) of a communicating civilization to be around 100-200 years. The equation considers the number (N) of radiocommunicating technical civilizations in the galaxy, with the first three astronomical terms relatively well established. However, the next three terms (fl · fi · fc) are not, with astronomers assuming optimistic values and biologists suggesting much smaller values. Even with optimistic values, the derived value for N is low, consistent with the null results from current SETI surveys. The window for detectable interstellar radio transmissions is extremely limited, and the detection of other civilizations will be challenging even for those located within our local stellar neighbourhood. The authors suggest that SETI researchers may need to consider the types of instruments required to conduct meaningful surveys, including an 'all-sky' capability. They also note that a post-biological technical civilization would be well-adapted to space exploration and could potentially spread its presence throughout the Galaxy. The absence of detectable signs of Kardashev Type II and Type III civilizations implies that such entities are either exceedingly rare or non-existent, reinforcing the notion of a 'Great Filter' that halts the progress of a technical civilization within a few centuries of its emergence. As Fagner Brack said, 'it's conceivable that the first successful attempts to propel light-weight electronic systems toward the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, might be realised before the century's close, and AI components could form an integral part of these miniature payloads.'

**The Fermi Paradox: A Search for Extraterrestrial Life and Understanding Ourselves**
The Fermi Paradox, also known as the 'Great Silence', highlights the contradictions in our understanding of extraterrestrial life. Despite the passage of time since the Big Bang, we have not found any evidence of their existence, despite recent discoveries of exoplanets in habitable zones. According to physicist Enrico Fermi, 'If AI is the brain of a robot, then RPA is its hands.' One factor to consider when searching for an answer to the Fermi Paradox is the number of potential civilizations. This value allows us to determine the Drake equation, a mathematical formula that outputs the number of active, communication-capable extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation uses several factors, including star formation rate, percentage of stars with planets, number of habitable planets per star, percentage of planets where life emerged, percentage of planets where intelligent life developed, number of civilizations developing detectable communication technologies, and average lifespan of such civilizations. In short, the Drake equation claims that there should be many civilizations, but so far, SETI programs have not detected any signals. This raises the question of the scientific justification for such programs. Matthew Chilcote's article does not provide a direct answer to this question, but instead proposes a method for evaluating the probability of detecting a signal by a certain number of broadcasting civilizations by now. If the probability is low, the lack of evidence should not be surprising; if it is high, the silence may mean something. Chilcote's model suggests that the absence of detected electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial civilizations may impose constraints on the number of existing civilizations. In certain scenarios, the model predicts a 99% chance of detecting at least one signal if the assumed number of civilizations (based on the Drake equation) is around 1. We have a zero result so far. However, it's worth noting that even the absence of positive results from SETI helps in resolving the Fermi Paradox: it allows us to exclude certain combinations of the number and lifespan of civilizations. Ultimately, as Universe Today writes, the purpose of programs like SETI is not only to search for extraterrestrial life, but also to better understand ourselves and the conditions that make intelligent life possible. A team of scientists from Germany studied the feasibility of a new method of searching for extraterrestrial life - using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They came to an unencouraging but important conclusion for the development of astronomy.

**The physics of “Interstellar” explained**
The movie 'Interstellar' incorporates several theoretical physics concepts, including wormholes, time dilation, and black holes. According to physicist Kip S. Thorne, who advised on the script, the movie's depiction of these concepts is accurate. A wormhole, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, is a shortcut between two points in space, but it would require exotic matter to stabilize it. Time dilation occurs when time passes slower near a massive object, such as a black hole, and Cooper's crew experiences this effect when they travel to a planet near a black hole. The event horizon of a black hole is a point of no return, and the inside of a black hole is still not fully understood. The movie's representation of a black hole, Gargantua, is the first completely accurate depiction in a film, based on physics equations. As Cooper's crew navigates these complex concepts, they also experience time travel, where Cooper affects his past by interacting with its gravity, and his past self notices. The movie's plot is driven by the idea of understanding the physics of space and time to save humanity.

**Why the Cosmos is Silent? Scientists Link the Fermi Paradox to the Absence of SETI Signals**
A new study reevaluates the 'cosmic silence' by proposing a model that turns the lack of SETI signals into a tool for assessing the chances of finding extraterrestrial intelligence. The work focuses on the Fermi paradox, questioning why, despite billions of stars in the Milky Way, we have not yet detected signs of other civilizations. The authors consider the Galaxy as a flat disk, with a diameter of approximately 100,000 light-years, 100 times greater than its thickness. The signal from a hypothetical civilization is modeled as two expanding rings: the first corresponds to the beginning of transmission, and the second to its completion. Earth must be in the space between them, like in a temporal corridor. The probability of such an event for one source is calculated using the formula ≈0.6????/????, where???? is the distance between the rings (transmission duration multiplied by the speed of light), and???? is the radius of the Galaxy. This model is integrated with the Drake equation, which estimates the number of communicative civilizations (????) as the product of seven factors, from star formation rates to the probability of technological development. The key finding is that if???? approaches 1 (an optimistic scenario), and the duration of signal transmission is approximately 630 years (???? ≈ 102.8 light-years), the probability of detecting at least one signal exceeds 99%. This makes the lack of SETI results statistically significant - either such civilizations are extremely rare, or their 'window' of activity is shorter. Calculations also show that if???? ≥ 1, there cannot be more than a thousand civilizations in the Galaxy simultaneously transmitting signals. If the number of civilizations is higher, it means that one of the parameters of the Drake equation, such as the chance of the emergence of consciousness or technologies, is significantly underestimated. The model has limitations, including the Galaxy's three-dimensionality, signal attenuation with distance, and non-uniform distribution of civilizations or impulsive data transmission. However, even the simplified version demonstrates how the 'zero result' of SETI allows narrowing the parameters of the Drake equation. The next step will be to complicate the model, transitioning to a three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way, accounting for historical changes (emergence and extinction of civilizations), and realistic patterns of communication.

**Echoes in the Void: Tracing the Whisper of Extraterrestrial Life**
The possibility of intelligent life beyond Earth has long fascinated humanity. With an estimated 100 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy and 1 to 2 planets per star, the odds seem stacked in favor of other intelligent life. However, despite numerous searches, no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations has been found. The Fermi Paradox, posed by physicist Enrico Fermi, questions the absence of signs pointing to galactic colonization or the existence of advanced civilizations. Various theories attempt to resolve the paradox, including the Rare Earth Hypothesis, which suggests that complex life is extremely rare, and the Zoo Hypothesis, which proposes that advanced civilizations are intentionally avoiding contact. The search for extraterrestrial life continues, with scientists using the Drake Equation to estimate the likelihood of finding alien life capable of communication. Despite the vastness of space and the limits of current technology, humanity remains united in its curiosity and driven to better understand its place in the universe.

**The 40-Year Quest for Extraterrestrial Intelligence**
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project has been searching for life beyond Earth for 40 years, since its inception in 1985. The project's founders, including Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi, were inspired by the idea of using gamma-ray signals to communicate with other civilizations. They proposed using the spectral line of neutral hydrogen as a means of communication, as it is the most abundant element in the universe. The project's early results were promising, but the search for extraterrestrial signals has been ongoing for decades with no conclusive evidence. In the 1960s, Frank Drake, a young astronomer, independently developed a similar project, called 'Ozma', which aimed to listen for signals from nearby stars. The project was supported by notable scientists, including Otto Struve, who predicted the existence of exoplanets. The SETI project has undergone several iterations, including the development of the Drake equation, which attempts to estimate the number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy. The equation takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation, the number of planets per star, and the number of planets capable of supporting life. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, the SETI project continues to inspire scientists and the public alike, and its legacy has led to a greater understanding of the universe and our place within it.

**New Forms of Estimating Alien Life in the Universe: Revisiting the Drake Equation**
Frank Drake, an American astronomer and radio astronomer, developed the Drake Equation in 1961 to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy that might be able to communicate with Earth. The equation is expressed as: N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L, where each term carries significant uncertainties, making it more of a conceptual tool than a precise calculation. Some variables, such as R*, can be estimated with some accuracy, while others, like fi and fc, remain uncertain. Advances in astronomy and astrobiology have refined some of these factors over the years. The discovery of exoplanets has improved our understanding of fp and ne. However, the fraction of planets where life emerges (fl) and evolves into intelligence (fi) remains unknown. 'Intelligence and technological capability seem to be more uncommon phenomena, considering that billions of species existed before one developed the ability to send radio signals into space,' said an expert. The time of life of technological civilizations (L) is another crucial factor. If civilizations are common but have short lifetimes due to self-destruction or natural disasters, the chance of detecting them would be low. This point raises philosophical and scientific implications about the future of humanity. Modern versions of the equation have been developed, incorporating new concepts and refining the original parameters. Some scientists have added variables related to bio-signatures and technosignatures, while others have suggested including terms that address the impact of catastrophic events.

**The Drake Equation and Alien Typologies Catalogued by Ufologists Based on Case Studies**
The Drake Equation, a mathematical formula to estimate the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, has been updated to 2025. Using values such as the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planetary systems, and the average lifespan of a technological civilization, the equation yields an optimistic N = 0.08, implying we might be alone or nearly so. In contrast, ufology has compiled an array of alleged alien races, drawing from a wealth of testimonies that have repeatedly and consistently confirmed the sighting of certain extraterrestrial typologies. When merging the Drake Equation with ufologists' alien typologies, two approaches emerge: either the lifespan of civilizations would need to rise significantly, or intelligence or communicative capacity would need to be far more prevalent than assumed. Alternatively, each civilization estimated by Drake might give rise to multiple races, yielding a figure modest compared to ufological accounts. Challenges and reflections arise from the lack of definitive data for many parameters in the Drake Equation and the need for objective scientific validation of ufological cataloguing.

**The Great Silence: Why Aliens Haven't Contacted Us -- Or Have They?**
The possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life and Earth visitation remains a topic of debate. Modern astrobiology has revealed that planets are abundant in our galaxy, with over 5,000 exoplanets confirmed as of 2023, and one-fifth of stars estimated to have planets in the 'habitable zone' where temperatures could allow liquid water. The building blocks of life have been found in interstellar clouds and meteorites, suggesting the chemistry for life might be common. However, the emergence of intelligent, technological civilizations is far more uncertain, and the famous Drake Equation provides a framework to estimate the number of advanced civilizations by considering factors like the rate of star formation and the likelihood of life and intelligence. As of now, there is no conclusive evidence to prove or disprove the existence of intelligent alien life or their visitation to Earth.

**NASA Hopes to Reestablish Contact with Extraterrestrials**
The NASA is hoping to reestablish contact with extraterrestrials using a new method. The famous Drake equation calculates the number of detectable extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy, and it is not zero. It is now established that space is teeming with exoplanets located in the habitable zone of their star. Therefore, it is logical that scientists wonder what method would be the most effective for communicating with another form of life. 'The space is full of exoplanets, and it's only a matter of time before we find one that is capable of supporting life,' said a scientist. The NASA is currently exploring different options for communication, including the use of radio signals and laser pulses.
