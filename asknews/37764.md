**California Surpasses Japan to Become Fourth-Largest Economy**
California has surpassed Japan to become the fourth-largest economy in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state's GDP reached $4.1 trillion in 2024, accounting for 14% of the US economy. California's economy is driven by several key sectors, including technology, trade, real estate and finance, industry, tourism, arts and entertainment, and agriculture. The state's tech industry is a major driver of growth, with a $1 trillion impact on the economy. California's ports are a vital hub for international trade, with a $675 billion trade volume in 2024. The state's real estate and finance sector contributed $491 billion to the economy in 2024. California's industry sector is the largest in the US, with 24,304 companies and 1.5 million employees. The state's tourism sector generated $157 billion in revenue in 2024, with a 3% increase from the previous year. California's arts and entertainment sector contributed $64 billion to the economy in 2024. The state's agriculture sector is a significant contributor to the economy, with a $59 billion revenue in 2024. The idea of California independence, known as 'Calexit', has gained traction in recent years, driven by a sense of disconnection between the state and the federal government. However, the reality of implementing such a plan is complex and faces significant legal and practical challenges. The state's economy is heavily reliant on the federal government, and any attempt to secede would require a constitutional amendment, which is highly unlikely. Furthermore, the state would need to establish new institutions, including a military, healthcare system, and social security, which would be a significant undertaking. In conclusion, while the idea of California independence is an interesting concept, it remains a symbolic goal rather than a feasible plan.

**Protests in Los Angeles Have Significant Impact on California's Economy**
The recent protests in Los Angeles have had a significant impact on the economy of California and the United States as a whole. The state's economy is a crucial part of the US economy, with a GDP of $3.9 trillion in 2023, accounting for 14% of the country's total GDP. California is home to many major industries, including the tech industry, which is worth over $7 trillion, and the entertainment industry, which generates over $100 billion annually. The protests have led to a significant decline in economic activity, with estimated losses of over $800 million in the first week alone. The port of Los Angeles, which is the busiest port in the US, has been severely affected, with 85 ships delayed and an estimated daily loss of $32 million. The tourism industry has also been impacted, with a 30% decline in fuel sales and a 45% increase in shipping costs. The state's unemployment rate remains high, at 5.3%, and the slow growth of the workforce is a major concern. The state's economy is facing significant challenges, including a housing crisis, a decline in the tech industry, and a decrease in the number of jobs available. The impact of the protests on the economy is expected to be long-lasting, and the state's economy is likely to continue to face challenges in the coming months.

**World Bank cuts 2025 global growth forecast to 2.3% amid trade tensions**
The World Bank has cut its 2025 global growth forecast to 2.3% due to trade tensions, citing that without a swift course correction, the harm to living standards could be deep. The bank expects global GDP growth to average 2.5% in the 2020s, the slowest rate in any decade since the 1960s. The US economy is expected to grow by 1.4% this year, a sharp slowdown from a 2.8% expansion in 2024. The World Bank warns that if US tariffs on imports rose another 10 percentage points, it could cut world growth by 0.5 percentage points this year. Commodity prices are expected to remain suppressed in 2025 and 2026, affecting 60% of emerging markets and developing economies. By 2027, the per capita GDP of high-income economies will be approximately where it was in pre-pandemic forecasts, while corresponding levels for developing economies would be 6% lower. World Bank official Gill urged policymakers to contain inflation risks and reduce the differential in tariff and non-tariff measures with respect to the US.

**World Bank Increases Argentina's GDP Growth Forecast to 5.5% in 2025**
The World Bank has revised its economic growth forecast for Argentina, predicting a 5.5% increase in GDP in 2025, 0.5 percentage points higher than its previous forecast in January. The organization attributes this improvement to unexpected growth in the agricultural, energy, and mining sectors, as well as 'macroeconomic stabilization, the elimination of exchange controls, and new business-friendly reforms that should boost consumer and investor confidence.' The World Bank also notes that the agreement with the IMF was part of the analysis, stating, 'As part of the stabilization process, it is expected that deflation will generate an increase in real household incomes, further driving the recovery. It is expected that the government will continue to maintain fiscal surpluses in line with the new economic policy program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).' The World Bank projects global growth to reach 2.3% in 2025, 0.5 percentage points lower than its previous forecast, with 2.4% and 2.6% growth projected for 2026 and 2027, respectively.

**World Bank Confirms Russia's GDP Growth Predictions for 2025 and 2026**
The World Bank has confirmed its previous predictions of Russia's GDP growth for 2025 and 2026. According to the June report 'Global Economic Prospects', the bank expects Russia's GDP to grow by 1.4% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. The World Bank also predicts a 1.2% growth in 2027. In 2024, Russia's GDP growth accelerated to 4.3%, up from 4.1% in the previous year. The World Bank notes that the slowdown in growth this year is mainly due to a decrease in private consumption and government spending, as well as a decline in corporate lending with government support. Experts at the World Bank also predict that a decrease in global energy prices will limit the growth of Russia's economy and budget revenues. They expect a slowdown in Russian exports and a decrease in imports due to a decline in consumer demand and tightened payment sanctions. The World Bank also notes that a labor shortage, exacerbated by negative demographic trends, as well as limited access to markets and technologies, will continue to limit Russia's long-term growth potential.

**California jumps to world's No. 4 economy. Can that last?**
California has taken the world's fourth-largest economy spot, producing $4.1 trillion worth of goods and services in 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. However, its ranking is uncertain due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, which makes domestic output pricier to global trading partners, and the rise of India's economy, which is projected to grow 6.2% in 2025. Additionally, California's economic growth cooled to a 4% annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2024, trailing the 4.8% U.S. pace, and the nation's growth shrank only 9%. The state's information industries faced steep challenges, and its GDP growth cooled by 33% when comparing all of 2024 to its finish.

**California's economy becomes the fourth largest in the world**
California's economy has surpassed Japan's to become the fourth largest in the world, with a nominal GDP of $4.10 trillion in 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state's robust economic sectors and productivity have fueled its growth. California's GDP grew at 6% in 2024, outpacing the US economy at 5.3%, China at 2.6%, and Germany at 2.9%. Despite an affordable housing crisis, California's population is still growing due to immigration and natural birth rates. The state remains a leader in industries like tech and agriculture, with 20% of Californians employed in the tech sector and $24.3 billion worth of food commodities shipped in 2023. California also contributes $83 billion more in federal taxes than it receives in federal support. Governor Gavin Newsom has called for an end to the Trump administration's tariff policies, which he says hurt the country's overall economy. 'California isn't just keeping pace with the world -- we're setting the pace,' Newsom said. 'Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation.'

**California Just Became The World's Fourth-Largest Economy In 2024**
California has surpassed Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy, according to a statement by Governor Gavin Newsom. The state's GDP was valued at $4.1 trillion in 2024, while Japan's GDP was $4.03 trillion. Newsom attributed the state's economic growth to its strong agriculture, high-tech, and manufacturing sectors. However, University of Southern California professor Michael Mische noted that California's ranking is due to the poorly performing economies of Japan and Germany. Mische stated that California's economy grew by 13.3 percent from 2019 to 2024, while Japan's economy saw only a 0.9 percent increase and Germany's was only 0.3 percent. Marshall Toplansky, an associate professor at Chapman University, warned that tariffs could slow California's economy, citing the potential impact on trade and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Newsom has filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's tariffs, claiming they will hurt states, consumers, and businesses. As Newsom said, 'California isn't just keeping pace with the world -- we're setting the pace.'

**California Surpasses Japan as World's Fourth-Largest Economy**
California has surpassed Japan as the world's fourth-largest economy, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state's GDP reached $4.1 trillion in 2023, placing it behind only the US ($29.2 trillion), China ($18.7 trillion), and Germany ($4.6 trillion). This impressive growth has been driven by the tech sector, but also by key industries such as tourism, agriculture, and entertainment. California's economy is expected to grow 6% in 2024, outpacing the 5.3% growth projected for the US, and far exceeding China and Germany's growth rates of 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively. However, the state's economy could be threatened by international trade tensions, particularly with China, one of its main trading partners, and by the protectionist policies of the Trump administration. Governor Gavin Newsom has vowed to fight against these policies, saying 'California not only keeps pace with the world; we set the pace.'

California's economy has surpassed Japan's to become the world's fourth-largest economy, with a nominal GDP of $4.1 trillion in 2024.

**UCLA Anderson Forecast: Increased Uncertainties Persist as New Administration Enacts Economic Agenda**
The UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts that the US economy will face increased uncertainties due to the new administration's economic policies, including mass deportations and tariffs. The forecast expects GDP growth to decline by about one percentage point in late 2025, with unemployment rising to 4.5% by the first quarter of 2026. Inflation will remain elevated, hovering at about 3.0% throughout 2025 and 2026. The forecast also notes that deportations will suppress job growth in California, particularly in the construction industry, and will lead to a decline in the non-immigrant workforce. The California economy is forecasted to grow at about the same rate as the US in 2025 and 2026, and slightly faster in 2027. However, the private sector's prospects for building out of the housing affordability problem over the next three years are nil, with permitted new units expected to number 102,000 in 2025 and grow to 127,000 by the end of 2027.
