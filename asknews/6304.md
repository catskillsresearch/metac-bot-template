**US STOCKS-Wall Street set for lower open after Trump's steel tariff threat | Headlines**
Wall Street's main indexes are expected to open lower on Monday after President Donald Trump announced plans to double tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to 50% from 25%, starting Wednesday. This move has fueled uncertainty around U.S. trade policies. Shares of U.S. steel companies rose in premarket trading, but shares of automakers fell. Peter Andersen, founder at Andersen Capital Management, said, 'People have been thinking about that (steel tariffs) and trying to formulate the economic impact. It presents the markets with a lot of uncertainty right now.' The increased levies risk deepening Trump's global trade war and dousing enthusiasm in markets. A temporary relief on some levies on China and a rollback of steep tariff threats on the European Union helped the benchmark S&P 500 log its best monthly performance in 18 months in May. However, Kyiv's strike on Moscow's nuclear-capable bombers on Sunday has renewed concerns around further escalation of the war. Most megacap and growth stocks were down, with Alphabet leading losses, down 2.2%. Tesla lost over 1% after it reported lower monthly sales for Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden. The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will present opening remarks before the Federal Reserve Board International Finance Division's 75th anniversary conference later in the day, which may provide insight into interest rate cuts. On the data front, a reading of S&P Global U.S. manufacturing PMI is due at 9:45 a.m. ET and ISM's manufacturing activity index is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. ET. Investors are also looking ahead to a crucial nonfarm-payrolls report on Friday to gauge the U.S. labor market's strength amid tariff volatility.

**Potential US semiconductor manufacturing boom complicated by economic policies**
The US semiconductor industry is experiencing a potential boom, with companies like Intel, AMD, Bosch, Samsung, and Micron investing in the Greater Sacramento region. However, President Trump's economic policies, including new tariffs and investigations into imports, have complicated this growth. The administration's goal of ensuring the US maintains a competitive edge in artificial intelligence development may be slowed. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, the US share of global chip production fell from 37% in 1990 to 10% in 2022. Barry Broome, president of the Greater Sacramento Economic Council, said weaknesses in the semiconductor supply chain became evident during the pandemic, and the industry is now driven to the Sacramento area due to federal subsidies and the region's wealth of tech knowledge. Bosch announced a $1.9 billion investment in the Greater Sacramento area in 2023 to manufacture chips for electric vehicles, creating up to 1,700 jobs. Tech workers who started out at companies like Intel have spun out companies of their own, including Sacramento-area AI startup Blaize and data storage manufacturer Solidigm. Lane Bess, board chair of Blaize, said the area is primed to be a main corridor for the semiconductor industry due to the talent and interest from defense and border security companies. Alvin Nguyen, senior analyst at Forrester, said the fluidity of the administration's tariffs will cause confusion about the impact on the supply chain. Broome hopes that the tariffs will be used for leverage to get better agreements in the next two or three months, and that the uncertainty over trade policy will conclude quickly.
