**Agriculture and Irrigation Committee Urges Speedy Completion of Nile River Lining Project**
The Agriculture and Irrigation Committee in the Senate emphasized the importance of lining the Nile River in the Draw area in Aswan Governorate as part of the national efforts to rationalize water consumption and protect agricultural land. The committee stressed that the project is one of the most important steps towards achieving food and water security, and implementing the directives of the political leadership in the field of lining canals and the Nile River. The committee chairman, Engineer Abdel Salam Al-Jbli, pointed out that the Nile River lining project helps to deliver water to the ends of the canals, which has contributed to preventing the agricultural land flooding that was previously suffering from drought. He also noted that expanding the lining works, especially in Upper Egypt governorates like Aswan, enhances agricultural production and preserves every drop of water in the face of climate change and water scarcity challenges. Member of Parliament Khaled Al-Una called for the speedy completion of the Nile River lining project in the Draw area, explaining that the project is not limited to technical aspects, but is a crucial factor in protecting the Nile River from erosion and degradation, in addition to its role in reducing aquatic plant growth, improving water distribution efficiency, and developing Nile River banks in these vital areas. Engineer Majdi Fawzi, head of the Central Administration for Nile Protection in the Eastern Region, stated that the absence of lining leads to water stagnation and increased evaporation rates, threatening the loss of large quantities of Nile water. He added that the Nile River lining project in Aswan has been included in the 2024/2025 investment plan, with the issuance of an official operational order and the start of field implementation, in coordination with the Nile Research Institute. The committee concluded its meeting by recommending the preparation of a comprehensive report on the subject and submitting it to the Senate for follow-up on the progress of work and ensuring implementation according to the timeline.

**Nigeria conducts first agricultural research evaluation in 40 years - Punch Newspapers**
Nigeria has conducted its first agricultural research evaluation in 40 years, marking a major step towards revitalizing research institutes and colleges of agriculture nationwide. The Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Security, Aliyu Abdullahi, disclosed that the last time a system-wide assessment was conducted was in the 1980s as a prelude to President Shehu Shagari's Green Revolution. The evaluation, spearheaded by the National Agricultural Development Framework (NADF), covered 16 agricultural research institutes and 17 colleges of agriculture, highlighting the urgent need for increased funding and infrastructure upgrades. According to the Executive Secretary of NADF, Mohammed Ibrahim, the condition of the research institutes is 'very, very deplorable' due to years of neglect. However, he expressed optimism about the renewed government commitment, stating, 'We are now here, thanks to the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. We want to have a very tailored approach.' The findings of the needs assessment emphasized the importance of investing in research, innovation, and development to achieve food security, agro-industrialization, and poverty alleviation. As part of the reform process, NADF has entered into partnerships to enhance research facilities, including a partnership with a renewable power company to provide constant power to the institutes. 'Agricultural research is the engine of growth of the agricultural sector,' Abdullahi stated. 'The ability of our research institutes to generate and transfer innovative technologies for use by stakeholders across the agricultural value chain is critical to achieving food security, agro-industrialization, and poverty alleviation,' said Lateef Sanni, Executive Director of the Nigerian Stored Products Research Institute and Chairman of the Committee of Directors of Research Institutes.
