**Catalonia Ranks High in Bureaucratic Delays and Tax Administration**
According to the 'Encuestas Empresariales' (Business Surveys) conducted by the World Bank, Catalonia is the autonomous community where it takes the longest to obtain a business license (an average of 93 days, compared to the national average of 65.8 days) and to receive payment for a public contract (80.1 days, compared to a national average of 63.7 days). Additionally, it is one of the regions where business owners dedicate the most hours to fulfilling tax declarations and payments (a median of 180 hours, compared to 150 hours for the entire country). The 'time tax' is lower in Catalonia, with business owners dedicating 9.5% of their time to bureaucracy, compared to 10.5% nationally. However, this is offset by factors such as a shorter time to obtain construction permits (a median of 50.3 days, compared to 84 days nationally) and a lower percentage of businesses that identify licensing and permits as a serious or very serious restriction. Business owners in Catalonia also experience longer wait times for customs clearance (10.9 days, compared to a national average of 6.1 days), ranking second only to the Comunidad Valenciana and the Balearic Islands. The average time for exporting goods is in line with the national average of 4.5 days, but lags behind the 7.8 days in Valencia and the Balearic Islands. The main obstacles for businesses in Catalonia are similar to those at the national level, with 35% of businesses citing inadequate workforce training, 18% citing labor regulations, and 15.9% citing tax administration. Only 2.9% of businesses cite electricity as an obstacle. The World Bank's 'Encuestas Empresariales' survey, which covers 103 countries and 250,000 interviews, was presented in Spain on May 26, 2024. The survey found that the main obstacles for businesses in Spain are inadequate workforce training (35%), labor regulations (18%), and tax administration (15.9%). In Catalonia, 37.2% of businesses cited inadequate workforce training as the main obstacle, and 19.3% cited tax administration. However, no Catalan businesses cited taxes as the main obstacle, despite the lower tax burden in the region.

**Spanish Women's National Team to Play in Catalonia for First Time in 28 Years**
The Spanish women's national football team will play a match in Catalonia for the first time in 28 years. The RCDE Stadium, with a capacity of 40,000 spectators, will host the match between Spain and England in the Women's Nations League. This comes after almost 30 years since the last time the Spanish women's team played in Catalonia, specifically in a World Cup qualifying match against Ukraine in 1997. Spain aims to win against England to secure their spot in the final phase of the Nations League.

**Catalan Government and ERC Reaffirm Commitment to Unique Financing System**
The Catalan government, led by Salvador Illa, and the Esquerra Republicana (ERC) party have reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement on financing for Catalonia. The agreement, which was reached as part of the investiture process, includes the creation of a unique financing system for Catalonia, which would allow the region to collect and manage its own taxes, including the IRPF. The proposal is expected to be presented to the Spanish government by the end of June, and would be implemented by 2026. ERC has stated that they will support the three supplementary budgets, worth almost 4 billion euros, as long as the main elements of the agreement are progressing as planned. The Catalan government has also announced plans to recaudate the IRPF and to prepare the Agencia Tributaria de Cataluña (ATC) for its future functions. However, the opposition in Spain, led by the Partido Popular (PP), has expressed concerns about the proposal, arguing that it would create a privileged system for Catalonia. The PP has called for a debate on the proposal in the Conference of Presidents, which will take place on Friday. 'The Govern is fulfilling its commitments', said Alícia Romero, the Catalan economy minister. However, it is unclear whether the proposal will be fully implemented, as it still needs to be ratified by a bilateral commission and a mixed commission of economic and fiscal affairs. 'We are not sure if we will be able to fulfill the agreement', said Isaac Albert, ERC's vice-secretary of communication. 'But we are working on it, and we are making progress'. 'The proposal is not just a technical document, but a political and technical framework that will serve as a basis for the debate', said Martí Carnicer, the head of the commission of experts working on the proposal. 'We need to reform the LOFCA, and we need to update the system of financing for the autonomous communities', he added.

**Spanish Government's Shift on Catalan Language Recognition in EU**
In 2018 and 2022, the Spanish government, led by Pedro Sánchez, rejected the idea of making Catalan, Galician, and Basque official languages of the European Union, citing the high cost and the fact that the EU treaties 'do not permit' it. However, in 2023, Sánchez changed his position to maintain the support of the Catalan nationalist party Junts, and now considers it a 'compromiso irrenunciable' (an unrenounceable commitment). The Spanish government has presented this issue as a domestic problem to the EU, potentially leading to the recognition of up to 75 languages in the EU. Sánchez's government has argued that the EU treaties must be modified to include these languages, which would require a conference of EU member states and ratification by all. However, the EU Commission has pointed out that there is no legal basis for expanding the language regime, and that any changes would require a treaty amendment. The Spanish government's position has been criticized for being inconsistent and for ignoring the reality of the EU's language policies.

**Catalan Government Works to Ensure Continuation of F1 in Montmeló**
The Catalan government, led by President Salvador Illa, is working to ensure the continuation of the Formula 1 (F1) racing event in Montmeló. Illa stated, 'We are working well, although discreetly, on the renewal of the F1 in Montmeló.' The current contract for the event runs until 2026, but from 2026 to 2035, the GP will be held in Madrid. Illa emphasized the importance of keeping the F1 event in Catalonia, saying, 'We are valuing different aspects to ensure that there is F1, and I am betting that Catalonia will be included in the name of the Grand Prix.' He also expressed his confidence in the organization of the event, stating, 'I have magnificent vibrations about the organization of the Grand Prix of Spain. It is functioning very well.' The event, according to Illa, 'allows us to show the best of Catalonia and leaves prosperity and wealth.'

**June: A Decisive Month for Spanish and Catalan Politics**
June is a crucial month for politics in Spain and Catalonia. The Constitutional Court will decide on a lawsuit against the Amnesty Law, while the Catalan government must take a decision on the future of El Prat airport and the financing of Catalonia. The Spanish government, led by Pedro Sánchez, must also decide on the recognition of co-official languages in Spain and the new financing system for Catalonia. The month will be marked by several key events, including the Conferencia de Presidentes on June 6, the PP's protest in Madrid on June 8, and the NATO summit in the Netherlands from June 24 to 25. As Salvador Illa said, 'The agreement will arrive just in time, but it will arrive on those dates.'

**Catalonia's Future: Preparing for a Population of 10 Million**
The Catalan government believes that the region will reach 10 million inhabitants in the near future and is preparing for the challenges that come with it. The current population of 8 million is expected to grow due to immigration, with the government projecting that the population will reach 10 million by 2052. However, some experts argue that this growth is not sustainable and that the region's infrastructure and services are not equipped to handle it. The government is planning to update the 1995 Plan Territorial General de Catalunya to address the needs of the growing population, including housing, transportation, and education. The plan aims to ensure that the region's resources are used efficiently and that the population has access to the services they need. Some experts, such as sociologist Mariña Couceiro, argue that immigration has been the driving force behind Catalonia's economic growth and that it is essential for the region's prosperity. Others, like Jaume Grau of Ecologistas en Acción, are concerned about the environmental impact of the growing population and the need for sustainable development. The government is aware of the challenges ahead and is working to address them, but the debate is ongoing and there are differing opinions on how to manage the region's growth.

**EU Rejects Catalan Language Recognition, Nationalist Movement Sees Victory**
The European Union has rejected the official recognition of the Catalan language, a demand made by Carles Puigdemont, a key ally of Pedro Sánchez, in exchange for his support. The EU fears that opening this door would lead to chaos, as it would be forced to recognize 50 new languages, including Galician, Basque, and Catalan. In Catalonia, however, the nationalist movement sees this as a major victory. However, in reality, the use of Catalan is declining in everyday life, particularly among immigrants and many native Catalans. In contrast, Luis Enrique, the coach of PSG, will speak in Spanish during his press conference after the Champions League final, without any controversy. Meanwhile, his colleague Guardiola, who has been a vocal advocate for Catalan nationalism, often avoids speaking Spanish, even though he has learned to speak German fluently. 'Contigo no, bicho, le dice al español... salvo cuando no hay más pelotas,' or 'You're not with me, buddy, unless you're out of options,' as he would say.

**Catalonia Confident in Written Agreement with Spanish Government on New Financing Model**
The Generalitat of Catalonia is confident that it will have a written agreement with the Ministry of Finance before June 30th on a new model of autonomous financing, which recognizes the 'singularities' of Catalonia. According to the 'consellera de Economia', Alícia Romero, the agreement should define the common elements and explicitly state the singularities of the territories. Romero stated, 'Our will is that all communities improve, not just Catalonia. This is what drives us to promote a new financing model that is more transparent, easier, and in which everyone can improve, in which singularities are collected, as is already done now.' The new model should concretely clarify these singularities and finance them adequately. The Generalitat aims to assume the management, collection, liquidation, and inspection of all taxes supported in Catalonia, including the IRPF, starting with this one. The agreement includes the commitment to have a director plan before July 31st to assume the IRPF competences by the Catalan Tax Agency (ATC). Romero added, 'We are working so that this new model is positive for everyone.' She emphasized that her proposal is within the common regime, 'It's not a concerto, it's a singular model for Catalonia, but generalizable, respecting the principles of solidarity and ordinality.'

**The Catalan and the Antipatriotism of the PP | Opinion**
The Goya Awards will return to Barcelona in 2026, a quarter of a century after they were last held there. This news is not unusual, given that the Spanish Film Academy and the Ministry of Culture have been advocating for the decentralization of major cultural events in Spain for years. Sevilla, Málaga, Valladolid, and Granada have all hosted the Goya Awards in recent years, making it logical for Barcelona to do the same. The announcement coincided with news that the Bank of Spain plans to establish a part of its Innovation Department in Barcelona to take advantage of local synergies with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. Some people see this as favoritism or privilege, simply because Barcelona is hosting institutions, events, or offices that some people think should be in Madrid. Madrid's Economy Minister, Rocío Albert, called it 'silly' that the Bank of Spain could strengthen its presence in Barcelona and said it should be 'where it has always been', meaning in the Alcalá Street in Madrid. These criticisms are similar to those made when a socialist government proposed moving the Senate to Catalonia's capital to reinforce its territorial representation character. It is clear that one can be for or against hosting events like the Goya Awards or the Senate in Barcelona. However, this must be in line with the past discourse. If the People's Party (PP) has claimed to be the sole guarantor of Catalonia's sacrosanct Spanishness, it should now be consistent and rejoice that something as Spanish as the central bank can have services in Barcelona, the second-largest city in the country. However, it would be naive to think that the PP will change its ways. The party has a lot of work to do if it wants to stop being a mere echo chamber for Vox on issues like the use of Catalan, Basque, or Galician languages in the European Union, which are perfectly recognized in the Constitution. The PP's efforts to block a proposal to recognize the diversity of the country it claims to govern can only be seen as a form of antipatriotism, specifically Spanish antipatriotism.

**ERC Accuses PSOE of 'Catalanophobia' and Calls for Official Recognition of Catalan in EU**
Jordi Albert, deputy spokesperson for ERC in the Catalan Parliament, has stated that the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) should have 'blindfolded' the voting process on the official recognition of Catalan, Galician, and Basque languages in European institutions, after Spain's request for recognition was postponed in the EU's General Affairs Council on Tuesday. Albert accused the People's Party (PP) of 'Catalanophobia' and expressed confidence that Catalan will eventually be recognized in the EU. ERC has criticized the PSOE for not taking concrete actions to achieve Catalan recognition, saying that 'good words are not enough if not accompanied by real commitment, firm diplomatic stance, and political will.' Albert stated that the PP's actions 'once again demonstrate this Catalanophobia' and accused them of not wanting anything that could benefit the Catalan people. However, he expressed confidence that the Catalan people will persist and that Catalan will eventually be recognized, saying 'the will to be Catalan, their ambition and national consciousness will not be deterred by any obstacles.' Oriol Junqueras, ERC leader, also expressed confidence that Catalan will be officially recognized, saying 'Catalan is part of the European heritage and Catalonia is rooted in Europe since its origins.'

**Foro Nuclear: 'If Catalonia Closes Its Three Reactors, It Will Go Back to the Stone Age'**
The president of Foro Nuclear, Ignacio Araluce, has stated that it doesn't seem logical to maintain the 2019 agreed-upon schedule for the closure of Spanish nuclear power plants, given the current energy, environmental, and geostrategic situation is different. He warned that if Catalonia closes its three reactors, 'it will go back to the Stone Age.' Araluce believes that the government is willing to negotiate with companies to extend the lifespan of the seven Spanish nuclear power plants, but the companies require a reduction in taxation as a condition, not only from the central government but also from regional and municipal governments. He thinks that delaying the closure of Almaraz I, scheduled for November 2027, would 'unlock the situation,' and this should be agreed upon by the fall at the latest. Araluce emphasizes that the complete closure of the reactors agreed upon in 2019 should be accompanied by an increase in renewable energy production by 2030: 'The production of electricity from wind and photovoltaic energy should be doubled in 5 years, and we don't know what power will be needed in 5 years.' He also criticizes the delay in infrastructure for energy storage, such as batteries or reversible hydroelectric power plants, which is necessary to increase storage capacity from 3.5 gigawatts to 22 gigawatts by 2030, 'which is a problem for renewables to be profitable.' Araluce notes that nuclear energy does not emit CO2, 'one of the points of support for the energy transition,' and criticizes those who have wanted to confront this type of energy, which the EU classifies as clean but not green, with renewables.

**Catalonia's National Identity: A Constitutional Framework**
The 'solution to the Catalan issue' is often presented as recognizing Catalonia's 'national identity'. However, this phrase is not new or innocent. It is an idea that seeks to legitimize the erosion of the constitutional foundations of the State. In democracy, it is legitimate to defend many things, including that Catalonia is a nation. What cannot be done is to ignore that the only framework that guarantees the rights of all is the constitutional order. The Constitution of 1978 recognizes the diversity of Spain - nationalities, languages, cultures - but does it from a fundamental principle: the existence of a single sovereign nation, which is Spain. Article 2 of the Constitution states clearly: 'The Constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation, common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards.' This formula is not decorative or symbolic; it is the cornerstone of our democratic system. Any attempt to empty it of content, even if presented with good words, is a direct attack on the 1978 coexistence pact. The Constitutional Court has already ruled on this issue in its famous Sentence 31/2010, related to the Catalan Statute. That text, approved in a referendum but partially challenged, included in its preamble the statement that 'Catalonia is a nation.' The High Court responded clearly: that expression has no legal effect. It may have political or cultural value, but it does not imply recognition of a different sovereignty. Because the only sovereignty recognized by the Constitution is that of the Spanish people as a whole. And here lies the crux of the matter: one thing is to talk about identity, culture, national sentiment; and another very different thing is to use that identity as an excuse to claim political privileges or rights that break the equality between citizens. Catalonia has a strong, rich, plural identity. Nobody denies it. But that does not give it the right to sit outside the common constitutional framework. It is legitimate to defend a Catalan national reality in the cultural or symbolic plane. But it is even more legitimate - and necessary - to defend the concept of a constitutional nation, because it guarantees equality, legality, and democracy. As Habermas recalled, 'democratic legitimacy requires that political decisions be subject to constitutional legality.' Without law, there are no rights. Without shared norms, there is no possible freedom. When one is with the law and the constitutional order, one is not alone, nor is one a reactionary. One is with millions of citizens who believe in coexistence based on common rules. One is with those who defend that self-government is perfectly compatible with national unity. Because autonomy is not sovereignty. And because defending the Constitution is also defending self-government against those who want to turn it into a prelude to rupture. No, Spain is not a 'nation of nations.' It is a nation that recognizes diversity, yes, pluralism, but a single nation. Recognizing that pluralism does not require dynamiting the foundations of the State. Rather, it preserves the constitutional framework, which is the only way to ensure that that pluralism does not become inequality or fragmentation. As Ortega y Gasset said, 'Spain is the problem that can only be solved with all Spaniards.' And that 'all' does not admit compartmentalized or crossed sovereignties. The answer is not in ambiguous formulas or symbolic gestures: it is in defending what we already have. And what we have is a Constitution that has given Catalonia more self-government than ever and Spain the longest period of democratic stability in its history. The stolid perorations do not lead to anything.

**PSOE Defends Catalan Will Not Be a Requirement for Expelling Migrants**
The PSOE's spokesperson in the Spanish government, Patxi López, has defended that Catalan will 'not be and will not be' a requirement for expelling or denying entry to migrants in Catalonia. López stated, 'The knowledge of the language, which has been one of the controversies, will not be a requirement to expel anyone or to deny anyone entry. On the other hand, recognizing Catalan, Basque, and Galician as an integration tool is something that has been done since 2009.' López made these comments during a press conference in Congress about the pact with Junts to delegate migration competences to Catalonia. López also emphasized that the proposal is 'a delegation of competences' and therefore 'is constitutional.' He added that the delegation of competences is 'governed by state legislation, state laws, and the Foreigners Act.' López concluded, 'Let's not make debates about things that do not exist, except for the heads of some to try to harm the government and say that we are breaking up Spain every 10 minutes or that we are giving up something to the independence movement. No, it's true. We are doing something constitutional and reasonable, also with this agreement on the Immigration Bill.'

**Illa Calls for Activation of Catalonia's Capabilities to Promote Shared Prosperity Model**
Catalonia's President, Salvador Illa, has called for the activation of Catalonia's capabilities to make the world recognize the 'shared prosperity model'. He believes that Catalonia has the capacity to assume this model of economic leadership, different from other models of unsolidary accumulation. According to Illa, this can be achieved through three ways: first, with ambition, openness to Europe, and confidence; second, by uniting the civil, cultural, and business initiative with the institutions; and third, by forming a collective commitment. He highlighted the 'Catalunya Lidera' plan, which aims to mobilize €18.5 billion in public resources by 2030, and emphasized the need to take advantage of opportunities despite the current 'deep changes in the world's paradigms - geopolitical, technological, environmental, and demographic - which involve risks and opportunities.'

**Catalonia and Spain Reach 20 Agreements, Marking a 'New Era' of Collaboration**
The Catalan government and the Spanish government have reached 20 agreements, marking a 'new era' of institutional collaboration. The agreements include increasing the Mossos d'Esquadra police force by 5,000 agents to 25,000 by 2030, and expanding the Catalan judiciary to 'situate it at the Spanish average of new courts.' This will require creating 60 new courts, according to Albert Dalmau, the Catalan Minister of Presidency. Dalmau also criticized the fact that these meetings had not taken place in years, with the last meeting of the Commission of Transfers dating back to 2010. The agreements also include the creation of a working group to establish a consortium of investments to manage large public works in Catalonia, and the transfer of competences to the Catalan government to appoint secretaries, intervenors, and treasurers in municipalities. 'A new era of relations between the Government of Catalonia and the Government of Spain has begun. The policy of collaboration must give better results than the policy of confrontation,' said Dalmau. 'It is time for a new era of collaboration and not confrontation,' added Ángel Víctor Torres, the Spanish Minister of Territorial Policy and Public Administration.

**Spain Launches Construction of Temporary Nuclear Waste Storage Facility**
The Spanish government has launched the construction project for a temporary storage facility for nuclear waste from the Vandellós I power plant in Catalonia, which has been closed since 1989 after a major nuclear accident. The facility will store the waste that has been stored in France for over three decades. The project aims to have the facility operational by 2027, with the goal of repatriating the waste from France by 2028. The waste will remain in the temporary storage facility for nearly 50 years, until the permanent deep geological repository is operational in 2073. The government has not yet estimated the cost of the project, but it is expected to take 18 months to complete. Spain has been obligated to return the nuclear waste it sent to France after the accident, but has accumulated delays and failed to meet its commitments. The country has paid over 218 million euros in penalties for not repatriating the waste on time, and will continue to pay for the next three to four years. The government has approved the new plan for the storage of nuclear waste, which includes the construction of seven temporary storage facilities, one for each reactor in the country.

**Catalonia Proposes Phasing Out Gasoline-Powered Motorcycles by 2030**
The Catalan government, led by President Illa, has proposed a plan to phase out gasoline-powered motorcycles by 2030. The plan includes creating 9,000 new charging points and improving the public perception of 'zero-emission' vehicles. However, the second point of the second axis has sparked controversy by promoting the gradual limitation of gasoline-powered motorcycles. According to the plan, restrictions on gasoline-powered motorcycles with environmental labels B and C will be implemented, and a transition program will be established to promote the production, distribution, and repair of electric motorcycles. This could lead to increased taxes on gasoline-powered motorcycles. The president of the Generalitat stated, 'Catalonia wants to lead the way for all of Spain and Europe.' However, the president of Anesdor, José María Riaño, has criticized the plan, saying, 'This proposal is unacceptable. Gasoline-powered motorcycles are not the enemy of sustainable mobility, but rather part of the solution, along with electric motorcycles. The Catalan government should explain to users why they want to restrict the use of their motorcycles, but not do the same with cars.'
