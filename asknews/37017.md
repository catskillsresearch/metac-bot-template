**Paris to Allow General Public to Swim in Seine River for First Time in 100 Years**
The city of Paris has announced that it will allow general public to swim in the Seine River, which was a concern during the 2024 Paris Olympics due to water quality issues. From July 5 to August 31, three sections of the Seine River will be open for swimming, with a maximum capacity of 700 people in the Marais section, 150 people in the Grenelle section, and 150 people in the Ver-si section. The city will monitor the water quality daily with the help of national and local health authorities and will determine whether to open the swimming areas based on the results. Paris Mayor said, 'This is a historic event that will allow Parisians and tourists to swim in the Seine River for the first time in 100 years, and will contribute to the city's leisure and biodiversity.' The city had banned swimming in the Seine River in 1923 due to severe water pollution caused by industrialization, and it was only allowed occasionally in the 1960s. However, after the 2024 Olympics, the city has implemented various projects to improve the water quality, including modernizing sewage treatment facilities.
