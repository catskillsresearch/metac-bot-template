**Portugal's Employment Rate Reaches New Record High**
According to provisional data from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), Portugal's employment rate has reached a new record high, with over 5.2 million people employed in April. The unemployment rate has decreased to 6.3%. The number of employed individuals has increased by 153,000 compared to the same period last year. The INE's estimates show that the active population has increased both compared to March and the same period last year, totaling 5.565 million people. The population employed in April reached 5.216 million, a new record and the highest number since at least 1998, with an increase of 33,000 people compared to March and 153,000 compared to the previous year. The INE notes that the employment growth was more pronounced among men and young people (3.5% in both cases), while female employment increased by 2.1% and adult employment by 2.8%. The INE reports 349,000 people unemployed at the end of April, a decrease of 1.2% compared to the previous month and a slight increase of 0.8% compared to the same period last year. The unemployment rate stood at 6.3%, decreasing by 0.1 percentage points both in the monthly comparison and in relation to the same month of 2024. The youth unemployment rate remains significantly higher than the average, reaching 19.7% of active people between the ages of 16 and 24. However, the INE highlights that in April, it 'reached the lowest value since June 2023 (18.4%)'. Looking at the broader concept of unemployment (which, in addition to the unemployed population, includes part-time workers, inactive people looking for work but not available, and inactive people available but not looking for work), 605,000 people were without work or working less than they wanted. The labor underutilization rate stood at 10.6%, a value lower than in March 2025 (0.2 percentage points) and the previous year (0.4 percentage points). This indicator has registered the lowest value since February 2011, according to the INE's note released on Monday.

**ILO revises downward job creation estimates in 2025**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) has revised its estimates of job creation in 2025 downward, reflecting a decrease in global economic prospects. The ILO estimates that nearly 84 million jobs in 71 countries are directly or indirectly linked to American consumer demand, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for the majority (56 million). However, Canada and Mexico have the highest proportion of exposed jobs (17.1%). ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo stated, 'We know that the global economy is growing at a slower pace than expected. Our report now tells us that if geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions continue, and if we do not address the fundamental issues reshaping the world of work, they will certainly have negative repercussions on labor markets worldwide.' The report highlights concerning trends in income distribution, with the share of labor income decreasing globally from 53.0% in 2014 to 52.4% in 2024. Africa and the Americas have experienced the largest declines. If this share had remained unchanged, global labor income would have been $1,000 billion higher in 2024, equivalent to $290 more per worker in terms of constant purchasing power. The erosion of the global share of labor income is putting pressure on inequalities and highlighting a disconnect between economic growth and worker remuneration. The report notes a shift towards high-skilled jobs, with women leading this trend. Between 2013 and 2023, the proportion of women in high-skilled jobs increased from 21.2% to 23.2%, while the proportion of men in high-skilled jobs was around 18% in 2023. As education levels continue to rise globally, the labor market remains characterized by significant mismatches between education levels. In 2022, only 47.7% of workers had qualifications matching their job requirements. The proportion of under-educated workers decreased from 37.9% to 33.4% over the past decade, while the proportion of over-educated workers increased from 15.5% to 18.9%. The report also addresses the effects of new technologies on the world of work, finding that nearly one in four workers could see their job transformed by generative AI. A greater proportion of jobs in moderately skilled professions are moderately exposed, but a greater percentage of jobs in highly skilled professions are highly exposed, with existing tasks potentially being automated by AI.

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**US job growth likely slowed in May amid trade uncertainty**
US job growth is expected to have slowed in May due to trade uncertainty, with a projected 125,000 new payrolls, down from stronger hiring numbers earlier this year. Despite this, the three-month average job growth remains healthy at 162,000, and the employment rate is predicted to hold firm at 4.2%. Employers are cautious amid unclear trade policy announcements from the White House, with frequent adjustments to timelines and import duty schedules. This has led to a decrease in job vacancies to 7.1 million in April, the lowest since late 2020. Companies are concerned about revenue dips and are limiting their budgets, which may impact the hiring process. The Federal Reserve is keeping a close eye on the labor market, with speeches expected from governors this week. Economists anticipate a drop in the US trade deficit and a possible GDP rebound in the second quarter.

**Turkey's Young Population: Challenges and Opportunities**
According to the '2024 İstatistiklerle Gençlik' report by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the proportion of young people in Turkey is 15% of the total population, which is higher than the European Union average of 10.7%. However, long-term projections show a significant decline in the proportion of young people. The number of young people aged 15-24 in Turkey is expected to decrease from 12.8 million in 2024 to 9.1 million in 2050. The proportion of young people in the total population is also decreasing, from 16.6% in 2013 to 9.7% in 2050. This trend indicates that Turkey is losing its demographic advantage and highlights the need to restructure education, employment, and social policies to adapt to this demographic change. Education is the main reason for migration among young people, with 35.8% of those who migrated doing so to access better, more diverse, or more accessible education opportunities. The second most common reason for migration is the desire to find a job and start working, with 14.5% of migrants citing this as their reason. The unemployment rate among young people is 16.3%, with a higher rate among women at 22.3%. This highlights the challenges faced by young women in accessing employment. The majority of working young people (56.3%) are employed in the service sector, while 30.7% are employed in industry and 13% in agriculture. The birth rate among young women has been declining rapidly, with 10 births per 1,000 young women aged 15-19 in 2024, down from 49 in 2001. This decline reflects changes in societal awareness, women's education and career-oriented lifestyle choices, and access to birth control methods. The net enrollment rate in secondary education is 88% in 2023/24, with 81.2% of students completing secondary education and 42.7% completing higher education. The net enrollment rate in higher education is higher among women at 49.0% and lower among men at 36.7%. Education is becoming more accessible to women. The main sources of happiness for young people are health (45.3%) and success (25.1%), with family, friendship, and material means being less important. The digital habits of young people are also notable, with 98.5% using messaging apps, 95.7% using social media, and 95.3% using voice or video calls. However, more productive or public content, such as political participation (6.2%) and selling goods or services (13.9%), is less prominent in their digital lives. This highlights the use of digital platforms for social communication. The distribution of young people across the country also shows significant differences, with Hakkâri having the highest proportion of young people at 20.8% and Balıkesir having the lowest at 11.8%. This reflects the impact of internal migration, education, and employment on regional demographic structures. The marriage rate among young women is 3.5 times higher than among young men, with 11.7% of young women being married compared to 3.3% of young men. This highlights the impact of societal roles, expectations, and cultural norms on gender.

**Giovani, over 50 e quarantenni: chi sale e chi scende nel mercato del lavoro (e perché)**
According to Bankitalia's annual report, the labor market has slowed down in 2024, with the number of employed individuals and working hours increasing by 1.6% and 2.1% respectively, compared to 1.9% and 2.5% in 2023. The growth in employment has been driven by permanent employment, which has increased among individuals aged 50 and over, due to demographic aging and the reduction of outflows from the labor market, partly due to past pension reforms. The demand for high-skilled professions has increased, but the dynamics have been different between age groups, with younger individuals satisfying the demand for high-skilled professions, while older individuals have emphasized the importance of less qualified professions. The labor market participation rate has also slowed down, with the rate of participation among individuals aged 15-74 increasing by 0.6 percentage points compared to 2019, but then decreasing in 2024. The participation rate among older individuals (50-74 years) has continued to rise, while that of younger individuals (15-34 years) has decreased.

**US Job Growth Expected to Slow Down in April Due to Economic Uncertainty**
The US is expected to see a slowdown in job growth in April due to increasing economic uncertainty. According to the Labor Department's report, non-farm employment growth may reach 130,000, down from 228,000 in March. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.2%. Economists believe that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies have created economic uncertainty, which has slowed down employers' hiring decisions. The range of expectations for job growth is wide, from 25,000 to 195,000. The Labor Department will release the report today at 3:30 PM local time. 'The job growth rate is crucial as it needs to keep pace with the growth rate of the working-age population, which is around 100,000,' said economists. 'A stable unemployment rate of 4.2% is a positive signal for the labor market.'

**Tariff-induced uncertainty seen curbing US job growth in April**
U.S. job growth is expected to slow in April due to President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy, which has created economic uncertainty. Despite this, companies are continuing to hire, keeping the labor market humming for now. The Labor Department's employment report on Friday is likely to be dismissed as backward-looking and will not offer a clear pulse of the economy. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to increase by 130,000 jobs last month, but warn that the pace of job gains will be more than the 100,000 needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain unchanged at 4.2%. Business sentiment continues to plummet, and economists expect layoffs to occur at some point. General Motors has cut its 2025 profit forecast and expects a $4-$5 billion tariff hit, while China has ordered its airlines not to take further deliveries of Boeing planes. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range next week. 'This is a situation where the air in the balloon is slowly dissipating out,' said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. 'How much can the labor market absorb and handle this uncertainty that the administration has injected into the economy?' asked Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale.

**April 2025 nTIDE Jobs Report: Steady Progress in Disability Employment**
The National Trends in Disability Employment (nTIDE) report released on April 4, 2025, highlights steady progress in disability employment. The employment-to-population ratio for individuals with disabilities increased from 37.1 percent in February to 37.5 percent in March 2025, a 0.4 percentage point increase. This is part of a broader trend, as the employment-to-population ratio for non-disabled individuals also rose from 74.4 percent to 74.8 percent during the same period. Dr. John O'Neill noted that while these changes may not be revolutionary, they mark a new normal regarding employment for people with disabilities. However, he warned that stability might be short-lived due to impending layoffs and cuts in public sector jobs, which could pose challenges for this vulnerable segment of the population. The report also highlights the importance of continued research and advocacy to dismantle barriers that prevent individuals with disabilities from pursuing meaningful employment opportunities. By leveraging data, fostering community-based initiatives, and engaging in collaborative networks, we can create pathways toward employment that are not merely aspirational but realistic and sustainable.

**US Manufacturing Index Falls to 49 in March, First Contraction in 2025**
The US manufacturing index, measured by the Ism, fell to 49 in March from 50.3 in February, marking the first contraction in 2025. This is below the expected level of 50, which indicates a contraction. Job openings in the US have also decreased, from 7.76 million in January to 7.57 million in February, which is below the expected level of 7.65 million. This suggests a gradual cooling of the labor market. According to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, if universal tariffs of 20% were to be imposed by the Trump administration, the US economy could fall into recession, with a 7% unemployment rate. This could lead to the loss of over five million jobs and a unemployment rate of 7.3% by early 2027, before decreasing to around 6% in 2028. The White House has stated that no decision has been made and that the 20% tariff on most imports is just one of the options being considered.

**Australia's Jobless Rate Holds at 4.1 percent as Workforce Shrinks**
Australia's job market is facing challenges as employment declined by 52,800 jobs in February, while workforce participation fell to 66.8 percent. Despite this, the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1 percent. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), job losses were partially offset by higher employment levels in certain age groups and growth in the employment-to-population ratio. Recruitment platform JobAdder reported a 44 percent increase in job applications, making job hunting more competitive. Temporary and contract roles accounted for 80 percent of all placements in 2024, up from 78 percent in 2023 and 74 percent in 2022, while permanent job placements declined to 20 percent. JobAdder CEO Martin Herbst attributed this trend to economic uncertainty, and the Reserve Bank projects unemployment to average 4.2 percent by mid-year.

**Huge number of Aussies found work**
Despite a 53,000 drop in employment in February, the Australian unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis noted that the fall in employment was due to fewer older workers returning to work, with lower levels of employment in the older age groups compared to 2024. However, employment for people aged 15-54 continued to grow over the year. This comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut the cash rate in February, and markets are predicting another cut in May. The employment-to-population ratio fell by 0.4 percentage points to 64.1%, but is still close to a record high set last December.

**US Economy Creates 151,000 New Jobs in February, Below Expectations**
The US economy created 151,000 new jobs in February, which is below the market's expectations of 160,000 jobs, according to the Broadcast's median projections. The unemployment rate was 4.1%, with 7.1 million people unemployed. The labor force participation rate and employment-population ratio were 62.4% and 59.9%, respectively. The average hourly earnings for American workers increased by 0.3% in February and 4% compared to the same month last year. Despite the strong labor market, the Federal Reserve may consider cutting interest rates, with 91% of projections suggesting a rate hold and 9% predicting a 0.25% cut. The ADP report also showed that the private sector added 77,000 jobs in February, below the expected 140,000 new jobs.
