**Russia's Plan for a Peaceful Resolution to the Conflict in Ukraine**
Russia presented a three-point plan for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine during the second round of negotiations in Istanbul. The plan includes a treaty of peace that must be supported by UN Security Council resolutions that will be binding for both parties. The Russian negotiators emphasized that the document is not an ultimatum, although many of its points have been rejected by Ukraine in the past. The plan proposes the recognition of Ukraine's neutrality and the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the annexed territories. Ukraine must also reduce its military forces and disband nationalist formations. Russia demands the lifting of all economic sanctions and the refusal to impose new restrictions between the two countries. The plan also includes the establishment of a bilateral control and monitoring center to ensure the implementation of the ceasefire. Ukraine has two options: either withdraw its troops from all annexed territories or prohibit the movement of Ukrainian military units, except for leaving Russian territory. In both cases, a 30-day ceasefire will be declared, during which both parties must comply with the agreed-upon points. Once the new executive and legislative bodies are formed in Ukraine, the peace treaty will be signed and ratified, and will enter into force after being supported by UN resolutions. According to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the treaty will not be signed until Ukraine declares a ceasefire before negotiating a lasting peace. 'We are not going to sign a treaty of peace until Ukraine declares a ceasefire,' Putin said. 'We are not going to sign a treaty of peace until Ukraine declares a ceasefire,' Putin said. 'We are not going to sign a treaty of peace until Ukraine declares a ceasefire,' Putin said.

**Russia's Conditions for a Ceasefire with Ukraine: What We Know**
Russia and Ukraine have agreed to exchange all wounded or seriously ill prisoners of war and those between 18 and 25 years old, but have not made significant progress on declaring a ceasefire of at least 30 days. Russia has presented a memorandum with its conditions for a ceasefire and a negotiated end to the conflict. According to the memorandum, Russia demands that Ukraine withdraw its troops from the four regions of the country that Moscow claims as annexed: Donetsk and Lugansk in the east, and Zaporiyia and Khersón in the south, before implementing a 30-day ceasefire. As an alternative, Russia proposes a second variant, which involves 'the prohibition of troop movements by the Ukrainian Army (...) with the exception of those aimed at withdrawing to the distance from the Russian border agreed upon by the parties.' Russia also demands 'the cessation of mobilization' by Ukraine and the beginning of the demobilization of its forces. Additionally, it demands 'guarantees from Ukraine of the cessation of sabotage and subversion actions against Russia and its citizens' and 'the creation of a bilateral monitoring and control center for the ceasefire regime.' Ukraine has rejected any of these conditions. 'This will be now treated by our military specialists with the Ukrainians,' said Vladimir Medinski, assessor of Russian President Vladimir Putin, regarding one of the Russian proposals to declare truces of two or three days in certain sectors of the front 'so that the commanders can collect the bodies of their soldiers.'

**Russia Proposes Partial Ceasefire and Ukrainian Withdrawal in Eastern Ukraine with Peace Treaty as Goal**
Russia has delivered a memorandum with its proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine, which includes a long-term ceasefire in some regions, the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, and measures to address what Moscow considers to be the deep causes of the conflict. The memorandum proposes a two- or three-day ceasefire once peace negotiations begin, allowing for the recovery of bodies in 'gray zones' and the delivery of 6,000 Ukrainian military corpses by Russia. After that, Russia offers two options for a ceasefire, one of which involves signing a 30-day ceasefire agreement that includes the commitment of Ukrainian forces to withdraw from Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. The other option is a package of ten conditions that have not been disclosed. Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinski confirmed that the memorandum has been delivered to Ukraine, saying, 'We have delivered our memorandum to Turkey. It has two parts: how to achieve a genuine long-term peace and what measures must be taken to make a ceasefire possible with all the guarantees.' Medinski emphasized that the Russian plan 'is quite detailed and very well worked out by our side,' and that Ukraine has decided to consider it. 'They will study it and respond. We'll see,' he added. The conditions proposed by Russia for a ceasefire include lifting martial law, holding presidential and parliamentary elections within 100 days after the end of martial law, ending Western arms deliveries to Ukraine, stopping 'sabotage' on Russian territory, and prohibiting the redeployment of Ukrainian forces and other paramilitary formations, with the exception of movements for withdrawal to a distance agreed upon from the Russian border. Additionally, Moscow demands the neutrality and denuclearization of Ukraine, the prohibition of any military activity by third countries on its territory, the international recognition of Crimea, the Donbass, and New Russia as part of the Russian Federation, and the lifting of sanctions imposed on Russia. Internally, it proposes guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of the Russian-speaking minority, lifting restrictions on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and prohibiting the glorification of Nazism. Russia also asks to limit the number of members, arms, and material of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, grant amnesty to 'political prisoners,' and advocate for the gradual restoration of bilateral diplomatic and commercial relations, including gas transit. Once the process is completed, the final peace treaty should be recorded in a UN Security Council resolution, explains the Russian memorandum.

**Russia's proposals call for elections in Ukraine, followed by peace treaty signing**
Russia's proposals for resolving the Ukrainian crisis include holding elections in Ukraine, followed by the signing of a peace treaty. According to the Russian memorandum, the sequence of steps is as follows: a 30-day ceasefire, elections, and the formation of governing bodies in Ukraine, and finally, the signing of the treaty. The peace treaty must be approved by a 'legally binding resolution of the United Nations Security Council' before it can be ratified and implemented. As stated in the document, 'the signing of a Memorandum on the ceasefire with specific dates for the implementation of all its provisions and the determination of the date for the signing of the future Treaty on the final settlement' is to be done immediately after Russia transfers 6,000 bodies of deceased military personnel to the Ukrainian side.

**Ukraine and Russia Agree to Exchange Prisoners, But Fail to Reach Ceasefire Deal**
Ukraine and Russia agreed to exchange 'all prisoners of war who are severely injured or seriously ill' and 'young soldiers aged 18 to 25 years' during a meeting in Istanbul. However, Russia rejected the proposal for an unconditional ceasefire, as proposed by Ukraine. The two sides also agreed to exchange 6,000 bodies of soldiers killed in combat, but failed to reach an agreement on a ceasefire. Russia proposed a partial ceasefire of '2-3 days' on certain parts of the front, but Ukraine rejected this proposal. The Russian delegation handed over a memorandum to the Ukrainians on 'the means to establish a durable peace' and 'the measures to be taken to achieve a complete ceasefire'. Ukraine also handed over a list of hundreds of Ukrainian children who were allegedly 'deported' by Russia and demanded their repatriation.

**Ukraine and Russia Agree to New Prisoner Exchange and Ceasefire Talks**
Ukraine and Russia have agreed to a new prisoner exchange, including all wounded or seriously ill prisoners and military captives between 18 and 25 years old. Additionally, the remains of 6,000 soldiers from each side will be exchanged. This agreement was reached after a meeting in Istanbul, where memorandums for a ceasefire were also discussed. Ukraine will take a week to analyze the Russian proposal. Ukraine has also handed over a list of 339 deported children, demanding their return. A trilateral meeting between the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the US is proposed to promote peace negotiations. Ukraine's Defense Minister, Rustem Umérov, announced the new prisoner exchange on Monday, following a meeting between delegations from Moscow and Kyiv in Istanbul. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that, after the exchange of 1,000 captives from each side agreed upon on May 16 in the Turkish city and implemented a few days later, there will be a new prisoner exchange. In this case, it was agreed to exchange all wounded or seriously ill prisoners of war and release all military captives between 18 and 25 years old. Additionally, another agreement was reached for the exchange of the remains of 6,000 soldiers from each side who fell behind enemy lines. 'The return of Ukrainian children is an integral part of any just and lasting peace and a key element of trust between the parties to negotiate,' said Ukrainian Presidential Office Head Andrí Yermak. 'Good faith is not words, but actions. And now it's time to show it,' he added. Russia has stated that they will study the list of children's names to facilitate their return to the neighboring country. 'Russia will study each case without exception from the Ukrainian list (...) There are no kidnapped children, there are children rescued and taken out of combat zones,' said Russian negotiator Vladímir Medinski. The meeting on Monday resulted in the agreement to meet again, but Ukraine wanted to take a step further and proposed to Russia to hold a three-way meeting between the presidents of Ukraine, the US, and Russia -Volodymyr Zelensky, Donald Trump, and Vladímir Putin, respectively- between June 20 and 30 to promote peace negotiations. 'This meeting is crucial to move forward in the negotiation process,' said Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guerogui Tiji. 'If Putin says he wants to meet tomorrow, President Zelensky will meet with him tomorrow. We don't have a problem with that. Unfortunately, the problem is on their side,' he commented.

**Russia and Ukraine to swap 12,000 dead soldiers; agree partial ceasefire**

**Ukraine Presents 22-Point Document Outlining Conditions for Peaceful Agreement with Russia**
Ukraine has prepared a 22-point document outlining the conditions for a peaceful agreement, which will be presented to Russia at the June 2 meeting in Istanbul. The initiative starts with a complete ceasefire for at least 30 days, followed by the exchange of prisoners, the return of Ukrainian children taken to Russian-controlled territories, and a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the document, Ukraine and Russia, with the participation of the US and Europe, should discuss the conditions under which the war, the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II, can be completely stopped. Ukrainian officials previously stated that they had transmitted the project document to the Russian side before the Istanbul talks. The conditions for a peaceful agreement outlined in the document are largely consistent with those previously announced by Ukraine. The document also states that the current front line should serve as the starting point for territorial negotiations. These conditions differ significantly from Russia's public demands. Recently, US President Donald Trump called on Moscow and Kiev to work towards a peaceful agreement. Russia proposed a second round of direct talks with Ukrainian representatives in Istanbul next week. Kiev stated this week that it is inclined to seek peace, but expects a memorandum from Russia with proposals. Despite this, Zelensky announced on Sunday that he will send a delegation of officials to meet with Russian colleagues in Istanbul. As known, the first round of talks between Ukraine and Russia took place on May 16 in Istanbul, resulting in an agreement to exchange prisoners in the format of '1000 for 1000'. The US received proposals for a ceasefire from Ukraine, which was the result of recent talks in Paris and London. The document contains 22 requirements. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian side has not yet received a Russian 'memorandum' with proposals for a ceasefire.

The roadmap also calls for a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The document, which was obtained by Reuters, states that Moscow and Kyiv will work with the US and Europe to draft terms for a lasting peace agreement. Ukrainian officials said they had previously sent the roadmap to Russia before the Istanbul talks. The proposed terms are similar to those previously presented by Ukraine.

**Russia Declared Victor in Diplomatic Showdown with Ukraine**
The recent Russian-Ukrainian negotiations have been met with mixed reactions from Western media, but many agree that Russia has emerged victorious in the diplomatic showdown. According to The New York Times, the meeting did not result in an agreement on a 30-day ceasefire, which was sought by Kyiv and its Western allies. The publication notes that Washington was not optimistic about the outcome, but the Trump administration is growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress. Trump has hinted that only a personal meeting with Putin can resolve the conflict. The Guardian also notes the lack of breakthrough, with correspondent Sean Walker expressing disappointment that the week ended without progress towards peace, and Western threats remaining empty words. However, Walker adds that Zelensky and European leaders are already discussing further steps with Trump. The Independent highlights Kyiv's frustration, with the Ukrainian side claiming that Russia's demands are 'unrealistic'. The publication also notes that Kyiv tried to involve the US and Turkey in the negotiations, but Russia insisted on a bilateral format, which angered the Ukrainian delegation. CNN takes a more optimistic view, citing Turkish mediators who assess the outcome as 'more positive than expected', with no accusations made and the discussion of a possible prisoner exchange being a significant step forward. European press, including Spanish El Mundo and Confidencial, and Polish Rzeczpospolita, generally conclude that there was no significant progress. However, French Le Figaro notes Russia's successes on the Donbass, with new settlements being liberated between Konstantinovka and Pokrovsk. The Global Times quotes experts who see the negotiations as an important step towards resuming direct dialogue between Russia and Ukraine, with the fact of the meeting itself being a significant achievement.

**Ukraine and Russia Engage in Diplomatic Efforts Amid Ongoing Conflict**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reiterated his offer to cease attacks on civilian targets, saying 'We hold our offer in place, and we expect a clear answer from Moscow.' Zelensky also stated that the 30-day ceasefire during Easter showed that it is possible to end the conflict, but that a 'real order from Moscow' is needed to stop the fighting. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed willingness to engage in bilateral talks with Ukraine, saying 'This is all a topic that needs to be carefully considered, perhaps even on a bilateral level.' Putin's statement comes after Zelensky offered to extend the ceasefire for 30 days. The Ukrainian president has also announced plans to meet with French, British, and US officials in London on Wednesday. The situation in Ukraine remains tense, with reports of explosions and air raid sirens sounding in various parts of the country. Russia has not confirmed whether it will extend the ceasefire, and the situation remains uncertain. The conflict has been ongoing for over three years, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The international community has been calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, but so far, no agreement has been reached.

**Team USA and Team Russia Release Statements Following Technical "Ceasefire" Team Meetings - The Last Refuge**
The United States, Russia, and Ukraine have agreed to a 'technical ceasefire' following bilateral technical-level talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The agreement includes measures to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes. The US will also help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems. Additionally, the US and Russia agreed to develop measures for implementing a 30-day ban on strikes against energy facilities in Russia and Ukraine, starting on March 18, 2025. The US reiterated President Trump's imperative that the killing on both sides of the conflict must stop, and will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution.

**Only Trump Believes in Peace with Putin**
US President Donald Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours during his campaign, but nearly three months after taking office, the conflict continues unabated. Trump's promise of quick agreements has emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sees this urgency as an opportunity to extract more concessions. The two-hour phone call between Trump and Putin, their second since Trump took office in January, has exposed the shortcomings of the 'negotiator-in-chief' and the difficulties of achieving a lasting peace agreement. Putin rejected the 30-day ceasefire agreed upon by the US and Ukraine, accepting only a limited truce on energy infrastructure. Trump's approach to his friends and enemies has been criticized, as he seems more interested in reaching an agreement with Putin than in ensuring Ukraine's security and independence. This stance plays into Moscow's hands. The phone call with Putin has revealed the extent to which Trump's pressure campaign on Kyiv over the past month, including public humiliation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House, has given Russia more room to maneuver. Putin not only rejected the unconditional ceasefire demanded by the US, but also set his own preconditions for peace, including the end of US-Ukraine military and intelligence cooperation. Trump's recent decision to suspend this cooperation, later reversing it, has set a dangerous precedent for Moscow, which sees it as a plausible demand. The coming weeks will show how far Trump is willing to go to please Putin, even if it means abandoning Ukraine. It all depends on whether the Kremlin can persuade the US that it has more to gain from its supposed economic association than from defending Ukraine. Putin recently spoke of a bilateral cooperation for aluminum production and the exploitation of rare earth minerals. Trump's obsession with disparaging his allies has severely weakened the transatlantic order and reduced Western power to impose its will. The positive side of this earthquake induced by the White House has been the awakening of European defense. Germany has approved its multi-billion dollar rearmament program this week, and the EU has given itself five years to counter its disuasion gaps and to be able to defend itself against Russian neo-imperialism. 'If Europe wants to avoid war, it must prepare for it,' is the new mantra. We Europeans will still have to thank Trump for this.

**Trump and Putin Discuss Ukraine Conflict and Bilateral Relations**
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a phone call that lasted over an hour and a half to discuss several strategic issues. According to the White House, Trump and Putin agreed on the 'need to achieve peace and stop the fighting in the Ukraine war', emphasizing that 'this conflict must end with a lasting peace'. They also agreed to 'improve bilateral relations between the United States and Russia'. Trump said, 'The money and blood that both Ukraine and Russia have spent on this war would have been better spent on the needs of their people... This conflict should not have started, and it should have ended a long time ago through sincere and genuine efforts for peace.' The statement confirmed that 'the two leaders agreed that peace in Ukraine will start with a ceasefire in the energy and infrastructure sectors, in addition to technical negotiations on implementing a ceasefire in the Black Sea, and a complete ceasefire and lasting peace. These negotiations will start immediately in the Middle East.' Trump and Putin also discussed the Middle East as a potential area for cooperation to prevent future conflicts, according to the White House. They also discussed the need to stop the spread of strategic weapons and will cooperate with others to ensure the widest possible implementation. They also expressed their opposition to Iran being in a position to destroy Israel. The two leaders agreed that the future holds great possibilities for improving bilateral relations between the United States and Russia, including large economic deals and geostrategic stability when peace is achieved.' The Kremlin reported that Putin supported Trump's initiative for a mutual ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine for 30 days, and issued instructions to the Russian army to comply. Putin also mentioned several important points related to the ceasefire, including Kiev's inability to negotiate, which may pose a challenge to implementing the agreement. Putin assured Trump that Russia will ensure the lives and humane treatment of Ukrainian soldiers who surrender in the Kursk region. In a related context, Putin informed Trump that a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine will take place on March 19, involving 175 prisoners from each side. As a 'goodwill gesture', Moscow announced its intention to hand over 23 wounded Ukrainian soldiers to Kiev. According to the Kremlin, Russia and the United States agreed to form joint expert groups to monitor the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine, and both sides expressed their readiness to start negotiations to establish a comprehensive plan related to maritime security in the Black Sea. Putin informed Trump of Moscow's readiness to work together to find permanent solutions to the Ukrainian crisis. The two presidents stressed the importance of normalizing bilateral relations between their countries, in light of their shared responsibility for ensuring global stability. They also discussed the Iranian file, where both expressed their opposition to Tehran's threat to destroy Israel. Finally, the agencies reported that the presidents discussed a wide range of areas where cooperation is possible, including the sports field, where Trump supported Putin's proposal to organize matches between the US National Hockey League (NHL) and the Russian Hockey League (KHL), in an effort to promote relations between the two countries on all levels.'

The statement also mentioned that the talks between the two sides covered bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington, with the two leaders stressing the need to improve them, starting from their shared responsibility to maintain global stability.

**Trump and Putin Agree to Work Towards Lasting Peace and Improved Relations**
US President Trump and Russian President Putin have agreed to work towards a lasting peace and improved bilateral relations between the two countries. According to the White House, 'both leaders have agreed that this conflict must end with a lasting peace and that US-Russia relations must be improved.' The first step towards peace is a ceasefire on energy and infrastructure: 'the leaders have agreed that the path to peace will begin with a ceasefire on energy and infrastructure, as well as technical negotiations for the implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, until a complete ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East,' it reads. Trump and Putin have also discussed the Middle East in broader terms, defining it as a region with potential for cooperation to prevent future conflicts. They have also discussed the need to stop the proliferation of strategic arms and will engage with other actors to limit it as much as possible. The two leaders have shared the opinion that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel. Finally, according to the White House, the US and Russia have agreed to improve relations that 'include important economic agreements and greater geopolitical stability once peace is reached.' Putin has expressed gratitude to Trump for his desire to contribute to reaching the noble goal of ending hostilities and human losses. Following the conversation, Putin immediately ordered the military to suspend attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure for 30 days. The Russian leader then set conditions for the ceasefire, including the end of rearmament. 'The Russian side has emphasized a number of essential points regarding the effective monitoring of a possible ceasefire along the entire contact line, the need to end forced mobilization in Ukraine and the rearmament of Ukrainian armed forces,' it reads from a Kremlin statement. There will be an exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine tomorrow, March 19, with 175 prisoners on each side.

**Trump-Putin phone talks aim for Ukraine ceasefire, peace deal**
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held high-stakes phone talks on Tuesday, aiming to convince Moscow to accept a 30-day ceasefire in the Ukraine war and move towards a lasting peace deal. Ukraine has agreed to a US-proposed ceasefire, but Putin has said his forces will fight on until several conditions are met. Trump hopes to persuade Putin to accept the ceasefire and allow progress towards a longer-term peace plan, which could include territorial concessions by Kyiv and control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. 'Many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains,' Trump said. 'Each week brings 2,500 soldier deaths, from both sides, and it must end NOW.' The Kremlin said there is already a 'certain understanding' between the two leaders, but many questions remain regarding the further normalisation of bilateral relations and a settlement on Ukraine.

During the talks in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) between the US and Ukrainian delegations, Sybiha emphasized that the release of prisoners, civilians, and the return of Ukrainian children were key issues. 'This was our fundamental position,' he stressed. The icon project, created by Ukrainian artists Sofia Atlantova and Alexander Klimenko, aims to transform death, symbolized by the ammunition box, into life, which is represented by the icon in Ukrainian spiritual tradition. The boxes, on which the icons are written, were brought from the combat zone, specifically from the Kiev, Kharkov, and Donetsk regions. The project was founded in 2014. The meeting between the Ukrainian and American delegations took place on March 11 in Jeddah. The key topics of the meeting were the path to peace and bilateral relations between Ukraine and the US. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Volz gave a press conference after the talks with the Ukrainian delegation, which lasted over eight hours. 'Ukraine has clearly stated that it shares Trump's vision of peace and has made specific steps and proposals, including agreeing to the US proposal for a complete ceasefire,' Rubio said. The US will now pass the proposal to the Russian side 'through multiple channels.' Rubio expressed hope that the Russians would agree, after which 'we can move on to the second stage - real negotiations on ending the conflict in a way that would be acceptable to both sides, sustainable, and ensuring the stability and security of Ukraine in the long term.' The topic of the agreement between Ukraine and the US on rare earth metals was not discussed. According to Rubio, the best 'gesture of goodwill' from Russia would be to agree to a ceasefire. Trump is ready to take 'tough measures' against both sides to negotiate a peaceful agreement. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umeyev announced that the pause in US military aid to Ukraine has been lifted. Sybiha explained why the ceasefire was agreed upon for only 30 days: 'The American side will now talk to the Russians about their readiness or unwillingness to end the war. Why is this temporary ceasefire so important - because it is not about freezing the conflict. It's just about trying to start the path to ending the war in a fair way. This is also a step that shows who is really interested in peace.'

**US and Ukraine Agree on 30-Day Ceasefire, Putting Pressure on Russia**
The US and Ukraine have agreed on a 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended if Russia agrees. The ceasefire will come into effect immediately if Russia approves it. The US will also resume its military aid to Ukraine and restart its intelligence cooperation. This move strengthens Ukraine's position in potential negotiations. The sudden breakthrough in the bilateral talks is a surprise, as both sides had initially set modest goals. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has taken a bold step by proposing a partial ceasefire, which initially focused on halting aerial and naval attacks. This had been discussed in 2024, as both sides saw it as a cost-effective measure. To put pressure on Russia, Ukraine launched a record 337 unmanned aerial vehicles against Russia on Tuesday morning, disrupting an important oil pipeline to Europe. The ceasefire was later expanded to include ground fighting, and the exchange of prisoners and the return of Ukrainian children from Russia were also agreed upon. This move has helped Ukraine to overcome Trump's criticism that they are the main obstacle to ending the war. Now, Putin is under pressure to show that his peace efforts are more than just propaganda. The success of the Jidda agreement depends on whether it marks the first step towards peace or hardens the fronts between East and West. Russia has responded with new drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. However, the Russian position is not the only uncertainty. The agreement raises numerous open questions, including the monitoring of the ceasefire, territorial concessions, and the future security architecture for Ukraine and Europe. The US role in defining its role in the conflict is crucial. The lack of security guarantees in the Ukrainian-US agreement is a concern, and the planned signing of a raw materials agreement is not a substitute. The European proposal to send a 'peacekeeping force' seems vague, and Moscow has rejected it. Additionally, a pure freezing of the conflict at the current front line does not guarantee peace, as Ukraine may accept certain territorial losses, but Russia's maximal demands go beyond the 'realities on the battlefield.' Putin's goal is to reverse the entire NATO expansion since the end of the Cold War, which means that the US government will have to consider how to counter the Kremlin's ambitions.
