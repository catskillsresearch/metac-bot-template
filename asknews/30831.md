**Forex Analysis & Reviews: 12.05.2025 - Trading Signals for BITCOIN...**
Bitcoin is trading around $104,250, above the 21st SMA and within a bullish trend channel. However, the latest Japanese candlestick chart shows signs of exhaustion, indicating a potential technical correction towards $100,000 if BTC falls below 103,600. On the other hand, if Bitcoin reaches $106,250, it will be seen as a signal to sell due to overbought conditions. The 200 EMA, located around 93,885, could serve as a good point to resume buying if bearish strength prevails.

**Bitcoin Price Predictions: Experts Expect $120,000 to $130,000 in 2025**
Experts predict that the price of Bitcoin may reach $120,000 to $130,000 in 2025, surpassing its historical maximum. According to Denis Astafiev, founder of SharesPro, Bitcoin is being increasingly considered as an alternative to gold, a defensive asset, in a world of global instability, sanctions, and trade restrictions. He also notes that liquidity has returned to the cryptocurrency market, citing the growth of M2 money supply indicators and their new historical highs, particularly in China. Independent economist Andrey Barkhata is more cautious, predicting that the price of Bitcoin will remain stable in the range of $95,000 to $115,000 by the end of May or early June, influenced by global instability, including the escalation of the conflict between India and Pakistan. However, Mikhail Smirnov, director of communications at exmo.me, is more optimistic, suggesting that Bitcoin may reach $120,000 to $130,000 or even $155,000 in 2025, depending on the development of events. 'In case of positive developments, the price of Bitcoin may reach $120,000 to $130,000 or even $155,000,' said Mikhail Smirnov. 'The return of liquidity to the market and the growth of M2 money supply indicators are positive factors for the cryptocurrency,' added Denis Astafiev.

**Expert Predicts Bitcoin Price to Reach $120-130 Thousand by 2025**
Denis Astafyev, founder of SharesPro, believes that the price of Bitcoin could reach $120-130 thousand by 2025, potentially breaking its historical record. He attributes this to Bitcoin being seen as a safe-haven asset in times of global instability, sanctions, and trade restrictions. Astafyev also notes that liquidity has returned to the cryptocurrency market, with the growth of M2 money supply and its new historical highs. However, independent economist Andrey Barxota predicts that the price of Bitcoin will not change significantly by summer, estimating a range of $95-115 thousand. Barxota attributes this to the market's reaction to global instability, including the escalation of the conflict between India and Pakistan. He notes that Bitcoin is sensitive to such events and that its price may be influenced by the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities.

**Bitcoin Predictions: $100,000 by 2029 and $25,000 by End of Year**
Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, predicts that Bitcoin will surpass $100,000 by 2029, before Donald Trump's second term ends. He believes that the global liquidity expansion will continue to drive the price up. Hayes also emphasized that the weakening of trust in fiat currency and the preference for scarce assets will lead to a sustained rally in the cryptocurrency market. He also stated that the US dollar will depreciate against gold and Bitcoin, and that US bonds are an investment to avoid. Tim Draper, a prominent venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, has also predicted that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 by the end of the year if companies continue to buy it. Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy, a leading Bitcoin holding company, believes that the price of Bitcoin has not yet reached $15,000 due to short-term investors leaving the market. He also noted that the US government has become more supportive of Bitcoin in recent months, with Trump's strategic Bitcoin stockpiling executive order and cabinet members actively supporting the market.

**From Caution to Optimism: A New Analysis of Standard Chartered's Revised Bitcoin Predictions**
Jeffrey Kendrick, the head of digital assets at Standard Chartered Bank, expressed regret over the bank's previous predictions for Bitcoin's price in the second quarter of 2025. The bank had previously predicted that the cryptocurrency would reach $120,000 with a possibility of reaching $200,000 by the end of the year. However, Kendrick now believes that those predictions were 'less than the reality that is beginning to form.' A significant change in investor behavior has made the $120,000 target price seem more achievable. Bitcoin has transitioned from a high-risk asset to a strategic tool for portfolio rebalancing, especially with the increasing shift away from traditional US assets, rising geo-political tensions, and economic instability. Increased institutional interest has also boosted confidence in Bitcoin. Kendrick believes that large investors now view Bitcoin as a safe haven in the face of global economic volatility, particularly with declining trust in the US dollar. This has led many to consider Bitcoin as an effective means of hedging against risks associated with traditional markets. The development of the infrastructure for trading cryptocurrencies, including the proliferation of financial products related to Bitcoin such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has made investing in Bitcoin easier and safer. These factors have raised the ceiling for expectations regarding the future market capitalization of the cryptocurrency. In light of these changes, it is no longer unlikely that Bitcoin will reach levels much higher than previously expected. The revised predictions suggest that it is possible for Bitcoin to surpass the $200,000 barrier by the end of 2025, driven by strong institutional momentum and the ongoing shift in the perception of digital assets. Bitcoin is no longer just a short-term trading tool, but has become an integral part of long-term strategic investment and risk management strategies for investors around the world. It appears that the first cryptocurrency is moving steadily towards establishing its place as one of the pillars of the new financial system, at a time when markets are seeking more stable and profitable alternatives.

**Bitcoin to Hit New All-Time High Around $120K in Q2, Standard Chartered Says**
Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick predicts that bitcoin will hit a new all-time high of $120,000 in the second quarter of the year. Kendrick attributes this to investors' strategic allocation away from U.S. assets, a 12-year high in the U.S. Treasury term premium, strong accumulation by whales, and a shift in American investors' preferences towards non-U.S. assets. He also notes that exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows suggest a 'safe-haven reallocation from gold into BTC.' Kendrick believes that 'bitcoin may be a better hedge than gold against financial system risks.' Bitcoin was trading at around $95,300 at the time of publication. Kendrick previously predicted that bitcoin would reach $200,000 by the end of 2025.

**Bitcoin Could Reach $200,000 by 2025, $1 Million by 2033, According to Bernstein Report**
A report by Bernstein predicts that the price of Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025, $500,000 by 2029, and $1 million by 2033. The main driver of this projection is the growth of Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Since the first funds were approved, the flow of institutional money into the market has exploded. According to Bernstein, the demand created by ETFs is so strong that it is pushing the already limited supply of Bitcoin, especially after the last halving. The report highlights a classic scenario of scarcity: many people want to buy, and few are selling. With ETFs making it easier for traditional investors to access the asset, this dynamic is likely to intensify. The study also notes a silent but powerful trend: the adoption of Bitcoin by large companies. Treasuries of multinationals, investment funds, and wealth managers are increasingly adding Bitcoin as a store of value. This is not just speculation, but a way to hedge against the risks of the traditional financial system, which is facing record levels of global debt and distrust in fiat currencies. While the report is optimistic, it also acknowledges the risks. Regulatory issues continue to be the biggest challenge for the future of Bitcoin. Various countries are reviewing their laws on cryptocurrencies, and some proposals could limit access to products like ETFs or impose compliance requirements that could slow down the growth of the sector.

Brad Garlinghouse from Ripple believes that Bitcoin may reach $200,000, but thinks this price is unrealistic.

The average prediction from 25 experts is $135,048, with some models predicting a price of up to $833,000 by 2035. Standard Chartered predicts a price of $120,000 by summer and $200,000 by the end of 2025.

However, he also criticizes Donald Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency, calling it a distraction from meaningful regulatory progress.

**Why bitcoin could hit $180K in 2025 as investors eye fresh entry**
A speaker from Funstrat, Tom Lee, has predicted a Bitcoin price of $250,000 by the end of 2024. However, another speaker believes that a more realistic target for 2025 is between $150,000 to $180,000. The core driver for this price increase is expected to be the monetary supply, liquidity market, and institutional play. The speaker notes that Bitcoin is starting to show more shine and luster as a diversification option in a volatile environment. When asked if it's too late to invest in Bitcoin, the speaker responds that it's never too late or too early to get into the cryptocurrency space. They recommend dollar cost averaging as a strategy to reduce emotion and make investing simpler. 'It's not too crazy to see it somewhere between 150 to 180,000 as we close out this year in 2025 for the Bitcoin price,' the speaker says. 'The key to the question is, is it too late or too early? And the answer is, it's never too late or too early to get into the cryptocurrency space.'

**'Strongly Believe Bitcoin Will Reach $180K To $200K in 2025', Robert Kiyosaki Says**
Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', has predicted that Bitcoin will reach $180,000 to $200,000 in 2025, despite the asset's recent 32% decline from its January record. Kiyosaki believes that the U.S. economy is headed for a historic market crash, which he terms 'a greater depression', and advocates for a rush to safe-haven assets like Bitcoin. He wrote, 'BITCOIN is $84k today. Strongly believe Bitcoin will reach $180k to $200k in 2025.' Since Kiyosaki shared his prediction, Bitcoin has shown signs of strength, jumping nearly 4% from around $84,000 to trade above $87,000.

**Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Will Reach $200,000 in 2025**
Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', believes that Bitcoin will reach $200,000 in 2025. He attributes this prediction to the macroeconomic situation, which he thinks will drive up demand for Bitcoin. Kiyosaki also predicts a major market crash, which he claims is already happening, and advises people to take precautions by investing in Bitcoin, gold, and silver. He emphasizes the importance of eliminating the 'poor mentality' and taking action to achieve financial freedom. According to Kiyosaki, 'those who invest in a single Bitcoin, gold, or silver now could emerge from this crisis as very rich.' However, he warns that if people wait, it may be too late after the 'giant crash.' Kiyosaki's comments come as Bitcoin is experiencing a corrective period, while gold and silver prices are increasing.

**Bitcoin Could Reach $200,000 In 2025 If Fed Relaxes Policy, Bitwise's Matt Hougan Says**
Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, believes Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025 if the Federal Reserve relaxes its policy and stimulates the economy. Hougan attributes the current muted performance of Bitcoin to broader economic concerns, but expects a significant rally if the Fed signals readiness to ease fears of a recession. He emphasized the ongoing imbalance between supply and demand in the Bitcoin market, noting that the Bitcoin network produces 165,000 BTC per year, while ETFs alone bought 500,000 last year. Hougan also pointed to institutional and corporate interest as reinforcing Bitcoin's long-term trajectory, stating that MicroStrategy continues to accumulate and that he believes the number of companies buying Bitcoin will triple this year. 'There's been so much fundamentally positive news that should have Bitcoin trading at $150,000 to $200,000 today,' Hougan said, speaking with Coindesk. 'The overhang of economic uncertainty is weighing on markets,' he explained. Hougan added that while Bitcoin could temporarily stagnate or retreat in a scenario where the Fed plays the tough parent, he expects long-term demand to support the asset. 'Bitcoin is going to get there eventually,' he said, calling recent dips a 'buy the dip' opportunity.

**Why Bitcoin is on Track to Hit $200K by 2026?**
Many analysts predict that Bitcoin could reach US$200,000 by 2026 due to factors like institutional demand, regulatory clarity, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. Institutional adoption is a major driver of Bitcoin's price momentum, with demand rising as more hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations enter the market. The approval of US-spot Bitcoin ETFs has made it easy for institutional investors to invest in digital assets, with analysts expecting these ETFs to hold around 7% of Bitcoin in circulation by 2025 and approximately 15% by 2033. This increased demand is likely to drive prices higher while keeping corrections mild.

**68% of Crypto Investors Think Bitcoin Will Hit $200,000 in 2025. Here's Why They May Be Wrong. | The Motley Fool**
68% of cryptocurrency investors believe Bitcoin will reach $200,000 in 2025, but there are reasons to be cautious. While a Trump presidency is expected to bring looser regulations and economic growth, there's a risk that politicians may not follow through on their promises. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate cuts and keep inflation above its 2% target may limit the potential for interest rates to decline, which could negatively impact Bitcoin's price. Furthermore, Bitcoin's history is characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, and changing investor sentiment can have a significant impact on its price. As such, investors should consider these risk factors and adopt a long-term time horizon when investing in Bitcoin. 'Trying to correctly predict if the price will hit $200,000 this year is a losing proposition, as these things are unpredictable,' says the author. 'But it's always a good idea to figure out key risk factors that could get in the way.'

**Will Bitcoin Reach $200K? 10x Research Shares BTC Price Prediction for 2025**
Analysts are predicting a significant price surge for Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025, with some forecasting a potential price of $200,000. Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, points to Bitcoin's recent performance and technical signals as evidence of a bullish trend. 'Gold and Bitcoin are entering a pivotal moment in the markets,' Thielen commented. Several macroeconomic factors, including easing inflation concerns and dovish Fed commentary, are contributing to the positive outlook. Other analysts, such as VanEck and Standard Chartered, have also made predictions for Bitcoin's price in 2025, with estimates ranging from $122,000 to $200,000. However, reaching $200,000 would require a continuation of bullish momentum and favorable macroeconomic conditions.
