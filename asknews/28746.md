**Morgan Stanley: Fiscal Concerns in Brazil Remain Despite Spending Freeze**
Morgan Stanley believes that fiscal concerns in Brazil have not decreased despite the government's announcement of a R$ 31.1 billion spending freeze. While the bank notes a positive point in the blocking of expenses of around R$ 10 billion, which is above the expected amount, they also mention the fact that the budget aims to reach the lower limit of the primary surplus target for this year. The economists at Morgan Stanley state, 'We continue to expect the government to meet the lower limit of the primary surplus target for 2025.' They also mention the increase in the IOF tax for various operations, such as credit to legal entities, international credit card, and private pension, which is expected to increase revenue by R$ 20.5 billion in 2025 and R$ 41 billion in 2026. However, the government has not presented any measures to reduce spending, according to the bank. 'Brazil's fiscal concerns are not decreasing and we see a low probability of a stabilizing primary surplus without structural reforms,' say the economists at Morgan. Despite this, the bank sees Brazil in a 'slightly better' situation compared to the global uncertainty context. They have improved their growth projections for the country, but worsened their inflation expectations for next year and now predict a more aggressive decline in interest rates in 2026.

**Brazil's Economic Growth: A Double-Edged Sword**
Brazil's employment and income data show a positive trend, with more people working and a record-high average income of R$ 3,057 in 2024. However, economists warn that this may have a negative impact on the economy, particularly on inflation. The main reason is that the increase in employment and income is driving up demand for services, which are a significant contributor to inflation. According to Cláudio Hamilton Matos dos Santos, a researcher at the Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (Ipea), 'the transfer of income to the poorer population generates demand for labor-intensive services.' This is evident in the services sector, which has created 52,4 thousand new jobs in March alone. However, Santos notes that this growth is not accompanied by an increase in productivity, which can lead to higher costs and inflation. Fernando de Holanda Barbosa Filho, a researcher at the Centro de Crescimento Econômico do Instituto Brasileiro de Economia da Fundação Getúlio Vargas (CCE/ IBRE-FGV), agrees that high salaries and a heated labor market are not inherently bad for the economy, but warns that the problem arises when the market's growth spreads to the rest of the economy, causing a demand shock. The Banco Central is using high interest rates to control demand and keep prices stable, maintaining the Selic rate at 14.75%. However, the government is also implementing other strategies to stimulate the economy, such as releasing consigned loans and providing benefits.

**Brazil's Interest Rates Decline Amid Government's Containment of R$31.3 Billion in Spending**
Brazil's government announced a containment of R$31.3 billion in spending, which led to a decline in interest rates, but the introduction of changes to the IOF (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras) created market noise. The DI (Depósito Interfinanceiro) interest rates for January 2026 and 2027 showed modest declines, while the rates for longer-term contracts, such as January 2031 and 2033, showed significant increases. However, as the market digested the details of the government's report, the rates began to decline further, with some reaching zero. According to Flavio Serrano, chief economist at Bmg, 'In the first moment, it seemed like a greater fiscal effort. Later, agents evaluated that the effective result of revenues and expenses was worse than budgeted.' The government's decision to release details about the IOF change after 17h created speculation in the market, with one source citing 'lack of clarity' and another source noting that some investors decided to take profits, buying back the tax, fearing 'something bad' from the IOF. The government aims to maintain a zero primary result in 2025, with a tolerance margin of 0.25% of the country's GDP. The fiscal question is a key factor in the market's evaluation of the future of inflation and monetary policy in Brazil.

**Central Bank Decides to Lower Interest Rate by 100 Basis Points**
The Central Bank has decided to lower the interest rate by 100 basis points to 24.50%. This decision is a reflection of the latest economic developments and expectations since the previous Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Globally, growth expectations have declined since the April meeting, mainly due to the ongoing developments in global trade policies and the possibility of further disruptions in supply chains. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have adopted a more cautious approach in managing their monetary policies amidst ongoing uncertainty about economic growth and inflation. In terms of global commodity prices, oil prices are still driven by supply and demand factors, while agricultural commodity prices have seen a less pronounced decline due to climate-related risks. Despite the decline in inflationary pressures, the upward risks surrounding inflation continue, including the exacerbation of geo-political tensions and the ongoing disruptions in global trade policies. Locally, preliminary indicators for the first quarter of 2025 suggest a continued recovery in economic activity, with expected real GDP growth of 5.0% compared to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Estimates of the output gap indicate that real GDP is still below its potential, despite the ongoing growth in economic activity, suggesting that demand-driven inflationary pressures will remain limited. This is consistent with the expected downward trend in inflation in the short term, supported by the current monetary policy stance. However, it is expected that economic activity will reach its potential by the end of the fiscal year 2025/2026. In terms of the labor market, the unemployment rate has seen a slight decline to 6.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The annual inflation rate has seen a sharp decline in the first quarter of 2025, mainly due to the decline in inflationary pressures, the effectiveness of the monetary policy tightening, and the positive impact of the base period, as well as the gradual disappearance of the impact of previous shocks. By April 2025, both the annual general and basic inflation rates had stabilized at 13.9% and 10.4%, respectively, mainly due to the moderation of monthly inflation developments as a result of the decline in food prices, which contributed to reducing the impact of the increase in non-food inflation due to administratively determined price movements. Given that the pressures resulting from these movements are of a temporary nature, the implicit inflation continued to take a downward trend since the beginning of the year, gradually converging towards its consistent level with the Central Bank's target for the fourth quarter of 2026. The slowdown in general and basic inflation, as well as the decline in implicit inflation, indicate an improvement in inflation expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the annual general inflation rate will continue to decline during the remaining period of 2025 and 2026, although the measures to control public finances implemented in 2025, as well as the relative stability of non-food inflation, will slow down the pace of this decline. It is worth noting that the intensity of the upward risks surrounding inflation has declined compared to the April meeting, mainly due to the decline in trade tensions, the current exchange rate developments, and the return of the risk indicator to its normal level, allowing for the continuation of the monetary easing cycle that began at the previous meeting. However, the upward risks remain, represented by the effects of global trade policies, regional conflicts, and the exceeding of public finance control expectations. Based on the current monetary policy stance, the Monetary Policy Committee believes that lowering the Central Bank's interest rate by 100 basis points will achieve a balance between mitigating the prevailing risks and the available room for further monetary easing, while supporting the downward trend in inflation during the expected horizon of expectations. The Committee will continue to evaluate its decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, emphasizing that these decisions are based on the expectations and risks surrounding them, as well as any new data that may emerge. The Committee will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments, and will not hesitate to use all available tools to bring inflation to the target rate of 7% (±2 percentage points) in the average of the fourth quarter of 2026.

**Central Bank Decides to Lower Interest Rate by 100 Basis Points**
The Central Bank of the country has decided to lower the interest rate by 100 basis points, which is expected to have an impact on the products and savings certificates offered by banks. The decision comes as the Central Bank continues to lower interest rates for the second time this year. Following the previous decision to lower interest rates, many banks have decided to lower the returns on savings certificates, indicating that there may be further decisions regarding the certificates that customers will purchase during the current period. The global economic outlook has been affected by the developments in global trade policies and the possibility of further disruptions in supply chains. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have adopted a more cautious approach to monetary policy. The prices of essential commodities are still driven by supply and demand factors, with oil prices being influenced by supply and demand expectations. The prices of essential agricultural commodities have seen a less severe decline due to climate-related risks. Despite the decline in inflationary pressures, the upward risks surrounding inflation remain, including the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the continuation of disruptions in global trade policies. On the local front, preliminary indicators for the first quarter of 2025 suggest a continued recovery in economic activity, with a growth rate of 5.0% expected for the national gross domestic product, compared to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The expected gap in the national gross domestic product suggests that the economy is still below its potential, despite the continued growth in economic activity, indicating that inflationary pressures from demand will remain limited. This is consistent with the expected downward trend in inflation in the short term, which is supported by the current monetary policy. However, it is expected that the economy will reach its potential by the end of the 2025/2026 fiscal year. In terms of the labor market, the unemployment rate has seen a slight decline, reaching 6.3% in the first quarter of 2025, compared to 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The annual inflation rate has seen a sharp decline in the first quarter of 2025, which is attributed to the decline in inflationary pressures, the effectiveness of monetary policy, and the positive impact of the base period, as well as the gradual decline in the impact of previous shocks. By April 2025, the annual inflation rate and the core inflation rate stabilized at 13.9% and 10.4%, respectively, due to the moderation in monthly inflation developments, which was driven by the decline in food prices, which contributed to reducing the impact of the increase in non-food inflation due to administratively determined price movements. Given that these pressures are of a temporary nature, the implicit inflation continued to take a downward trend since the beginning of the year, gradually converging towards its consistent level with the Central Bank's target for the fourth quarter of 2026. The slowdown in general and core inflation, as well as the decline in implicit inflation, indicate an improvement in inflation expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the annual inflation rate will continue to decline during the remaining period of 2025 and 2026, although fiscal control measures implemented in 2025, as well as the relative stability of non-food inflation, will slow down the pace of this decline. It is worth noting that the severity of upward risks surrounding inflation has decreased compared to the Central Bank's meeting in April, due to the decline in trade tensions, the current exchange rate developments, and the return of the risk indicator to its normal level, allowing for the continuation of the monetary easing cycle that began in the previous meeting. However, the upward risks remain, including the effects of global trade policies, regional conflicts, and exceeding the expectations of fiscal control measures. Based on the current monetary policy, the Monetary Policy Committee believes that lowering the basic interest rate by 100 basis points will achieve a balance between mitigating the prevailing risks and the available room to move forward in the monetary easing cycle, while supporting the downward trend in inflation during the expected time horizon. The committee will continue to evaluate its decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, emphasizing that these decisions are based on the expectations and risks surrounding them, as well as any new data that may emerge. The committee will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments and will not hesitate to use all available tools to bring inflation to the target rate of 7% (±2 percentage points) in the average for the fourth quarter of 2026.

**Central Bank of Egypt Decides to Lower Interest Rates by 1% on Deposits and Loans**
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to lower interest rates by 1% on deposits and loans for one night, and the main bank rate by 100 basis points to 24.00%, 25.00%, and 24.50%, respectively. This decision is a reflection of the latest economic developments and expectations since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The committee noted that global growth expectations have declined since the previous meeting, mainly due to the ongoing trade policy developments and the possibility of further disruptions in global supply chains. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have adopted a more cautious approach in managing their monetary policies, amidst ongoing uncertainty about the economic growth and inflation outlook. The committee also noted that the global prices of essential commodities remain driven by supply and demand factors, with oil prices being influenced by supply and expectations of a decline in global demand. The prices of essential agricultural commodities have shown a less pronounced decline due to climate-related risks. Despite the decline in inflationary pressures, the upside risks to inflation remain, including the exacerbation of geo-political tensions and the continuation of trade policy disruptions. On the domestic front, preliminary indicators for the first quarter of 2025 suggest a continued recovery in economic activity, with expected real GDP growth of around 5.0% compared to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The committee expects the real GDP to remain below its potential despite the ongoing growth in economic activity, indicating that inflationary pressures from demand will remain limited. This is consistent with the expected downward trend in inflation in the short term, which is supported by the current monetary policy stance. However, it is expected that economic activity will reach its potential by the end of the fiscal year 2025/2026.

Given that these pressures are of a temporary nature, the implicit inflation has continued to follow a downward trend since the beginning of the year, gradually converging towards its consistent level with the bank's target for the fourth quarter of 2026. The slowdown in the general and core inflation rates, as well as the decline in implicit inflation, indicate an improvement in inflation expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the annual inflation rate will continue to decline during the remainder of 2025 and 2026, although the fiscal adjustments implemented in 2025, as well as the relative stability in non-food inflation, will slow down the pace of this decline. It is worth noting that the upside risks surrounding inflation expectations have declined compared to the April meeting, mainly due to the decline in trade tensions, the current exchange rate developments, and the return of the risk indicator to its normal level, allowing for the continuation of the monetary easing cycle that began at the previous meeting. However, the upside risks remain, including the effects of trade protectionism globally, the escalation of regional conflicts, and the exceeding of fiscal adjustments expectations. Based on the current monetary policy stance, the Monetary Policy Committee believes that reducing the central bank's basic interest rates by 100 basis points will achieve a balance between mitigating the prevailing risks and allowing for further progress in the monetary easing cycle, while supporting the downward trend in inflation during the expected time horizon. The committee will continue to evaluate its decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, emphasizing that these decisions are based on expectations and risks surrounding them, as well as any new data that may emerge. The committee will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments and will not hesitate to use all available tools to bring inflation to the target rate of 7% (±2 percentage points) in the average of the fourth quarter of 2026.

**'Year of Predictive Mirages' - Expert on Russian Economy in 2025**
Anton Tabakh, an expert, said that the probabilities of development scenarios have changed since the publication of the RA Expert report. The key question is what will happen with monetary policy and how far the Central Bank will go with its cooling measures. Inflation has slowed down, and the ruble has strengthened significantly, which has a big impact on consumption, especially for the more affluent citizens and businesses, and to a lesser extent for the poor. The Central Bank is likely to lower interest rates in the near future, with a possible change in rhetoric in June and the first rate cut in July. The expected inflation rate at the end of the year is 6-6.5%, with a Central Bank rate of 18%. Even in a positive scenario, the real interest rate will remain very high. There is a possibility of a scenario where the economy slows down even further, requiring a faster rate cut, but this is unlikely due to high government spending and inflationary expectations. A high probability of interest rate rigidity is possible only if there are some very negative shocks on the external contour. The budget's income in 2024 increased by more than a quarter, which is an optimistic factor for the 2025 budget. However, the progress of the progressive tax on citizens' income has played a minor role so far, as it mainly brings money to the regions and will only be received by the budget at the end of the year. The economy remains mostly market-based, but with a high share of the state sector. After the growth of the state sector since the beginning of the pandemic and in 2022, it has now stabilized. In the case of a decrease in geopolitical tensions, the share of the state sector will likely be adjusted downward. Inflation expectations are for a decrease, but the question is how sustainable this decrease will be. If inflation drops from 10% to 6-6.5%, the question is whether it will stay there or go further. The Central Bank wants to strictly bring it down to target levels, possibly below 4%, which may require maintaining high interest rates for a long time.

Given that these pressures are of a temporary nature, the implicit inflation continued to take a downward trend since the beginning of the year, gradually converging towards its consistent level with the Central Bank's target for the fourth quarter of 2026. The slowdown in general and core inflation, as well as the decline in implicit inflation, indicate an improvement in inflation expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the annual inflation rate will continue to decline during the remaining period of 2025 and 2026, although fiscal control measures implemented in 2025, as well as the relative stability of non-food inflation, will slow down the pace of this decline. It is worth noting that the severity of upward risks surrounding inflation has decreased compared to the Central Bank's meeting in April, due to the decline in trade tensions, the current exchange rate developments, and the return of the risk indicator to its normal level, allowing for the continuation of the monetary easing cycle that began in the previous meeting. However, the upward risks remain, including the effects of global trade policies, regional conflicts, and exceeding the expectations of fiscal control measures. Based on the current monetary policy, the Monetary Policy Committee believes that lowering the basic interest rate by 100 basis points will achieve a balance between mitigating the prevailing risks and the available room to move forward in the monetary easing cycle, while supporting the downward trend in inflation during the expected time horizon. The committee will continue to evaluate its decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, emphasizing that these decisions are based on the expectations and risks surrounding them, as well as any new data that may emerge. The committee will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments and will not hesitate to use all available tools to bring inflation to the target rate of 7% (±2 percentage points) in the average for the fourth quarter of 2026.

**Central Bank of Egypt Decides to Lower Interest Rate by 1% on a Slower Pace**
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to lower the interest rate by 1% on a slower pace than the previous meeting. According to the Central Bank's report, the interest rate on overnight deposits and lending, as well as the main operation rate of the bank, decreased by 100 basis points to 24%, 25%, and 24.50%, respectively. This decision reflects the latest developments and economic expectations since the previous Central Bank meeting. The Central Bank explained that global growth expectations have decreased since the April meeting, mainly due to the ongoing developments in global trade policies and the possibility of further disruptions in supply chains. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have adopted a more cautious approach in managing their monetary policies, given the ongoing uncertainty about economic growth and inflation prospects. In terms of global commodity prices, oil prices are still driven by supply and demand factors, as well as expectations of a decline in global demand. Regarding global prices of basic agricultural commodities, the decline was less pronounced due to climate-related risks. Despite the decline in inflationary pressures, the upward risks surrounding inflation remain, including the exacerbation of geo-political tensions and the continuation of trade policy disruptions, according to the Central Bank's statement. On the domestic front, the Central Bank stated that preliminary indicators for the first quarter of 2025 indicate a continued recovery in economic activity, with expected real GDP growth of around 5% compared to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The estimates of the output gap suggest that real GDP is still below its potential, despite the ongoing growth in economic activity, indicating that inflationary pressures from demand will remain limited. This is consistent with the expected downward trend in inflation in the short term, which is supported by the current monetary conditions. However, it is expected that economic activity will reach its potential by the end of the fiscal year 2025/2026. In terms of the labor market, the unemployment rate has decreased slightly to 6.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The annual inflation rate has decreased sharply in the first quarter of 2025, mainly due to the decline in the intensity of inflationary pressures, the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening, and the positive impact of the base period, as well as the gradual disappearance of the impact of previous shocks. By April 2025, both the annual general and basic inflation rates stabilized at 13.9% and 10.4%, respectively, mainly due to the moderation of monthly inflation developments, resulting from the decline in food prices, which contributed to reducing the impact of the increase in non-food inflation due to administratively determined price movements. Given that these pressures are of a temporary nature, the implicit inflation has continued to take a downward trend since the beginning of the year, gradually converging towards its consistent level with the Central Bank's target for the fourth quarter of 2026. The slowdown in general and basic inflation, as well as the decline in implicit inflation, indicate an improvement in inflation expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the annual general inflation rate will continue to decline during the remainder of 2025 and 2026, although the implementation of fiscal policy adjustments in 2025, as well as the relative stability of non-food inflation, will slow down the pace of this decline. It is worth noting that the intensity of upward risks surrounding inflation has decreased compared to the April meeting, mainly due to the decline in trade tensions, the current exchange rate developments, and the return of the risk indicator to its normal level, allowing for the continuation of the monetary easing cycle that began in the previous meeting. However, the upward risks remain, including the effects of protectionist trade policies globally, regional conflicts, and exceeding the expectations of fiscal policy adjustments. Based on the current monetary conditions, the Monetary Policy Committee believes that lowering the bank's basic interest rates by 100 basis points will achieve a balance between mitigating the prevailing risks and the available room for moving forward in the monetary easing cycle, while supporting the downward trend in inflation during the expected time horizon. The committee will continue to evaluate its decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, emphasizing that these decisions are based on expectations and risks surrounding them, as well as any new data that may emerge. The committee will continue to closely monitor economic and financial developments, and will not hesitate to use all available tools to bring inflation to the target rate of 7% (±2 percentage points) in the average of the fourth quarter of 2026.

**Central Bank of Egypt Decides to Lower Interest Rates by 1% on Deposits and Loans**
The Central Bank of Egypt decided to lower interest rates by 1% on deposits and loans for one night, and the main bank rate by 100 basis points to 24.00%, 25.00%, and 24.50%, respectively. This decision is a reflection of the latest economic developments and expectations since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The committee noted that global growth expectations have declined since the previous meeting, mainly due to the ongoing trade policy developments and the possibility of further disruptions in global supply chains. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have adopted a more cautious approach in managing their monetary policies, amidst ongoing uncertainty about the economic growth and inflation outlook. The committee also noted that the global prices of essential commodities remain driven by supply and demand factors, with oil prices being influenced by supply and expectations of a decline in global demand. The prices of essential agricultural commodities have shown a less pronounced decline due to climate-related risks. Despite the decline in inflationary pressures, the upside risks to inflation remain, including the exacerbation of geo-political tensions and the continuation of trade policy disruptions. On the domestic front, preliminary indicators for the first quarter of 2025 suggest a continued recovery in economic activity, with expected real GDP growth of around 5.0% compared to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

This is consistent with the expected downward trend in inflation in the short term, which is supported by the current monetary policy stance. However, it is expected that economic activity will reach its potential by the end of the fiscal year 2025/2026. In terms of the labor market, the unemployment rate has shown a slight decline to 6.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The annual inflation rate has shown a sharp decline in the first quarter of 2025, mainly due to the decline in inflationary pressures, the effectiveness of monetary policy tightening, and the positive impact of the interest rate cut, as well as the gradual decline in the impact of previous shocks. By April 2025, the annual inflation rate and the core inflation rate had stabilized at 13.9% and 10.4%, respectively, mainly due to the moderation in monthly inflation developments, driven by the decline in food prices, which contributed to reducing the impact of the increase in non-food inflation due to administered price adjustments. Given that these pressures are of a temporary nature, the implicit inflation has continued to follow a downward trend since the beginning of the year, gradually converging towards its consistent level with the bank's target for the fourth quarter of 2026. The slowdown in the general and core inflation rates, as well as the decline in implicit inflation, indicate an improvement in inflation expectations. Therefore, it is expected that the annual inflation rate will continue to decline during the remainder of 2025 and 2026, although the fiscal adjustments implemented in 2025, as well as the relative stability in non-food inflation, will slow down the pace of this decline.

**Central Bank of Egypt Cuts Interest Rates by 100 Basis Points**
The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Egypt decided to lower the interest rates by 100 basis points to 24.00%, 25.00%, and 24.50% for overnight deposit and lending, and the main operation of the central bank. This decision is a reflection of the latest economic developments and expectations since the previous Monetary Policy Committee meeting. The committee cited the global economic slowdown, trade tensions, and the uncertainty surrounding the economic growth and inflation outlook.

The unemployment rate has decreased slightly to 6.3% in the first quarter of 2025, compared to 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

**Turkey's Central Bank Announces Inflation Expectations for 2025, 2026, and 2027**
Turkey's Central Bank President Fatih Karahan announced the second Inflation Report for 2025, which includes inflation expectations for 2025, 2026, and 2027. The inflation expectations for 2025 remain unchanged at 24%, 2026 at 12%, and 2027 at 8%. Karahan stated, 'We took proactive steps in response to the recent market volatility. We will continue to maintain our firm stance in monetary policy to ensure the continuation of de-inflation. The uncertainty in global trade and economic policies remains high. Financial market volatility has increased. As a result of our tight monetary policy, the composition of demand has become more balanced. The de-inflation process continues uninterrupted. The inflation rate for goods is at low levels. On the other hand, this process has been accompanied by an increase in uncertainty in recent periods. Consumer inflation decreased to 37.9% in April, a significant drop from the peak in May 2024. Preliminary data suggests that this trend will continue in May. Domestic demand has lost momentum, but it has been higher than expected. We are continuing to receive the results of our tight monetary policy in a gradual manner. Industrial and service production increased in the first quarter. We expect the current account deficit to GDP ratio to be slightly higher in 2025 compared to 2024, but below the long-term averages. The inflation reduction process continues. Energy commodity prices have recently shown a significant decline. The effect of the demand conditions on inflation has decreased in the first quarter. Inflation expectations are above our de-inflation path and continue to rise. This view requires us to maintain our firm and stable stance in monetary policy. The measures we have taken have reduced market volatility. Financial conditions remain tight. There has been a significant decrease in KKM accounts. Portfolio preferences have been limited to foreign exchange. Our firm stance in monetary policy supports our reserves. Inflation is expected to decrease to 24% in 2025, 12% in 2026, and 8% in 2027. We aim to stabilize inflation at 5% in the medium term after it decreases to 8% in 2027. Due to the increasing uncertainty in recent periods, we have maintained our 2025 forecast range at 19-29%. The forecast range for 2026 is 6-18%. In the 2025 forecast update, upward and downward effects balanced each other. With our cautious stance, we expect inflation to continue to decline in the coming period. In fact, our firm stance in monetary policy will continue to strengthen the de-inflation process through the stabilization of domestic demand, the real appreciation of the Turkish lira, and the improvement in inflation expectations. As expectations decline again and the decline in service inflation continues, the decline in inflation will continue throughout the rest of 2025. The increased synchronization of monetary and fiscal policies will also contribute to this process. To summarize, we will continue to maintain our firm stance in monetary policy until inflation and price stability are achieved.'

**Brazil's Central Bank Lowers Economic Growth Projection for 2025**
The Central Bank of Brazil has reduced its projection of economic growth for 2025 to 1.9%. According to the Monetary Policy Report, the bank's decision is based on the country's economic slowdown in the fourth quarter of last year, which saw a 0.2% increase. The report states, 'The slowdown was more pronounced in sectors sensitive to the economic cycle, in family consumption and in the formation of fixed capital.' The bank also notes that the economy is being impacted by the high interest rates of 14.25% applied to control inflation. This projection is lower than the government's expectation of 2.3% growth this year. In 2024, the Brazilian economy grew by 3.4%. The report also states that the expectations of economists for inflation have worsened for this and the next years, remaining above the 3% inflation target. According to the bank, inflation in the country will end 2025 at 5.1%, above the target, with a tolerance of 1.5% above or below. The report projects that inflation will continue above the tolerance limit throughout 2025, starting to fall in the fourth quarter, but still remaining above the target. In this scenario, the bank projects that the accumulated inflation in four quarters in Brazil will be between 5.5% and 5.6% in the first three quarters of 2025, falling to 5.1% at the end of the year, 3.7% in 2026, and 3.1% in the third quarter of 2027. The Central Bank of Brazil also predicts an inflation rate of 3.9% in the third quarter of 2026.

**OECD Lowers Brazil's Economic Growth Forecast Due to High Interest Rates and Trade Barriers**
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has reduced its forecast for Brazil's economic growth in 2025 and 2026. The OECD now predicts a 2.1% growth rate for 2025, down from 2.3%, and a 1.4% growth rate for 2026, down from 1.9%. The organization cites 'higher trade barriers' and 'increased geopolitical and policy uncertainties' as factors contributing to the moderation of the global economy. The OECD also expects the global growth rate to decrease from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026. In contrast, the OECD has increased its inflation forecast for Brazil, predicting a 5.4% inflation rate in 2025 and a 5.3% inflation rate in 2026. The OECD notes that the Central Bank has raised interest rates to 'ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored.' The organization also highlights that the unemployment rate is 'particularly low' in Brazil and Turkey, compared to the 2018-2019 period, which was before the pandemic.

**Brazil's Inflation and Economic Growth Projections Reduced**
Economists have reduced their projections for inflation, dollar, and economic growth in Brazil. According to the latest Boletim Focus, released by the Central Bank, the estimate for the IPCA inflation rate in 2025 has decreased from 5.68% to 5.66%. The projection for inflation in 2026 has increased from 4.40% to 4.48%, while for 2027 it remains at 4.00%. The estimate for 2028 has increased from 3.75% to 3.78%. Despite the revision, inflation remains far from the 4.5% ceiling set by the National Monetary Council. Brazil has already exceeded the inflation ceiling in 2024, which accumulated a 4.83% increase. The Central Bank attributed the breach of the inflation ceiling to strong economic growth, real devaluation, and climatic factors. The median projection for the GDP in 2025 has decreased from 2.01% to 1.99%, as well as for 2026, which has passed from 1.70% to 1.60%. The projections for 2027 and 2028 remain unchanged, both at 2%. The expectation for the dollar in 2025 has also been reduced, falling from R$ 5.99 to R$ 5.98. For 2026, the estimate remains at R$ 6. The projection for 2027 and 2028 remains at R$ 5.90 and R$ 5.90, respectively. The median for the basic interest rate (Selic) has remained stable at 15% this year. Currently, the rate is at 13.25%, a value fixed after the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) in January. The expectation is for a new increase of 100 basis points in the next meeting, which will take place on Wednesday (19). For the end of 2026, the projection has been maintained at 12.50% per year, and for 2027, at 10.50%. For 2028, the estimate is 10%.

**Brazil's Economy in 2025: A Challenging Year Ahead**
Brazil's economy in 2025 is expected to be different from 2023 and 2024, when it was driven by a 2% increase in public spending, according to Samuel Pessoa, a researcher and professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. When Lula took office, the economy was already operating at full capacity, so the increased spending pushed up inflation, Pessoa warns. He believes that Lula's decision to increase public spending was a 'political strategy' in a polarized social context where he risked not completing his term. The economy grew 3.4% in 2024, and inflation was nearly 5%, 'far from the forecasts.' In 2025, an expansion of 2% and an inflation of 6% is expected. However, Pessoa thinks that the situation is not as bad as to prevent Lula from being a strong candidate in the 2026 elections. According to Pessoa, the economy will grow 2% in 2025, inflation will be 6%, and the interest rate will increase to 15%. The economy will also experience a strong deceleration, with the cíclica component growing 1.5% and the exógena component growing 4%. For 2026, Pessoa estimates that the economy will grow 2%, inflation will decrease to 5-5.5%, and the interest rate will start to decrease. Lula's chances of re-election depend on his ability to manage the economy and his popularity, which is currently high but may decrease due to the economic situation.

**Brazil's Economy Grows, but High Inflation Rate Raises Concerns**
Brazil's economy has grown for the fourth consecutive year, but the high inflation rate above the target is a major concern. The inflation rate of 4.83% in 2023, above the target of 3% and the ceiling of 4.5%, indicates that the country may not be able to sustain this level of growth, particularly driven by family consumption. The high demand has put pressure on inflation, forcing the Central Bank to raise interest rates and slow down economic activity. According to the IBGE, family consumption has been the main driver of economic growth in recent years, but this has led to high prices and a subsequent shock of interest rates. The data also shows a decrease in the savings rate to 14.5% of GDP, the lowest since 2019, which is related to the growth driven by consumption, both by families and the government, which 'burns' savings, leaving fewer resources available for investment. The country's external vulnerability has increased, with the current account deficit rising from 1.12% of GDP in 2023 to 2.55% in 2024, which has led to a weakening of the real against the dollar. The government's decision to allow the economy to slow down to reduce inflation or to announce measures to stimulate consumption is a major question mark for 2025. If the government chooses the path of consumption, the consequence will be an increase in the smoke coming out of the engine, via higher inflation.

**Haddad: ‘Growth with low inflation is our obsession’**
Brazil's Finance Minister, Fernando Haddad, stated in an interview that the country's economic situation under the Lula government is better than the one inherited from the previous government, where the base interest rate (Selic) was around 25% and inflation reached 12%. Currently, the INPC accumulated over the last 12 months is 4.56% and the interest rate is fixed at 13.25%. Haddad believes that the panorama will improve with the approval of the 2025 Budget, which is waiting for voting in the National Congress. 'Approved the Budget, in the medium term we will have lower interest rates, without penalizing the population, including producers, who depend on the State,' said the minister. He also stated that the budget is balanced and gives conditions for sustainable growth. 'It's ready to be approved,' he guaranteed. Haddad expressed confidence in the work of Congress for the approval of the budget, highlighting that the deputies and senators had an important role in voting projects and measures necessary for the control of expenses and maintenance of investments. According to him, the budget reflects the economic direction of the Lula government: 'Growth with low inflation is our obsession,' he said. Haddad also pointed out that the primary deficit of the Government in 2024 was 0.09% of the PIB, close to zero, signaling the real concern with the balance of public accounts. This set will favor both a more intense drop in inflation and the reduction of the base interest rate, argues the Minister of Finance. The Minister also stated that the Government has been expanding the values and mechanisms of the Plano Safra, and that this policy will be maintained, with the intention of expanding food production, ensuring supply and reducing prices. Haddad clarified that the Plano Safra 2025 will not have interruptions, despite the National Treasury having requested the suspension of credits, motivated by the non-approval of the 2025 Union Budget. According to a note from the Ministry of Finance, the ministry will send a letter to the Court of Auditors of the Union in search of technical and legal support for the immediate resumption of the credit lines with equalized resources from the Plano Safra 24/25. The note continues: 'The lines were suspended by the National Treasury due to legal necessity, due to the non-approval of the Annual Budget Law (LOA) 2025. It is worth noting that the Pronaf, which serves small farmers, continues to operate.'

**Brazil Reduces Growth Projections and Raises Inflation Expectations for 2025**
The Brazilian government has announced a significant revision of its economic projections for this year. The expected GDP growth rate has been reduced to 2.3%, down from the previous 2.5%. This adjustment reflects the continuation of the monetary tightening policy adopted by the government to combat inflation, which has also been revised upwards. The inflation rate expected for 2025 is now 4.8%, higher than the 3.6% projected at the end of last year. According to the Secretary of Economic Policy, Guilherme Mello, the policies implemented must have a sectoral impact, but will not compromise the macroeconomic performance. The inflation of 4.8% for this year is mainly due to the delayed effects of the exchange rate depreciation and the persistence of inflation, which does not disappear immediately after price stabilization. The government remains optimistic, believing that despite the global economic difficulties, Brazil can navigate these turbulences with a resilient economy, especially if monetary and fiscal policies continue to be adjusted according to needs.

**Brazil Lowers 2025 GDP Growth Forecast Amid Inflation and Global Pressures**
The Brazilian Ministry of Finance lowered its 2025 GDP growth forecast from 2.5% to 2.3%, citing higher interest rates and global economic challenges. Officials linked the downward revision to tighter monetary policy, which raised borrowing costs, and external uncertainties such as slower global growth. The inflation estimate exceeds the central bank’s target, reflecting persistent price pressures in the economy. Market analysts remain skeptical of the government’s inflation forecast, projecting a higher rate of 5.58% for 2025. Despite these challenges, Brazil’s labor market showed resilience in 2024, with unemployment dropping to 6.6%.

**Brazil's Inflation Rate Drops to 4.56% in January 2025**
Brazil's inflation rate, the largest economy in Latin America, decreased to 4.56% in January 2025, down 0.27 percentage points from December, according to the government. The prices rose by only 0.16% in the first month of 2025, the lowest percentage for January since 1994, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The national consumer price index (IPCA) moderated significantly compared to December 2024 (0.52%) and January 2024 (0.42%). Housing prices, including residential energy, fell by 3% in January, which contained the increases in transportation (+1.30%) and food (+0.96%). The government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is studying measures to contain inflation, particularly in the food sector, at a time when the executive's popularity indices are declining. The data reflects the deceleration of the Brazilian economy in the second half of 2024, hindered by factors such as the cycle of interest rate hikes promoted by the Central Bank to control price escalation. The Central Bank has raised interest rates by one point to 13.25% annual, and has reaffirmed that it will continue to raise them due to the upward trend of inflation, the country's fiscal situation, and international uncertainty. The financial market predicts that the basic interest rate will close 2025 at 15% annual, and estimates that Brazilian inflation will end the year at 5.58%, exceeding the target of 4.50% for this year.

**Brazilian Economists Raise Inflation Expectations for 2025 and 2026**
Economists have raised their inflation expectations for 2025 and 2026, according to the Focus report released by the Central Bank on January 27. The inflation forecast for 2025 increased from 5.08% to 5.50%, remaining above the target ceiling. For 2026, the projection also rose, from 4.10% to 4.22%, marking the fifth consecutive increase. The Central Bank is closely monitoring the inflation target, which is based on the 12-month accumulated inflation rate. If it remains outside the tolerance interval for six consecutive months, it will be considered unfulfilled. The revisions reinforce the challenging scenario faced by the Brazilian economy, with persistent inflationary pressures requiring a careful calibration of monetary policy. Despite the growing projections for inflation, the market maintained a stable forecast for the Selic interest rate at the end of 2024, at 15%. This estimate reflects the expectation that the Central Bank will continue with a rigorous monetary policy, especially after raising interest rates to 12.25% at the end of 2024 and signaling a new increase in early 2025. For 2026, the forecast for interest rates rose from 12.25% to 12.50%, while for 2027, the rate was adjusted from 10.25% to 10.38%. This trajectory suggests that the market expects a gradual deceleration in interest rates, but without giving up on a high plateau to contain inflationary pressures. The market also revised its forecast for GDP growth for 2025, increasing it from 2.04% to 2.06%, reflecting the positive impact of data released by the IBGE, which showed a 0.9% growth in the third quarter of 2024, above market expectations. For 2026, however, the projection for GDP growth was adjusted downward, from 1.77% to 1.72%, reinforcing the view that the economy will face more significant challenges in the coming years, with a focus on the impact of high interest rates on consumption and investments.
