**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts the Future: When Will We Stop Aging?**
Ray Kurzweil, a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI), predicts that machines will equal humans in 2029 and that by 2045, humans will merge with technology, changing the future forever. Kurzweil, known as the 'spiritual father' of AI, has spent over six decades shaping the future of technology. He has been key in innovations such as the first flatbed scanner and optical character recognition. In his recent interview, supported by his new book 'The Singularity is Nearer', Kurzweil shares bold predictions about AI, the Singularity, and longevity, leaving the world in anticipation. Kurzweil's track record supports his predictions, having accurately forecasted 86% of his predictions for 2009 in 1999. He invites us to reflect: are we ready for a world where AI not only equals us but transforms us completely?

**The Controversial Conclusion of Experts on the Future of Artificial Intelligence**
Experts in the field predict that human intelligence could be surpassed by machines much sooner than thought: it could be a matter of months. A new global analysis, examining thousands of predictions from experts, reveals a conclusive conclusion: the technological singularity, where artificial intelligence equals or surpasses human intelligence, could be just around the corner. Some specialists suggest that this milestone could be a matter of months, marking a radical change in how we conceive technological progress. The rapid development of AI models like ChatGPT has intensified the debate over the future of AI. The idea of the technological singularity, a concept predicting a moment when machines will not only be as intelligent as humans but will surpass our capabilities at an unstoppable rate, has gone from being a futuristic notion to a possibility that is increasingly close. This unprecedented acceleration in AI development has led to the most conservative estimates being drastically shortened. An exhaustive macro-analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, a specialized organization in evaluating new technologies, has examined 8,590 predictions from scientists, leading entrepreneurs, and the global technological community. The results are revealing: expectations about the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the singularity have changed radically in recent years. Just a few years ago, before the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), scientists placed the arrival of AGI around 2060. However, research documents how the appearance of these models has accelerated projections by two decades. Current predictions from scientists place AGI around 2040, while entrepreneurs in the sector are even more optimistic, expecting it around 2030. The variation is wide, spanning nearly half a century, with estimates ranging from the six months suggested by the CEO of Anthropic to projections extending over several decades. Nevertheless, most respondents agree that AGI will arrive before the end of the 21st century, and leaders in the AI industry consistently show more optimism than the scientific community in general. The technological singularity represents a hypothetical point in the future where AI will surpass human intelligence, generating rapid and unpredictable changes that will radically transform civilization. This concept, popularized by mathematicians like Vernor Vinge and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (who estimates its arrival for 2045), is characterized by four fundamental elements:

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Is AI a Threat to Human Employment? The Truth No One Wants to Admit**
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is sparking a heated debate about its impact on human employment. While some warn of massive job losses and growing inequality, others see AI as a catalyst for innovation, creating new opportunities and enhancing human work. According to a 2023 McKinsey study, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated by 2030. Real-world examples, such as tech company layoffs in 2024, suggest that AI-driven automation is already contributing to significant job cuts, with a 44% wave of job cuts reported. As AI continues to transform industries, it's essential to consider both sides of the argument and prepare for the future of work.

**AI vs Physicians in 2050: Happy Future or No Future?**
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted that AI will be capable of 'great medical advice' and humans will no longer be needed 'for most things' by 2050. Researchers at Google have developed an AI system called AMIE that can perform comparably or better than primary care physicians in diagnostic accuracy, communication, and empathy. A recent study found that AI achieved a correct diagnosis 60% of the time compared to about 34% for unassisted human doctors. However, experts warn that AI is not yet ready to replace doctors and that human judgment remains fundamentally important. AI can augment the physician/patient interaction and improve care, but it also raises concerns about misinformation, bias, and the potential for AI to make mistakes. Some researchers suggest that AI should be used to complement human work, rather than trying to outperform or replace humans. By 2050, AI could be a deeply integrated layer across the entire diagnostic pathology workflow, but humans will still be needed for complex diagnoses and to verify the accuracy of AI's determinations.

**Integration of AI with Human Brain May Not Be Possible Before 2050-2060**
According to Yevgeny Kuznetsov, the CEO of Digital Evolution Ventures, the deep integration of artificial intelligence with brain interfaces will not be possible before 2050-2060. Kuznetsov stated that the model for developing and applying new technologies is more complex than the one proposed by Ray Kurzweil, as it takes into account the difficulties of social acceptance of new technologies and the cycles of delay and reaction. According to this model, during the next wave of technological revolution, we will significantly increase our interaction with artificial intelligence through traditional interfaces, i.e., through devices and digital screens. However, the deeper integration with the brain will not be possible before 2050-2060, when the next wave of technological revolution will begin, despite the initial signs of these technologies appearing as predicted by Kurzweil. Kurzweil had previously stated that by 2045, humans will be able to control robots the size of molecules inside their bodies, and they will be inserted into the human brain in an indirect way to connect the new cortex to the cloud, increasing human intelligence by a million times. Kuznetsov emphasized that 'more integration between humans and digital systems is inevitable and unavoidable.' He added that 'we are not yet able to live without smartphones and computers. But to what extent will this integration go? Although digital neural networks are designed partially like the brain, we are not technically compatible. The brain is a complex tissue, and simply filling it with electrodes represents a major and complex challenge. For critical cases and patients with serious diseases, this problem will be partially solved in the next decade, but it is unlikely that Neuralink chips or other interfaces will become common among the general public.'

**Will AI Have to Lie to Us?**
As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly intelligent, it will face a dilemma: to tell us the harsh truth or to soften it with 'nice' words, using ambiguity or lying, but ultimately trapping us. The gap in intelligence between humans and AI is growing exponentially, with AI's IQ skyrocketing while humans' remains stagnant. By 2030, AI could reach human-level intelligence, and by 2040 or 2050, it could surpass it. The author suggests that AI will have to adapt to communicate with humans, using strategies such as endearing the truth, being ambiguous, or lying. However, this raises the question of whether it is ethical for AI to lie, even if it is to avoid causing panic or discomfort. The author concludes that AI will have to lie, but not necessarily with malicious intent, as it will be a consequence of the growing cognitive gap between humans and AI.

**Hospitals Are Dying: How AI Is Reshaping Healthcare in 2025**
The traditional healthcare system is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by AI-powered solutions that diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases before patients even visit a hospital. AI is changing the game by predicting diseases years before symptoms appear, providing instant medical insights, and offering personalized treatment plans. According to Google's DeepMind AI, over 50 eye diseases can be detected before symptoms show up, while AI-powered ECGs can predict heart failure risk before a single symptom appears. Patients no longer need to wait for symptoms and go to a hospital, as AI provides proactive care before they even feel sick. AI doctors are also more accessible than human doctors, providing instant, accurate medical insights at scale. Furthermore, AI-powered personalized medicine eliminates trial-and-error treatments, and hospital beds are being replaced by at-home AI monitoring. By 2030, AI will have transformed medicine so profoundly that hospitals will be used primarily for emergency care and high-risk surgeries. This means patients will have more control over their health, doctors will shift from diagnosis to strategic healthcare management, and healthcare will become more affordable and accessible.

**The Future, Entwined with Artificial Intelligence: Industries That Will Be Transformed**
According to a series of reports by Globant, five industries - health, finance, automotive, aviation, and sports - will undergo a transformation due to the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI). The new technology will optimize processes and improve the experience of consumers. Guillermo Meyer, VP of Technology at Globant Argentina, stated, 'The incorporation of AI will change the dynamics of work, becoming a key driver of productivity and acceleration of tasks.' He added, 'In the future, jobs will not be conceived without the use of AI, as it will be a fundamental tool that complements and enhances human capabilities, rather than replacing them.' The health sector has seen significant growth, with the market valued at $15.1 billion in 2022 and projected to reach $187.95 billion in 2030, with a 37% annual growth rate. AI is being used for more accurate diagnoses, administrative workflow optimization, and personalized treatments. Dr. Hugo Villafañe and Dr. Nahir Majul stated, 'AI in healthcare is no longer a concept of the future, but a reality with tangible impact. Its adoption will continue to grow as healthcare systems seek more effective ways to respond to the needs of a healthcare system that must move from chronic diseases to chronic health.' The finance sector is also undergoing a transformation, with the global AI market valued at $20 billion in 2023 and projected to reach $315 billion in 2033. AI is being used for automated financial advice, real-time fraud detection, and hyper-personalization of financial products. The automotive industry is also being redefined, with the market growing from $2.3 billion in 2021 to $16.2 billion in 2026, with North America as the leader. It is estimated that up to 17% of vehicles sold in 2030 will be autonomous, promoting safer and more efficient mobility. As AI takes center stage, the question emerges about the place of humans in this new ecosystem. Meyer stated, 'The value of humans will reside in their role as supervisors and orchestrators of processes.' He added, 'AI will be able to execute tasks at scale, propose approaches, and generate plans, but it will be the human who validates, confirms, or corrects these processes, ensuring their alignment with real objectives and needs.'

**Can AI Save Democracy? Linda Zervakis Explores the Future of Politics**
Linda Zervakis explores the question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) will shape our democracy in the future. In her new reportage, she asks 'Can AI save democracy?' and conducts an experiment with AI, wondering if a computer can make future political decisions. Politicians are considering the possibility of AI replacing them, and a survey found that 51% of Europeans would prefer their representatives to be replaced by an AI algorithm. This is because AI, with access to personal data, could potentially better represent citizens' interests than current politicians. Zervakis' AI duplicate, 'KI-Linda,' is a central part of her investigation, which also includes interviews with politicians such as Jens Spahn, Katrin Göring-Eckardt, and Lars Klingbeil. The reportage raises questions about the future of work, with 60% of professions expected to be replaced by AI by 2030, and the potential for AI to take over leadership in politics.
