**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Immortality May Be Possible in the Near Future, Experts Say**
Experts believe that immortality may be possible in the near future. According to experts, including Dr. Ian Pearson, Ray Kurzweil from Google, and biochemist Aubrey de Grey, there are theories for the future. Pearson predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will use advanced technologies to live forever, possibly by uploading their brains onto computers or robot bodies. Kurzweil believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a fusion between humans and machines that will lead to immortality by 2045. De Grey explains that medical advancements may make aging a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1,000 years or more. Pearson also envisions a world where medical treatments cure deadly diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, before they become fatal. Kurzweil predicts that artificial intelligence will bring about a transformation in society, making essential things like food and housing cheaper, and linking human brains to technology through devices like Neuralink.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**Healthy life now for healthy ageing**
According to current trends, people born in 2040 and beyond are expected to live longer than those who are in their 40s or younger today. The average life expectancy in Europe, Oceania, America, and Japan is close to 80 years, and in Malaysia, it is more than 74 years. Considering the increasing life spans, it is not unlikely that those in their 40s or younger today will live longer than those who were in their forties 20 years ago.

**14-year-old Indian girl's 210cm-long hairball removed in record-breaking surgery**
A 14-year-old Indian girl had been experiencing abdominal pain and nausea for a month, and was finally diagnosed with a rare condition called 'Rapunzel Syndrome' after an emergency surgery. The girl had been swallowing non-food items, including hair, rubber bands, wood shavings, and small stones, which had accumulated in her stomach and intestines, forming a 210-centimeter-long 'hairball'. The surgery, performed by Dr. Jeevan Kankariya, was a success and the girl is now recovering well. The hospital is planning to apply for a Guinness World Record for the longest hairball ever removed. Dr. Kankariya said, 'This is one of the most shocking cases I've seen in my career, and I'm proud that we were able to save her life without any complications.' The girl will undergo further psychological and psychiatric evaluation to prevent similar incidents in the future.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Turkmenistan's Sarigul Matiyeva: The Woman Who May Be the Oldest on Earth**
Sarigul Matiyeva, a resident of Turkmenistan, is believed to be the oldest living woman on Earth, reportedly having turned 117 years old this year. According to documents, she was born on January 1, 1908, although there are some doubts about the accuracy of her age due to difficulties with registration in the early 20th century. Matiyeva has 43 grandchildren, 97 great-grandchildren, and 9 great-great-grandchildren. Her family attributes her longevity to her active lifestyle and positive attitude. As her son said, 'In life, there must be a goal.' Matiyeva is known for participating in the famous horse ride from Ashgabat to Moscow in 1935, covering 4300 km in 84 days. However, the Guinness World Records recognizes Brazilian Ina Canabarro Lucas as the oldest living woman, at 116 years old, which is five months younger than Matiyeva. The record for the longest human lifespan is held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days.

**The Longest Confirmed Human Lifespan: Jeanne Calment's Story**
Jeanne Calment, a woman from Arles, France, holds the record for the longest confirmed human lifespan, living to the age of 122 years and 164 days. She was born on February 21, 1875, and died on August 4, 1997. Calment's life was well-documented, and she was interviewed by researchers multiple times, including a 30-minute interview in 1992. The researchers, including Jean-Marie Robine, a demographer and gerontologist, have extensively studied her life and confirmed her age through various methods, including analyzing her family's genetic background and reviewing her medical records. A conspiracy theory emerged in 2018, suggesting that Calment's daughter, Yvonne Billot, had falsified her mother's death certificate in 1934, but this theory was thoroughly debunked by experts, including Robine, who stated that the chances of such a conspiracy being successful are extremely low. The theory was also contradicted by a counter-enquiry published in 2019 in the Journal of Gerontology, which confirmed Calment's age at the time of her death. Calment's life has been extensively studied, and she remains an important figure in the field of gerontology, with her case helping to shed light on the human lifespan and the factors that contribute to longevity.

**‘I will never die’: Bryan Johnson, anti-ageing influencer, claims eternal life after injecting his teen son's blood**
Bryan Johnson, a 47-year-old tech millionaire and anti-ageing influencer, claims he will never die due to his biohacking methods. He injects himself with his teenage son's blood every night, believing that the younger blood can repair and rejuvenate his cells. Johnson explained that he takes a litre of blood from his son Talmage, separates it into plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and then injects the plasma into his body. He believes that living forever is not a concept that the human brain can contemplate, but technology is evolving so fast that it may be possible to extend life beyond our current life expectancy. According to Johnson, his life expectancy is expected to be around 80 to 90 years old if he continues to maintain his health, but technology may change this. Johnson said, 'Forever is not a concept the human can contemplate.'
