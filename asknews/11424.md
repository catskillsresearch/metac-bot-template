**Claudia Sheinbaum Votes in Historic Judicial Election, Celebrating Citizen Participation**
Claudia Sheinbaum, the federal president, cast her vote in the historic judicial election of 2025, exclaiming '¡Viva la democracia!' before doing so. Sheinbaum has expressed her support for the reform that allows for the popular election of judges, magistrates, and ministers, arguing that it aims to combat corruption and bring justice closer to the people. According to Sheinbaum, 75% of citizens are in favor of this change, as shown in polls. However, critics, including opposition parties, jurists, and civil organizations, have raised concerns that this reform could compromise the independence of the judiciary and politicize the process. They also worry that Morena, the ruling party, could influence the selection of candidates, weakening the checks and balances and favoring partisan interests. This idea of holding judicial elections in Mexico gained momentum during the government of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his party Morena. López Obrador presented a series of constitutional reforms in February 2024, including one that proposes the election of judges, magistrates, and ministers of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) by popular vote. According to López Obrador, the intention of this measure is to obtain a more transparent judiciary, as 'this power has been hijacked by economic and political interests.'

**US Treasury Secretary Confident US Will Never Default on Debt**
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling. 'The United States will never default, this will never happen', he said in an interview with CBS News. Bessent added that the US authorities 'are on a warning path and will not hit a wall'. According to the International Monetary Fund's calculations, the US government debt will increase to 122.5% of GDP by 2025 and continue to rise, reaching 128.2% by 2030. Earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the country's government debt is on an 'unsustainable trajectory', but has not yet reached an unacceptable level, and it is unknown when this threshold will be crossed.

**US Faces High Risk of Financial Collapse, Warns Congressional Budget Office**
The US is facing a high risk of financial collapse, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO predicts that the federal debt will rise to 117% of the country's GDP by 2034, up from 98% last year. The interest payments on the debt are also expected to increase to 4% of the GDP, which is a significant burden on the government. Despite these alarming numbers, investors are still confident in the US economy and are willing to buy government bonds and the dollar, which are the backbone of the global financial system. However, some experts warn that the US is heading towards a financial crisis, citing the country's high debt levels and the potential for a recession. If a recession were to occur, it would have a double impact on the US finances, with a decline in tax revenues and a significant increase in welfare payments, leading to a financial collapse. The Federal Reserve may be able to mitigate some of the effects of a recession by lowering interest rates, but this would not eliminate the risk of a financial crisis. The CBO's central projections assume that the US will experience a continuous and sustained economic growth over the next decade, but this is an optimistic assumption. If the economy were to experience a recession, the US finances would be severely impacted, with a significant increase in debt and interest payments. Some experts, such as Chris Marsh from Exante Data, warn that if the yield curve does not return to its natural state, the US could face a severe financial crisis, with the federal debt rising to 125% of the GDP by 2034 and interest payments reaching 30% of the government's revenues.

**DOSB Receives Four High-Quality Concepts for Olympic Bid**
The German Olympic Committee (DOSB) has received four high-quality concepts from cities and regions interested in hosting the Olympics. According to DOSB President Thomas Weikert, 'We are convinced that with this selection process, we will not only find the best concept for Germany, but also one that will allow us to win in the international competition.' The four candidates are Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, and the Rhein-Ruhr region. Weikert added, 'We are very happy to have four high-quality concepts to choose from. This shows the continued appeal of Olympic and Paralympic Games.' The DOSB will develop the concepts with the candidates until the end of September and present them to the members at a meeting in Frankfurt on December 6. All four candidates plan to let the citizens vote on their plans. The final decision on the German candidate will be made by the end of 2026 and then approved by the DOSB members. The evaluation criteria and the composition of the committee that will make the selection are still unclear. Additionally, it is still undecided whether Germany will bid for the 2036, 2040, or 2044 Olympics. The last Olympics held in Germany were in 1972 in Munich.

**Trump wants to maintain nuclear predominance**
US President Donald Trump announced his goal to quadruple the country's nuclear energy capacity by 2050. This decision is consistent with his aim to maintain the US's leading position in key areas and to give a strategy to the private sector. Trump ordered the Department of Energy to accelerate the construction of ten large reactors by 2030 and to contribute to the modernization of existing reactors. The executive order includes four decrees, which insist that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a 'culture excessively averse to risk' that establishes that nuclear facilities produce the lowest number of emissions, even below natural ones. According to Michael Katsios, Director of Scientific and Technological Policy of the Presidency, the executive orders will launch a 'nuclear renaissance in the United States' and will allow 'great innovators and entrepreneurs in the United States to overcome obstacles' in nuclear technology. The four executive orders are related to two areas of government: energy and defense. They allow the construction of nuclear reactors on federal land, reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and increase uranium mining and enrichment in the United States. Trump also signed an order to reinstall 'science with gold standards' in a moment when the government has cut billions of dollars in federal subsidies for scientific research and has reduced the staff of federal agencies focused on science. 'Today we sign important decrees that will make us the true force of this industry, which is enormous,' Trump said in the presentation of the executive orders. The Nuclear Energy Office has a budget cut of $400 million, but this is compensated by the increase of other items. According to the Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, the 'excess of regulation' will be reduced and the investment of risk capital in the industry will be encouraged, allowing 'to win the war of artificial intelligence with China.'

**Eduardo Bolsonaro Vows to Run for President in 2026, if Father Allows**
Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has expressed his willingness to run for president in 2026, stating 'obviamente, se for uma missão dada pelo meu pai, vou cumprir' (obviously, if it's a mission given by my father, I will fulfill it). He mentioned that he is happy to see his name in some polls, but believes that the candidate in a 'normal democracy' should be his father. Eduardo also stated that he is not the owner of his father's will and that the decision of who will be the candidate will be up to Jair Bolsonaro. He also mentioned that his father is still a possible candidate, despite being ineligible until 2030. Eduardo also spoke about his own plans, saying that he is an 'exilado político' (political exile) and that he will likely stay in the US until 2026, when he plans to return and possibly run for the presidency or senate.

**US voters will soon vote via smartphones, businessman Andrew Yang says**
Andrew Yang, a US entrepreneur and former presidential candidate, predicts that Americans will be voting on their smartphones within the next eight years. He believes that mobile voting could increase voter turnout, strengthen democratic systems, and reduce US polarization. According to Yang, mobile voting would not be mandatory, but one option of a hybrid system, allowing people to choose whether to vote digitally or in person. He also noted that the digital ballots would have a paper backup once received by the election offices, adding a layer of verification. Yang thinks that mobile voting could profoundly change the US political system, making voting more accessible and reducing the biparty system. He argues that this could have influenced the outcome of recent US elections and believes that a shift in politics is necessary to address major problems, such as socio-economic inequalities. 'My wildest prediction is that Americans will be voting on their smartphones in the next eight years,' Andrew Yang told Euronews Business. 'Smartphones have been a net negative in terms of the functioning of democracy in America and most countries; it's about time they did something good,' he said. 'That's why we have to improve accessibility, so that you can expand the franchise,' Yang added. 'We're looking for a hero or a villain to save us, a person to change everything, but what's required is changing the underlying system,' he told Euronews Business.

**Andrew Yang Warns of Widespread Disturbances and Violence from Autonomous Trucks**
Andrew Yang, a former candidate for the US presidency, warned that the introduction of autonomous trucks could lead to widespread disturbances and violence. Yang pointed out that the US has over 3.3 million truck drivers, and that automation could displace jobs at a rate three to four times faster than the Industrial Revolution. He predicted that there would be 'much passion and resistance' from workers in the transportation and manufacturing sectors, and that some drivers might even resort to violence, saying 'Instead of killing myself, why not destroy a robot truck?' Yang made this warning in a 2019 interview with Joe Rogan, where he stated that the consequences of automation could be 'very optimistic and perhaps a bit unrealistic' to ignore. Yang emphasized that regulations such as hours of service and electronic logging would make it difficult for human drivers to compete with machines that 'never need to rest'.

**You can't zone 2027 ticket to North, Wike Warns PDP - Daily Trust**
Nyesom Wike, Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), has warned the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against zoning its 2027 presidential ticket to the north. Wike said, 'You can’t send the presidency to the north. I told them. Selfishness can kill a system.' He argued that if the APC sends its presidential ticket to the north in 2031, the PDP will then try to send it to the north as well, which he called 'smartness' that won't help. Wike's comments appeared to be directed at PDP's 2023 presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, who has continued to vie for the presidency despite not making headway. Atiku justified his multiple attempts by citing the example of Abraham Lincoln, who contested seven times before winning the presidency in the United States.

**Trump’s Threat to EV Trucking Rules Undermines Big-Rig Bets**
President Donald Trump's plans to undermine California's stricter vehicle requirements and federal tailpipe rules are threatening the growth of electric heavy-duty trucks in the US. The rules, which were set to push fleet owners to switch to electric trucks by 2035, have been gutted by the California Air Resources Board. This has left companies like Hight Logistics, which has invested tens of millions of dollars in electric trucks, feeling uncertain about their future. 'It's a setback,' says Salim Youssefzadeh, CEO of WattEV, which has built charging stations for trucks across California. 'That's probably going to delay some of these larger fleets from going electric.' The US is far behind other countries like China, Norway, and Sweden, which have made significant progress in adopting electric heavy-duty trucks. 'Policy incentives matter,' says Maynie Yang, a BloombergNEF analyst. 'By pulling back support at this early stage, the US will stall its development of an EV supply chain and ensure its trucks remain more expensive.'

**Education Dept. DEI guidance unaffected by court order**
Despite a federal judge's ruling against the Trump administration's anti-DEI efforts, the Education Department is moving forward with guidance that requires colleges to end race-conscious programs by February 28 or lose federal funds. The plaintiffs who challenged the anti-DEI orders say the guidance is 'inconsistent' with the judge's ruling, but the department claims the injunction does not cover its guidance document. Outside lawyers agree with the department, suggesting colleges should still prepare to comply. Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said the letter was based on federal law, not the president's executive orders. However, John Yang, president of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, countered that the Dear Colleague letter is 'problematic' and 'inconsistent' with prior rulings. Outside legal experts say the injunction doesn't currently affect the department's Dear Colleague letter, but it's possible that new litigation will be introduced before the deadline.

**Sharp Divides as Parliamentarians Debate the Future of SDGs**
Parliamentarians gathered at the UN Headquarters in New York emphasized the need to reboot the 2030 Agenda, citing the slow progress made on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). President of the General Assembly Philémon Yang stated, 'We are far behind from where we need to be on almost every single one of the SDGs.' Only 17% of the SDGs have been achieved, with debt and development being major sticking points. US economist Jeffrey Sachs called for action based on 'fundamental fairness', emphasizing that many developing nations bear no historical responsibility for climate change yet struggle to access funding. UN officials insisted that a lack of political will remains a fundamental barrier, with some delegates questioning the effectiveness of existing frameworks and suggesting replacing the SDGs with new goals. However, there was a point of agreement that inaction is not an option, with the President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), Tulia Ackson, stating, 'We must be willing to think less in terms of our own political interest and more in terms of the common good.'

**Daybreak Feb. 14: Rollins in at USDA, RFK Jr. at HHS**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as the new Secretary of Health and Human Services, bringing his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) priorities to the federal government. Brooke Rollins, the new Secretary of Agriculture, has promised to review government contracts that have been frozen, affecting farmers and ranchers. Kennedy will lead a newly formed Make America Healthy Again Commission, which will study the causes of the 'childhood chronic disease crisis' and examine the potential negative effects of certain prescribed medications. Del Bigtree, a key ally of Kennedy, expects him to increase regulation of the food industry, particularly the way the Food and Drug Administration regulates food ingredients. The Make America Healthy Again Caucus is already eyeing legislative ways to implement Kennedy's vision, including restarting the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans process. Additionally, Rep. Dusty Johnson plans to introduce a bill to raise the SNAP work requirement to 65, and Sen. Tina Smith will not seek reelection in 2026.

**Davis ’27: Andrew Yang has the charisma. But does he have the policy?**
Andrew Yang '96 spoke at the Salomon Center, discussing his vision for a 'human-centered economy' and Universal Basic Income (UBI). Yang believes that the US GDP is sufficient to provide a $1,000-a-month stipend to every adult, but fails to consider the country's $36 trillion national debt, which far surpasses its GDP. The author argues that Yang's proposal would exacerbate the country's financial issues, particularly with Social Security becoming insolvent by 2033. The author suggests that Yang's focus on UBI is 'empty promises' and that politicians like Wes Moore and Pete Buttigieg offer more realistic platforms.

**US Withdraws from Paris Agreement, Mexico Boosts Renewable Energy Targets**
The United Nations has confirmed that the US will withdraw from the Paris Agreement one year after submitting its formal notice. Mexico has increased its renewable energy targets, aiming to add 27GW of new capacity by 2030. Meanwhile, a patent war between NIO and Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) has escalated, with CATL suing NIO for patent infringement. In the US, President Trump has signed an executive order to halt offshore wind energy leasing and sales, and oil giant Shell has abandoned a major offshore wind project in New Jersey. Research has shown that energy storage companies have raised $19.9 billion in funding in 2023, a 5% increase from the previous year. However, the US energy storage market has become increasingly uncertain due to the election and potential policy changes. A study has also found that the effectiveness of the Yangtze River dolphin protection zones is poor, with the species' population declining by 64.7% in protected areas compared to non-protected areas.
