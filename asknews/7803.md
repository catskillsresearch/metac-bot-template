**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**France Enters a New Demographic Regime: A Younger Population**
France is entering a new demographic regime characterized by an increasing life expectancy and a declining birth rate. Demographic inertia is already affecting social security accounts and the overall balance of society. However, the country is expected to become younger than its European counterparts. According to the United Nations' population division, by 2100, France's median age will be 47 years old, making it one of the youngest countries in Europe, alongside Hungary. This is a reversal from 1950, when France was one of the oldest countries in Europe, with a median age of 33 years. The country is expected to surpass Ireland as the youngest European nation by 2025, with half of the population under 44 years old. This projection is based on assumptions about mortality, fertility, and migration rates. Even with a constant fertility rate, France's median age is expected to remain at 47 years old in 2100, with a significant gap with other European nations. However, if immigration is zero, France's population would age more, while Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Hungary would become younger. The world is aging faster than France, with a 20-year increase in median age by 2100, compared to a 14-year increase in France. This trend is already underway, with individuals born in 2025 expected to be 75 years old in 2100.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Young Sudanese in Ethiopia Dream of a Peaceful Future**
In a conference room at a hotel in the center of Addis-Abeba, Ethiopia, a group of young Sudanese people are discussing the future of their country. Dahlia Husman Ahmed, a former medical student from Khartoum, emphasizes the importance of unity: 'We are all Sudanese, she says. It's essential to engage. We want to end this war peacefully, with humanity. Because this conflict has been going on for too long.' Ali Mohamed, who arrived in Addis-Abeba just a month ago, is more skeptical. He believes that peace will only be possible with international support: 'This conflict is not just between the Rapid Support Forces and the army, it's more complicated than that, there are also many other militias involved. The international community needs to mobilize. So far, it has been very quiet on the crisis in Sudan.' Some participants, like Muhab Mustafa, who arrived in Addis-Abeba in January 2024, are already thinking about the future of Sudan: 'I would like to one day be able to join the government. Because I know I have the capabilities. If I have the opportunity to help my country, I would do it with pleasure.' According to the UN, the war in Sudan has forced 13 million people to flee, mostly to neighboring countries.

**The Inevitable Decline of the European Economy: A Warning from Marc Vidal**
According to Marc Vidal, by 2050, there will be no European economy among the top 10 in the world, and neither will Spain. This is reflected in the report 'El Mundo en 2050' by Price, which collects prospective analyses from the IMF and the study 'Potencias mundiales 2050-2075' by Goldman Sachs. The report highlights economic stagnation, political fragility, and clear geopolitical changes that show a significant decline. The European Union's growth is expected to be only 0.7% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2025, losing competitiveness to powers like India, China, and even the US. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated this trend, accelerating the decline of Western hegemony. Additionally, the intermittent commercial war with the US, driven by Donald Trump, has further contributed to this decline. Vidal states that the European model of well-being, although admirable in many ways, is becoming unsustainable without deep reforms in defense, energy, and industry. He concludes that it is 'irremediable' unless significant changes are made, citing the study's findings that an empire in decline reveals its downfall when its laws become arbitrary, complex, and disconnected from social consensus. Vidal also criticizes the official discourse, which promotes an artificial morality where poverty is sold as virtue and the destruction of tradition is presented as inevitable progress.

**Europe's Aging Population: A Growing Concern**
The median age in Europe has reached 44.7 years, with some countries, such as Italy, already exceeding 48.7 years. According to Eurostat, the population of the EU will begin to decline in 2026, with a projected decrease of 50 million people by 2100. The main cause of this demographic shift is the decline in fertility rates, which have fallen below the replacement level. In 2023, the global fertility rate in the EU was 1.38 children per woman, down from 1.44 in 2003 and below the replacement level of 2.1. Eurostat estimates that the proportion of people aged 65 or older will increase from 21.6% in 2024 to 32.5% in 2100, while the proportion of people aged 80 or older will multiply by 2.5, from 6% to 15%. The tasa de dependencia, which measures the relationship between the number of young people and those of older age, will tend to worsen, with a projected ratio of two people in work for every one dependent in 2024. As stated by Eurostat, 'the process of aging is so accelerated, linked to the increases in longevity, that Eurostat predicts that the proportion of people aged 80 or more in the population of the EU will multiply by 2.5 between 2024 and 2100, passing from 6% to 15%.'

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**The European country with the lowest retirement age - only have to work until 49**
According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the average retirement age in the EU is projected to be around 67 by 2060. However, Turkey stands out as a significant outlier, with retirement ages of just 49 for women and 52 for men. The OECD's 'Pensions at a Glance' report highlights that Denmark will have the highest retirement age by 2060, with people retiring at age 74. This contrasts with the trend of rising retirement ages in many countries, where citizens are required to work for longer. The report notes that life expectancy and years spent in retirement are increasing across Europe, leading to higher thresholds.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Path To 2075: Goldman Counters Demographic Time Bomb Narrative With Positive Spin**
Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius and his team argue that global aging is not a crisis, but a manageable demographic transition with positive economic implications. They point out that the working-age ratio (ages 15-64) has declined from 67% in 2000 to 63% today and is projected to fall further to 57% by 2075 in developed economies. In contrast, Elon Musk has warned that 'low birth rates will end civilization.' Hatzius and his team see this transition as an opportunity, particularly for developed markets. In emerging market economies, the working-age ratio is currently near its peak at 66% but is expected to drop to 61% over the next 50 years.

**Ukraine's Demographic Situation: A Complex Challenge Ahead**
According to a UN forecast, if no effective measures are taken, Ukraine's population will decrease to 32 million people by 2050. The country's population will also age significantly, with the number of people aged 60+ (11.1 million) exceeding the number of working-age individuals (10.9 million) by 2070. This will put a critical strain on healthcare, social support, and pension systems. Analysts warn that the integration of veterans will be a key factor in the demographic situation and labor market. After the end of the conflict (forecast for the end of 2025), the share of veterans and their families who will require special attention will increase to 15% of the population, or 4-5 million people. The war has also led to an increase in the number of people with disabilities, who will make up around 9% of the population (3.4 million) by 2025. However, only 16% of working-age individuals with disabilities are employed, and only 16% of vacancies are accessible to them. The study notes that another large group in need of support are internally displaced persons (IDPs), who officially make up around 12% of the population (over 4.6 million). However, the actual number is lower due to the lack of re-registration after return or departure abroad. The labor market situation is extremely tense, with 63% of enterprises in 2024 experiencing difficulties in recruiting staff, especially skilled workers. The only sector with growth in employment is government administration and defense (23.8% of employed population), due to mobilization. In other sectors, there is a decline, particularly in industry (-37%) and social services (-11%). In response to these challenges, a series of reforms are planned in 2025 in the areas of social insurance, support for vulnerable groups, including veterans and people with disabilities, and updating labor legislation.

**Ukraine's Demographic Forecast: A Challenging Future Ahead**
According to a demographic forecast, Ukraine's population will decrease to 32 million people by 2050. The proportion of veterans and people with disabilities will increase significantly. By 2070, the number of people aged 60+ (11.1 million) will exceed the number of working-age population (10.9 million), creating a critical pressure on healthcare, social support, and pension systems. The integration of veterans will be a key factor in the demographic situation and labor market. The number of people with disabilities will also increase, with over 60% of veterans being under 40 years old, requiring a reevaluation of veteran policy with a focus on their reintegration into civilian life. The war has led to an increase in the number of people with disabilities, with only 16% of working-age people with disabilities employed, and only 16% of vacancies available to them.

**Dominican Republic and Mexico to Stop Population Growth by 2070, Cepal Report Says**
According to the Cepal report 'Long-term care for older people, demographic and social perspectives in the Hispanic Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico', the Dominican Republic and Mexico are the countries in Latin America where the population will stop growing between 2050-2070. The Dominican Republic's population will reach its maximum of 13.3 million in 2062, almost 2 million more than in 2024 (11.4 million). By 2070, the population will have decreased by 70,000 people compared to 2062, with a growth rate of -0.13%. Mexico, the most populous country in the subregion, is projected to reach its maximum population in 2052 and will have a population of 139 million in 2070, with a growth rate of -0.35%. The report also states that Cuba, El Salvador, and Costa Rica will reach their maximum population before 2050, while Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama will show the most continuous population growth beyond 2070. The Dominican Republic has a lower average age of 114.5, with 121.4 women of 60 years old per 100 men of the same age, which is below the average. By 2070, this index will decrease to 117 women per 100 men. The countries that will have decreased the indicator the most are El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Only Haiti and the Dominican Republic will increase it, although at different rates. The majority of countries in the subregion tend to a reduction of the femininity index between 2024 and 2070, indicating a movement towards greater gender equity in life expectancy. However, Haiti is an exception, as the femininity index increases, suggesting a greater female predominance in the future.'

**Spain's Working-Age Population to Decline by 2030, Aging Population to Reach 30% of Workforce**
According to the Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal, the working-age population in Spain will decline to 33 million 600 thousand people by 2030, and will continue to shrink until 2050. By 2030, people over 60 will make up 30% of the workforce, up from 20% currently. The population of dependents (those under 16 and over 66) will increase from 48% to nearly 70% in 25 years. The median age will rise by 4 years to 49. The worst period is expected to be the 2040s, with a potential decline in economic growth of 0.4%. However, the aging population will also lead to a decrease in unemployment, reaching 7% by 2070. The Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal notes that Spain's situation is similar to that of Europe, but does not rule out the need for additional measures. Productivity will be the main driver of economic growth, contributing 1.1 percentage points, while the labor factor will contribute 0.2 percentage points.

**Will We Push the Limits of Human Longevity?**
The number of centenarians has significantly increased, with new age groups emerging, including those over 105 years old and 'supercentenarians' over 110 years old. This raises the question of whether the limits of human longevity will be pushed back. A database hosted by the Ined (Institut national d'études démographiques) collects validated cases of people who died at 105 years or older in 12 countries. Analysis of the data provides some answers. In France, the number of centenarians has increased 30-fold since 1970, with women outnumbering men in all age groups. By 2024, there will be 30,000 centenarians, and by 2070, there will be 200,000. The increase in centenarians is due to advances in healthcare throughout their lives. The number of supercentenarians is also increasing, with 924 cases in 2020. However, the number of centenarians decreased in 2021 and 2022 due to the arrival of 'classes creuses' born during World War I. The mortality rate for men is still higher than for women, with a 'surmortalité chronique' for men. The question remains whether there is a ceiling to human longevity, with some demographers estimating that the risk of death increases exponentially with age, while others propose a plateau of mortality.

**Youth Army Exhibition Commemorates 80th Anniversary of Victory in Chinese Civil War**
To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese Civil War, the 'Finding an 80-year-old Youth - The 80th Anniversary Exhibition of the Youth Army and Series of Activities' is currently being held at the Zhongshan Hall in Taipei. At a press conference on March 30, 98-year-old 'old soldier' Pan Chang-fa, a member of the 'Independent Constitutional Guard' of the Youth Army, emphasized the brutality of war and the importance of preserving peace. Pan said, 'I have seen the aftermath of the Korean War, and I want to remind people to cherish the peace we have achieved.'

**Retirement Age Increased to 65 for Some Insured Individuals**
The retirement age for some insured individuals has increased to 65. Starting from 1 January 2019, men who started working, women who started working after 1 January 2023, and men who started working in 2024 will not be able to retire before the age of 65. Women who started working in 2024 will be able to retire at the age of 63 if they complete their premium days between 2044-2045, 64 if they complete them between 2046-2047, and 65 if they complete them in 2048 or later. For women who started working in a worker status after 1 January 2028, the retirement age will be 65. According to the Habertürk news, the retirement age for insured individuals who started working between 8 September 1999 and 30 April 2008 was 58 for women and 60 for men, but for those who started working after 30 April 2008, the retirement age will be determined based on the completion of premium days every two years. Now, the 65-year-old condition has come. The retirement age will change according to the completion of premium days. For workers (4/a) status, those who complete 7200 premium days will be able to retire at 58, while those who complete 9000 premium days will be able to retire at 60. For artisans (4/b) and civil servants (4/c) status, those who complete 9000 premium days will be able to retire at 60. For women who complete their premium days between 31 December 2025, they will be able to retire at 58, while men will be able to retire at 60. However, for women who complete their premium days between 1 January 2036-31 December 2037, they will be able to retire at 59, while men will be able to retire at 61. For those who complete their premium days between 1 January 2038-31 December 2039, women will be able to retire at 60, while men will be able to retire at 62. Men who complete their premium days in 2044 or later will not be able to retire before the age of 65, while women will not be able to retire before the age of 65 starting from 2048. The retirement age has become more difficult for the young generation. 'It is a difficult situation for the young generation,' said a source.

**National Pension Fund to Deplete by 2057, National Debt to Reach 7300 Trillion Won by 2072**
According to the '2025~2072 year long-term financial forecast' report by the National Assembly Budget Office, the National Pension Fund's accumulated contributions will peak at 1936 trillion 900 billion won in 2039, but will then record a deficit and completely deplete by 2057. The Academic Pension Fund will deplete even faster, peaking at 28 trillion 200 billion won in 2027 and then recording a deficit from 2028, completely depleting by 2042. By 2072, the accumulated financial deficit of the National Pension Fund is expected to be 2,899 trillion 400 billion won, equivalent to 60.9% of the country's GDP. The accumulated financial deficit of the Academic Pension Fund is expected to be 128 trillion 900 billion won in 2072, equivalent to 2.4% of the country's GDP. The National Assembly Budget Office stated that 'although the National Pension Fund and the Academic Pension Fund are currently recording surpluses, they can pose a potential risk to the national finances' and 'it is necessary to discuss measures to secure financial sustainability to prepare for future financial risks.' The national financial outlook is bleak. By 2072, the national debt is expected to be 7,303 trillion 600 billion won, a 5.7-fold increase from the current 1,270 trillion 400 billion won. The national debt is a 'real national debt' as it is subject to government repayment obligations. The national debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise from 47.8% this year to 173% in 2072. The rapid increase in national debt is due to the fact that government expenditures are greater than government revenues. The main cause is the decline in the working-age population (15-64 years old) and the increase in the elderly population (65 years and older). The working-age population is expected to decrease from 35.9 million to 16.6 million by 2072, while the elderly population is expected to increase from 10.5 million to 17.2 million. However, if the low birth rate trend is reversed, the national debt-to-GDP ratio could be reduced by nearly 10 percentage points. Under the 'high' scenario, which assumes a population of 66 million more than the 'middle' scenario, the national debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease by 9.7 percentage points. On the other hand, under the 'low' scenario, which assumes a population of 6.05 million less than the 'middle' scenario, the national debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase by 9 percentage points. The National Assembly Budget Office stated that 'last year's total fertility rate was 0.75, which is expected to rebound to the middle scenario level, and is positively evaluated. However, it emphasized that 'at least, policy efforts are needed to maintain a minimum level of population structure equivalent to the middle scenario.'
