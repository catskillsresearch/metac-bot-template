**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**Macri Supports Governors' Demand for Infrastructure Development**
Former President Mauricio Macri expressed his support for the governors' demand for infrastructure development during his presentation at the 'Energía Chubut 2050' cycle. He emphasized the need for coordination between the state and infrastructure to reduce the gap between Argentina's potential and reality. Macri stated, 'I'm fed up with people talking about Argentina's potential. The challenge is to reduce the gap between potential and reality. The only way to achieve this is to build trust and coordination.' He also criticized the national government's management of public works, saying, 'I was on Ruta 3, which is a national route, and it's in shambles. I get the feeling that if the province doesn't take charge, it won't get done.' Macri also discussed the alliance between the PRO and La Libertad Avanza in Buenos Aires, saying that it's still on track, but the economic stability is still not achieved. He emphasized the need for a 'minimalist state' but one that 'always has to be there.' Macri concluded by saying, 'We need the state to be there, with infrastructure, with ports, with airports, with Wi-Fi. Without it, there's no development.'

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Global Stablecoin Payment Market Exceeds $128 Trillion, Expected to Continue Growing**
The global stablecoin payment market has grown rapidly, exceeding $128 trillion in the past two years. According to Artemis, a blockchain data analysis company, the total stablecoin payment amount from 2023 to 2025 is $94.2 billion. Among these, B2B transactions accounted for the largest share, with $36 billion annually. Card-linked stablecoin payments also showed rapid growth, exceeding $13.2 billion annually. As the use of stablecoins in real-world economies increases, governments and traditional financial institutions are also showing growing interest. In the US, stablecoin regulation bills are being discussed, and the UAE and EU are also allowing the issuance of some stablecoins, accelerating institutional entry. US Vice President J.D. Vance said at the recent 'Bitcoin 2025' event, 'Stablecoins do not threaten the dollar and strengthen it.' He also stated, 'The Genius Act will bring stablecoin activity to the US, strengthening the dollar's position.' Stablecoins are backed by collateral to maintain their value, with most dollar-based stablecoins, including USDC, backed by US Treasury bonds. In terms of market share, Tether (USDT) dominates the stablecoin market, with a 86.1% market share as of February this year. USDC, issued by Circle, follows closely behind. The stablecoin market has grown 54.5% in the past year, with a market capitalization of $24.73 billion. The market is expected to continue growing, with Citibank predicting that the market will reach $160 trillion by 2030.

**A Glimpse into a Climate-Changed Future: '2050 Store' and 'Wiers - the Voice of the Earth'**
As the temperature in Seoul reached 29 degrees Celsius on the first day of June, a mock '2050 Store' was set up at the Seoul Madang to showcase the potential effects of climate change on our daily lives. The store featured items that may be extinct by 2050, such as Korean apples, domestic squid, wine, abalone, chocolate, and iced Americanos. According to Greenpeace, the domestic squid catch has decreased by 16/20 over the past 20 years due to rising sea temperatures, and 44% of abalone and shellfish species are at risk of extinction due to ocean acidification. The event, 'Wiers - the Voice of the Earth,' was held to raise awareness about climate change and to encourage citizens to take action. Participants were asked to write down the small, everyday things they want to preserve in a '2050 Diary' wall, and to record their thoughts on a 'Voice of the Earth' audio booth. The event also featured a coffee truck serving fair-trade coffee and vegan milk tea. Greenpeace's climate and energy campaigner, Jeong Sang-hoon, said, 'We set up this event to hear the voices of citizens who are concerned about climate change and to amplify the voice of the Earth.' He added that the organization plans to use the feedback from the event to campaign for change in the government and parliament after the presidential election. Participants expressed their hopes for the next government to prioritize climate change, with one citizen saying, 'I hope the next government will reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy.' Another participant said, 'I hope the next president will actively communicate with international organizations like the UN to address climate change.'

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Scope Ratings: No Rating Decision for Turkey, Stable Outlook with 'BB-' Rating**
Scope Ratings, a German credit rating agency, announced that it did not make any rating decisions regarding Turkey. The agency's credit rating for Turkey is 'stable' with a rating of 'BB-'. The statement noted that global and local uncertainties, inflationary pressures, and restrictive monetary policies have negatively affected investor confidence and consumer demand. It is predicted that GDP growth will be 3.0% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026. However, the statement added that internal demand could be supported by a more gradual fiscal tightening. The government aims to reduce the general budget deficit from 5.2% in 2024 and 3.6% in 2026 to 4.0% of GDP in 2025. Officials are committed to maintaining fiscal discipline, including measures such as increasing tax collection, eliminating ineffective tax exemptions, and introducing a minimum corporate tax. It is expected that the general government debt will be around 25-27% of GDP by 2030, which is lower than that of its peers.' said officials.

**Households Key to Grid Stability, Study Finds**
A study by TransnetBW, the German transmission grid operator, found that households that adjust their energy consumption to the current market situation could lead to significant economic savings of up to 11 billion euros by 2050, with 1.5 billion euros in Germany. The study, 'Adequacy 2050', examined the long-term security of supply and the robustness of the German grid development plan against the effects of climate change. According to the study's lead author, Massimo Moser, the assumptions of the plan are 'partly too optimistic'. The study found that households with their own energy generation, such as solar panels or heat pumps, are a key lever for the system's cost efficiency. However, if only half of these households act in a market-oriented manner, at least nine gigawatts of hydrogen-capable power plants would be needed, said co-author Georgios Savvidis. Even under average weather conditions, this would be more than the plan currently foresees. The study also pointed out that weather extremes have a significant impact on the grid, with wind power generation in Germany potentially fluctuating by up to 15% compared to the long-term average. According to Moser, this would be a 'notable size'. Even under normal weather conditions, the capacities assumed in the grid development plan would not be sufficient to ensure a complete power supply in 2050. In extreme weather conditions, such as a year-long drought or an unusually cold winter with 42 frost days, the deficit could grow. In the worst-case scenario, there could be brownouts, where parts of the grid are intentionally shut down to maintain stability. However, this could be prevented by increasing cross-border connections in the European grid, which could save up to 18 billion euros per year by 2050.

**Households Crucial for Energy System Stability, Study Finds**
Households play a crucial role in the stability and efficiency of the energy system, according to a study by TransnetBW. If households with their own energy generation, such as solar panels, consume energy in a way that considers the current market situation and the needs of society, significant economic savings could be achieved. The study 'Adequacy 2050' estimates that these savings could reach up to 11 billion euros in Europe by 2050, with 1.5 billion euros in Germany. For example, charging electric cars at night or during times when energy is cheap and in low demand could have positive effects for all. The study also found that the German Net Development Plan is too optimistic in its assumptions about the impact of climate change, according to the study's leader, Massimo Moser.

'Even under average weather conditions.' The authors also point out that the development plan makes strongly simplified assumptions about the weather. 'The yield from wind power in Germany could fluctuate by up to plus/minus 15 percent compared to the long-term average,' said Moser. 'This means a difference of up to 150 terawatt hours per year - about 12 percent of the assumed German electricity demand in 2045.' 'This is a considerable size,' emphasized Moser. Even under normal weather conditions, the capacities assumed in the development plan are not sufficient to ensure a complete power supply in 2050, according to the study. In extreme weather conditions, such as a year-long drought in Europe or an unusually cold winter with 42 frost days, the deficit could grow. In the worst-case scenario, there could be power outages, also known as brownouts, where parts of the grid are deliberately shut down to maintain network stability.

**The Island of Stability: A New Frontier in Nuclear Physics**
The concept of the 'island of stability' in the periodic table, where superheavy elements have longer half-lives, has been a topic of interest for scientists. The island is thought to be located beyond the 'sea of instability' of the actinides and lanthanides. Recent experiments have shown that the island may be closer than previously thought, with the discovery of the element 120 and the synthesis of the element 290. The island is expected to be located at least one period away, even if the 8th period opens up a new g-orbital. The region is thought to be around element 164. Researchers have suggested that superheavy elements may exist in the solar system, particularly on asteroids. The asteroid Polymnia (33) has a density of around 75.3 g/cm^3, which is higher than any known mineral. Other compact and super-dense objects (CUDO) have also been discovered. NASA has organized an expedition to another anomalous asteroid, Psyche, which is thought to be one of the densest asteroids in the solar system. The expedition aims to prepare the technical base for future visits to CUDO, which may hold the key to understanding the 'island of stability' and the limits of the periodic table.

**'Relatively Stable' Emissions? Airbus Says Innovation Can Offset Air Travel But the Record Isn't Good**
Airbus Chief Sustainability Officer Julie Kitcher stated that aviation emissions have remained 'relatively stable' due to technological advances, despite the rise in air travel. However, research shows that emissions have doubled since 1990, despite aircraft becoming twice as energy efficient. The transition to sustainable aviation fuels is crucial but faces supply challenges. Kitcher emphasized the need for decarbonization strategies and offsetting emissions with the right tools to reach net zero by 2050. Air travel demand continues to rise, and experts worry that slower adoption of climate policies in regions like India and China could delay decarbonization efforts. Kitcher remains optimistic about progress in these markets, citing advancements in renewable fuel. Airbus projects that air traffic will more than double in the next 20 years, and the company is working on a hydrogen-powered aircraft that could enter service in the 2030s. 'We've seen that over the decades, although air travel has doubled, actually the greenhouse gas emissions from aviation have remained relatively stable,' Kitcher said. 'So it shows that the technology and the measures that we're implementing are offsetting the growth from aviation.' Kitcher added that 'at the end of the day, you see that the growth is there for air travel, so it's really about being able to offset and reduce emissions with the right tools to be able to get us to net zero in 2050.'

**Taiwan's Energy Stability: A Military Simulation Reveals the Risks of a Nuclear-Free Home**
The '2025 TTX Zone Security Military Simulation' event, held from March 3 to 5, concluded its last day with the topic of 'Energy Stability'. According to the simulation results, the risk factor for this scenario reached 0.99, indicating an 'emergency state'. William Anthony Stanton, former AIT director, asked, 'Why does the Taiwanese government oppose nuclear power?' The attendees explained that this is a political issue, not a realistic problem. Stanton clarified that during his tenure as AIT director, he did not receive any instructions from the US government to promote nuclear power in Taiwan. He also stated that the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan (AmCham Taiwan) has expressed concerns about Taiwan's power supply in their policy white papers, but this is focused on the evaluation of American companies in Taiwan, which may support stable and zero-carbon nuclear power. Central University of Finance and Economics professor, Liang Qiuyuan, reported that Taiwan will close its third nuclear power plant's No. 2 unit in May, achieving its goal of becoming a 'nuclear-free home' by 2025. However, the gap in renewable energy and natural gas cannot be filled, and Taiwan relies on coal-fired power plants to generate electricity, violating the 2050 net-zero carbon target and potentially facing carbon tax. He suggested that Taiwan should quickly restart nuclear power, especially with the advancement of nuclear waste treatment and the development of small modular reactors (SMRs). Stanton expressed his confusion, saying that he accompanied the US Energy Secretary to visit the Second Nuclear Power Plant and was impressed by Taiwan's nuclear facilities. He wondered why Taiwan, despite facing power shortages, has been opposed to nuclear power by both the KMT and DPP governments.

**The True Threat: Overpopulation, Not Climate Change**
A 1960 study by physicist Heinz von Foerster and his team predicted that the world would reach a critical point on November 13, 2026, due to exponential population growth. According to their projections, the growth of the world population would be so significant that humanity would experience a collapse, not due to natural disasters or pandemics, but due to its own decisions and actions. The study, titled 'Doomsday: Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026', argued that even if a constant food supply and the avoidance of natural disasters were achieved, overpopulation could trigger the collapse of social and environmental systems. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that demographic growth has reached a pace that technological advancements cannot mitigate adequately. As a result, addressing this phenomenon is imperative to ensure a sustainable future. According to the model used, overpopulation will lead to extinction due to resource scarcity and the environmental impact of human activities. The research warned that if the world population continues to grow at this rate, we will reach an unsustainable threshold where societies cannot preserve their stability or sustainable development. Although this prediction is now viewed with skepticism, especially due to the stabilization of population growth rates, the dialogue about the limits of human growth remains relevant. The UN has estimated that the world population could reach 11.2 billion by 2100, raising questions about the management of the planet's resources and environmental protection in a world with a constantly increasing population.

**Europe's Future Uncertain: A Warning from Former Spanish Intelligence Director Jorge Dezcallar**
According to former Spanish intelligence director Jorge Dezcallar, by 2050, Europe could no longer have any of its nations among the world's top 10 economies. The combination of political and economic crises, along with social polarization, has eroded trust in institutions and affected both the population and investors. Dezcallar believes that the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical conflicts have disrupted supply chains and increased energy costs, posing a significant challenge to European economic stability. He emphasizes the need for deep reforms to revitalize industry and strengthen the continent's military capabilities. Europe's high dependence on external energy sources has exacerbated an energy crisis, worsened by geopolitical conflicts. Inflation, unemployment, and economic slowdown are significant challenges to European economic stability. Dezcallar's vision of Europe's future is concerning, raising questions about the continent's role in the global economy. China, on the other hand, is poised to become a dominant global economic player, with its 'Made in China 2025' plan aiming to modernize its manufacturing base and lead in high-tech industries. This highlights the need for Europe to implement significant reforms to avoid falling behind in the global competition.

**James Hansen Warns of Potential Collapse of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation**
Renowned climate scientist James Hansen has sounded the alarm about the potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the coming decades. Hansen, a former director of the NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has been a vocal advocate for climate action and one of the first scientists to warn about human-induced climate change. According to Hansen, the AMOC, which regulates the climate in the North Atlantic by transporting warm water from the southern hemisphere to the north, could collapse in as little as 20-30 years, much sooner than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates. This would lead to a drastic cooling in Northern Europe and a rise in temperatures in the south. Hansen's warning is based on a new study he conducted with a team from Columbia University, which suggests that the AMOC is more vulnerable to collapse than previously thought. The study's findings contradict the IPCC's predictions, which estimated that the 1.5°C temperature threshold would be reached by 2030, but was surpassed in 2023. Hansen attributes the potential collapse to the melting of Greenland, which is causing a massive influx of freshwater into the Atlantic, weakening the AMOC. Other scientists, such as Peter and Susanne Ditlevsen, have made similar predictions, estimating that the AMOC could collapse between 2025 and 2095, with a likely date of 2057. However, some studies suggest that the AMOC remains stable. Despite the scientific uncertainties, all experts agree that the only way to prevent the collapse is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**Climate Scientist James E. Hansen Warns of 'Sleeping Giant' Threat: AMOC Collapse**
Renowned climate scientist James E. Hansen has issued a new warning: 'the sleeping giant' is the greatest threat. Global warming is advancing faster than predicted, and official models may be underestimating the risk. Hansen, who presented his findings to the US Congress in 1988, is now 83 years old and still warning about the dangers of climate change. The current rate of global warming is unprecedented, with a 0.4°C increase in just two years. However, Hansen is most concerned about the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a phenomenon that could occur in the next few decades. The AMOC regulates the climate in the North Atlantic by transporting warm water from the southern hemisphere to the north. Its collapse would cause a drastic cooling in Northern Europe and an increase in temperatures in the south. Hansen estimates that this could happen in 20-30 years, much sooner than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts. Hansen and his team at Columbia University have published a new study that challenges the IPCC's predictions. According to the IPCC, the 1.5°C threshold would be reached by 2030, but in reality, it has already been exceeded in 2023. Hansen is skeptical of the official models and believes that the understanding of the AMOC phenomenon is still 'very primitive.' He insists that urgent measurements are needed to evaluate the real risk. 'We cannot remain blind to this threat. We need more observations to understand what is happening and take action before it is irreversible,' he said. Not all experts agree with Hansen. In 2023, professors Peter and Susanne Ditlevsen published a study in Nature that placed the collapse of the AMOC between 2025 and 2095, with a probable date in 2057. However, other scientists have published studies suggesting that the AMOC is still stable. The Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) maintains the IPCC's evaluation and considers it unlikely that the AMOC will collapse this century, although it acknowledges that the current is weakening. Despite the scientific disagreements, all experts agree that the only way to avoid the collapse is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to the UN, they should decrease almost by half by 2030, but recent reports indicate that they are still increasing. Hansen is clear: 'We cannot continue to ignore this threat. Every delay brings us closer to the point of no return.'
