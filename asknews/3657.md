**How Can We Put "Health" and "Care" Back in Healthcare?**
The US healthcare system is facing a crisis of trust and compassion, driven by the corporatization of medicine prioritizing profits over patients. Despite spending more per capita on healthcare than any other developed nation, the system is failing in fundamental ways, including declining life expectancy, eroding trust in medical professionals, and burning out caregivers. To address this crisis, we must support private practice autonomy and prioritize patient outcomes over profits. This involves acknowledging that the current system is broken, and people must be prioritized over profits. We must break the cycle of declining physician autonomy leading to increased burnout, which reduces compassion and efficiency, and worsens patient outcomes and erodes trust. This requires an approach that supports physicians who choose private practice, strengthens laws preventing the corporate practice of medicine, addresses the burnout epidemic, rebuilds the human connection between patients and providers, and reforms healthcare financing to reduce the emphasis on volume and prioritize quality of care.

**Home health agencies drop telehealth, citing applicability, costs ...**
A recent study published in Health Services Research reveals that one-fifth of home healthcare agencies that implemented telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic have discontinued the service in 2024. The main reasons for discontinuing telehealth were its inapplicability for aging patients (60%), high costs and lack of reimbursement (55%), and challenges with integrating telehealth services into the workflow (16%). According to study author Dana B. Mukamel, Ph.D., 'without [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] reimbursement, many agencies may abandon telehealth, potentially missing opportunities to improve care and manage costs as home health demand skyrockets.' The study's findings suggest that expanded federal reimbursement for telehealth services is crucial for its continued adoption in home healthcare.

**Costs rise in New York State as hospitals buy traditional private practices**
Hospitals in New York State are buying private practices and charging patients and insurance companies higher hospital rates for the same care, according to interviews and documents. This trend is costly and has drawn attention from state and national lawmakers. A Congressional Budget Office study found that hospitals can charge a hospital rate that is estimated at 60% more than the rates paid to independent practices, clinics, and providers for the same procedures. 'The impact on the consumer -- the patient -- could be significant depending on the insurance plan,' said Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group. Hospitals argue that consolidation strengthens healthcare and allows for better negotiation with drug companies and lower malpractice insurance premiums. However, critics say that this reduces competition and gives an advantage to large hospital groups. 'Hospital are becoming mini-monopolies in their area,' said Bill Hammond, senior fellow for health policy at the Empire Center for Public Policy think tank. A state legislative proposal seeks to make payments 'site neutral,' so that a service provided by a hospital group would be paid at the same rate as an independent practice, clinic, or lab. Adoption of site neutral costs would save New York state $1.4 billion a year in healthcare costs and save New Yorkers $213 million a year in out-of-pocket spending.

**Call For Inquiry and Commission To Regulate Private Healthcare Charges**
The Galen Centre for Health and Social Policy is calling for a parliamentary inquiry and an independent statutory commission to regulate private healthcare charges. The centre argues that Bank Negara's direction on health insurance premiums and hospital charges has led to increased economic and medical hardship, and that the ongoing increases in health insurance premiums were not unexpected. The centre also notes that the promise of lower health insurance premiums with the adoption of copayment and deductions was proven to be hollow. The Galen Centre recommends that all new medical reimbursement products beginning next year would be required to have co-payment features, and that annual co-payments caps be introduced. According to the centre, less than 8% of healthcare expenditure is attributed to health insurance, while around 33% is out-of-pocket payments. The centre agrees to the need for responsible medical and health insurance usage, which would reduce the pressure on premium increases. As stated by the centre, 'These health insurance premiums increases do not happen in a vacuum.' The centre also notes that the medical bills imposed by providers such as private hospitals continue to be unregulated, and that insurers are forced to pay what has been charged, often leaving them transferring the consequences of over-consumption and overcharging to consumers, patients and policyholders. 'A government linked company (GLC) providing private healthcare services recently announced a historic milestone of RM1 billion in quarterly earnings. Though it is great news for the shareholders which include the government, this should be a concerning development,' the centre stated.

**Cantabria's Healthcare System Sees Significant Increase in 'Peonadas' and Productivity Bonuses**
The public healthcare system in Cantabria, Spain has seen a significant increase in 'peonadas' (extra payments) and productivity bonuses over the past two years, with a total investment of 38 million euros in 2025. This is a 21-fold increase from 2023, when the incentives for performance were 1.8 million euros. The payments can reach up to 20,000 euros per month for some specialists. The increase in spending on productivity bonuses and peonadas has been driven by the need to retain talent and increase productivity in the system, but critics argue that it should be used to reform the model and create more stable employment. The government has recognized the need for reform, but has not taken concrete steps to address the issue. The payments are made in addition to the regular salaries of healthcare professionals, and are seen as a way to incentivize them to work harder. However, some critics argue that the payments are unfair and should be replaced with a more structured and equitable system. The government has promised to increase productivity and reduce waiting lists, but the results have been mixed, with the number of patients on waiting lists for surgery decreasing by only 2,500 in the past two years.

**Taiwan's Healthcare System Faces Challenges as Individual Hospitals Implement Total Budget**
Taiwan's healthcare system has introduced a new policy where individual hospitals have a total budget, and preliminary results show that the point value has improved. However, the Community Hospital Association's chairman, Zhu Yihong, warns that many hospitals are self-controlling their medical services to avoid being 'cut off' by the National Health Insurance (NHI) and may affect patient access to care. Zhu said, 'It is too early to say that the individual hospital total budget has successfully stabilized the NHI point value.' Many hospitals have taken measures to limit their medical services, such as limiting outpatient visits and reducing the number of surgeries, and promoting their own self-paid medical services. The Executive Director of the Medical Reform Committee, Lin Yaohui, urged the NHI Bureau to strictly monitor the outpatient care rates of major hospitals and whether they have implemented tiered care. She also suggested that the NHI Bureau use medical quality indicators to regulate hospitals and prevent them from promoting self-paid items or reporting NHI items as self-paid, which would increase patients' financial burdens. Lin said, 'Although the first quarter NHI point value is good, we should continue to observe the third and fourth quarters to get a more accurate result.'

**What we expect from a people-centric health budget**
Bangladesh's health sector faces significant challenges due to a lack of strong political commitment, inefficient management, weak governance, and financial constraints. To address these issues, the government must ensure full and efficient utilisation of the current budget, fill vacant positions, and create new ones as needed. The proposed 'people-centric health budget' requires increasing public spending on healthcare relative to GDP, ensuring equitable regional allocations, strengthening public health infrastructure, and reducing out-of-pocket expenses. However, the current budget management system is plagued by structural barriers, including a disconnect between different tiers of leadership, inadequate training and capacity in field and hospital administration, and ambiguities in public procurement laws and regulations. To implement a people-centric health budget, structural reforms are essential, including prioritising preventive and promotive services, integrating the primary healthcare system, introducing a universal family health card, and establishing a national health fund. Dr Syed Abdul Hamid, professor at the Institute of Health Economics at the University of Dhaka, emphasizes the need for political will and public advocacy to advance the health sector sustainably and equitably through an inclusive and responsible budgeting framework.

**Britain on 'road to bankruptcy' under Rachel Reeves, warn experts**
Experts warn that Britain is on the 'road to bankruptcy' due to high government debt and tax burden. The Centre for Policy Studies and the Institute for Fiscal Studies predict that the upcoming spending review will result in real-terms cuts to public services, including public sector employment, pay, and services provided. The IFS suggests that reducing NHS funding growth will make it harder to achieve the government's goals for hospital waiting times. Defence Secretary John Healey has stated that military spending will reach 3% of GDP by 2034, which will likely make cuts elsewhere more likely.

**UK faces choice next week between health and other spending, IFS**
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that the upcoming spending review in the UK will be a 'significant domestic policy event' for the Labour government. The review will determine how much to spend on healthcare versus other public services. According to the IFS, the government will have to choose between prioritizing healthcare or other areas, as there is no room for extra borrowing or tax rises. The IFS forecasts that if healthcare spending increases at the same pace as other areas, it will only just keep pace with an aging population and not allow any reversal of recent years' deterioration in service quality. The review does not cover spending on pensions or other benefits, which the government is tackling separately. 'Simultaneously prioritising additional investments in public services, net zero and growth-friendly areas... will be impossible,' said Bee Boileau, a research economist at the IFS.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank has warned that the UK's finance minister, Rachel Reeves, will face a difficult decision in next week's multi-year spending review.

**A National Single-Payer Healthcare System Would Be Good for Employers, Too | Common Dreams**
A national single-payer healthcare system would benefit employers as well as employees. The current job-based insurance system poses health-related and financial burdens on employers and employees. These burdens include high costs for employees and their families, time spent managing insurance, and potential compromises to hiring and worker productivity. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Francisco conducted seven company case studies and found that the cost of health insurance has limited profit margins for employers. As one owner said, 'The cost of health insurance has limited, I mean that there's a certain limit to my profit margin and particularly with other factors such as supply chain issues... I'm getting squeezed on a lot of different fronts, and if my health insurance didn't go up 10% every year, I could pay people 10% more every year... They don't want to give up their health insurance, but I think they know that it's suppressing the wages that we can pay.' A national single-payer healthcare system would eliminate these burdens and provide universal coverage.

**Letter: The (health care) devil is in the details**
John Brenan, a critic of single-payer health care, argues that the government will inevitably 'screw it up' and increase costs. He points to Medicare, a single-payer system for seniors, which has 'less than stellar' results, including restricted services and high out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries. Brenan suggests that any single-payer system will be flawed and proposes an alternative idea based on paying today's bills with yesterday's invested dollars and minimal government involvement. He challenges advocates of single-payer health care to develop a better idea, saying 'only then' will he give it his attention.

**Letter: What do you want in your health care system?**
A 2022 Congressional Budget Office report suggests that a single-payer health care system in the United States could save $300 to $450 billion annually, which is about 16% to 23% of the current federal deficit. This system could also eliminate personal bankruptcies and losses of homes due to medical bills. Single-payer systems save money by simplifying billing and administrative processes, negotiating lower prescription drug prices, and reducing efficiency and fraud through a single database and greater transparency. Mike Huntington asks, 'What do you want in your health care system? How can we pay for it?'

**Guest opinion: The high costs of single-payer health care**
Ryan Smith, a former chairman for the Utah College Republicans, argues that a single-payer health care system would worsen the health care affordability crisis in Utah. He cites a 2024 report that found health care spending has increased by nearly 20% in the state, posing significant financial challenges for employees and small business owners. Smith claims that private insurers, when adequately regulated, create incentives for cost control and improved services, whereas single-payer systems often operate as monopolies, stifling innovation and leading to care rationing. He also points to the inefficiencies of government-run systems, such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, which suffers from delays for routine critical procedures. Smith concludes that embracing market-driven reforms that empower consumers, promote innovation, and ensure access to high-quality care is the path to a better health care system, rather than sacrificing choice and competition for the false promises of a single-payer system.

**Guest columnist Matteo Pangallo: Health care should be based on need, not greed**
Massachusetts should adopt single-payer health insurance to ensure everyone has access to quality and equal care, regardless of income level. The current system is driven by corporate greed, with insurance companies increasing costs to maintain profit margins. This is unacceptable, especially when 41% of Massachusetts families struggle to pay for health care. The Massachusetts Medicare for All Act would save money by creating a statewide single-payer public health insurance program, paid for with a progressive tax. This would eliminate premiums, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket expenses, and would be more affordable for 90% of Massachusetts residents. As the article states, 'need should come before greed' and it's time for the Legislature to act on this clear will of the people, who have voted in favor of single-payer health insurance 68 times since 1998 with an average approval rating of 67.5%.

**My Turn: Let’s base health care on need, not greed**
The author argues that Massachusetts should adopt single-payer health insurance, citing the rising costs of private insurance and the need to prioritize healthcare over corporate profits. The Massachusetts Medicare for All Act would create a statewide public health insurance program, paid for with a progressive tax, and eliminate premiums, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket expenses. The author notes that Massachusetts led the nation in adopting the Health Care Reform Law in 2006, which became the model for the national Affordable Care Act. They urge readers to support the Massachusetts Medicare for All Act and remind lawmakers that the people have consistently voted in favor of single-payer health insurance in nonbinding ballot questions. As the author states, 'It's time we put need before greed and create a health insurance system that works for every person in Massachusetts, regardless of their income level.'

**Activists Declare "Health Care For People, Not For Profit" : Indybay**
Activists gathered to protest the profiteering of healthcare at a J.P. Morgan Healthcare Investors Meeting, calling for a single-payer system that prioritizes people over profit. The protest came after the recent killing of a UnitedHealthcare executive, highlighting the $22 billion profit made by the largest health insurer in the country in 2023. In contrast, a single-payer system to care for every individual in the country would cost approximately $20 billion per year. The protesters also drew attention to the US's $17.9 billion in weaponry sent to Israel, which has enabled the slaughter and starvation of over 45,000 Palestinians. As one protester stated, 'Health care can only be provided to the whole society as a single payer system, and equally to all its members.'
