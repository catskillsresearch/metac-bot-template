**Spacecraft 'Kosmos-482' May Complete 45-Year Orbit Around Earth Today**
The Soviet spacecraft 'Kosmos-482', launched in 1972 to land on Venus, may complete its 45-year orbit around Earth today, May 9. Due to a rocket failure, the spacecraft did not reach Venus and became stuck in an elliptical orbit around our planet. It is expected to enter Earth's atmosphere on the night of May 10, with debris potentially falling to the surface. The 495 kg spacecraft has a 1-meter diameter titanium body designed to withstand high temperatures during Venus entry. This construction may allow it to survive re-entry intact, potentially landing as a single large object. According to The Aerospace Corporation (CORDS), the re-entry time is predicted for 1:54 AM EST (0554 GMT) with a possible deviation of 9 hours. Due to its 52-degree orbital inclination, the spacecraft can fall anywhere between 52° north and 52° south latitude, covering most of the planet's surface. However, the risks to the population remain minimal, as most of the Earth's surface is water, and a significant portion of the land is sparsely populated. CORDS estimates the probability of a person being injured by the spacecraft's fall at 0.4 per 10,000, significantly below industry safety thresholds. The spacecraft was part of the 'Venus' program, which saw the USSR become the first country to achieve a soft landing on Venus in 1970 and send the first color images of its surface in 1982.

**Solar Flare AR 4079: A Massive Region on the Sun's Surface Raises Concerns**
Astronomers have identified a large solar flare, AR 4079, on the surface of the Sun, which has raised concerns in the scientific community. This type of region can emit solar flares, intense explosions of light, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs): clouds of charged particles that, when directed towards the Earth, have the potential to affect communications, electrical grids, and satellites. What makes this flare unique is its massive size: 140,000 kilometers in diameter, more than 10 times the size of the Earth. It is located near the solar equator, a zone that, for several days, pointed directly at our planet, increasing the level of alert. Experts are concerned about the possible CMEs that could be released from this region. According to Infobae, if one of these ejections impacts the Earth directly, it could cause damage to satellites, affect air navigation, and provoke interference in electronic systems. Solar flares, although known to science, rarely reach the size of AR 4079. These regions form when the Sun's magnetic field becomes tangled, preventing heat from flowing freely to the surface. As a result, cooler and darker areas are created, with temperatures around 3,300 degrees Celsius, in contrast to the 5,000 degrees of adjacent areas. According to NASA, the Sun is composed of plasma, an electrically charged gas. When the magnetic field lines twist and accumulate, they interfere with solar energy, generating these visible spots that, on occasion, can be observed with certified solar glasses as small dark points. AR 4079 has already emitted M-class flares, a medium-intensity category. Although no large-scale eruption has occurred, its accumulated energy and complex magnetic structure maintain the latent risk. According to Gizmodo, this spot presents a beta-gamma-delta configuration, one of the most complex and with the highest potential to generate solar flares. If a high-intensity flare or a CME occurs while pointing towards the Earth, it could trigger a global geomagnetic storm. These storms can alter GPS signals and telecommunications, as well as cause failures in satellites and electrical systems. Although AR 4079 has not shown extreme activity, scientists insist on the need for constant monitoring. Astronomers explain that the solar flare AR 4079 is currently in a quiet phase. The formation of these regions on the surface of the star is a constant phenomenon, although their behavior can change suddenly. Due to its recent position in front of the Earth, scientists warn that, in case of generating a significant solar eruption, it could produce a geomagnetic storm with the potential to affect the planet. If a significant solar eruption occurs while facing the Earth, we will receive a direct impact of solar energy and solar particles, which will trigger a geomagnetic storm, highlights Infobae.

**Cosmos 482: Soviet Venus Probe Returns to Earth After 53 Years**
After 53 years of drifting in space, the Soviet Union's Venus probe, Cosmos 482, has finally returned to Earth's atmosphere. According to the European Space Agency, the probe was last detected by radar over Germany before disappearing. It is believed to have crashed into the Indian Ocean, approximately 560 kilometers west of the Andaman Islands. The probe, which was about 1 meter in diameter and weighed half a ton, was designed to withstand extreme temperatures and pressures. Despite its small size, it was a robust structure that could withstand 300G acceleration and 100 atmospheres of pressure. Interestingly, astronomers discovered that the probe was still carrying an unknown object, possibly its parachute, but it could not be confirmed. The probe was launched in 1972 but failed to reach its destination, breaking into four parts. Two of the parts crashed into New Zealand within 48 hours, leaving deep craters in the soil without causing any injuries. The incident highlights the robust design of the probe, which was able to withstand the intense forces of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.

**ESA's 'Plato' Observatory to Search for Earth-like Exoplanets**
The European Space Agency (ESA) is building the 'Plato' observatory, which will have 24 cameras as its 'eyes' to search for Earth-like exoplanets. The cameras are being installed by the German company OHB, and the observatory will use all 26 cameras simultaneously to scan large areas of the sky for transiting signals from planets similar to Earth orbiting stars similar to the Sun. The 'Plato' mission will focus on finding a 'second Earth' and will also help to better understand the structure and internal dynamics of other stars by detecting their brightness fluctuations and seismic waves. The observatory will have a wide field of view and will be able to study over 200,000 Sun-like stars during its operation. The simultaneous coverage of a large area is crucial to not miss a brief transiting event, when a planet passes in front of its star, slightly changing its brightness. 'Plato' will search for potentially interesting objects, which scientists can then observe with other telescopes, both ground-based and space-based. As ESA's Director said, 'It will be a great day when we find a second Earth.'

**Soviet-era probe meant for Venus crashes off Indonesia**
A Soviet-era space probe, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, has crashed into the Indian Ocean off the coast of Indonesia after re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. The probe, originally meant to land on Venus, failed to escape the Earth's gravity due to a malfunction and has been orbiting the planet for 53 years. According to Roscosmos, 'The device was launched to explore Venus but remained in a high elliptical orbit around Earth due to a malfunction in the upper stage and gradually approached the planet.' The probe's crash was widely anticipated by space agencies, and while it was initially thought to be robust enough to survive re-entry, Roscosmos stated that 'Kosmos 482 no longer exists'.

**A Soviet spacecraft is hurtling towards Earth after five decades in orbit – Virgin Islands Free Press**
The Soviet spacecraft Kosmos 482, which was meant to travel to Venus but malfunctioned and entered an elliptical orbit around Earth, is expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. According to astronomer Jonathan McDowell, the spacecraft's final rocket stage malfunctioned, causing it to not reach escape velocity. McDowell says it's difficult to predict where the capsule will land, but estimates that the re-entry time will be narrowed down to a few hours by late Friday or early Saturday. The capsule is equipped with a heat shield designed to withstand temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, but it's unclear whether it will survive re-entry after 50 years in orbit. McDowell notes that the capsule will likely land in the ocean, which covers 70% of the planet's surface, but there's a possibility it will pass close enough to civilization to allow for spectacular photos of the spacecraft blazing through the sky. 'If you can survive Venus, you can absolutely survive Earth,' McDowell said. However, he added, 'I don’t really know whether exposure to the outer atmosphere has kind of cracked the shield or degraded it in some way.'

**A failed Soviet Venus probe is falling to Earth. Here's what it might look like**
A failed Soviet Venus probe, Kosmos 482, is expected to fall back to Earth on May 10, 2025. The probe, which has been in orbit for over 50 years, was launched in 1972 as part of the Soviet Union's Venera program but never reached Venus due to problems with its launch vehicle. According to forecasts, Kosmos 482 will reenter Earth's atmosphere and may survive its trip through the air intact, potentially slamming down onto the surface or water. The spacecraft's size and weight are similar to a recent capsule returned by Varda Space, which measured about 3 feet in diameter and weighed around 265 pounds. If Kosmos 482 survives, it will impact Earth's surface at about 150 mph. Recent spacecraft reentries, such as those of SpaceX's Starlink satellites and a dead Chinese satellite, have offered clues to what the public might see during Kosmos 482's reentry, which could be a single fireball streaking through the sky.

**Cold War-era Soviet probe set to crash back to Earth next week**
A 53-year-old Soviet Union's Kosmos 482 Venus lander is predicted to crash into the Earth's atmosphere on May 10, 2025. The spacecraft was launched in 1972 but failed to reach Venus and instead entered orbit around the Earth. According to the SatTrackCam Leiden blog, the present rate of decay will have the capsule hitting the Earth's atmosphere somewhere between 52° North and 52° South latitude. While the impact is unlikely to cause harm, the landing capsule consists of instruments sealed inside a semi-globular titanium protective shell designed to withstand passage through the Venusian atmosphere and survive on the surface of Venus for over an hour. If it doesn't break up on reentry, it stands a good chance of reaching the ground, but the odds of it pranging on top of someone are extremely low due to the large amount of uninhabited land area.

**Failed Soviet satellite hurtling towards Earth may hit like a meteorite, tracker warns**
A 53-year-old Soviet space probe, a landing capsule from a failed Venera mission, is expected to reenter the Earth's atmosphere around May 10, 2025. According to Dutch satellite tracker Marco Langbroek, there is a small chance it will burn up on reentry, but it was built to survive landing on Venus, making it possible for it to survive reentry intact and impact the Earth. The probe, about a meter across and weighing 500kg, could hit the Earth at a speed of 250kmph, posing risks similar to a meteorite impact. The risks involved are not particularly high, but not zero, and the exact location of the impact remains unclear, with possible locations ranging from the UK to New Zealand. Trackers are continuing to observe the space probe to gather more data and pinpoint the exact date and location of the reentry.

**A failed Soviet Venus lander will fall back to Earth after being stranded for 53 years**
The Soviet Union's Cosmos 482, a Venus lander that failed to reach the planet in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere in about two weeks, on or near May 9-10. According to satellite watcher Marco Langbroek, the landing module, custom-made to withstand reentry through Venus' atmosphere, might survive reentry through Earth's atmosphere intact. However, Langbroek notes that the risks involved are not zero, and the impact could be similar to that of a meteorite. The reentry model, developed by Langbroek and his colleague Dominic Dirkx, predicts an end velocity of around 145 miles per hour-plus on impact. Langbroek says, 'I wouldn't bet on that working now, and would assume that, if it survives re-entry, it would come down hard.' The Cosmos 482 was a sister probe to Venera 8, which successfully landed on Venus in 1972 and relayed data from the planet's surface for 50 minutes and 11 seconds.

**NASA's daredevil solar spacecraft survives 2nd close flyby of our sun**
NASA's Parker Solar Probe has successfully completed its second close flyby of the sun, collecting science data about solar wind from inside the sun's corona. The spacecraft, which is the size of a car, swooped within 3.8 million miles of the sun's surface at a speed of 430,000 miles per hour, matching its historic record set last year. The probe operated autonomously, collecting data with its four science instruments, and beamed back a beacon tone on Tuesday, signaling that it was in good health. Scientists hope the close-up data will help them better predict space weather and solve long-standing mysteries about the sun. The spacecraft's record-setting achievements highlight the effectiveness of its custom heat shield, which safeguards the probe from the sun's intense heat. The Parker Solar Probe team was recently honored with the 2024 Robert J. Collier Trophy annual award for their work on the mission.

The NASA's Parker Solar Probe has successfully recorded the 'sound of the Sun' when it 'touched' the surface of the massive star. The spacecraft captured the sound of the solar winds and particles that the Sun expels, which are the energetic motor that drives life on our planet. According to NASA data, the spacecraft was 3.8 million miles or 6 million kilometers away from the central star, just 6% of the distance between Mars. The spacecraft survived the close approach and made contact on December 27. As stated by the official Parker Solar Probe account, 'Parker Solar Probe has called home. After passing just 3.8 million miles from the solar surface on December 24 (the closest solar flyby in history), we've received the radio tone from the Parker Solar Probe that confirms the spacecraft is safe.' The probe can withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit and has a thermal shield that keeps its instruments at a comfortable 85°F. Manuel Mazzanti, a space program journalist, notes that the Parker Solar Probe is also the fastest human-made object, reaching speeds of 692,000 km/h.

**Unveiling the Mysteries of the Sun**
The NASA's Parker solar probe, traveling at a record speed of 692,000 km/h, recently reached a record distance of six million kilometers from the Sun. According to NASA scientists, the probe survived the extreme heat and will continue its journey until at least September next year. The data collected by the Parker solar probe aims to better understand solar winds and the paradox of the solar atmosphere, where the outer layer (the solar corona) is much hotter than the surface of the Sun, as stated by NASA. 'The data collected by the Parker solar probe will help us to better understand the solar corona and its extreme heat,' said NASA scientists. 'This will allow us to improve our knowledge of the Sun's behavior and its impact on the solar system.'
