**Weed still low priority for Austin cops after court ruling**
The Austin Police Department (APD) will not hold or arrest people for marijuana possession for now, following a court decision that struck down a city ordinance decriminalizing small amounts of marijuana. According to APD Chief Lisa David, 'we will be going with the way we were policing before.' The city is still analyzing the ruling and determining the next steps. Meanwhile, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick continues to push for a ban on all hemp products in the state, with a bill to enact an all-out ban on THC passing through the Texas Senate. However, a bill to tighten regulations on hemp sales has advanced through the House, and legislation to expand access to medical cannabis has also been approved.

**Texas House passes bill expanding compassionate use of medical cannabis**
The Texas House has passed House Bill 46, which expands the compassionate use of medical cannabis in the state. The bill, authored by State Rep. Ken King (R-Canadian), aims to address the issue of limited access to low-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cannabis for Texans who are legally allowed to receive it. According to King, the state initially approved low-THC cannabis for epilepsy treatment 10 years ago, but the program has been hindered by a lack of licensed dispensing organizations and restrictive storage and distribution laws. HB 46 requires the Texas Department of Public Safety to issue 11 licenses to dispensing organizations, allows for secure storage facilities without additional licenses, and expands the list of qualifying conditions for low-THC cannabis prescriptions. State Rep. Penny Morales Shaw (D-Houston) praised the bill, saying it provides an alternative to addictive opioids and will allow working families to manage chronic pain, Crohn's disease, and other conditions in an able-bodied way. King noted that this bill only deals with the Texas Compassionate Use program and that another bill, Senate Bill 3, will be introduced soon.

**Texas House OKs bill to expand medical marijuana provisions**
The Texas House has approved a bill to expand the state's medical marijuana program, giving veterans broad access to THC treatments and increasing the number of dispensaries allowed in the state. The bill, which was approved on a 118-16 vote, would nearly double the number of medical conditions non-veterans would be eligible for treatment under the Texas Compassionate Use Program. Military veterans would be given special access, and their doctors would be allowed to prescribe low-dose THC for conditions not on the state's list. The bill also raises the number of allowed dispensaries to 11 and lets them store inventory in various regions of the state, cutting down on delivery expenses and the time it takes for patients to get their prescriptions. According to Rep. Christina Morales, 'This is an amazing alternative to addictive, harmful opioids, which we know is a huge problem. This bill empowers individuals and families to avoid those dangerous drugs.' However, State Rep. David Lowe voted against the bill, saying that he doesn't believe marijuana is an effective treatment for PTSD or other problems veterans have, citing advice from the VA that 'any type of marijuana use for PTSD only masks the symptoms. Don't ever do that.'

**Texas Lawmakers Approve Bill To Expand Medical Cannabis Program**
Texas lawmakers have approved a bill to expand the state's medical cannabis program, allowing for a broader range of qualifying medical conditions and the prescription of vaping cannabis products. The bill, backed by Representatives Ken King and Penny Morales Shaw, aims to increase access to medical cannabis while introducing more explicit rules around its use and distribution. If enacted, it would add conditions such as chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, and Crohn's disease to the list of eligible conditions, and give licensed dispensaries the ability to establish additional satellite locations. The measure also clarifies that any group dispensing low-THC cannabis must hold a license from the Department of Public Safety and limits each package or container to no more than 1.2 grams of THC. As stated by Representative Ken King, 'This bill is a step in the right direction to provide relief to those in need.'

**Texas House set to vote on major medical cannabis expansion**
The Texas House is set to vote on House Bill 46, a comprehensive expansion of the Compassionate Use Program, which would allow Texans to use cannabis for medical purposes in various forms, including patches, lotions, and vaping devices. The bill, authored by State Rep. Ken King, would also add chronic pain, glaucoma, and other conditions to the list of qualifying conditions. Heather Fazio, director of the Texas Cannabis Policy Center, said, 'This comprehensive program expansion has been a long time coming.' King's proposal is in contrast to Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick's proposed near-total ban on THC. The bill would also give authority to the Texas Department of State Health Services to add any condition they designate at any time if the bill becomes law.

**Pressing deadlines, unfinished business: Where the Legislature stands...**
With less than three weeks remaining in the Texas Legislature's 140-day session, several major issues remain unresolved. Governor Greg Abbott has secured passage of his top priority, school vouchers, but other key issues such as property tax cuts, water infrastructure, and teacher pay raises are still pending. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick's social conservative priorities, including bills to infuse more religion into public schools and restrict the use of bathrooms by transgender people, are also awaiting action. Despite the looming deadlines, lawmakers are optimistic that they can meet their goals, with Senate Education Committee Chair Sen. Brandon Creighton saying that leaders from both chambers are making 'meaningful progress on reconciling differences.' However, the session is expected to be contentious, with Patrick threatening to force a special session if his priorities are not met. Meanwhile, the House and Senate are working to finalize a $7.7 billion public education spending plan, with House GOP leaders pushing for across-the-board raises for school staff and Senate Republicans advocating for teacher pay raises. The session is also expected to address the state's water crisis, with a bipartisan measure to dedicate $1 billion a year for the next decade to shore up the state's water infrastructure. Additionally, the Legislature is considering a bill to clarify when a doctor can legally provide an abortion under the state's near-total ban, and a measure to ban products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive element in marijuana. 'The system is set up to kill stuff, not to pass stuff,' said Ken Armbrister, a conservative Democrat who spent four years in the House and two decades in the Senate. 'Something that's not on the tip of everybody's tongue, or it's a new idea of doing things -- it could take a couple of sessions.'

**Texas medical marijuana: House passes bill to expand Compassionate-Use Program**
House Bill 46 has passed in the Texas House with a 122-21 vote, aiming to expand the Compassionate-Use Program for medical marijuana. The bill would allow patients to use low-THC cannabis products, including patches, lotions, inhalers, and vapes, for medical necessity. It would also include honorably discharged veterans, those with chronic pain, glaucoma, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions. The bill seeks to improve access to dispensaries, with 11 licensed locations across Texas and satellite locations allowed with state approval. According to Rep. Ken King, 'Texans still struggle to get access to the medicine they're legally allowed to receive.' Rep. Penny Morales Shaw added, 'Right now too many of our fellow Texans are forced to suffer or self-medicate because they don't have sufficient access.' The bill now faces an uncertain fate in the Texas Senate.

**Texas House signals expanding state's medical marijuana program**
The Texas House has advanced a bill to expand the state's medical marijuana program, allowing for prescribed smokable products and expanding the list of qualifying conditions to include chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, Crohn's disease, and degenerative disc disease. The bill, House Bill 46, would also allow licensed dispensers to open more satellite locations, making it easier for patients to access the medicine they need. Rep. Ken King said, 'There are too many Texans who are still struggling to get access to the medicine they legally have a right to receive.' Supporters argue that this expansion will help to prevent the industry from crumbling and provide an alternative to addictive opioids. Terrence Baugh, marketing manager for goodblend, said, 'This method puts wear and tear on our vehicles. Limits the amount of time we can spend with patients and can compromise product integrity.' The bill would correct some of these problems by allowing medical marijuana distributors to store their products in various satellite locations instead of having to drive across the state to return the product every day.

**Dan Patrick Says He'll Push Special Session if Texas Doesn't Ban THC or Change Bail Laws**
Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has stated that he will push for a special session of the Texas Legislature if lawmakers fail to ban THC or tighten Texas' bail laws before the current session ends in early June. Patrick has leverage to compel special sessions by killing must-pass legislation, and has done so in the past. He is targeting the hemp industry, which he claims has exploited a loophole in a 2019 state law, and is pushing for Senate Bill 3, which would effectively shutter the industry by making it illegal to possess or manufacture products containing THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program. Patrick also wants to amend the state's bail laws to keep certain criminal defendants in jail as they await the resolution of their cases, citing concerns about public safety. He has a number of hostage options, including the two-year state budget and several agencies up for sunset review. Patrick said, 'You just can't regulate it. You've gotta take it out,' referring to the hemp industry. He also stated, 'People are dying because of issues with bail,' emphasizing the importance of addressing the issue.

**Top 10 Issues in the Cannabis Industry for 2025**
The cannabis industry is facing several significant developments in 2025. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has postponed the hearing on rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III due to an appeal. This delay has the potential to have dire consequences on producers, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. Meanwhile, the SAFER Banking Act, which aims to provide the cannabis industry access to financial services, has failed to receive a vote before the end of the 118th Congressional session. The bill's prospect of being revived in the 119th Congressional session is highly unlikely. In the Washington, DC, cannabis market, all cannabis establishments must be operational and compliant with the District's regulations by March 31, 2025. New York is increasing the number of licenses available from 275 to over 625 in 2025, and a new grant program will award up to $30,000 to CAURD retailers for business owners who have, in the past, been impacted by marijuana-related convictions. Several states, including Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Texas, aim to legalize cannabis for adult use in 2025. The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) will now apply only to foreign entities registered to do business in the United States. Cannabis companies will want to be aware of comprehensive data privacy laws taking effect in 2025 as more states aim to protect consumers' personal data. Hackers are increasingly creative at leveraging malware and other threats to breach systems and gain access to customers' data. Cannabis companies should be aware of Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, which bars cannabis companies from taking certain deductions or applying certain credits otherwise available to businesses in other industries. Two bills were recently introduced in the House and Senate, respectively, which seek to bar cannabis businesses' from utilizing these benefits, even if cannabis was rescheduled to Schedule III. In the last year, some states and the federal government have taken an increasingly hostile stance toward hemp-derived products containing THC. California recently extended a 2024 emergency ban prohibiting the sale of products containing any detectable level of hemp-derived THC. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has integrated into various aspects of our everyday lives since its inception, and we are quickly approaching a time when it will be fully incorporated into a wide variety of cannabis-related functions at every stage of the process -- from growing to warehousing to retailing. Given cannabis' status as a Schedule I substance under the CSA, most cannabis products are ineligible for federal trademark protection. However, some states allow for trademark registration of cannabis products -- though such protection does not extend past state lines.

**How Dan Patrick's pledge to ban THC in Texas could shutter an $8B industry**
A proposed ban on THC products in Texas could have devastating consequences for the $8 billion industry, which includes smokeshops, high-end restaurants, and retailers. Critics argue that the industry has gone too far and that THC gummies are being sold to children. However, retailers and farmers say a ban would be unfair and that new safety regulations, such as age restrictions and product testing requirements, would be a better solution. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has expressed concerns about the industry, stating that 8,000 locations have opened up in the last two years selling above the marijuana limit. Cities across the state have started cracking down on smoke shop operations, and an investigation found that some products tested over the legal limit for delta-9 THC. Some consumers are hesitant to buy due to a lack of clarity about what is in the products. Shop owners say they are doing their due diligence, but a blanket ban would only hurt people who rely on the products.

**THC ban coming to Texas? Texas Ag Commissioner Sid Miller weighs in | Texas: The Issue Is**
Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller weighs in on Senate Bill 3, which aims to ban all non-medical THC in the state. Miller says the bill will restore the original intent of the law passed in 2019 and parallel federal law. However, he is torn about the bill, as it could put 8,000 businesses out of business. Miller hopes the bill will close the door on recreational marijuana in Texas and loosen restrictions on medical marijuana, allowing doctors and patients to prescribe medication as they see fit. 'I'd rather get bureaucrats and politicians out of people's medication and let the doctors and patients prescribe that to the patients as they see fit. That would be the ultimate freedom right there,' Miller said. 'We're not going to conflict with federal law. What we're trying to do is parallel and mirror. Federal law. Everything in the legislation currently follows federal law. What's outside the law is possibly the Delta-8, Delta-9 loophole,' Miller added.

**Proposed THC ban draws crowds to Austin, casting uncertainty over Texas' booming cannabis industry**
A proposed THC ban in Texas has drawn hundreds of people to Austin, casting uncertainty over the state's booming cannabis industry. Sen. Charles Perry, who authored the bill SB3, said, 'We've got to get the genie back in the bottle.' The bill aims to ban THC products with levels above 0.3%, but cannabis companies argue that this would force many shops to close. Allen Police Chief Steve Dye said that the current loophole allows for the sale of illegal products with high THC levels, making them stronger and more addictive. However, John Burk, the owner of Shell Shock CBD, argued that Texans don't want a ban and that veterans like himself use THC as a safer alternative to opioids. The committee will meet again to vote on the bill, which is expected to pass in the full Senate but faces uncertainty in the House.

**Texas hemp production, sales have been legal since 2019. Why one senator wants to ban THC.**
Texas Senator Perry has proposed a bill to ban THC in the state, citing concerns over the misuse of the hemp industry and potential health risks. However, dozens of witnesses testified before a Senate panel that a total ban would have unintended economic and health consequences, including destroying hemp industry businesses and harming the Texas economy. Many veterans also spoke out against the ban, saying they use hemp products to combat chronic issues like post-traumatic stress disorder. Perry's alternative bill, SB 1505, aims to expand the state's medical marijuana program and provide more access to medical users. According to Perry, the current hemp program has been 'ruined' by the misuse of consumable hemp, and the ban is necessary to protect public health. However, others argue that increased regulation is the solution, not a total ban. As one veteran, Dave Walden, said, 'The Texas Legislature has always supported veterans, yet you’re considering a bill that would push us back to the same failed system of opioids that has already claimed too many of our brothers and sisters.'

**Will Texas ban THC products? What to know about Senate Bill 3, backed by GOP lawmakers**
Texas lawmakers are considering Senate Bill 3, which would ban nearly all forms of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. The bill, backed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, aims to tighten regulations around THC products sold in convenience stores and vape shops. Supporters, including State Sen. Charles Perry, claim that the previous legislation created a loophole for retailers to sell dangerous products to adults and children. Perry said, 'If they are really honest with you, most of them will tell you without the THC products, they can't be profitable, and so the gig is up.' The ban would not include cannabis-infused products such as CBD or CBG, but possession of consumable hemp products would be punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of $4,000. Opponents, including Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, worry that the complete ban would hurt thousands of businesses, mostly mom and pops, that have invested their life savings into opening these new businesses.

A new survey from the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs found that 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support a comprehensive medical marijuana program. However, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick plans to ban all consumable THC products in the state during the upcoming Texas legislative session. Heather Fazio, director of the Texas Cannabis Policy Center, said, 'A majority of Texans, including Republicans, want to see prohibition repealed and a legal market for cannabis instituted.' Fazio also stated that Texans don't want to see under-regulated industries and prefer a comprehensive legal infrastructure where products are tested, labeled, and have consumer protection. She added that the sales of THC products are regulated at the state and federal level, but there is room for improvement, especially when it comes to age restrictions and packaging standards.

**The Current Landscape of Texas Cannabis Policy and Laws: A 2025 Overview**
The Texas legislative session has begun, and cannabis policy is a major topic of debate. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick is pushing for a ban on all forms of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products, citing concerns over unregulated and potentially dangerous products. However, some lawmakers, such as State Representative Jessica González, are advocating for the legalization of recreational marijuana. González's House Bill 1208 would permit adults to use, possess, and transport up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis, with a 10% tax on cannabis sales. The medical marijuana program in Texas remains limited, but advocates are pushing for expansion and better regulation. The outcome of this session will shape the future of cannabis policy in the state.

A proposed ban on all THC products in Texas has sparked debate among lawmakers and business owners. Supporters of the ban, including Lt. Governor and Sen. Perry, argue that dangerous intoxicating products are being sold in the state, while opponents, including business owners, claim that THC products provide relief from various maladies. Despite the controversy, most analysts believe that strict regulations will be implemented instead of a blanket ban. The fate of THC in Texas will be decided during the current legislative session, where several bills aim to expand access to medical marijuana or legalize recreational cannabis.
