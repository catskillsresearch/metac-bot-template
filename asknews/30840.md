**Fears major law change could 'cut the guts' out of entire rural industry: 'It can't be fixed'**
The Australian Labor Government's plan to ban live sheep exports in 2028 is feared to 'cut the guts' out of the rural industry, particularly the merino wool industry in Western Australia. Industry insiders argue that the ban will have a ripple effect, decimating the industry and impacting farmers, laborers, and businesses in rural communities. While animal advocates welcome the ban, citing animal welfare concerns, the Australian Livestock Exporters' Council disputes these claims, stating that exporters have improved significantly since reforms in 2018. The industry warns that the ban will lead to a decline in sheep prices, reduced income for farmers, and potentially even the slaughter of sheep due to lack of demand. Shearers, who can earn up to $750 per day, will also face inconsistent work and potential unemployment. 'It's not really good having groups of shearers just sitting around,' said WA Shearing Industry Association president Darren Spencer. 'The ban doesn't come into effect until 2028, but farmers are making decisions now on what they do,' he added. 'Right across our membership here, most contractors have got a lot less work,' Spencer said. 'Live sheep export is fundamentally cruel and it cannot be fixed. Literally millions of sheep have died and all have suffered through this trade in live animals,' an Animals Australia spokesperson said. 'What it boils down to is this government has made a deal with activists and made this decision based on ideology rather than evidence,' said Australian Livestock Exporters' Council CEO Mark Harvey-Sutton.

**67 Dogs Rescued from Grim Fate at Dog Meat Farm  --  with Help from 'Wheel of Time' Star Daniel Henney**
In a historic rescue, 67 dogs were saved from a dog meat farm in South Korea, which was shut down due to cruelty violations. Actor Daniel Henney, a longtime advocate for Humane World for Animals, joined the rescue effort, helping to relocate the dogs to the United States. The dogs, mostly Jindo-mixes, were in poor condition, with some having deformed bones caused by nutritional deficiency. Henney, who has a personal connection to the issue, having rescued a dog from the South Korea dog meat trade in 2020, was visibly emotional during the rescue. 'They're not even eating their food, they just want love,' he said of the canines. The dogs will receive veterinary care and be placed up for adoption. This rescue is significant as it is the first since South Korea's dog meat ban was passed, which will officially go into effect in 2027.

**Advocating for California's animals**
Staff and volunteers from Marin Humane attended Animal Advocacy Day at the California state Capitol to advocate for three key issues: closing the puppy mill pipeline, increasing access to veterinary care, and enhancing animal protection. Assembly Bills 519, 506, and 928 aim to address these issues by requiring online pet brokers to disclose animal origins, allowing registered veterinary technicians to perform certain tasks, and prohibiting large-scale cockfighting operations. According to Assemblymember Chris Rogers, cockfighting is a multi-million-dollar industry involving over 3 million birds in California. The bills aim to improve animal welfare in the state and Marin Humane is hopeful they will pass. 'California leads the way in animal welfare,' said Rogers. 'We're hopeful these important bills will pass.'

**Slovenia Introduces New Laws on Animal Protection and Agriculture**
The Slovenian government is planning to introduce a new law on animal protection, which will include mandatory microchipping of cats. The law is expected to come into effect on May 1, 2025. The current law on animal protection has been amended several times in recent years, with the latest changes aimed at improving the treatment of animals in shelters. However, some critics argue that the law does not go far enough in protecting animals. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food has proposed a new law on beekeeping, which would allow for the use of drones to monitor bee colonies. The proposal has sparked controversy among beekeepers, who are concerned about the impact of drones on their livelihoods. The Ministry has also proposed a new law on hunting and fishing, which would introduce stricter regulations on the use of certain hunting methods. The proposals are currently undergoing public consultation. Additionally, the Ministry has announced plans to introduce a new law on animal welfare, which would include stricter regulations on the treatment of animals in shelters and the use of animals in scientific research. The law would also introduce a new system for reporting animal cruelty. The Ministry has stated that the new law is aimed at improving animal welfare and reducing animal cruelty. However, some critics argue that the law does not go far enough in protecting animals. The Ministry has also announced plans to introduce a new law on agriculture, which would include stricter regulations on the use of pesticides and fertilizers. The proposals are currently undergoing public consultation.

**Ecuadorian National Assembly Rejects Motion to Archive Animal Rights Law Project**
The Ecuadorian National Assembly rejected a motion to archive the Organic Law Project for the Protection and Defense of Animal Rights (Lopda) with 54 affirmative votes, allowing the project to return to the Biodiversity and Natural Resources Commission for further analysis. The decision comes after a heated debate between animal rights and productive sectors, following a 2022 Constitutional Court mandate. The project aims to regulate the rights of non-human animals and responds to a 2022 court ruling recognizing animals as subjects of rights. The Lopda project was presented by the Ombudsman's Office in August 2022 and includes measures such as the prohibition of cruel practices and the regulation of animal production. However, after the first debate on August 1, 2024, the Biodiversity Commission introduced modifications that generated criticism from animal rights groups. The decision not to archive the Lopda has sparked divided reactions, with some groups demanding its archive, calling it 'regressive' and contrary to the Constitutional Court's mandate. Others, including productive sectors, have defended the modifications, arguing that the original project would increase food production costs and affect food sovereignty. The project will now return to the Biodiversity Commission for adjustments, with a new report to be presented within 90 days, after which it will return to the Plenary for its final debate. If approved, the norm will be sent to the Executive for its approval or veto.

**Newsom calls on California cities to effectively ban homeless encampments**
California Governor Gavin Newsom is urging local governments to effectively ban public camping and close dangerous encampments. He released a template ordinance that cities and counties can adopt, which includes provisions such as a ban on persistent camping, blocking sidewalk passageways, and making reasonable efforts to offer shelter before clearing camps. Newsom stated, 'The time for inaction is over, there are no more excuses.' The announcement comes after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling granted officials authority to enforce strict camping bans and clear encampments. Newsom also plans to release $3.3 billion for local governments to expand mental health and addiction facilities through Proposition 1.

**European Countries Say No to Fur Business, Last Fur Farms to Close**
More European countries are saying no to the fur business, leading to the closure of the last remaining fur farms. According to a service published on Delfi.lt, as part of the international project Pulse, 'more and more European countries are choosing to ban fur farms, or the breeding and slaughter of animals solely for their fur'. Not only that, 'in some countries that have made this decision, the last fur farms are about to be closed'. Lithuania has banned fur farming, with the law coming into effect on January 1, 2024, and all fur farms will be closed by January 1, 2027. 'The law on the ban of fur farming in Lithuania entered into force on January 1, 2024, and from January 1, 2027, it will be prohibited to keep, breed, sell, or otherwise transfer animals solely for the purpose of obtaining their fur' - the service reports. Those who close their fur farms will receive compensation, with the Ministry of Agriculture stating that the Commission for the Environment has proposed a graduated indemnity principle. 'Those who closed their activities in 2024 may receive 3 euros per unit, in 2025 2 euros, and those who withdrew from the market in 2026 1 euro. In addition, 100% of the costs of demolition of the building, destruction of equipment, and severance pay for employees will be compensated by the agricultural company' - the service reports. The ban on fur farming in Lithuania was adopted thanks to the active involvement of environmental organizations and public bodies, such as 'Empty Cages' (Gabbie vuote), as well as residents of the country. In some cases, fur farms have been closed before the law came into effect due to the severity of animal welfare regulations.

**Opposition to California's Prop 12 Gaining Steam**
The Center for Environment and Welfare (CEW) has launched a campaign to stop California's Prop 12, citing 'far-reaching consequences' and increased grocery prices. The campaign, called 'Food Price Fix,' includes a website, educational video, and letter-writing initiative. Will Coggin, research director at CEW, said, 'Consumers who have never stepped foot in California are paying the price for its overreaching, inflationary law.' The campaign follows the introduction of The Food Security and Farm Protection Act, which aims to prevent states from interfering with commerce and agricultural practices. Many agricultural producers support this legislative solution, citing the negative consequences of regulations like Prop 12, including increased costs and higher prices for consumers. According to data from Numerator, the price of a dozen eggs rose nearly $3 over last year, reaching $6.54 in March 2025, an increase of 82% compared with March 2024.

**Lawmakers must defend California law on farm animal safety**
The Food Security and Farm Protection Act (S. 1326) poses a threat to state laws promoting humane farming practices, such as California's Proposition 12 and Massachusetts' Question 3. These laws require animals used for food to have basic freedoms, like lying down, turning around, and moving freely. The author, grateful for states taking action, urges lawmakers Rep. Sara Jacobs, Sens. Alex Padilla, and Adam Schiff to vote against the Act and defend animals against extreme cruelty, saying 'I hope that my lawmakers will do the right thing by voting against the Food Security and Farm Protection Act.'

**Congress Keeps Trying to Overturn State Agriculture Laws**
The 'Food Security and Farm Protection Act' (S. 1326) has been introduced in the US Senate, which would create a private right of action for anyone affected by another state's agricultural regulation to bring suit and invalidate it. Proponents of the bill have characterized laws like California's Proposition 12 and Massachusetts's Question 3, which set animal welfare standards for certain animal products, as part of a 'war on breakfast.' However, critics argue that the bill would give foreign adversaries like China an even bigger chokehold on American agricultural production while harming producers and principles of state sovereignty. The bill's introduction on April 8, 2025, coincided with the start of a trade war with China, and critics argue that it would create an internal mechanism for China to invalidate state laws they don't like. The bill has been criticized by farmers, lawmakers, and experts, who argue that it would lead to more consolidation in the food industry and give more power to big players like Smithfield Foods, which is owned by a Chinese holding company.

**Chinese-owned farms press for repeal of CA animal welfare law**
Chinese-owned farms, including Smithfield Foods, are pressuring California lawmakers to repeal the state's animal welfare law, Proposition 12. The law, which aims to improve the treatment of pigs and other farm animals, has been met with opposition from the pork industry, which claims it will increase costs and lead to job losses. Meanwhile, a new study has found that small farms are disproportionately impacted by extreme heat, with temperatures affecting crop yields and the health of livestock. The study analyzed 56 million cow-level production records across 18,000 dairy farms from 2012 to 2016. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., has introduced a bill, the Honor Farmer Contracts Act, which would require the USDA to give a 60-day notice of any agency closures. The bill aims to protect farmers from disruptions to their grants and contracts. As the US is the third-largest pork producer in the world, exporting around one-third of the pork it produces domestically, the debate over animal welfare and farm ownership continues.

**Senate Bill Could Roll Back State Animal Welfare Laws and Voter Protections - One Green Planet**
A new Senate bill, the Food Security and Farm Protection Act, introduced by Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), is raising concerns among animal advocates. According to Humane World for Animals, the bill would undo key animal welfare and public health laws across the United States, nullifying state laws such as California's Proposition 12, which bans the sale of pork, veal, and eggs from animals raised in cruel confinement. Kitty Block, president and CEO of Humane World for Animals, explained that the bill would 'nullify a slew of state laws' designed to protect farm animals and public health, while Sara Amundson, president of the Humane World Action Fund, added that the bill 'would hand over sweeping power to a narrow segment of the agriculture industry,' ignoring voter-supported protections for humane farming practices, food safety, and farm workers' rights.

**Senate Measure Would End California’s Animal-Welfare Law Created by Prop 12**
Republican lawmakers in the U.S. Senate have introduced the Food Security and Farm Protection Act, which aims to strike down California's animal-welfare law created by Proposition 12. The law, which was passed in 2018, requires that pigs be housed in conditions allowing them to turn around without touching an enclosure, and that they have at least 24 square feet of space. The new legislation, introduced by Sens. Charles Grassley, Joni Ernst, and Roger Marshall, would prevent any state or local government from passing laws that interfere with commerce and agricultural practices outside their jurisdictions. This move has drawn support from the nation's largest pork interest group.

**Trump Cabinet nominee says she’ll work to kill California pork law**
Brooke Rollins, the nominee for agriculture secretary, has expressed her commitment to working with Senator Joni Ernst to pass the EATS Act, a bill that would override California's Proposition 12, a voter-approved initiative that bans the sale of meat from pigs held in small cages. Rollins stated, 'Under a proper system of government, “we don’t have states telling our producers how they can raise their livestock,” Prop 12, she said, is “not just affecting California. It’s affecting multitudes of other states.” The pork industry is hoping that with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, they can pass the legislation to preempt the state law. However, the legislation has been met with opposition from animal-protection groups and some Republicans, who argue that the law is effective and valuable. Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action, stated, 'I’m disappointed that the incoming secretary of agriculture wants to nullify a lopsided state election that has triggered implementation of a very effective and valuable law.' The state of California has defended its law, with Steve Lyle, spokesperson for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, stating, 'The state’s voters “overwhelmingly adopted Proposition 12 and California will defend its law.'

**Trump's Appointed Agriculture Secretary Vows to Repeal Controversial California Animal Welfare Law**
Donald Trump has appointed Brooke Rollins as the new US Secretary of Agriculture. During a hearing in the US Senate on January 23, Rollins stated that she will work to repeal a law in California that imposes stricter animal welfare requirements, particularly in pig production. The law, known as Proposition 12, has been controversial among pig farmers. Rollins said, 'I am a strong supporter of federalism, which means that states have the right to self-determination. However, in this specific case, it is clear that it is not just about California, but also about other states and parts of the agricultural industry, including family farms with pigs. Iowa, as well as many other states, have been severely affected by this. Yes, I would like to cooperate with you on this, and I look forward to it.' The law, which was passed in 2018, requires a minimum of 2.2 square meters per pregnant sow, which is more than twice the current standard. The law has caused significant discontent among American pig producer associations. However, with a 5-4 majority, the US Supreme Court approved California's Higher Animal Welfare Act in 2023, which was then implemented. The law not only affects pig producers in California but also producers from other states who want to sell to California must comply with the requirements.
