**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Elon Musk say it's '50/50' he'll land on Mars next year and he needs to 'get lucky' - Daily Star**
Elon Musk says there is a '50/50 chance' of landing a spaceship on Mars next year, and he needs to 'get lucky'. Despite recent test flight failures, Musk remains optimistic about progress towards establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. He believes reusable rockets will enable more than a million people to live on Mars within 30 years. Musk hopes to send 20 ships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with the goal of building a self-sufficient city that could survive even if cut off from Earth. He is scouting possible sites for a Mars city, with Arcadia Planitia being the leading candidate. Musk aims to fly 100 ships to Mars between 2030 and 2031 and 500 more in 2033. He said, 'This is, like, an incredible thing to have - this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet and a new world.'

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak predicts a dystopian future for humanity, with the global population shrinking to 100 million by 2300 due to AI replacing jobs and causing a collapse in birth rates. According to Prof. Kak, 'Computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will be doing literally all that we do because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He warns that major cities like New York and London will become ghost towns, and that the world will be devastated. Prof. Kak, author of 'The Age of Artificial Intelligence', says that people are unaware of the consequences of AI and that it's likely that the world population will collapse. He also mentions that billionaire Elon Musk has expressed similar concerns, suggesting that humans should consider colonizing space to avoid extinction. Prof. Kak states, 'It's likely. I have all the data in the book. This is not just my personal opinion.'

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, including decision-making in offices, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that demographers are predicting a population collapse due to AI, and that the great cities of the world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to 100 million. He also notes that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, and suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing space may be a viable option to ensure humanity's survival.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Half of the world's population suffered an additional month of extreme heat: "Climate change is here and it kills"**
According to Climate Central, 4 billion people experienced at least 30 additional days of extreme heat, with some countries experiencing up to 48 days. Without human-induced climate change, these temperatures would have been significantly lower. Kristina Dahl, Chief Scientist at Climate Central, stated, 'There is no place on Earth that has not been affected by climate change, and heat is its deadliest consequence.' Mariam Zachariah, a researcher on global weather event attribution, noted that frequent and intense heat episodes have severe effects, including heat-related illnesses, deaths, and crop losses. The Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre's Roop Singh emphasized, 'The evidence of the link between climate change and heatwaves is undeniable.' The planet is likely to exceed the 1.5°C threshold compared to pre-industrial levels with a 70% probability between 2025 and 2029.

**The 'no warning' asteroid that changed how scientists defend Earth - Manchester Evening News**
A 60 ft asteroid that struck Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013, injuring over 1,600 people and shattering glass for miles, was not detected prior to impact. The event serves as a reminder that an unknown asteroid could occur at any time. Currently, there are no known major threats to Earth, but NASA had previously estimated a 3.1% chance of asteroid 2024 YR4 impacting Earth on December 22, 2032. However, this probability was later reduced to near zero as more data was collected. The International Asteroid Warning Network was activated in response to the threat, and a new asteroid, 2025 FA22, has been added to the European Space Agency's 'watchlist' with a potential impact in 2089. The Planetary Defense Coordination Office has identified 873 NEOs larger than one kilometer and 11,266 NEOs large enough to wipe out entire cities. NASA scientists have successfully nudged an asteroid off its course in the DART mission, proving that technology could be used to redirect hazardous space rocks in the future. 'We did not see that one coming,' said Katie Kumamoto, a researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 'The fact is that humanity does have a system that has been put in place in the last decade, essentially, and it worked for YR4,' said Danica Remy, president of the B612 Foundation. 'Even though we now feel we've got a good handle on the population of large near-Earth asteroids, we're still working on understanding what the smaller population is,' said Planetary Defense Officer Emeritus Lindley Johnson.

**Multiple Apocalyptic Predictions for the End of the World**
According to various predictions, the end of the world is approaching. A solar flare is expected to hit the Earth in 2025, causing a 'total blackout' and internet shutdown worldwide. However, some scientists disagree, citing that the most active phase of the solar cycle will occur in late 2023 to early 2024. Bulgarian mystic Vanga predicted that a conflict in Europe in 2025 will have a devastating impact on the continent's population, followed by the exploration of Venus for energy sources in 2028. By 2033, the polar ice caps will melt, causing a significant rise in sea levels, and by 2076, communism will spread across the planet. Vanga also predicted that humans will make contact with aliens in 2130, followed by a global drought that will affect most countries. The final stage of the apocalypse is expected to occur in 3005, with a war against a Martian civilization, and by 3797, the last humans will leave the planet due to its uninhabitability. Additionally, an Austrian scientist, Heinz von Förster, predicted that the world will end on November 13, 2026, due to overpopulation, and the French Institute of Demographic Research predicts that the world's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, leading to a shortage of natural resources, food, and water. Finally, there are concerns about potential asteroid collisions, including one in 2028 and another in 2029, which could have catastrophic consequences.

**NASA looking for ways to destroy asteroid that could strike Earth, kill city**
NASA and other space agencies are planning to destroy asteroid 2024 YR4, which has a 1.5% chance of striking Earth, killing approximately 110 million people. The asteroid, estimated to be between 130 and 300 feet wide, is expected to enter Earth's atmosphere at 38,000 mph in December 2032. According to a project manager at the Kennedy Space Center, 'No one is panicking, but it [is] definitely what we're talking about in the hallways of NASA.' The asteroid's path will be observed by NASA and the European Space Agency's Webb Space Telescope in March, and it will come back into view in 2028.

**'City killer' asteroid could wipe out 100 million people in seven years**
Asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 3.1% chance of hitting Earth on December 22, 2032, posing a threat to over 100 million people living in major cities. If it were to hit, the asteroid would release 8 megatons of energy, over 500 times greater than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. NASA scientists have applied for emergency use of the James Webb space telescope to track the asteroid and collect more information. The asteroid's projected trajectory would see it fly over eight of the world's 100 most populated cities, including Bogotá, Abidjan, Lagos, and Khartoum. According to NASA's Moly Wasser, 'Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope will observe the asteroid in March 2025. As more observations of the asteroid's orbit are obtained, its impact probability will become better known.'

**Asteroid 2024 YR4: More than 100 million people live in risk corridor, Nasa data shows**
Asteroid 2024 YR4, the size of Big Ben's tower, has a 2.6% chance of hitting Earth on December 22, 2032. According to Nasa, the impact risk corridor of the asteroid stretches over some of the world's most populous cities, including Bogotá, Abidjan, Lagos, Khartoum, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Dhaka, with a combined population of over 110 million. The destructive potential of the asteroid is equivalent to 8 million tons of TNT, roughly 500 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Nasa has already tested technologies to deflect asteroids, and other space agencies are working on contingency measures to prepare for any necessary intervention. Ground-based observations of the asteroid will continue until April, and Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope will observe it in March 2025 to better understand its trajectory, size, and composition.

**Will Asteroid 2024 YR4 hit Earth? NASA raises probability as 'risk corridor' home to 100 million people identified**
NASA has identified the estimated flight path of potentially devastating asteroid 2024 YR4, which has a 2.3% chance of hitting Earth on December 22, 2032. The asteroid, estimated to be between 130 and 300 feet in diameter, could cause devastating consequences if it were to hit, with the power of 7.7 megatons of TNT, or 500 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. NASA has doubled the chance of impact since its discovery in December 2024, due to its unusual flight path over populous cities. Neil deGrasse Tyson has urged the new administration not to cut spending on science, saying 'Now might be a bad time to reduce spending on Science. Just sayin.'

**SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE: NASA rapidly recalculating likelihood of asteroid colliding with Earth**
NASA has increased the likelihood of asteroid 2024 YR4 colliding with Earth on December 22, 2032, from 1% to 3.1%. According to NASA, there is now a 1 in 32 chance of the asteroid impacting Earth, which could result in localized destruction. The asteroid is estimated to be between 40 and 90 meters in diameter and is moving at 46,800 km per hour. NASA estimates that if there was a collision, the explosion would be equal to eight megatons of TNT. The asteroid's impact risk data indicates that the northern tip of South America, sub-Saharan and North Africa, and South Asia would be affected, with a combined population of about 110 million people. NASA spokesperson Molly Wasser stated, 'It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will be ruled out as an impact hazard, as has happened with many other objects that have previously appeared on NASA’s.' However, she also noted that 'it is also possible its impact probability will continue to rise.'

**Beware the asteroids of a changing climate**
Asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 1.3% chance of hitting Earth on December 22, 2032, but experts say this figure is likely to be revised downward. Meanwhile, the article highlights two 'metaphorical asteroids' that have struck with ominous implications: a 22% rate hike request from State Farm insurance in California and a report from the First Street Foundation that found 84% of US neighborhoods will see falling property values due to climate risks over the next three decades. This could lead to a massive migration of over 55 million Americans by 2055, with 5.2 million relocating in 2025. The article argues that we should be preparing for the calamities that await us on Earth, rather than just tracking space rocks.
