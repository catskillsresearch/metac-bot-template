**The wild hunt for clean energy minerals**
The world is facing a critical mineral shortage, essential for clean energy technologies. The US Geological Survey has flagged 50 minerals as critical to the economy and security, with 18 materials particularly important for energy. The demand for these minerals is surging, with mineral demands from clean energy deployment projected to double to quadruple by 2040. The US is a major consumer of critical minerals but not a significant producer, with China leading in production and refining capacity. Researchers are exploring alternatives to lithium, such as lithium iron phosphate batteries, and developing more efficient mining technologies. However, the challenge of securing a reliable supply of critical minerals remains, with the world likely to rely on lithium for decades to come. New mining projects are underway, including in the US, and companies are exploring mining the ocean floor and even asteroids for critical minerals.

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**3.7 Billion-Year-Old Organic Molecules on Mars: A Step Towards a New Era of Life?**
NASA and private space companies are in a priority race, while organic molecules discovered on Mars have caused excitement in the scientific community. Andy Weir's 'The Martian' novel and film, which has become a reality, is a step-by-step process. What does this mean for humanity and our world? In recent years, Mars has become the biggest excitement for the scientific community and space enthusiasts. Mars, being a neighbor to Earth, has a potential for new life and exploration. Searching for life signs on Mars, solving the planet's past climate, and establishing permanent settlements, are considered important milestones for humanity's future in space. The Martian film, which was adapted to the big screen in 2015, detailed and realistically portrayed NASA's plans to send humans to Mars by 2035. The film tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars after a storm and must survive with limited resources. NASA also makes a great effort to rescue him. The Martian has turned into a reality. In the US, there is a debate about whether Mars or the Moon should be prioritized. Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman thinks that Mars should be prioritized. However, Elon Musk's priority is also Mars, but he has been criticized for his approach. China's increasing activity on the Moon is also affecting the US's strategic decisions. Trump and Musk's priority on Mars can be interpreted as follows: 'Mars, although it seems like both of their priorities, has not been left out of the equation. Ultimately, Mars is a difficult road, and the Moon is an important station. It's a destination, as well as a stopover.' 'Of course, Mars is much more important and has a much greater return. Both scientifically and technologically, Mars travel requires significant investments. The work done will result in technologies that can be adapted to daily life on Earth, changing our lives in different forms.' 'Even if humans are not on Mars by 2031, they will be very close to it in the 2030s.' Elon Musk has announced that he will send an 'unmanned' spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026 and that humans can go to Mars by 2031. Do you think humanity is close to achieving this goal? 'Because this work has long exceeded the realm of imagination. This process can be described as 'a very ambitious goal.' The fact that large companies are investing so much in this indicates that they have significant commercial expectations. The timeline may be a bit behind schedule. Humans may not be on Mars by 2031, but they will be very close to it in the late 2030s.' 'The fact that Mars has signs of past life, which may indicate that the necessary conditions for life exist there, is a significant discovery.' Sabancı University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Astrofysics Professor Ersin Göğüş recently discovered large organic molecules on Mars. This has raised questions about biological activity on Mars. The molecules found on Mars are similar to those produced by life on Earth and have remained intact for approximately 3.7 billion years without being affected by geological activity, moisture, or heat. This suggests that the molecules on Mars are as old as life on Earth. What does this mean? Can Mars give us clues about our world's past and future? 'Of course, it can.' 'We know that the first signs of life appeared on Mars and Earth around the same time, approximately 4 billion years ago. We also know that Mars lost its atmosphere due to extreme solar winds, which could have led to the end of life. Although this is not a risk for Earth, humanity's excessive use of the planet could have negative consequences.' 'The Mars mission is motivating the development of new technologies.' Some people criticize the billions of dollars spent on sending humans to Mars, saying that 'it's a luxury to invest in space while solving problems on Earth.' Do you think this criticism is justified?

**Can AI save American manufacturing from collapse?**
American manufacturing is facing a severe skills gap, with over 2.1 million jobs potentially going unfilled by 2030, according to Heather Carroll, Chief Revenue Officer at Path Robotics. Carroll emphasizes that this is a 'national problem' that requires immediate attention. She believes that AI can bridge the labor gap, allowing robots to adapt and make decisions on the fly, and augment human capabilities. Carroll stresses that the problem is accelerating and that action must be taken now to avoid being left behind. She describes the current moment as a 'make or break' point for the United States in terms of skilled labor, but also sees opportunities for growth and innovation if leaders adopt AI technology now.

**FonARCom Brings AI Debate to Festival del Lavoro**
The 16th edition of the Festival del Lavoro in Genoa hosted a debate on the ethics of artificial intelligence, organized by FonARCom. The panel, moderated by Michele Damiani, included experts such as Andrea Cafà, Fabrizio Di Modica, and Roberto Marseglia. The discussion centered on the risks and opportunities of AI in the workplace, particularly the AI Act, a European regulation that introduces obligations, sanctions, and training for workers using or developing AI systems. The panel emphasized the need for employee training, developing new skills, and safely managing the digital transition. According to the European Commission, by 2030, over 50% of professions will require advanced digital skills. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will create around 170 million new jobs by the end of the decade, but also eliminate around 92 million. A Gallup survey found a 7% increase in workers concerned about technological obsolescence over four years.

**Over 1 Billion Young People to Face Health Problems by 2030, Warns Lancet Commission**
A new report by the Lancet Commission warns that over 1 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 will face health problems by 2030. The report, written by 44 international experts, including 10 young people, highlights the growing threats to adolescent health and well-being, citing over 550 studies reviewed since 2021. According to Sarah Baird, a professor of global health and economics at George Washington University, 'It's clear that we're already in a crisis of poor health among young people, and it will only get worse.' The report identifies several interconnected risk factors, including the impact of climate change, the increasing use of digital technologies, the sustained rise in obesity, and a global mental health crisis. By 2100, it is projected that nearly 1.8 billion adolescents will be exposed to temperatures 2.8°C higher than those in the pre-industrial era, which could intensify extreme weather events, food insecurity, and heat-related illnesses. 'I think people struggle to recognize what a warmer world means for health and well-being,' Baird said. 'Young people are going to live much longer than older generations, and they have the most to lose if we don't invest in their future.' The report also highlights the massive use of digital technologies, with 79% of people aged 15-24 worldwide having access to the internet. While these technologies offer opportunities, they also present risks. 'There are very strong opinions around social media and digital access, but I think it's a story with many nuances,' Baird explained. The Commission warns that these effects will be amplified with the development of artificial intelligence and calls for urgent policy measures. The report also notes a sustained increase in obesity rates, with an estimated 464 million adolescents expected to have overweight or obesity by 2030, a 143 million increase from 2015. This trend is linked to high consumption of sugary drinks, increased availability of ultra-processed foods, and sedentary behavior. Regarding mental health, the Commission predicts that by 2030, 42 million years of healthy life will be lost due to mental disorders or suicide, making it the leading cause of morbidity in adolescents. 'They have lost education and the ability to relate to people, and they are facing multiple economic crises. Potentially, they live in a poorer and more stressful world,' Baird said. For Professor Aoife Doyle of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the report is a wake-up call. 'These convincing data should motivate governments and donors to take action to fulfill their promises of universal health coverage and provide more appropriate services for adolescents,' she said. The authors emphasize that the described threats do not act in isolation, but interact with each other, amplifying their effects on adolescent health. Despite the bleak outlook, Baird highlights the resilience of young people to face these challenges. 'Many still remain very optimistic about what the future holds and want to do everything they can to make their future better,' she concluded.

**ESA's 2040 Strategy: A Path to Growth and Sustainability**
Heriberto Saldivar, the Head of Strategy at the European Space Agency (ESA), believes that Spain has a lot of potential for growth. The ESA has recently approved its 2040 strategy, which has five main goals: protecting the planet and climate, exploration and discovery, strengthening European autonomy and resilience, empowering competitiveness, and inspiring Europe. Saldivar emphasizes that the strategy is not about adding new elements, but rather integrating and consolidating existing ones. He highlights the importance of consistency and sustainability, and the need to break the cycle of relying on short-term funding. The ESA is also working to improve industrialization in the sector, which is currently fragmented. Saldivar mentions three key points: the 2025 agenda, which focuses on transforming the agency and improving processes; the integration of a 'matrix' to achieve better efficiency in technology development and transfer; and the evolution of the georetorno program, which has been criticized but is still seen as a useful tool. He also stresses the importance of education and training in STEM fields, and the need to inspire young people to pursue careers in space-related fields. Finally, Saldivar discusses the potential impact of the US budget reduction on the NASA-ESA collaboration, and the ESA's plans to continue with projects like Gateway. He also mentions the agency's plans to compete with China and Russia, and the role of the Spanish space industry in the European ecosystem.

**The Importance of Care for the Aging Population**
By 2030, one in six people worldwide will be 60 years or older, with the population of 60 years or older expected to increase from 1 billion in 2020 to 1.4 billion. By 2050, the population of people 60 years or older is expected to double to over 2.1 billion. The number of people 80 years or older is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050, reaching 426 million. According to Francisca Gallegos, Chile's subsecretary of Social Services, the government's role in addressing the issue of aging and care is crucial. She stated, 'The topic of care for people is of utmost importance and should be part of all public policy.' Chile's program, Chile Cuida, aims to provide support to people in need of care, their caregivers, and their families. The program has expanded to cover 43% of municipalities in 2024 and is projected to reach 62% by 2025 and the entire country by the end of the president's term. Gallegos emphasized the importance of addressing the issue of unpaid care work, which falls disproportionately on women. She noted, 'The problem of unpaid work is grave. In Latin America and the Caribbean, women dedicate between 22 and 42 hours a week to unpaid work, while men dedicate between 10 and 20 hours per week.'

**Experts Predict Global War and Climate Change as Biggest Threats by 2035**
A recent survey conducted by the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, has found that 40% of experts believe that there is a high likelihood of a global war between the US, Russia, and China by 2035. The survey, which involved 357 political strategists and foreign policy experts, found that 10 out of 10 experts believe that there is a possibility of a large-scale war between the three nations. The war could be fought with nuclear weapons and could also extend to outer space. Experts have pointed out that the establishment of the US Space Force in 2019 by former President Donald Trump is a recent example of the increasing militarization of space. Even if the world avoids a global war, experts predict that the consequences of climate change will be severe, with 3 out of 10 experts believing that it will be the second biggest problem facing humanity by 2035. Additionally, 1.7% of experts believe that a new pandemic could break out, while 5.1% believe that the increasing financial debt will cripple the world by 2035. The survey also found that 62% of experts believe that the world will be worse off in a decade, while 38% believe that it will be better.

A survey of 357 global affairs experts predicts that a major war involving major nations like the US, China, or Russia will break out by 2035, with four in 10 respondents believing it will happen. The majority of those who believe WWIII is coming said that it would likely involve nuclear weapons and battles in outer space. Climate change is also a major concern, with three in 10 experts ranking it as the single biggest threat to global prosperity between 2025 and 2035. The survey, conducted by the Atlantic Council, also found that experts believe the US will decline in terms of economic power and technological innovation, and that new global alliances may threaten the US and NATO. 'The grimmer forecasts were in keeping with a dark global outlook overall, with 62 percent of respondents expecting the world a decade from now to be worse off than it is today, and only 38 percent predicting that it will be better off,' the Atlantic Council said.

**The Future of Work: A Net Gain of 78 Million Jobs by 2030**
According to the World Economic Forum's Report on the Future of Jobs 2025, approximately 78 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030, while 92 million jobs will be destroyed due to technological advancements and the transition to a green economy. This means that there will be a net gain of 78 million jobs. However, governments, employers, and employees must work together to ensure that the skills of the workforce match the demands of the new job market. Education plays a crucial role in this equation, as professionals need to be able to handle new technologies that can guarantee employability for millions of people. A recent OECD study found that 18% of adults in 31 countries (excluding Brazil) lack basic proficiency in reading, mathematics, and problem-solving. This is a significant warning sign, as without basic knowledge, it is impossible to handle advanced technologies that can make or break employability in the job market. The needs of economies at different stages of development are asymmetric, and the demand for professionals in the care industry (such as nurses, social workers, and psychologists) is expected to increase in the coming years, particularly in more mature economies. On the other hand, functions such as cashiers and administrative assistants are likely to lose space, requiring professionals in these areas to seek requalification to remain employable. In Brazil, the economy is still at a medium level, but it is expected to lose its demographic bonus in 15 years, when the proportion of the population in the active age group is smaller than that of dependents. According to the Forum, Brazilian employers consider the skills gap to be the main barrier to business transformation in the country by 2030. However, this also presents an opportunity, as companies in Brazil expect growth in job openings for specialists in areas such as digital transformation, AI, supply chain management, and logistics. The promotion of effective educational policies becomes even more urgent in this context.
