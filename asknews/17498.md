**Anadolu Yıldızı-2025 Search and Rescue Exercise Conducted**
The Anadolu Yıldızı-2025 Search and Rescue Exercise was conducted in the international waters between the Greek islands of Sakız and Midilli. The exercise showcased the Turkish Armed Forces' (TSK) search and rescue capabilities on land and sea. Various scenarios were applied with the participation of local and foreign observers. The exercise started with the participation of the Ege Ordusu Komutanlığı, Kara Kuvvetleri Komutanlığı, Deniz Kuvvetleri Komutanlığı, Hava Kuvvetleri Komutanlığı, and Sahil Güvenlik Komutanlığı units. The first phase of the exercise involved a search and rescue helicopter from the Kara Kuvvetleri, a search and rescue plane from the Hava Kuvvetleri, a search and rescue helicopter, a frigate from the Deniz Kuvvetleri, two corvettes, four Sahil Güvenlik boats, a search and rescue plane, two search and rescue helicopters, and two search and rescue ships. The teams responded to a distress call from a cargo ship in the Turkish Search and Rescue Region. According to the scenario, a ship on fire in the area between the Sakız and Midilli islands sent a distress call to the Ana Arama Kurtarma Koordinasyon Merkezi, which then notified the Deniz Arama Kurtarma Koordinasyon Merkezine. The Deniz Arama Kurtarma Koordinasyon Merkezinin başlattığı harekatta, senaryo gereği imkanların yetersiz olması nedeniyle Hava Arama Kurtarma Koordinasyon Merkezinden yardım talebinde bulunuldu. The exercise ended with the rescue of 5 people from the sea, including 3 mannequins and 7 personnel. The CN-235 Casa search and rescue plane from the Sahil Güvenlik Komutanlığı was able to locate the survivors and the rescue teams were able to rescue them. The exercise aimed to improve the coordination between the TSK and the Turkish search and rescue organizations, and to test the arama kurtarma komuta kontrol sistemleri. The second phase of the exercise will be held on land tomorrow in İzmir Menemen Dumanlı Dağı.

**Israel's Genocide and the Risk of Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Dominance**
Israel is facing its toughest times since its establishment in 1948. Once known as the country of people who were victims of genocide, it is now known as the country of genociders. Germany, which has always unconditionally supported Israel due to its guilt and historical shame, has also remained silent in this situation. The only step Israel can take is to remove Prime Minister Netanyahu and hold him responsible for the genocide. According to the schedule, Netanyahu's trial will be concluded within the next 7 months, and he will likely be sent to prison. However, if this scenario is not enough to make Israel wash its hands, a plot to assassinate Netanyahu or a fatal accident could occur. Regardless of the scenario, Israel's future will be marked by difficult times. The ultra-Orthodox Jewish population is growing rapidly, and they will become the dominant force in Israel by 2050, making them a significant risk to the region and the world. Meanwhile, CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu's insistence on returning to the party leadership despite his losses and the taban's dissatisfaction with him will be his greatest defeat. The situation is similar to the Greek General Staff's gift of a historical map of Helen to the Fener Rum Patriarch, which showed Istanbul and Thrace outside of Turkey's borders. This move is seen as a provocation by some, and it is believed that the Greek government is trying to create tension between the two countries. However, the Turkish government is taking a cautious approach, and the Turkish ambassador in Athens is trying to maintain good relations with Greece. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of avoiding provocations and promoting peace and understanding between the two countries.

**Is Humanity Dead?**
The world is witnessing a sharp rise in armed conflicts and deaths, with over 200,000 people killed in 2022 alone. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the genocide in Gaza are two examples of devastating and unwinnable wars. The Gaza crisis is a symbol of moral collapse, with entire neighbourhoods flattened, families erased, and generations wiped out. The article argues that the global community has failed to act, with the media diluting the horror and institutions remaining paralysed. The writer calls for action, protest, and justice, and asks why Palestinian blood is treated as less sacred and their lives less worthy of outrage. The article concludes with a cry for humanity, urging the world to unite for justice, peace, and dignity.

**SAFE RMMO'nun silah alımındaki 'maliyet kilidini' kaldırıyor**
The SAFE program, which is expected to be implemented by the European Union through the 'ReArm Europe 2030' plan, is expected to bring both challenges and opportunities for the Greek government. According to the weekly Kathimerini, the program will remove the 'cost barrier' for the Greek National Guard (RMMO) in acquiring weapons. The SAFE program has allocated a budget of 150 billion euros to be used by member states to strengthen their domestic defense industries, with the majority of the funds expected to be allocated to countries with established defense industries such as Germany, France, and Italy. However, the program also allows for cooperation with third countries, which has raised concerns for Greece and Cyprus, as well as Turkey, which may also be able to participate and access European funding. Despite the political hurdles, the Greek government sees the SAFE program as an opportunity to boost its domestic defense industry, with over 30 Greek companies having already signed research and development agreements with foreign companies. The program also allows for the acquisition of defense systems, including drones and software, which could be exported to other countries, and has already seen cooperation between Greek and Cypriot companies. The Greek Defense Minister, Vasilis Palmas, has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Greek Defense Minister, Nikos Dendias, for cooperation between Greek and Cypriot companies working on defense systems. The program also allows for the acquisition of defense systems from other EU member states, which could help to reduce the cost of acquiring systems such as the Leopard tank and the Marder infantry fighting vehicle. As one source from the Greek government noted, 'the production will be done with European funding, and if the companies from Cyprus or other countries are not participating, the needs will be met by European sources, and this will not affect our cooperation with the US.'

**Turkey's Military Mobilization Efforts Cause Concern in Greece**
Turkey's military mobilization efforts, including its defense industry, have been making headlines worldwide. However, a recent article in the Greek press has caused concern among the Greek people. According to the article, Turkey is rapidly increasing its military capabilities, and its defense industry has created jobs for over 100,000 people in 3,500 firms. The article also states that Turkey's defense exports are expected to increase by 65% by 2024. Greece is worried that Turkey's inclusion in the European Union's new defense financing mechanism, the European Security Action (SAFE), will strengthen the ties between Ankara and Brussels. Additionally, the article highlights Turkey's advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground and sea systems, with Turkey owning 65% of the global UAV market. The article also mentions that 75 of Turkey's systems are used by NATO, and that Turkey's hosting of the 2026 NATO Summit is an important milestone in its role in European defense. Furthermore, the article notes that Turkey is planning to build nuclear-powered submarines, with the goal of becoming the seventh country to possess this capability. Finally, the article mentions that Turkey currently has 13 submarines, including the new Reis-class fleet, which is currently under construction.

**Ukraine Evacuates 11 Villages Amid Fears of Russian Offensive, 8 Killed in Past 24 Hours**
Ukraine has ordered the evacuation of 11 more villages in the Sumi region due to fears of a large-scale Russian military offensive. Unfortunately, diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire have been unsuccessful, and fighting continues. In the past 24 hours, at least 8 people have been killed in Russian bombings in Ukraine, including a 9-year-old child. The Russian invasion, which began in February 2022, has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians and military personnel. The Kremlin has rejected Ukraine's request to receive a ceasefire proposal in advance, casting doubt on the planned negotiations in Istanbul on June 2. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umérov has called on Moscow to provide a pre-agreement document with its conditions and accused Russia of deliberately delaying the process to prolong the conflict. Ukraine sees this document as crucial before sitting down for talks. Diplomatic efforts to end the war have increased recently, but both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of not seeking peace. Russia has proposed meeting again in Istanbul on Monday, following the failure of the first meeting on May 16. However, Kiev has not confirmed its participation and is waiting for Russia to send a 'memorandum' with its conditions for a lasting peace. Ukrainian President Zelensky criticized that Russia is trying to avoid concrete results in the next meeting. Turkey, through its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called on both countries to attend with 'strong delegations'. Ukraine viewed with suspicion that Russia sent the same low-level team that led the previous round. Additionally, it requested that a US-proposed ceasefire be accepted, but the Kremlin rejected it. Russia and Ukraine have agreed on the largest prisoner exchange since the conflict began in 2022, releasing 390 people each, including soldiers and civilians, last Friday. Zelensky described the act as 'the first phase of the 1,000-for-1,000 exchange'. This was the only real advance after the Istanbul meeting a week ago. Sergei Lavrov announced that there will be a new round of negotiations. According to Russian authorities, the massive prisoner exchange was a response to an initiative promoted from Moscow. They also assured that they will maintain this type of operation in the future.

**'Greece and India can act as bulwark against Erdogan' - The Sunday Guardian Live**
Leonidas Chrysanthopoulos, a former Greek ambassador to Canada, Poland, and Armenia, and Secretary General of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation, believes that Turkey is playing a significant role in the Mediterranean due to its balanced approach in the Ukrainian crisis, strong arms industry, and expanding influence in Africa. Chrysanthopoulos sees Turkey as a revisionist power, trying to change existing beliefs on historical events and refusing to respect international treaties involving Greece. He also notes that Turkey, under Erdogan, is trying to establish itself as the leader of the Islamic world and aims to regain the power and influence it had during the Ottoman Empire. Chrysanthopoulos suggests that Greece and India can act as a bulwark against Erdogan by enhancing military cooperation, particularly in the Air Force, and conducting joint military exercises in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean. He also recommends closer cooperation at the UN and other international fora, as well as effective cooperation in nuclear technology. Chrysanthopoulos believes that this cooperation would make Turkey and Pakistan think twice before creating conditions for armed conflicts.

**Turkey's Military Ambitions Leave Greece Concerned**
Turkey's defense industry has been making significant strides, causing concern among neighboring countries. Greece has acknowledged Turkey's capabilities, stating that Ankara is using the 18th Balkan General Staff Conference as a platform to accelerate its European Union (EU) integration. The Greek media reported that Turkey's military products are being sold to Europe, effectively encircling the continent. Additionally, Turkey plans to build nuclear-powered submarines, aiming to become the seventh country in the world with this capability. The Greek media also highlighted Turkey's growing defense industry, with over 3,500 companies employing over 100,000 people and export figures expected to increase by 65% by 2024. Greece is concerned that Turkey's inclusion in the EU's new defense financing mechanism, the European Security Action (SAFE), will deepen its ties with Brussels. Furthermore, Turkey dominates the global drone market with a 65% share and has made significant progress in unmanned ground and sea systems. The article also notes that 75 of Turkey's systems are used by NATO, and its hosting of the 2026 NATO Summit is a significant milestone. Finally, the article mentions that Turkey is planning to build 13 submarines, including the new Reis-class fleet, with a focus on nuclear-powered submarines.

**The Kosovo Conundrum and the Ukrainian Crisis**
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has been ongoing, with the recent talks in Turkey ending in failure due to disagreements over the status of the four Ukrainian regions. This reminds one of the Kosovo War. Kosovo and Vojvodina were once autonomous provinces of Serbia, but after the Yugoslav Wars, Kosovo declared independence in 2008, which was not recognized by Russia, Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Spain, India, Indonesia, Ukraine, Vietnam, Cambodia, and China. As a result, Kosovo has not been able to join the United Nations. Kosovo's economy is struggling, with a low average national income of $6,000, ranking 107th globally. In contrast, Serbia's average income is around $12,000, ranking 77th globally. The four Ukrainian regions, which were once part of the Russian Empire, have a significant Russian-speaking population and rich industrial and mineral resources. Since the 2014 conflict, the residents of these regions have been killed by the Ukrainian government, leading to deep-seated ethnic tensions and hatred. After Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, over a million people have been killed, making it the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II. In October 2022, the Russian parliament formally annexed the four regions, which has a total area of around 90,000 square kilometers, larger than Serbia's territory. Ukraine will not accept this, and President Zelensky has told US President Trump that he will not accept Russia's conditions. However, Ukraine is currently in a disadvantageous position, and it is unclear whether Russia will give up the occupied territory. According to information provided by Trump, over 5,000 people are killed every day on the battlefield, and the US is pushing for an early end to the war. If the EU does not continue to provide sufficient weapons, ammunition, and financial resources to support Ukraine, the US may withdraw from the mediation efforts and let the Vatican take over. If this happens, Ukraine's future will be bleak.

**Greek Foreign Minister Calls for Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflicts**
Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis, who chairs the UN Security Council this month, addressed a joint statement on behalf of 80 ambassadors representing countries committed to international humanitarian law and protecting civilians in armed conflicts. He emphasized that 36,000 civilians have been killed in 14 conflicts worldwide in 2024, and that civilians continue to be killed, injured, and displaced. The use of explosive materials in populated areas has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of victims, while landmines and unexploded ordnance continue to claim lives and cause injuries in conflict zones. Gerapetritis highlighted the dire situation in Gaza, where civilians have been exposed to the worst humanitarian crisis, with a high risk of famine. He also mentioned the situation in Sudan, where civilians have borne the brunt of the conflict, with millions displaced and half the population facing severe food insecurity. The minister stressed that protecting civilians is not a choice, but a legal obligation under international humanitarian law, and that all parties to conflicts must work towards protecting civilians in all circumstances. He called on UN member states to use their capabilities and resources to respect this principle, which is a binding law for all. Gerapetritis emphasized that civilians, especially women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, suffer more in armed conflicts. He also highlighted that many farmers, children, teachers, and others are forced to flee. The minister reiterated the need for parties to conflicts to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, especially those related to their daily lives, and to treat them with humanity. He also condemned the violence against humanitarian workers, who suffered the most in 2024, with over 360 workers killed in 20 countries. The group of ambassadors urged all parties to the conflict to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to needy civilians, stressing that politicizing humanitarian aid is unacceptable. The statement also emphasized the importance of protecting journalists and media workers, and respecting their independence and rights, especially in the face of misinformation that fuels conflicts. In conclusion, Gerapetritis stressed the need for accountability and investigation into all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, and called for a comprehensive approach to protecting civilians. He said, 'We are not reacting to a specific crisis, but rather engaging in preventive diplomacy. We want a comprehensive approach to protecting civilians. Let us work together to respect international humanitarian law, protect the dignity and privacy of civilians, and ensure that their faces and voices, which are often lost in statistics, remain at the heart of our efforts in this field.'

**NATO Exercises in Greece: A New Front in the Conflict**
Former Ambassador Volkan Vural spoke to Odatv about NATO's activities in Greece, saying, 'When it comes to American exercises, a certain level of tension is inevitable.' The upcoming exercise will involve 12,000 troops, but Turkey will not be participating. The scenario involves enemy forces invading Dedeağaç and Kavala, which are also home to American bases. NATO forces will then push the enemy back, crossing the Meriç River in the process. Vural noted that, given Turkey's proximity to the exercise and its status as NATO's second-largest military power, it would normally be expected to participate. However, he also pointed out that the exercise is taking place in areas where the number of American bases has been increasing, and where President Erdoğan has previously expressed concern about the growing presence of American military equipment. Vural said, 'It's natural to link these two things together.' He also noted that the exercise is taking place in a region where tensions are already high, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean, where Greece and Cyprus are being armed by the US and Israel. Vural said, 'This is a new front, a new dimension of the same conflict, the same struggle.'

**Turkey Reiterates Commitment to Protecting Civilians in Conflict Zones**
Turkey reiterated its commitment to protecting civilians in conflict zones, according to Ambassador Yıldız, who spoke at the UN Security Council meeting on 'Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflicts'. Yıldız emphasized that 'it is not only a moral obligation, but also essential for achieving lasting peace and stability' to address the issue of missing persons. He highlighted the importance of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to solve this problem. Ambassador Yıldız also mentioned that Turkey has consistently advocated for 'apolitical, impartial, and result-oriented efforts' to address this challenge, in line with international law. He noted that thousands of people are still missing in Syria due to the ongoing conflicts, causing 'unbearable suffering' for many families. Yıldız expressed satisfaction with the new Syrian government's efforts to address this issue. He also highlighted the 'unique' humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Israel has imposed a blockade for over two months, resulting in the displacement of nearly the entire population, with thousands killed, injured, or trapped under the rubble. Yıldız called on Israel to comply with its international obligations, including UN Security Council Resolution 2474, and to provide full transparency and accountability. He welcomed the release of American-Israeli dual citizen soldier Edan Alexander, who was held captive by Hamas since October 2023, and emphasized the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Ambassador Yıldız also responded to the Greek Cypriot representative's statement on the missing persons in Cyprus, saying that the fate of the missing persons cannot be evaluated without considering the historical context. He emphasized that the issue of missing persons in Cyprus dates back to 1963 and affects both the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities. Yıldız also noted that the majority of the missing Turkish Cypriots are civilians, while the majority of the missing Greek Cypriots are military personnel. He stressed that the work of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus should continue with the cooperation of both sides and that the Greek Cypriot representative's absence from the UN Security Council meeting is 'both unjust and unacceptable'.

**Turkey and Israel Discuss Conflict Resolution in Syria**
Turkey and Israel have held a face-to-face meeting to discuss a mechanism for conflict resolution in Syria. Turkey's Defense Minister, Hulusi Akar, stated that Israel's continued operations in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as its attacks on neighboring countries, are detrimental to the region's stability and peace. Akar called on Israel to cease its provocative actions and respect Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The meeting was part of Turkey's efforts to establish a conflict resolution mechanism in Syria. In other news, Turkey has increased its defense capabilities, including the addition of new equipment to the Turkish Armed Forces' inventory. The Defense Ministry also stated that Turkey will continue to support the Syrian government in its fight against terrorism, including the withdrawal of the terrorist group SDG from the Halep and Tişrin Barajı areas. Additionally, the ministry condemned the establishment of a new terrorist organization in the Greek Cypriot Republic, which is seen as a threat to the security and stability of the region. The ministry also expressed concerns over the planned laying of a submarine cable by Greece, the Greek Cypriot Republic, and Israel, which is seen as a provocation and a threat to Turkey's interests in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Additionally, MSB sources stated that the withdrawal of the terrorist organization SDG from the Halep and Tişrin Baraj is being closely monitored. The sources also mentioned that a new terrorist organization has been formed in the Greek Cypriot Republic (GKRY) with a goal of targeting Turkey, and that Turkey will not tolerate any actions that threaten the security and rights of the Turkish Cypriots. Furthermore, MSB sources stated that Turkey will not allow any actions that threaten the security and rights of the Turkish Cypriots, and that the Turkish government will take necessary measures to protect the Turkish Cypriots. The sources also mentioned that the Libyan National Army's Kara Kuvvetleri Komutanı Korgeneral Saddam Hafter visited Turkey and that the visit was a significant step towards establishing a united and peaceful Libya. Finally, MSB sources stated that 18 terrorists were neutralized in the last week, and that a total of 555 terrorists have been neutralized since January 1.

**Greece and Turkey: Migrant Boat Accidents Result in Multiple Deaths**
At least seven people, including three children, were killed in a boat accident in Greece, while nine migrants drowned in a separate incident in Turkey. Twenty-three people were rescued from the Greek incident, and search and rescue operations are ongoing. Greece is a common route for migrants from Asia and the Middle East, who often arrive by inflatable boats from Turkey. The Greek government has strengthened its stance against illegal immigration. According to the United Nations, around 2,500 migrants have died in 2024, and approximately 9,000 migrants have entered Greece since the beginning of the year. Greek coast guard officials said that a boat carrying migrants encountered difficult conditions and capsized, resulting in the deaths of seven people, including three children. Twenty-three people were rescued and taken to a migrant camp on the island, while search and rescue operations continued until the evening. The Greek coast guard suspected that water may have entered the boat before it sank. In a separate incident, the Turkish coast guard received a distress call from a boat carrying migrants and sent three boats and a helicopter, rescuing 25 people and recovering nine bodies. Many migrants die during perilous journeys across the Greek and Turkish coasts. The United Nations reported that around 2,500 people have died in 2024. Last month, the Greek coast guard reported the death of a migrant and the rescue of 18 others after a smuggler abandoned them during their attempt to cross from Turkey. According to the UNHCR, around 9,000 people have entered Greece since the beginning of the year, mostly by sea. The number of migrants who entered Greece last year was over 54,000, and the Greek government has strengthened its stance against immigration. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis addressed migrants, saying, 'If you want to enter Greece illegally and are not eligible for asylum, we will do our best to return you to where you came from. Smugglers and NGOs cooperating with them will not decide who enters our country.'

**More than a dozen migrants die as boats sink off Greece and Turkey**
Two separate incidents involving migrant boats have resulted in the deaths of more than a dozen people in the Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey. In the first incident, a dinghy carrying migrants began taking on water, and 23 people were rescued, while the bodies of eight people, including three women and three children, were recovered. The survivors were taken to a migrant camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. In the second incident, the Turkish coast guard received an emergency call for help from a migrant boat and deployed three boats and a helicopter, recovering nine bodies and rescuing 25 people. The incidents highlight the dangers of the eastern Mediterranean route, which has seen over 54,000 people attempt to reach Greece by sea last year, with 125 reported dead or missing. According to the U.N. refugee agency, over 8,000 people have arrived in Greece by sea and 755 by land since the start of 2025.

**4 dead including 2 children as boat carrying migrants capsizes near Greek island**
A boat carrying migrants from the Turkish coast to a nearby Greek island capsized, leaving at least four people dead, including two children, according to Greece's coast guard. The search and rescue operation is ongoing, with multiple agencies involved. Greece is a key entry point for migrants fleeing conflict, and the incident highlights the dangers of the journey.

**Families Divided by War Find Hope in Acts of Faith in 2025**
In a world marked by 60 active wars, civilians face unprecedented levels of death and displacement. According to the World Economic Forum, armed conflicts have increased non-combatant fatalities by 30% in the last year. Religious organizations and local communities are emerging as support networks amidst the chaos, while global leaders fail to curb the violence. The Global Risk Report 2025 notes that conflicts have surpassed economic and environmental crises as the greatest threat to humanity. Regions such as the Sahel, Middle East, and parts of Asia are witnessing attacks on hospitals and schools, while arms trafficking fuels cycles of revenge. 'We're seeing children recruited as soldiers and entire villages erased from the map,' says a Red Cross volunteer in an interview with g1. In refugee camps, churches, mosques, and temples have become spaces of welcome. In Lebanon, Pastor Elias Haddad, who shelters 200 families in his parish, says that solidarity transcends religions: 'Here, Muslims and Christians share the same bread. War doesn't ask what you believe before destroying your home.' Initiatives like the 'Peace Network,' which connects religious leaders from 15 countries, aim to mediate local ceasefires. Behind the numbers are stories like that of Amina, a 32-year-old Syrian who lost her parents in a bombing and now cares for her younger brothers in a Turkish shelter. 'I pray that my brothers don't grow up with hatred in their hearts,' she says. Psychologists warn of a 'traumatized generation,' while NGOs denounce the lack of access to medicine and therapy in war zones. As governments discuss economic sanctions, civilians are building alternatives. In Colombia, former guerrillas and victims have created a cooperative agricultural project to revitalize rural communities. 'Peace is like a plantation: it requires patience and daily care,' reflects Carlos Márquez, one of the founders. For experts, popular pressure for diplomacy – and not arms – is the last hope to prevent 2025 from becoming the year of global rupture.
