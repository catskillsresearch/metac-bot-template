**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**Healthy life now for healthy ageing**
According to current trends, people born in 2040 and beyond are expected to live longer than those who are in their 40s or younger today. The average life expectancy in Europe, Oceania, America, and Japan is close to 80 years, and in Malaysia, it is more than 74 years. Considering the increasing life spans, it is not unlikely that those in their 40s or younger today will live longer than those who were in their forties 20 years ago.

**Plasma Exchange in Humans Reduces Biological Age by over Two Years**
A clinical trial has been conducted to assess the safety and effects of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) on biological age in healthy adults over 50. The results showed that TPE combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) reduced biological age by an average of 2.6 years, as measured by multi-omic biomarkers. The study, led by scientists at Circulate Health and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, found that patients receiving TPE with IVIG experienced changes in immune cells associated with reversed age-related immune decline. According to David Furman, PhD, 'Unfortunately, most so-called 'longevity interventions' lack proven effectiveness in humans. By conducting clinical trials, we aim to change that -- this study marks the first step in demonstrating that plasma exchange can significantly improve key mechanisms of biological aging.' Eric Verdin, MD, president and CEO of the Buck Institute, added, 'In this study, we examined thousands of molecular signatures to pinpoint key drivers of rejuvenation. Our characterization builds a better understanding of which baseline biomarkers are predictive of treatment response and lays a foundation upon which we can build personalized intervention plans for patients in the future.'

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**What if you could live up to 200?**
As scientists explore the possibility of living up to 200 years, many questions arise about the impact on our mindset and way of life. If humans could age relatively healthy up to 200, it would likely change our perspective on time, allowing people to pursue multiple passions and develop skill sets over decades. However, this would also require significant improvements in medical care to prevent painful aging symptoms. From a psychological perspective, being attached to one's body for 150 years would be a significant difference. This development would likely shape our societies, science, ethics, and way of living in a profound way. As one person noted, 'it is a topic we should start thinking about' and consider the potential effects on our lives.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Study Reveals Combination of Cancer-Fighting Drugs May Pave the Way for Anti-Aging Treatment**
A team of researchers has found that a combination of two cancer-fighting drugs, Trametinib and Rapamycin, can extend the lifespan of mice by up to 30%. According to a new study, the international research team discovered that combining these two drugs, known for their effectiveness in inhibiting cancer cell growth, resulted in extending the lifespan of mice beyond the use of each drug individually, while also reducing inflammation and delaying cancer progression in aging mice. Although the results do not necessarily mean that these drugs will extend human lifespan with the same efficiency, they represent an important step towards developing 'anti-aging' medications, a new category of treatments aimed at preventing diseases and improving quality of life in advanced age. Dr. Linda Partridge, a researcher from University College London and the Max Planck Institute for the Biology of Aging, said, 'We don't expect similar results in humans, but we hope these drugs will help people age healthier and live longer'.

**The Key to Longevity is in Our Hands**
While aging is inevitable, it's crucial to remember that the rate of aging can be changed. In this article, I will discuss two key aspects of the longevity approach: the supremacy of lifestyle over genetics and the ability of advanced technologies to detect diseases 10 to 20 years before they occur. These two factors, lifestyle adjustments and technological early detection, are the most effective tools for extending our lifespan.

**Taiwanese Study Finds Adopting Healthy Habits Can Extend Lifespan by Up to 24 Years**
A recent study in the US found that adopting eight healthy habits can increase lifespan by up to 24 years. A Taiwanese study in 2024 found that practicing five healthy behaviors can extend average lifespan by approximately 7 years. Taiwan's average lifespan is around 80 years, but unhealthy years account for 8 years, resulting in a significant impact on society and families. According to Dr. Lee, the former director of the Bureau of National Health Insurance and current director of the Taipei Medical University's Health and Welfare Policy Research Center, Taiwan's health expectancy is still shorter than that of neighboring countries like Japan and South Korea due to the lack of effective management of chronic diseases. Dr. Lo, a professor at Taipei Medical University, suggests that the traditional measure of lifespan is insufficient to reflect the health status of an aging and chronic disease society. He recommends using integrated indicators such as 'health expectancy' (HALE) and 'disability-adjusted life years' (DALY) to better reflect the health situation. According to Dr. Lo, practicing five healthy behaviors, including not smoking, avoiding excessive drinking, regular exercise, sufficient fruit and vegetable intake, and maintaining a healthy weight, can extend lifespan by 7.13 years and reduce medical expenses by 28.1%. Dr. Liao, the director of the Department of Family Medicine at Taipei Medical University Hospital, notes that over 80% of Taiwanese people over 65 suffer from chronic diseases, often accompanied by multiple medications and symptoms of weakness. He emphasizes that 'loss of health with aging' is a severe challenge. Dr. Liao also points out that a study by the American Nutrition Association in 2023 found that a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, not smoking, avoiding excessive drinking, a plant-based diet, avoiding overuse of painkillers, stress relief, sufficient sleep, and positive interpersonal relationships, can extend lifespan by 24 years. A Taiwanese study in 2024 also found that regular exercise, not smoking, avoiding excessive drinking, eating more fruits and vegetables, and maintaining a healthy weight can extend lifespan by 7 years. Both studies demonstrate the impact of preventive medicine on health expectancy, making it the most urgent task. Dr. Wu, the vice president of the Taiwan Long-term Care Professional Association, emphasizes that 'active aging' is not only a medical issue but also a policy, community, and family issue that requires cooperation between the government and the public. She suggests creating an age-friendly public space and community atmosphere to promote active aging, such as designing environments that encourage older adults to leave their homes and participate in society, which can effectively delay disability and improve the quality of life for older adults. She also cites Finland as an example of designing tiered policies for different age groups to reduce the incidence of disability and alleviate the burden on the long-term care system and families. Dr. Wei, the deputy director of the National Health Insurance Administration, notes that 85.9% of Taiwanese people over 65 suffer from at least one chronic disease, and there is a phenomenon of young-onset disease. According to statistics, seven of the top ten causes of death in Taiwan are related to chronic diseases, including cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lower respiratory disease, and kidney disease, indicating that chronic diseases pose a significant threat to the health of the Taiwanese people. To address the burden of chronic diseases, the National Health Insurance Administration has launched the 'Healthy Taiwan' action plan, proposing the '888 three-high prevention and control strategy' to achieve 80% of three-high (hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia) patients in the care system, 80% receiving health lifestyle consultations, and 80% achieving stable control within 8 years. She also notes that this strategy also targets healthy populations, high-risk populations, and chronic disease patients, designing preventive, management, and treatment pathways to improve overall care efficiency.

**'I'm a doctor and four things are vital if you are keen to reach 100 years old' - The Mirror**
Dr. Gareth Nye, a Biomedical Science lecturer at the University of Salford, suggests that following four key rules can potentially extend one's lifespan. These rules include increasing daily activity levels, rather than focusing on structured exercise, and avoiding prolonged periods of sitting. Dr. Nye also recommends a balanced diet, avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and foods high in saturated fats, and consuming more whole, organic foods. Additionally, he stresses the importance of getting 7-8 hours of sleep per night and visiting a GP for regular medical check-ups to understand genetic risks. According to Dr. Nye, 'In essence, a long life is down to luck, but you can improve your luck.'

**Healthy Living Extends Your Life**
A study led by Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital found that women who have no risk factors at the age of 50, such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity, live 14.5 years longer and are 13.3 years less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases. Men in the same category live 11.8 years longer and are 10.6 years less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases. According to Dr. Christina Magnussen, 'High blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol are responsible for half of the world's cardiovascular diseases. Controlling these factors extends life.' The study also found that women who do not smoke live 5.5 years longer and are 5.5 years less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases, while men who do not smoke live 4.8 years longer and are 4.8 years less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases. Prof. Dr. Stefan Blankenberg stated, 'Blood pressure control is the most contributing factor to a healthy life. It is possible to reduce risks even after the age of 50.' The study analyzed data from over 2 million people from 6 continents.

**The Elusive Quest for Eternal Life: A Conversation with Professor Yuri Konov**
Professor Yuri Konov, a gerontologist and geriatrician, discussed the concept of aging and the possibility of extending human lifespan. He noted that the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed extending youth to 45 years in 1964, but this has not been achieved. Konov emphasized that there is no scientific basis for claims of people living up to 200 years, such as the story of a 122-year-old man who allegedly choked on food at a royal reception. He also stated that modern medical advancements have not led to an increase in human lifespan, and that there is even a trend of decreasing maximum lifespan in recent years. Konov advised people to focus on living in the present and not to invest in unproven methods of extending lifespan. He noted that a 90-year-old person cannot maintain absolute mental clarity, and that people should not rely on 'fairy tales' about eternal life.

**Extending Healthy Lifespan: A Key to a Better Quality of Life**
Extending healthy lifespan is no longer just about living longer, but about living a life free from diseases and disabilities that can hinder daily activities and reduce enjoyment. Studies show that as people age, their health deteriorates, and they lose the ability to fully enjoy life. However, research on extending healthy lifespan is still underfunded, despite its importance. The world needs innovative solutions to improve quality of life as people age, especially with the global increase in average lifespan. In Saudi Arabia, for example, it is expected that the number of people over 60 will increase significantly in the coming decades. According to reports, the average lifespan has improved significantly in recent years due to advancements in healthcare and lifestyle, increasing from 18 years in 1990 to around 30 years currently, and expected to reach 40 years by 2050. This poses significant challenges to the healthcare system, requiring effective strategies to prevent age-related diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Extending healthy lifespan is not just a health goal, but also a key pillar of the Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to improve citizens' health and quality of life, and provide $40 trillion annually. Preventing age-related diseases, along with scientific progress that has made many diseases treatable, significantly contributes to achieving this goal. Improving lifestyle, such as following a healthy diet and regular exercise, can extend healthy lifespan by up to 12 months. Investing in medical research and healthcare technology can also help discover new treatments for age-related diseases, enhancing the quality of life for the elderly. Extending healthy lifespan is no longer a dream, but a necessity in a world heading towards population aging, through focusing on prevention, treatment, and investing in healthcare research, so that everyone can enjoy a healthy and active life even in old age.

**Dr. Ángel Durántez: 'Three Habits to Reduce Your Life Expectancy by 18 Years'**
Dr. Ángel Durántez, a pioneer in Longevity Medicine in Spain, explains how to live longer with health by applying the latest scientific advances. According to a study by the University of Washington, Spain is expected to have the highest rate of longevity in the world within two decades, with an average life expectancy of over 85 years in 2040. Dr. Durántez emphasizes the importance of self-care and a positive attitude towards life in achieving healthy aging. He warns that bad habits, such as poor nutrition, can reduce life expectancy by up to 18 years. To avoid this, he recommends abandoning three unhealthy habits: 'We spend many years with chronic diseases and discomfort', he says. 'Until the age of 30-35, we are in the 'free stage', without disease. Until 60, we are still fine. But after that, up to 50% of people say they feel bad or very bad. By 80, we are dependent'. 'The challenge is to extend that point of 60 to the last day of our life', he insists. 'The physical aspect is important, but so is the mental aspect. A positive attitude towards life and positivism are key to healthy aging', he emphasizes. 'The mentality. Of all we can do, the most important thing is a positive attitude towards life'. Dr. Durántez also notes that the current rate of progress in increasing life expectancy is slowing down due to unhealthy lifestyles in many populations, 'causing the opposite effect'. He recommends abandoning three unhealthy habits to avoid reducing life expectancy: 'bad eating habits, lack of physical activity, and a sedentary lifestyle', he says. 'If we don't change these habits, our life expectancy could be reduced by up to 18 years', he warns. 'It's not just about living longer, it's about living better', he concludes. 'The key is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and a positive attitude towards life', he emphasizes.

**Scientists Say There's A Simple Hack That Could Help You Extend Your Life**
Scientists have discovered a simple hack to extend one's life by five years - exercising as much as the top 25% of the population. According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, US adults over 40 who exercise at this level can add five years to their life expectancy, reaching 84 years instead of 78.6. The recommended exercise is equivalent to walking at a good clip for 160 minutes every day. Researchers believe that changes in city infrastructure, such as walkable neighborhoods and green spaces, could encourage people to be more active. As Dr. [no specific doctor mentioned] said, 'The findings suggest that physical activity provides substantially larger health benefits than previously thought.'
