**DF Authorities React to US Embassy's Travel Warning**
The authorities of the Federal District (DF) in Brazil reacted to the alert issued by the US Embassy, recommending that US citizens not travel to certain administrative regions of the DF. The governor of the DF, Ibaneis Rocha, classified the recommendation as 'unfounded' and stated that 'it was a speech without basis.' He emphasized the efficiency of the public security system in the DF and attributed the positive results to the work of the Secretariat of Security and the police forces. The US Embassy recommended that citizens avoid traveling to Ceilândia, Santa Maria, São Sebastião, and Paranoá, citing risks related to crime. However, the governor invited representatives of the US government to visit the capital to see the reality of these regions, which he described as peaceful. He also suggested that the US should focus on its own problems, such as the high crime rates in cities like New York. The secretary of Public Security, Sandro Avelar, stated that the report was made by people who do not know the reality of Brasília and suggested that the US Embassy should improve its sources of information. According to the Atlas da Violência 2025, the DF registered the lowest rate of homicides in the last 11 years, with 347 homicides in 2023, a rate of 11 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The DF is also the third unit of the Federation with the lowest rate of homicides, behind only São Paulo and Santa Catarina.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**More than half of young people will face health problems by 2030**
A new study published in The Lancet reveals that the health of adolescents and young people is in a critical situation. By 2030, more than 1 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24 will live in contexts where health conditions will become increasingly adverse. The report, prepared by the second Commission on Health and Well-being of Adolescents, consisting of 40 experts and over 200 young people from 36 countries, predicts a significant increase in mental health disorders, obesity cases, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, while anemia could affect a third of this population. 'The health of adolescents is at a critical point, with mixed progress,' said Sarah Baird, co-president of the Commission. Despite a decrease in alcohol and tobacco consumption and improved access to education, obesity and overweight have increased eightfold in certain regions of Africa and Asia over the past three decades. The document also highlights that progress in youth health has been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic and low state investment in programs targeting this age group. In 2016, fewer than 1,000 adolescents lived in unfavorable health conditions, but by 2021, the number had already exceeded 1.1 billion. Another concerning aspect is the role that climate change and technology will play. According to researchers, this will be the first generation to grow up with an average annual temperature 0.5 degrees above the pre-industrial era, which could intensify heat-related illnesses and increase cases of 'eco-anxiety,' a form of anxiety linked to environmental degradation. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence could bring new challenges to mental health and digital well-being. According to UN estimates, by 2030, there will be over 2 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24. This generation faces a health crossroads that, according to experts, can only be resolved with coordinated action and increased investment in prevention and youth well-being policies.

**30 US Cities With Highest Homicide Rates In 2024**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the age-adjusted national homicide death rate rose 30% in 2020 and another 5% in 2021, reaching 8.2 deaths per 100,000 people. This is 55% higher than it was ten years prior. Despite this, the murder rate in the US is still lower than its highest point in the 1970s and early 1990s. In 2023, there were 515 fewer murders in 32 study cities compared to 2022, a 10% drop. The CDC and FBI use different definitions of homicide and methods to gather statistics, but the FBI's data is affected by low response rates from police departments. Arlington County has a lower homicide rate than any other county in the US with a population of at least 100,000, with 3.8 deaths per 100,000 people between 2018 and 2022. It also has minimal traffic deaths, with 2.7 per 100,000, the lowest proportion in the country.

**Could 2025 see the lowest murder rate ever recorded?**
The US murder rate has been declining over the past couple of years, with the 2024 rate returning to pre-COVID levels. According to crime data analyst Jeff Asher, the initial numbers for 2025 suggest a record low murder rate is within the realm of possibility. Asher notes that a 10 percent or more decline in murder nationally in 2025 would tie 2014, which currently holds the record for the lowest national murder rate ever recorded. The numbers show a significant decline in murders in many cities, including Baltimore, St. Louis, Cleveland, Denver, New Orleans, New York, and Chicago. Asher writes, 'Running the numbers suggests that a 10 percent or more decline in murder nationally in 2025 would roughly tie 2014.' However, it's essential to note that the year is not over, and the numbers could change. Despite this, the decline in murders is a significant and positive trend, and it's worth celebrating.

**Mexico's Homicide Rates: A Complex and Ongoing Issue**
According to the Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Pública, the number of intentional homicide victims in Mexico has fluctuated significantly over the years. In the first quarter of 2015, there were 4,121 victims, which increased to 4,832 in 2016, 6,401 in 2017, 7,743 in 2018, 8,513 in 2019, and 8,809 in 2020. However, since 2021, there has been a permanent reduction, with 8,416 victims in 2021, 7,328 in 2022, 7,487 in 2023, and 7,160 in 2024. The data for January to March 2025 indicates a total of 6,799 victims. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI) data shows similar fluctuations, with 4,632 victims in 2015, 5,007 in 2016, 7,026 in 2017, 8,154 in 2018, 8,775 in 2019, 8,705 in 2020, 8,484 in 2021, 7,545 in 2022, and 7,619 in 2023. An analysis of the data suggests that there is no clear evidence that specific policies are responsible for reducing violence. Based on a time series regression analysis, a projection for 2030 suggests that there will be approximately 5,026 homicides using the Secretariado Ejecutivo data and 6,599 using the INEGI data, both of which are far from the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals for a peaceful Mexico.

**US Population to Decline Without Migration by 2033, CBO Predicts**
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population without migration will start to decline in 2033, which may hinder economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US in eight years, and population growth will be driven only by migration. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that in 2023, there were 3,591,328 births, a historic low, and 3,090,582 deaths. The birth rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The CBO expects the gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to an average annual growth rate of 2.5% over the past three decades. This is due to the decline in the workforce due to aging population and slowing productivity growth. The CBO also predicts a rise in the national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. 'Even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting,' the CBO said. The CBO's previous forecast, made in 2023, expected the US population to decline by 2040. The current forecast reflects the consequences of a government order issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern border of the US, signed by former President Joe Biden.

**US Population Expected to Start Declining in 2033, CBO Predicts**
According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population is expected to start declining in 2033, excluding migration, which could undermine economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US within eight years, and population growth will only be sustained through migration. In 2023, the US saw a record low birth rate, with 3,591,328 children born, and a death toll of 3,090,582. The fertility rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The report also notes that the US GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to a 2.5% average annual growth rate over the past three decades. This is due to the shrinking workforce as the population ages and declining productivity growth. The CBO also predicts that the number of workers will increase from 171 million in 2025 to 185 million in 2055, with an annual growth rate of 0.1%. Additionally, the report notes that the 'slowdown in the growth of educational attainment' will also hinder economic growth. The CBO also forecasts a rise in the US national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. As the CBO notes, 'even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting.' The current forecast is a revision from the CBO's previous prediction of a population decline in 2040, which was made in 2023. The new forecast takes into account the consequences of a government directive issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern US border, signed by former President Joe Biden.

**One in five girls born in 2030 will live to 100**
According to new research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), one in five girls born in 2030 is projected to live until at least 100 years old, rising to almost one in four for those born in 2047. For boys, the projections are less dramatic, with more than one in eight males born in 2030 expected to reach 100, increasing to about one in six by 2047. The figures are based on past trends in annual death registrations and assume improved mortality rates among elderly people. Kerry Gadsdon of the ONS said, 'The gap between male and female cohort life expectancy at birth has fallen over the past four decades. This is likely due to improvements in lifestyle, for example reduction in smoking rates and the working conditions of men over several decades, as well as advances in healthcare, for example the prevention and treatment of heart disease.' The ONS published the data to 'allow us to understand the size of the projected population at older ages, which is important for policy making and service planning.'

**Colombia's Homicide Rate: A Concerning Situation**
Andrés González, former Minister of Justice and member of the Externadista Center for Peace, analyzed the panorama of peace and sustainability in the world. He stated that several issues must be considered to achieve peace that is consistent with the planet's sustainability. González highlighted that Colombia's situation is concerning regarding the Sustainable Development Goals (ODS). The country has a high rate of homicides, with 25 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2024, which is four or five times higher than the global average. He expressed concerns that it will be difficult to meet the goal of reducing the homicide rate to 16 per 100,000 inhabitants by 2030. González emphasized that the lack of access to justice, the consolidation of effective and responsible institutions, and the guarantee of people's safety are essential for achieving the ODS. He also mentioned that the impunidad and the lack of presence of the State and the justice system in some regions of the country are significant factors in the violence. González recognized the role of the JEP (Special Jurisdiction for Peace) and the need to repair the victims. 'It is very difficult to achieve the goal of reducing the homicide rate to 16 per 100,000 inhabitants by 2030. We would be lucky to reach 20. Unless we take a series of structural and fundamental measures that allow for a significant change.'

**US Deaths Expected to Surpass Births in Next Decade, Report Says**
According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the number of deaths in the United States is expected to surpass the number of births in the next decade. The report attributes this change to a decline in immigration and a falling birth rate. By 2033, the number of deaths is projected to exceed the number of births, seven years earlier than previously estimated. The CBO also projects that the population of the United States will be older and smaller by 2054 due to a decline in immigration. This change will have an immediate impact on the country's economic growth, as the population growth is directly linked to the available workforce, which, along with productivity, helps to drive the economy, tax revenue, and the country's economic strength relative to competing nations like China. The report also notes that a generation will not be able to replace another within the estimated period. The low birth rate in American families is also a significant factor contributing to the new demographic numbers. The CBO projects that the fertility rate, the number of children a woman has throughout her life, will decrease from 1.7 to 1.6 by 2054, less than 2 children per family nucleus. According to the report, the agency estimates the rates based on 'past trends'. The agency's forecast for the next three decades is that the annual population growth will decrease to 0.02%, less than a quarter of the average growth rate achieved between 1975 and 2024, which was 0.9% per year.
