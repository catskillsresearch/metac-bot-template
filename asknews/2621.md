**Bangladesh sets 5.5% growth target in a modest budget**
Bangladesh's Finance Advisor Salehuddin Ahmed has set a GDP growth target of 5.5% for the 2025-26 fiscal year, the lowest in many years. The goal is part of a Tk 7.9 trillion budget proposed on Monday, which emphasizes 'holistic development' over 'growth-centric' concepts. Salehuddin said, 'Due to this fight against inflation, our GDP growth rate may be slightly lower.' The previous Awami League government had set a growth target of 6.75% in the budget for the 2024-25 fiscal year, but it was not met. The new budget also notes that the growth rate may increase to 6% in the 2026-27 fiscal year and 6.5% in the 2027-28 fiscal year. According to the Bangladesh Economic Review, the country achieved a record 8.15% GDP growth rate in the 2018-19 fiscal year, but the pandemic and other challenges have since impacted the economy.

**Japan Doubles Down on Foreign Investment Target Amid Economic Challenges**
Japan has announced plans to increase its target for foreign direct investment to 150 trillion yen (approximately 1.05 trillion dollars) by 2035, a 50% increase from the previous target set for 2030. The move aims to boost economic growth and stimulate regional dynamism, despite internal and external challenges, including a slowdown in domestic consumption and trade tensions with the US. According to Toshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, 'the investment was driven by sectors that benefited from strong local sales and tourism, such as hotel construction.' The government's new plan aims to direct a significant portion of foreign investment towards areas outside major cities, in an effort to redistribute growth and create local job opportunities. The government is considering offering financial incentives and new grants, as well as promoting partnerships between the public and private sectors, to encourage foreign companies to establish production facilities and research centers in these areas. Japan also aims to attract investments in future-oriented sectors, such as carbon removal and green technology, reflecting Tokyo's desire to play a leading role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. These goals are expected to be officially included in the government's financial and economic policy guidelines in June. Despite growth in some sectors, such as food (13%) and real estate (11%), Japan's economy contracted by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, highlighting the fragility of the economic environment. Nagahama said, 'after Trump's victory in the November elections, the threat of tariffs has made some companies cautious about new investments.' He added that it is unlikely that the data will have a significant impact on the revised GDP numbers scheduled to be released on June 9.

**US Treasury Secretary Confident US Will Never Default on Debt**
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the US government will never default on its debt, despite the lack of a decision on raising its debt ceiling. 'The United States will never default, this will never happen', he said in an interview with CBS News. Bessent added that the US authorities 'are on a warning path and will not hit a wall'. According to the International Monetary Fund's calculations, the US government debt will increase to 122.5% of GDP by 2025 and continue to rise, reaching 128.2% by 2030. Earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the country's government debt is on an 'unsustainable trajectory', but has not yet reached an unacceptable level, and it is unknown when this threshold will be crossed.

**US Faces High Risk of Financial Collapse, Warns Congressional Budget Office**
The US is facing a high risk of financial collapse, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO predicts that the federal debt will rise to 117% of the country's GDP by 2034, up from 98% last year. The interest payments on the debt are also expected to increase to 4% of the GDP, which is a significant burden on the government. Despite these alarming numbers, investors are still confident in the US economy and are willing to buy government bonds and the dollar, which are the backbone of the global financial system. However, some experts warn that the US is heading towards a financial crisis, citing the country's high debt levels and the potential for a recession. If a recession were to occur, it would have a double impact on the US finances, with a decline in tax revenues and a significant increase in welfare payments, leading to a financial collapse. The Federal Reserve may be able to mitigate some of the effects of a recession by lowering interest rates, but this would not eliminate the risk of a financial crisis. The CBO's central projections assume that the US will experience a continuous and sustained economic growth over the next decade, but this is an optimistic assumption. If the economy were to experience a recession, the US finances would be severely impacted, with a significant increase in debt and interest payments. Some experts, such as Chris Marsh from Exante Data, warn that if the yield curve does not return to its natural state, the US could face a severe financial crisis, with the federal debt rising to 125% of the GDP by 2034 and interest payments reaching 30% of the government's revenues.

**Scope Ratings: No Rating Decision for Turkey, Stable Outlook with 'BB-' Rating**
Scope Ratings, a German credit rating agency, announced that it did not make any rating decisions regarding Turkey. The agency's credit rating for Turkey is 'stable' with a rating of 'BB-'. The statement noted that global and local uncertainties, inflationary pressures, and restrictive monetary policies have negatively affected investor confidence and consumer demand. It is predicted that GDP growth will be 3.0% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026. However, the statement added that internal demand could be supported by a more gradual fiscal tightening. The government aims to reduce the general budget deficit from 5.2% in 2024 and 3.6% in 2026 to 4.0% of GDP in 2025. Officials are committed to maintaining fiscal discipline, including measures such as increasing tax collection, eliminating ineffective tax exemptions, and introducing a minimum corporate tax. It is expected that the general government debt will be around 25-27% of GDP by 2030, which is lower than that of its peers.' said officials.

**Resilient Short-Term Perspectives for Africa's Growth Despite Global Headwinds**
Despite global economic and political headwinds, Africa has resilient short-term perspectives for growth. According to the 2025 Economic Prospects for Africa (PEA 2025) report, 21 African countries are expected to achieve a growth rate of over 5% in 2025, with four countries (Ethiopia, Niger, Rwanda, and Senegal) potentially reaching the critical threshold of 7% necessary for poverty reduction and inclusive growth. Africa's projected growth rates will exceed the global average and those of most other regions, except for emerging and developing Asia. The continent's resilience is based on effective national reforms and better macroeconomic management. However, regional growth perspectives vary significantly: East Africa leads with a projected growth rate of 5.9% in 2025-2026, driven by Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania's resilience. West Africa maintains a solid growth rate of 4.3%, driven by new oil and gas discoveries in Senegal and Niger. North Africa is expected to grow at 3.6% in 2025, while Central Africa's growth will slow to 3.2% and Southern Africa will only grow by 2.2%. Despite these challenges, Africa has a huge untapped potential for national resources. The PEA 2025 estimates that with appropriate policies, Africa could mobilize an additional $1.43 trillion in national resources from fiscal and non-fiscal sources, solely through efficiency gains. Africa's unexploited resources include: natural capital, with 30% of global mineral reserves and potential revenue of over $1.6 trillion by 2030; human capital, with a median age of 19 years, representing a demographic dividend that could add $47 billion to Africa's GDP through better labor participation; financial capital, with pension fund assets reaching $1.1 trillion and official transfers potentially reaching $500 billion by 2035 if transfer costs are reduced; and commercial capital, with the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) potentially increasing exports by $560 billion and the continent's revenue by $450 billion by 2035. Urgent measures are needed to combat resource leaks. The report highlights that massive capital outflows compromise the continent's development. In comparison to the $190.7 billion in financial inflows recorded in 2022, Africa has experienced approximately $587 billion in financial outflows. Of this total, around $90 billion was lost due to illicit financial flows, $275 billion was diverted by multinational corporations that transfer their profits, and $148 billion was lost due to corruption. When Africa allocates its own capital effectively (human, natural, fiscal, commercial, and financial), global capital will follow African capital to accelerate investments in the continent's productive sectors. The report calls for global reforms in several critical areas, including: improving macroeconomic management, quality institutions, good governance, and the rule of law; mobilizing fiscal revenues through improved tax administration, expanded tax bases, and strengthened social contracts with citizens; making natural capital accounting mandatory and enforcing national value retention through enrichment requirements; deepening financial markets by exploiting institutional savings, developing local currency bond markets, and harmonizing regulatory frameworks to facilitate cross-border investments.

**US Population to Decline Without Migration by 2033, CBO Predicts**
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population without migration will start to decline in 2033, which may hinder economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US in eight years, and population growth will be driven only by migration. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that in 2023, there were 3,591,328 births, a historic low, and 3,090,582 deaths. The birth rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The CBO expects the gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to an average annual growth rate of 2.5% over the past three decades. This is due to the decline in the workforce due to aging population and slowing productivity growth. The CBO also predicts a rise in the national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. 'Even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting,' the CBO said. The CBO's previous forecast, made in 2023, expected the US population to decline by 2040. The current forecast reflects the consequences of a government order issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern border of the US, signed by former President Joe Biden.

**US Population Expected to Start Declining in 2033, CBO Predicts**
According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population is expected to start declining in 2033, excluding migration, which could undermine economic growth. The CBO predicts that mortality will exceed birth rates in the US within eight years, and population growth will only be sustained through migration. In 2023, the US saw a record low birth rate, with 3,591,328 children born, and a death toll of 3,090,582. The fertility rate among women aged 20-24 (55.4) reached a record low. The report also notes that the US GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to a 2.5% average annual growth rate over the past three decades. This is due to the shrinking workforce as the population ages and declining productivity growth. The CBO also predicts that the number of workers will increase from 171 million in 2025 to 185 million in 2055, with an annual growth rate of 0.1%. Additionally, the report notes that the 'slowdown in the growth of educational attainment' will also hinder economic growth. The CBO also forecasts a rise in the US national debt from 100% of GDP in the current fiscal year to 156% of GDP in 2055. As the CBO notes, 'even small changes in migration, birth, or death rates, accumulated over many years, can have a significant impact on results in later periods of forecasting.' The current forecast is a revision from the CBO's previous prediction of a population decline in 2040, which was made in 2023. The new forecast takes into account the consequences of a government directive issued in June 2024, which suspended the entry of most non-citizens through the southern US border, signed by former President Joe Biden.

**US Federal Debt to Reach 107% of GDP by 2029, CBO Warns**
The US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has predicted that the country's federal debt will reach 107% of the country's GDP by 2029, surpassing the highest level reached after World War II. The CBO also warned that the large increase in debt will have a negative impact on economic growth, increase interest payments to foreign investors, and pose significant risks to the country's fiscal and economic outlook. The CBO also predicted that the US budget deficit will remain at a high level over the next 30 years, with a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 6.3% on average, and 7.3% in 2055. The CBO also predicted that the US population will grow more slowly over the next 30 years, with a potential labor force growth rate of 0.3% per year, compared to 0.8% over the past 30 years. The CBO also predicted that the population will start to decline in 2033 if foreign immigration to the US does not occur. 'This is a warning of the risks of strict immigration policies,' said a Bloomberg report. The CBO also predicted that the average annual economic growth rate will be 1.6% by 2055, and the potential growth rate will be 1.7%.

**US Debt To Explode Past World War II Highs, Threatens Growth For Decades: CBO**
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released a report warning that the US public debt is on track to reach 156% of GDP by 2055, surpassing wartime records and threatening economic growth and policy freedom. The report attributes the rise in debt to chronic budget deficits, which are expected to average 6.3% of GDP over the next three decades. This will lead to slower economic growth, increased interest payments to foreign holders of US debt, and pose significant risks to the fiscal and economic outlook. The CBO also warns that the ballooning debt 'could cause lawmakers to feel constrained in their policy choices.' The report highlights the impact of an aging population on economic growth, with the number of people aged 65 and older growing faster than those in the prime working-age bracket. This demographic drag will cap real economic growth, with the economy expanding more slowly than it has over the past 30 years. The CBO estimates average annual growth of 2% from 2025 to 2035, slowing to 1.6% between 2036 and 2045 and further down to just 1.4% from 2046 to 2055. The report also warns of the risks of financial disruption, including a fiscal crisis that could cause interest rates to rise abruptly and other disruptions to occur. 'The risk of a fiscal crisis -- that is, a situation in which investors lose confidence in the value of the U.S. government's debt -- would increase,' the report said. Such an event could 'cause interest rates to rise abruptly and other disruptions to occur.' The report added that the US's fiscal position would be 'more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, because the larger the debt is, the more an increase in interest rates raises debt-service costs.' The consequences go beyond domestic concerns. If investors fear that inflation could rise, 'expectations of higher inflation could erode confidence in the U.S. dollar as the dominant international reserve currency.'

**US population set to shrink by 2033 without immigration, CBO says**
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the US population would begin to shrink in 2033 without immigration, seven years earlier than previously estimated. The CBO's long-term budget outlook report projects that annual deaths will exceed the number of births in the US by 2033, and net immigration would be necessary to drive population growth. The report also forecasts weaker economic growth, with GDP increasing at an average rate of 1.6% over the next 30 years, compared to 2.5% over the last three decades. The CBO warns of a fiscal crisis due to massive public-sector borrowing, which is projected to reduce resources available for private investment and lead to a slowdown in productivity gains. The CBO's projections also highlight the risk of a debt burden, with debt held by the public swelling to 156% of GDP in 2055. 'Increased federal borrowing is projected to reduce the resources available for private investment,' the CBO said. 'In the agency's assessment, no tipping point can be identified at which the debt-to-GDP ratio would become so high that it would make a crisis likely or imminent,' the report said.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released a report stating that the US economic growth will slow down over the next 30 years due to weak population gains and increased government spending. The report projects that publicly held debt will reach 156% of GDP in 2055, down from a previous projection of 166% of GDP in 2054. The CBO also warns that without immigration, the US population would begin to shrink in 2033. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has advocated for a '3-3-3' plan to address the debt and economic growth issues, but the CBO has expressed skepticism about the plan's feasibility. The report's warnings come as the US is on track to hit its statutory debt ceiling as early as August without a deal between Congress and the White House.

**Increasing private investments hold key to achieve Viksit Bharat by 2047**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released a report that appreciates India's economic growth despite recent setbacks. The report projects India's growth outlook for 2024-25 and 2025-26 at 6.5 per cent. However, the growth rate is expected to be lower than previous years due to a decline in manufacturing, mining, and construction sectors. The IMF executive board report suggests that deepening geo-economic fragmentation and regional conflicts could affect external demand and regional conflicts could lead to volatility in oil prices. To achieve the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047, the report recommends implementation of structural reforms, strengthening human capital, supporting greater participation of women in the labour force, and creating more employment opportunities. IMF Directors opine that 'India's strong economic performance provides an opportunity to advance critical and challenging structural reforms to realise the ambition of becoming an advanced economy by 2047'. The global agency has appreciated India's fiscal prudence and its road map for government debt to GDP reduction to 50 per cent at the central government level by 2031. A new World Bank report suggests that India will need to grow by an average of 7.8 per cent over the next 22 years to achieve the country's high income status hopes by 2047. Suggested measures include increasing total investment from current 33.5 per cent of GDP to 40 per cent (both in real terms) by 2035, increasing the overall labour participation from 56.4 per cent to above 65 per cent, accelerating overall productivity growth and achieving faster and inclusive growth across the states.
