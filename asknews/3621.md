**Humberto Costa Warns of 'Disaster' if Far-Right Wins Senate Majority**
Senator Humberto Costa (PT-PE) expressed concern about the 2026 election scenario, where 54 out of 81 Senate seats will be up for grabs. According to Costa, there is a 'concrete possibility' that the opposition, led by the far-right, will win the majority in the Senate, which he believes would be a direct threat to the country's democratic balance. 'I don't think it will be easy, but if the far-right wins a majority in the Senate, it could be a disaster for our democracy. It could start the opening of processes against STF ministers, rejection of names for the Central Bank, regulatory agencies, diplomatic corps... a true pandemonium could be installed,' Costa warned. He confirmed that he will try to renew his mandate and stated that the Senate dispute will be the PT's top priority in 2026. Costa's goal is to build a solid base of support for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), in case he is re-elected. 'In the Senate, the main strategy will be to build a solid base for the Lula government, so we don't have to face the same difficulties we're facing now,' he declared. Costa also emphasized the importance of expanding the party's representation in the Chamber of Deputies, and stated that the PT will invest in viable candidacies and names with strong electoral appeal.

**Humberto Costa: 'Far-right Senate majority would be a disaster for democracy'**
Senator and interim president of the PT, Humberto Costa, expressed concern in an interview that the opposition may win a majority of seats in the Senate in 2026, when 54 of the 81 mandates will be renewed. 'I don't believe it will be easy, but if the far-right wins a majority in the Senate, it could be a disaster for our democracy,' he said. 'It could lead to the opening of processes against STF ministers, rejection of names for the Central Bank, regulatory agencies, and the diplomatic corps... it could be a true pandemonium.' Costa confirmed that he will run for re-election and stated that the PT's central strategy will be to prioritize the Senate election. He aims to form 'the future government Lula's bench' in case of Lula's re-election in 2026. 'In the Senate, the main strategy will be to form a solid base for the Lula government, so we don't have to face the same difficulties we're facing now,' he said. Costa also stated that the party will work to expand its presence in the Chamber. 'It's possible to do so with a well-planned election. Good teams and vote-pullers can improve our situation in the Chamber,' he said.

**A New Leader for Korea: The Importance of the Upcoming Presidential Election**
The upcoming presidential election on the 3rd is a historic day that will determine the direction of South Korea. Over the past few years, Korea has lost its way due to extreme political polarization and economic stagnation, which has crippled the government and eroded public trust. Today, every citizen's choice will decide whether to return Korea to its rightful path. This election is not just about replacing or extending the current government, but also about resetting the entire government. The world is undergoing significant changes, including the US-China trade war, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the AI revolution, but Korea's political leadership has failed to respond adequately. As a result, the country's competitiveness has been weakened, and key industries such as automobiles and semiconductors are being overtaken by China and Taiwan. A new leader is desperately needed to reboot Korea. However, unfortunately, the presidential candidates have failed to meet public expectations. As the election draws to a close, they have focused more on negative campaigning than on policies. Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party of Korea candidate, has accused the People Power Party of being a 'domestic enemy,' while Kim Moon-soo and Yoon Suk-yeol have focused on Lee's personal corruption and family issues. Even their policy proposals have been populist in nature. Lee has vowed to increase spending, saying 'refusing to take on national debt is just foolish talk,' while Kim has proposed a 70 trillion won tax cut. Despite this, citizens must not give up on voting. Voting is not just about choosing a candidate, but about expressing one's opinion on the kind of country one wants. Every vote counts, and the collective opinions of citizens will determine the future of the country. Even if the chosen candidate is not elected, the weight of each vote is significant, and it can send a strong message to the political leadership.

**Dems Weigh High-Risk, High-Reward Plan to Win the Senate**
Democratic strategists are considering a high-risk, high-reward plan to win the Senate by quietly backing independent candidates in traditionally Republican states. The strategy involves minimal disclosure and late-cycle involvement to avoid angering the party's base and ruining the candidates' aura of independence. Potential target states include Nebraska, Iowa, and Alaska, where Senate contests are taking place this year. This approach highlights the difficulty of the Senate map for Democrats and the need to repair their brand among a wide swath of the country. Some officials have reached a more dire conclusion, anticipating a challenging midterms next year.

**Cory Booker Announces Plan To Occupy The Rhineland**
Senator Cory Booker announced a surprise plan to reoccupy the Rhineland, a move that would be the first step in returning the Third Reich to its former glory. Booker's plan includes invading Poland, seizing Czechoslovakia, and purifying the Aryan race of undesirables. He declared, 'I am now only the first soldier of the German Reich. I have put on the mantle that was most sacred and dearest to me again. I will not take it off until victory is secured, otherwise I will not survive.' Booker's Nationalist Socialist Party aims to emerge victorious in the next election, paving the way for the security and rights of the Reich. However, local man Roger Dame expressed skepticism, saying 'I'm not sure he realizes we're in California?'

**House Dems' campaign chair says her party's 'on offense' in 2026 battle to win back majority from GOP**
House Democratic campaign chair Suzan DelBene says her party is 'on offense' in the 2026 battle to win back the majority from the GOP. DelBene notes that the party only needs three more seats to take control of the House, and that they have 35 districts in play where they have opportunities. She argues that the reason they have opportunities is because people are outraged and want to see someone who will fight for their communities, not just be blindly loyal to a president. DelBene also points to the fact that the party gained seats in the 2024 elections and is confident that they will take back the majority in 2026. However, the party is facing a polling dilemma, with their ratings at historic lows in national surveys. The Fox News poll showed that 41% of voters have a favorable view of the Democrats, while 56% have an unfavorable view. Despite this, the poll also showed that 49% of voters would back a generic Democrat in their congressional district, while 42% would support the generic Republican candidate.

**Senate rankings: The 5 seats most likely to flip**
The 2026 midterm cycle is heating up, with several Senate seats up for grabs. Here are the five seats most likely to flip: Georgia, North Carolina, Maine, Michigan, and New Hampshire. In Georgia, Sen. Jon Ossoff is considered the most vulnerable Democrat, and Republicans are eager to win back the seat. However, the GOP's top choice, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, has decided not to run, leaving a crowded field of B-tier candidates. In North Carolina, Democrats are waiting to see if Gov. Roy Cooper will run against Sen. Thom Tillis. In Maine, Democrats are struggling to find a viable candidate against Sen. Susan Collins, and Rep. Jared Golden has announced he will run for his House seat instead. In Michigan, a trio of Democrats are running to succeed retiring Sen. Gary Peters, including Rep. Haley Stevens and former health director Abdul El-Sayed. In New Hampshire, Rep. Chris Pappas is the top-tier Democratic candidate, but Republicans are eyeing a comeback with former Sen. Scott Brown. 'Kemp is the 1:1 on the board. Full stop,' said one GOP operative. 'This is a situation where you want a primary. Where you want them to show their mettle because I just don't think that we have a clear enough indication on any of these guys to say they can do it.' Democrats remain bullish on their chances, but the Republican Party is confident in their ability to win back the majority. 'I am bullish on Jon Ossoff.... He's done a great job. He's centered the people of Georgia and their needs and their concerns,' said Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). 'I'd hate to have to run as a Republican in this moment,' he added.

**What does the future hold for the California Democratic Party?**
The California Democratic Party is facing a moment of reckoning after recent losses, but leaders are calling for self-introspection and acknowledging the need to do more to win over voters. Rusty Hicks, the Chair of the California Democratic Party, acknowledged that the state legislature has more work ahead to address affordability issues, but shrugged off the fact that Republicans managed to flip three legislative seats during the 2024 election. Despite this, Democrats continue to enjoy a supermajority in Sacramento. The party's priority in 2026 will be the congressional midterm elections, and they plan to engage with young voters by going to high school and college campuses. Democrats are hoping to wrest back control of at least one of the houses in Congress to thwart Republicans' attempts to advance President Donald Trump's agenda. 'We need to think about how we talk about economics, with a real plan to help people who are struggling,' said Dave Min, a Democrat. 'We need to stay focused and fearless, go into red districts with resolve,' added Sydney Kamlager-Dove. Corrin Rankin, chair of the California Republican Party, responded that Republicans are just getting started and that the 2024 election made one thing clear: 'Voters are done with Democrat mismanagement. Californians are ready for change, and Republicans are ready to lead.'

**US Republicans Move to Allow Donald Trump a Third Term**
US Republican Andy Ogles has proposed a constitutional amendment to allow President Donald Trump to serve a third term. The amendment would modify the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms, to allow for a third term. Ogles claims to have 'a lot of support' among his Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives, but acknowledged that the amendment would face a 'tough road' to passage. The proposed change would enable Trump to serve a third term on a constitutional basis. Ogles justified his proposal by citing Trump's 'decisive leadership', which he claims has been in contrast to the 'chaos, suffering, and economic decline' experienced by Americans in the past four years. Trump has expressed interest in serving a third term, saying 'Many people want me to do it.' However, the amendment would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, and then ratification by three-quarters of state legislatures, making it an unlikely outcome. Democratic lawmakers have criticized the proposal, with Representative Steve Cohen saying 'Two terms are enough chaos for any nation to endure.'

**Senate | Cook Political Report**
The Cook Political Report provides an overview of the 2024 US Senate elections, highlighting key battleground states and potential candidates. The report notes that Democrats' chances of winning the Senate depend on their performance in Maine, which is considered a challenging state to win. The article also mentions potential Republican candidates in Alabama and Louisiana, and discusses the importance of the Senate elections in determining the balance of power in Congress. According to Jessica Taylor, 'A crowded GOP field is expected to seek to succeed Tuberville in Alabama Senate.' Additionally, 'Bayou Battle looms as Cassidy tries to repent from Trump impeachment vote' in Louisiana. Amy Walter states, 'Democrats' road to the Senate goes through Maine. That's harder than it sounds.' The report concludes by asking, 'Could Republicans blow it again?'

**Carlos Kikuchi Warns of Peronist Party's Potential Loss in Buenos Aires Elections**
Senator Carlos Kikuchi, a former member of La Libertad Avanza, has warned that the Peronist party may lose the province of Buenos Aires in the upcoming elections if it does not unite. Kikuchi, who recently launched his new space, Unión, Renovación y Fe (URF), believes that the key to the September 7th elections will be the Peronist party's ability to unite, which is currently fragmented between the Peronist nucleus and Axel Kicillof's allies. 'If Cristina Kirchner runs for the third section, she will win. That would be a desperate attempt to consolidate her leadership in the province. I don't know if she will nationalize the election, but it depends on who they put in front of her,' Kikuchi said. He also warned that Kicillof is 'resting on a structure of 45 mayors' who want to distance themselves from the Kirchnerism. 'He is being pushed to treat the re-election of the mayors, it seems like he is resting on the justicialism that wants to break with the Kirchnerism, but he is afraid of the albertismo,' Kikuchi said. Kikuchi also made a hint at CFK's internal conflict with Kicillof, saying 'I'm not sure if she is more interested in distancing herself from the Kirchnerism than losing the election.' He also noted that the Kirchnerism and massism 'have always given her the right,' but Kicillof 'still has not shown any sign of approaching' CFK. Kikuchi presented his new space, URF, as a liberal alternative in the province, aiming to absorb part of the libertarian vote. 'There is a 20% of Buenos Aires residents who are against the Kirchnerism, but they also don't fully support the government,' he argued.

**Trump Rules Out Third Term, Talks Succession**
US President Trump has made it clear that he has no intention of seeking a third term in office, and has spoken for the first time about the issue of succession. Trump said, 'There are many people who buy the 2028 hat, but I don't want to do that. I want to have four great years and then hand over to a great Republican.' Trump acknowledged that the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution prohibits anyone from being elected president more than twice. He said, 'I will be an eight-year president, two terms. That's important.' Trump also mentioned some potential successors, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, saying they are 'hot' candidates for the future of the Republican Party. Trump praised Vance, saying he is 'talented', and believes his vice presidential position gives him an advantage in future Republican primaries. Trump also praised Rubio, saying he 'does a great job', and believes he can handle the position of National Security Adviser in the short term. Trump is confident about the 2026 midterm elections, saying, 'Those who win the presidential election usually lose the House or Senate. But I think we can easily turn this trend around.'

**Trump Rules Out Third Term, Names JD Vance and Marco Rubio as Potential Successors**
US President Donald Trump has ruled out seeking a third term, despite the sale of 'Trump 2028' hats by his organization. Trump stated, 'I'm going to be an eight-year president, a two-term president. I've always thought that's very important.' He claims this is not allowed by the Constitution, although he is unsure of the reason. Trump has named JD Vance and Marco Rubio as potential successors, praising Vance's 'fantastic' work as his vice president and Rubio as 'excellent.' Trump's focus is now on the 2026 midterm elections, where the Republican Party aims to maintain its majority in both the House and Senate. Trump concluded, 'It's quite consistent that the winner of the Presidency ends up losing the House, losing the Senate. But I think we're going to flip that, easily.'

**Cannabis or Coal? The Topics Shaping Australia's Election**
The upcoming Australian Senate election on May 3 will determine which policies become a reality. With more than half of the Senate up for re-election, analysts predict the Greens will keep their single Senate seat in each state. Right-wing minor parties such as One Nation and Clive Palmer's Trumpet of Patriots have a chance to win seats in states where the coalition vote is low. Legalise Cannabis is also a plausible party to win a seat, according to election analyst Ben Raue. The field in Queensland is crowded, with either One Nation's Malcolm Roberts or LNP defector Gerard Rennick's People First party likely to claim the third conservative seat. Senator Rennick said it would be hard to retain his seat but a minor-party alternative to the coalition is needed. The Liberals are in danger of losing their third seat in South Australia or Western Australia to a minor party. Jacqui Lambie is likely to retain her Tasmanian seat, but the outcome is not guaranteed. Labor could take a third seat in Victoria or WA or a second in Queensland if there is a big enough bump in its vote, but this is unlikely.

**Poland's Ruling Coalition on the Brink of Collapse**
The ruling coalition in Poland may soon break apart, according to Ryszard Petru, a deputy from the 'Poland 2050' party. Petru stated that the coalition 'Third Way', which includes 'Poland 2050', the speaker of the Sejm, Shimon Holownia, and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), led by Minister of National Defense, Władysław Kosiniak-Kamyszek, is likely to dissolve. 'We disagree with PSL on most ideological issues,' Petru said. He added that after the presidential election in May, 'we will need to decide on the next plan.' 'I would assume that this project will not be continued. It was more of an election project,' Petru stated. Meanwhile, Jarosław Zięba, a deputy from the Polish Peasant Party, also expects the coalition 'Poland 2050' to break apart after the presidential election. 'I think that after the presidential election, we will have to get used to the idea that PSL will exist on its own, and 'Poland 2050' will not exist. I'm afraid that by that time, this project will be over,' Zięba said. The current balance of power in the Sejm suggests that without the votes of 'Poland 2050' deputies, Donald Tusk's coalition will not have a parliamentary majority.

They mention several potential candidates, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who they consider the 'best choice' due to her intelligence, communication skills, and anti-corruption stance. They also highlight her bilingualism, youth, and online engagement.

**Alberto Feitosa: 'There is a need for a third option' in 2026 Pernambuco gubernatorial election**
Alberto Feitosa, a state deputy in Pernambuco, stated that there is room for a third option in the 2026 Pernambuco gubernatorial election, which could counterbalance the possible polarization between Governor Raquel Lyra and Recife Mayor João Campos. According to Feitosa, the election will be influenced by the national plebiscite and may be polarized between the current government and a Bolsonarist right-wing representative. 'There is not only space, but a need for a third option. The election will be nationalized. The tendency is that Bolsonaro will influence the state elections. Given this, it is logical that we need a candidate. Because, what I have heard is that one of the Senate seats will be for who Bolsonaro indicates. We need to have our own candidacy to help that senatorial candidate,' explains Feitosa. Feitosa suggests that the 2022 ticket, which included Anderson Ferreira as governor candidate and Gilson Machado Neto as senator candidate, could be repeated. However, the senator candidate would need to align with the main Bolsonarist agenda. 'It will be Bolsonaro's candidate. It will be the one who will set the agenda and sign the impeachment of a Supreme Court minister. Someone who will face the consequences,' Feitosa points out. Feitosa emphasizes that the decision will be made by Bolsonaro himself and that he will personally follow Bolsonaro's instructions. He believes that the Liberal Party in Pernambuco will grow in 2026, both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Pernambuco Legislative Assembly.

**La Libertad Avanza's Strategy to Win the Election: A Complex Game of Alliances**
The Government has made progress in its goal to hold elections without primaries, as the Chamber of Deputies approved the official project of electoral reform, which includes the suspension of PASO for this year. The initiative will now be debated in the Senate's extraordinary sessions. La Libertad Avanza is confident that the election will favor them, as they are likely to have more deputies and senators after the 11th of December. However, the Senate is a different story, and the Government wants to design a strategy to win each senator. In the City of Buenos Aires, the PRO party's decision to participate or not will be crucial in winning a senator. La Libertad Avanza's ideal scenario is for the PRO to become the first minority, allowing them to win two senators and a third ally from the PRO. The PRO, however, does not want to be seen as the tail of the Milei's party, and some of its leaders are furious with La Libertad Avanza's leaders, who they believe are trying to empty the PRO by proposing candidates. The peronismo seems to be more confused than expectant, with many of its leaders believing that Cristina Kirchner is a burden that prevents other members from taking flight. For now, it seems that there is no room for third parties, as La Libertad Avanza and the PRO will likely remain allies. This has allowed the kirchnerismo to resurface as the true opposition and the second force at the national level, maintaining its weight in the conurbano, where Cristina Kirchner has the most support, according to Cristina Kirchner, 'the expresidenta es un ancla que no deja despegar ni tener vuelo a cualquier otro miembro del peronismo.'

**Hardly any support for third party in 2025 elections**
A commentator notes that third parties will not survive the 2025 elections, citing the APNU+AFC's behavior in office and the Asha Kissoon saga as factors contributing to erosion in trust for third parties. Recent poll findings suggest that none of the mini parties will win a seat, and even under a 'joinder list', they may only scrape one or two seats. The PPP is expected to run away with the elections, making gains from the PNC (APNU)+AFC coalition. The commentator notes that there is no credible third party to challenge the PPP, and the history of the PNC does not make it attractive to middle of the road voters. According to the commentator, 'it will be an uphill task for a coalition to challenge the PPP given the power of the purse of the incumbent and its spending spree on infrastructure projects, grants, etc.'
