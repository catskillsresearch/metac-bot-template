**Editorial: Shifting the scales requires bold action**
The government's proposal to offer free weight-loss drugs for those with a body mass index of over 35 has been met with criticism, with Health Minister Jo Etienne Abela describing the drugs as a 'quick fix'. However, experts agree that a multifaceted approach is necessary to tackle the obesity epidemic, which has failed to make significant progress despite decades of initiatives. The World Health Organisation predicts that the number of people with obesity will double by 2035. Research has shown that obesity is a complex, costly, and chronic disease caused by factors beyond an individual's control, including the addictive effects of ultra-processed food. Abela has proposed a 'multifaceted approach' that includes policy decisions to shape the food environment, addressing social and economic factors, and increasing collaboration with the private sector and professionals on the ground. He has also floated the introduction of a sugar tax and announced a research programme on food labelling, supply, and promotion. Abela's efforts are seen as a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to make obesity a national priority and safeguard future generations from the long-term health and economic consequences of the disease.

**Pioneering Technique Allows Patient to Walk Without Assistance Just 24 Hours After Surgery**
A pioneering technique at the Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA) has allowed a patient to walk without assistance just 24 hours after being admitted with a tumor and in a wheelchair. The technique, called ablación bronquial por microondas con crioterapia, is minimally invasive and combines microwave ablation with cryotherapy. It is also the first time in the world that it has been performed under the guidance of an ecobroncoscopio, increasing its precision and safety. Dr. Miguel Ariza, a member of the HUCA's Intervencionista de Neumología team, explained that the most notable aspect of the technique is that it avoids invasive procedures like traditional thoracic surgery, which requires weeks of recovery. 'We have minimized the risk of damaging healthy adjacent tissues by performing the procedure under ecobroncoscopic control,' he added. The technique has been shared at the Pulmonology OnAir Global Event 2024 and has been exported to over 20 countries in just two years. Dr. Ángel Expósito, director of La Linterna de COPE, said that the success of the technique has been 'rotund' and will 'change the paradigm of lung cancer treatment.'

**Cryopreservation: A $80,000 USD Gamble for a Second Chance**
Alcor, a US-based non-profit organization, is offering Quebecers the chance to cryopreserve their heads for $80,000 USD and their bodies for $220,000 USD, plus annual fees. Jeremy Wiggins, president of Alcor Canada, explains that the cost is often covered by life insurance policies. 'We have teams that deploy to the bedside of the person,' he adds. Alcor, founded in 1972, cryopreserves human bodies in liquid nitrogen in the hope of reviving them one day. Wiggins notes that some elderly people move to the US, just 10 minutes away from Alcor's offices, to be cryopreserved quickly after death. 'We want to have Quebecers and Canadians among our members,' he says, seeking donors to support his research. However, the cost of cryopreservation is not for everyone. 'There are annual fees based on age. The earlier you sign up, the cheaper it is,' Wiggins explains. Annual membership fees range from $60 USD per year for children to $200 USD per year for adults.

**Robert Miller's Quest for Immortality through Cryopreservation**
Robert Miller, a Montreal billionaire, has been accused of sex crimes against several underage girls. Despite his declining health, he wants to avoid prison and death through cryopreservation. Miller has paid a fortune to be cryopreserved after his death and hopes to be revived in the future when his accusers will be gone. The cryopreservation process is handled by the Alcor foundation, which has already preserved the remains of 240 people. Miller's lawyers have confirmed that he has made arrangements for his body to be preserved at Alcor. The cost of cryopreserving a person's head is $80,000, while the cost of preserving the entire body is $220,000. Since 2001, Alcor has been receiving a significant portion of its funding from Miller, who has also created his own foundation to support the organization. The Future Cryonics Foundation has injected $24 million into Alcor, which has increased its presence in Canada and has opened an office in Ottawa. However, some experts, such as Michael Hendricks, a professor at McGill University, are skeptical about the possibility of reviving people in the future and believe that the cryopreservation process is more of a 'poudre de perlimpinpin' than a real solution.

**Cryopreservation: The Quest for Immortality**
Scientists are working on a way to bring people back to life through a process called cryopreservation. This involves freezing a body in a tank filled with liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees Celsius, with the goal of reviving it in the future. Several companies around the world are working on this technology, including the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona, USA. According to the article, there are currently 200 people who have undergone cryopreservation, including a 14-year-old British girl who died of cancer in 2015 and had her body cryopreserved. Ramón Risco, a scientist at the University of Seville, has successfully revived a microscopical worm that had been cryopreserved and believes that this technology could be applied to humans in the future. However, the article also raises concerns about the ethics of cryopreservation and the potential consequences of reviving a person after a long period of time. 'It's only a matter of time' before this technology becomes a reality, says Risco, but 'we need to control how the cooling and mass transfer process is carried out to avoid the formation of ice, which is our greatest enemy when it comes to cryopreserving a body.'

**Russia's Growing Interest in Cryonics: Freezing Bodies in the Hope of Revival**
Cryonics, a technology that freezes the human body or brain at extremely low temperatures in the hope of reviving it in the future, has gained popularity in Russia, with a 30% increase in interest in 2025. In Russia, it is possible to freeze the body, and the cost is not prohibitively expensive. Cryonics Institute and Alcor Life Extension Foundation, two of the largest cryonic companies, are based in the US and have been storing bodies and brains of their clients for decades, hoping to revive them in the future. In Asia, interest in cryonics is also growing, with the Yinfeng Life Science Foundation in China having performed several procedures. The process of cryopreservation begins immediately after clinical death, with specialists cooling the body to -10°C to slow down cell destruction. The next step is to replace blood with cryoprotectant, a special solution that prevents the formation of ice crystals that can damage cells. The body is then cooled to -130°C to avoid sudden changes that can harm tissues. When the body is fully prepared, it is placed in a cryostat, a container filled with liquid nitrogen, where it is stored at -196°C in a vertical position, waiting for technologies that can revive it. Clients can choose either full body freezing or brain preservation, hoping that in the future, it will be possible to create a new body or transfer consciousness into an artificial shell. Although cryonics looks promising, it has serious problems, including cell damage even with cryoprotectants, and the lack of technology to revive the frozen. However, supporters of this idea believe that nanomedicine and artificial intelligence will eventually find a way to revive the frozen.
