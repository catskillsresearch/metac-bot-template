**New McCarthyism: Trump's America turns to racialized persecution - Asia Times**
The United States is experiencing a civil liberties crisis, with the Trump administration's second term seeing a rapid escalation of surveillance and legal action targeting Chinese and other Asian communities. This is not an immigration issue, but a racialized persecution of talent, dignity, and due process. Since January 2025, over 60 Chinese and Chinese American scholars have been subjected to federal inquiries or visa denials without clear evidence of wrongdoing. The Department of Homeland Security's 'foreign influence' watchlists have expanded to include individuals affiliated with Chinese institutions, and surveillance programs like Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) are being turbocharged. This is a moral emergency, and the response must match the scale of the threat. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka's arrest serves as a stark reminder of the potential for federal overreach and the importance of safeguarding civil liberties for all individuals, regardless of their background or status.

**Jerry Jones admits Trump anti-DEI message made NFL more 'aware' in wake of accelerator program pause - CBSSports.com**
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones admitted that recent Supreme Court rulings and President Donald Trump's anti-DEI policy positions have made the NFL more 'aware' of the issue. Jones stated, 'The emphasis the president puts on it just makes us all aware and thinking about it.' However, Jones emphasized that the 2023 Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action has had a greater influence on decision-making than Trump's rhetoric. Pittsburgh Steelers owner and NFL diversity committee chair Art Rooney II countered that the NFL is not abandoning its diversity efforts, saying, 'We're still not satisfied with where we are, and we recognize that we still have work to do.' The NFL is re-evaluating its coaching accelerator program, which has been paused, with the goal of making improvements, including combining head coaching and front office candidates.

**Dont overstay your visa: US Embassy issues stern warning to Indian travellers - The Tribune**
The US Embassy in India has issued a stern warning to Indian nationals traveling on visas, stating that overstaying a visa, even by a short period, can result in deportation and a permanent ban from entering the country again. The warning comes amid a renewed immigration crackdown under US President Donald Trump's second term, which has seen aggressive pursuit of immigration reforms and enforcement actions. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has also emphasized that holding a valid visa or green card does not guarantee immunity from deportation, and that individuals who promote violence or terrorism can face immediate removal, regardless of their immigration status. As the White House continues to overhaul the H-1B visa program and expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, the message is clear: coming to America is a privilege, not a right.

**US imposes visa bans on India travel agents for facilitating illegal migration**
The U.S. State Department has imposed visa restrictions on owners and staff at India-based travel agencies that allegedly facilitate illegal migration to the United States. According to department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, the move aims to 'cut off alien smuggling networks.' Bruce stated, 'We will continue to take steps to impose visa restrictions against owners, executives, and senior officials of travel agencies.' The decision comes as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on migration and deport undocumented immigrants. The U.S. embassy in New Delhi has warned Indian nationals about the consequences of overstaying their authorized period of stay in the country, including deportation and a permanent ban on re-entry.

**Trump-Backed Proposal to Tax Remittances Advances in US House**
A proposal backed by former US President Donald Trump, which includes a 5% tax on remittances sent by foreigners and visa holders, has advanced in the US House of Representatives. The proposal was approved by a narrow majority of 17 votes to 16 in the Budget Committee, with all Republican votes in favor. The proposal aims to raise revenue by taxing remittances, which are sent by foreigners and visa holders. The tax would be 5% of the amount sent. The proposal also includes tax cuts and increased defense spending. However, the proposal has been criticized by Democrats and some Republicans, who argue that it would add to the national debt and would not be fair to certain groups. 'We are issuing checks that we cannot cash, and our children will pay the price,' said Representative Chip Roy. 'Something needs to change, or I will not support it.' The proposal is expected to face further negotiations, but the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, aims to bring it to the full House before the end of the week. 'This is the vehicle through which we will fulfill the mandate that the American people gave us in the last elections,' he said.

**Trump Administration Warns World Cup Visitors: 'Don't Stay Too Long'**
The Trump administration has warned visitors to the 2026 World Cup in the US that they should not stay too long, emphasizing that they must comply with the conditions of their visa. Vice President JD Vance stated, 'Everyone is invited, but don't stay too long.' The warning reflects a shift towards stricter policies, even in the context of a major international event. The US government aims to send a direct message to football fans planning to attend the World Cup: hospitality will not be synonymous with tolerance for overstaying one's visa. This warning from the Trump administration to tourists responds to the need to maintain control over migration in the face of a massive influx of visitors during the tournament. The authorities have warned that failing to comply with the authorized stay period on the tourist visa for the World Cup 2026 could have severe migration consequences, including restrictions on entry to the US in the future, cancellation of existing visas, and obstacles to new migration applications. This warning to foreign visitors was defined as a preventive measure, but with strict application under the US migration policy. The US government has confirmed that during the 2026 World Cup, additional measures of migration surveillance will be implemented at international airports and key entry points, aiming to monitor the flow of tourists in real-time and detect possible cases of unauthorized prolonged stay, in line with the guidelines of the new Trump administration.

US President Donald Trump has issued a new rule requiring non-citizens, including H-1B work visa holders, F-1 student visa holders, and Green Card holders, to carry proof of their legal status at all times. The rule, part of Trump's executive action 'Protecting the American People Against Invasion', is effective from April 11, 2025, and affects over 5.4 million Indians living in the US. According to the Department of Homeland Security, 'All non-citizens 18 and older must carry this documentation at all times. This administration has directed DHS to prioritize enforcement -- there will no sanctuary for noncompliance.' Failure to comply could result in a fine or up to six months in jail.

**Trump Administration Seeks to Eliminate Diversity Visa Lottery**
The Diversity Visa Lottery, also known as the 'visa lottery', has been a topic of discussion since Donald Trump's presidency. The program, which offers up to 55,000 visas to immigrants each year, has been criticized by some as an 'unnecessary exercise' that could compromise national security. According to the US Embassy in Guatemala, the visas are intended to provide an opportunity for immigration to people from countries with a low National Gross Income (NGI), defined as $13,000 or less. However, a new proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, aims to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery and prevent winners from sponsoring family members for permanent residence. The proposal, presented by Representative Mike Collins, argues that the program is an 'exercise in virtue signaling' and that the US should focus on 'common-sense solutions' to its immigration policies. Collins stated, 'We have opened the US to an endless chain migration system while launching a dart at the world and allowing a faceless computer code to determine the path to citizenship for 50,000 immigrants.' The proposal is not the first attempt to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery, as Trump had previously expressed his intention to end the program in 2017, citing security concerns. However, the new composition of Congress and the renewed push by the Trump administration may change the current landscape. Collins added, 'We have opened the US to an endless chain migration system while launching a dart at the world and allowing a faceless computer code to determine the path to citizenship for 50,000 immigrants.'

**US Introduces New Policy to Limit Visas for Foreign Officials Facilitating Irregular Immigration**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new policy to limit the issuance of visas to foreign officials who facilitate irregular immigration to the United States. According to Rubio, securing the country's borders is crucial for the security and prosperity of the United States. He stated, 'Today, I am announcing a new policy to limit the issuance of visas to government officials from abroad, including immigration and customs officials, airport and port authorities, and others who intentionally facilitate irregular immigration to the United States.' The policy also includes private sector entities that provide services to irregular migrants traveling to the United States. Rubio emphasized that the US will not retreat from defending its national security interests. This move comes after President Donald Trump's executive order on January 20, which canceled programs 'Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion' and 'CBBW' that allowed for lawful immigration to the US. Trump also ordered the establishment of a facility in Guantanamo Bay to detain 30,000 'criminal migrants' who enter the country illegally.

**Trump's New Attempt to Eliminate the Diversity Visa Program**
A new proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, aims to eliminate the Diversity Visa Program, also known as the lottery visa program, which grants up to 55,000 permits per year to certain applicants. The program, which has been in place for years, has been criticized for being unnecessary and for prioritizing diversity over security. According to Rep. Mike Collins, the program is 'a pointless exercise in virtue signaling by the government.' Collins argues that the program is 'a chain migration system' that allows a computer algorithm to determine the path to citizenship for 50,000 immigrants. He also claims that the program is 'a broken system' that needs to be reformed. The proposal has been met with support from conservative organizations such as Heritage Action and NumbersUSA, which argue that the program undermines national security and restricts opportunities for qualified workers. 'We should be awarding visas to the best and brightest immigrants from around the world who share our commitment to American values,' said Ryan Walker, vice president of Heritage Action. 'Issuing visas based on arbitrary 'diversity' quotas undermines national security, restricts opportunities for qualified workers, and doesn't promote true diversity,' he added.

**Update on Legal Challenges to President Trump's Presidential Actions**
Since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, he has issued a record number of presidential actions, including 62 executive orders and various declarations. Several of these actions have been challenged in court, including orders to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates and programs. The Office of Management and Budget ('OMB') also issued a memorandum freezing federal grants and loans. Additionally, an order aimed to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants and those temporarily present in the U.S. Furthermore, an order, referred to as 'Fork in the Road,' offered financial incentives to encourage federal employees to resign, with the goal of downsizing the federal workforce. AGG will continue to monitor developments related to President Trump's presidential actions.

**Lotería de visas: ¿otra puerta que cierra a los cubanos?**
A new initiative led by Republican congressman Mike Collins threatens to eliminate the Diversity Visa Program for Immigrants (DV) in the United States, also known as the 'visa lottery'. This program, which allows over 50,000 immigrants to obtain permanent residence each year, could be canceled if Collins' proposal, part of the SAFE Act, is successful. Collins argues that the measure aims to 'stop chain migration by eliminating the possibility of winners of the Visa Lottery sponsoring family members to obtain green cards'. Collins stated, 'We have opened our country to an almost endless chain migration system while launching a dart at the world and leaving a faceless computer code to determine the path to citizenship for 50,000 immigrants'. The Republican initiative rekindles an old debate about the continuation of the program, which has been criticized in the past. In 2017, Donald Trump asked Congress to eliminate it, saying 'It sounds good but it's not good, it's not good. It hasn't been good and we've been against it'. Opponents of the visa lottery consider it unfair to grant privileges to immigrants without a merit-based selection process. Collins emphasized, 'Ending the Visa Lottery is common sense'. Ryan Walker, executive vice president of Heritage Action, argued that 'arbitrary diversity quotas' could restrict opportunities for qualified talents and pose a risk to national security. Roy Beck, founder of NumbersUSA, strongly criticized the program, calling it 'one of the most insulting government programs against American workers'. The argument of national security has been a key point in efforts to eliminate the program. In 2017, the terrorist attack in New York by Sayfullo Saipov, who had obtained his residence through the visa lottery in 2010, reignited the debate. The threat of canceling the program comes on top of the recent exclusion of Cuban citizens from the DV-2026 lottery, which had been open for registration until November 2024. Cuba, one of the countries historically most benefited by this type of visa, was left out of the list of eligible countries, which still includes Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.

**Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program**
President Donald Trump has the opportunity to cancel the Diversity Visa program, also known as the 'green card lottery', which has been criticized for undermining American interests. The program, established in 1990, randomly selects participants for a legal immigration pathway, with 55,000 immigrant visas granted annually. However, the program lacks a meritocratic foundation, is susceptible to criminal activity and fraud, and poses national security threats. Since its inception, the program has brought over 1.5 million immigrants to the US, but also indirectly facilitated the arrival of millions more. The program's selection process chooses individuals regardless of their education, skill, or economic needs, contradicting American values. The US consular corps allocates significant time and effort to verifying the authenticity of submitted documents, but many applicants come from countries where bribery and document forgery are common practices. The program has been associated with numerous criminal enterprises and has allowed potentially dangerous individuals to enter the country. President Trump has called for the program's termination, and with Republicans in control of Congress, he now has an historic opportunity to build a more rational immigration system.

**US order on workforce diversity will hit Indians**
US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the US government and private sector. This move is seen as a reversal of affirmative action policies, which were introduced by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. Trump has accused his predecessor, Joe Biden, of 'DEI madness' and has urged private companies to 'end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences.' Several large companies, including Walmart, Target, and Amazon, have already rolled back their DEI programs. The move is expected to have global implications, particularly for Indians who are hired by these companies. Women and people of color in the US will also be affected by the new executive order, which is seen as a step backward in the fight for equality.

**Executive Order Tracker**
President Trump has issued a series of executive orders and actions on January 20-24, 2025, aimed at reforming various aspects of the federal government and addressing national security concerns. Key actions include: revoking executive orders related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and immigration; reinstating the Mexico City Policy; ending federal funding for elective abortions; and declaring a national emergency at the southern border. The orders also aim to strengthen American leadership in artificial intelligence, digital financial technology, and energy production; and to reform the federal hiring process and restore merit-based hiring.
