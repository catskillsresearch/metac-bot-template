**Panama to Start Building Railway to Paso Canoas in 2026**
Panama plans to start building a railway to Paso Canoas, on the southern border with Costa Rica, in January 2026, according to Panamanian authorities. The ambitious project aims to connect Panama with Costa Rica and reduce the time it takes to transport goods from San José to the Panama Canal from 1.5 days to approximately 9 hours. 'We believe that by January 2026, construction will begin,' said Henrry Faarup, general secretary of the Panama Railroad. The project also seeks to establish a physical connection with Costa Rica. 'The idea is to already have a foot in Costa Rica,' Faarup said. Private companies are already conducting studies of prefactibility to join the project, according to Álvaro Bermúdez, president of the Costa Rican Institute of Railroads (Incofer). 'Studies are being conducted through private initiative. There are companies interested in being granted a concession. These are studies of prefactibility; then would come the feasibility studies,' Bermúdez explained.

**Panama Canal Sees 30% Increase in Maritime Traffic**
The Panama Canal has seen a 30.44% increase in maritime traffic between October 2024 and April 2025, with a total of 7,083 transits. According to La Prensa, this represents a significant growth despite the severe drought in the region during the same period last year. Ricaurte Vásquez, administrator of the waterway, stated during the Climate Week that the current situation due to tariffs and duties imposed by the US government has not affected operations. 'There have been no effects on transit,' he said. However, with US-China tariffs under negotiation and global uncertainty surrounding the conditions that will apply to commercial flows, maritime transport operators cannot yet estimate the final impact of the new international configuration. Of the total traffic through the Panama Canal by April, 73.06% was recorded in Panamax locks with 5,175 transits, while Neopanamax locks saw 1,908 vessels pass through, accounting for 26.94%.

**Panama Asks India to Adhere to the Neutrality Treaty of the Canal**
Panama's Foreign Minister, Javier Martínez-Acha, officially requested that an Indian parliamentary delegation, led by Shashi Tharoor, adhere to the Neutrality Treaty of the Canal. The treaty 'declares that the Canal, as an international waterway, will be permanently neutral according to the regime established in this treaty.' Tharoor stated, 'We know the importance of this issue for Panama and it is a very important point that we are studying. We commit to you, Minister, in this sense.' The Neutrality Treaty was signed in 1977 and has been adhered to by at least 40 countries from Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. This comes amid tensions between Panama and the US, with Panama complaining about the payment of tolls by US ships and the alleged influence of China.

**The Separation of Panama from Colombia: A Historical Perspective**
The separation of Panama from Colombia 121 years ago is a significant event that has shaped the country's history. The US took control of the Panama Canal, and the Panamanian government was established with the support of the US. However, the Colombian government considered this intervention as an infringement of international law. The US and Colombia negotiated several treaties, including the Cortes-Root Treaty of 1909 and the Urrutia-Thomson Treaty of 1914, which was approved by the Colombian Congress. However, the treaty was criticized for its lack of protection for indigenous peoples and its favoritism towards US companies. The treaty was later revised and approved again in 1921. In 1958, the Colombian Supreme Court ruled that the 1914 treaty was not a perfect act until it was approved by the US, and that the 1936 constitutional reform had indirectly ratified the treaty. The US returned control of the canal to Panama in 1999, but the two countries have since announced cooperation agreements on military matters. The article concludes that revisiting the historical debates between the US and Colombia can provide insights into the present and future of Panama.

**Panama Canal Reservoir Project Sparks Opposition from Local Farmers**
The construction of a new reservoir for the Panama Canal has sparked opposition from local farmers, who are concerned about losing their homes and livelihoods. The reservoir, which will occupy 4,600 hectares, is intended to prevent the effects of severe droughts, such as the one in 2023, which forced a significant reduction in ship traffic. 'We will fight to the end,' said Magdalena Martínez, a 49-year-old farmer who lives in the village of Boca de Uracillo. 'We don't know where we will go, and they are not offering us anything that excites us. We won't be able to live the same way here.' The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has promised to dialogue with the affected communities and reach agreements, but if the reservoir is not built, 'we will regret it in 15 years,' said Karina Vergara, manager of the Social and Environmental Team of Water Projects at the ACP. The project is expected to begin in 2027 and be completed in 2032, with an investment of $1.6 billion, of which $400 million will be used to indemnify and relocate around 2,500 people from several villages.

**The Separation of Panama from Colombia: A Timely Reminder of the Era of Donald Trump**
The separation of Panama from Colombia 121 years ago is a timely reminder of the era of Donald Trump. The US has long been interested in the Panama Canal, and its geostrategic importance has resurfaced with Trump's presidency. The US has called for the canal to be returned to American control, citing Chinese influence. This echoes the famous phrase 'I took Panama', attributed to President Theodore Roosevelt, whose expansionism was key to Panama's independence and US dominance over the 'Eighth Wonder of the World'. The US and Colombia signed the Mallarino-Bidlack treaty in 1846, granting the US a franchise for the transit of cargo and passengers through the ports and future interoceanic railroad, in exchange for maintaining sovereignty and reciprocal exemptions. However, this agreement marked the beginning of Colombia's loss of sovereignty over the Isthmus. The construction of the canal was entrusted to Ferdinand De Lesseps, who had successfully built the Suez Canal. However, the project was paralyzed in 1899 due to unforeseen climatic conditions and technical errors. The company went bankrupt in the midst of a financial and political scandal that shook France. The bankruptcy coincided with the War of the Thousand Days (1899-1902), which pitted the conservative government against the armed faction of the Liberal Party. US military intervention in the Isthmus to protect the railroad was decisive in ending the conflict, with the peace agreement signed in Panama on a US warship. The US and Colombia negotiated the Herrán-Hay treaty in 1903, which granted the US exclusive rights to build, exploit, and protect the canal for 100 years, renewable at their discretion. The Colombian Senate rejected the treaty in 1903, citing concerns over sovereignty, nationalism, and a lack of understanding of the international context. Meanwhile, a secessionist movement was brewing in Panama, driven by local elites frustrated with Bogotá's inaction and fearful of losing the opportunity for the canal. On November 3, 1903, Panama declared independence from Colombia, with US backing and the collaboration of the railroad company. The US recognized Panama's independence three days later and guaranteed its protection against potential Colombian reprisals. Colombia saw US intervention as an international infringement, as the Mallarino-Bidlack treaty obligated the US to guarantee Colombian sovereignty and not intervene in internal conflicts. Various diplomatic attempts to resolve the 'Panama Affair' failed, including the Cortes-Root treaty of 1909, which Colombia rejected. The US and Colombia negotiated a new treaty in 1914, which was approved by the Colombian Congress in 1914. However, the Colombian Supreme Court abstained from ruling on a challenge to the treaty's constitutionality, citing a lack of jurisdiction. The debate over the treaty was transferred to the US Senate, which refused to accept the expression of 'sincere regret' and the $25 million compensation agreed upon. The Colombian government also issued a decree establishing state ownership of the subsoil petroleum, which the US saw as a risk to its oil company investments and which stalled the ratification of the agreement. The US Supreme Court ultimately declared the decree unconstitutional in 1919. The treaty was finally ratified by the US Senate in 1921 and maintained the agreed-upon compensation. Colombia approved the treaty in 1921, but with significant divisions. The treaty was later challenged in court, with the Colombian Supreme Court ruling that it was constitutional in 1958. The US returned the canal to Panama in 1999 and withdrew its military presence from the area. However, new cooperation agreements between the two countries have been announced. The fate of Panama is tied to its canal, and the resurgent interests of the US will determine its future.

**Panama Seeks Investors from Houston, Texas**
Panama is seeking potential investors from Houston, Texas, as part of the Panama Week Texas 2025 event. The event, organized by the U.S.-Panama Business Council (USPA), brought together a delegation from Panama, including representatives from the Ministry of Commerce and Industries (MICI), to meet with executives from the Port of Houston, led by CEO Charlie Jenkins. The delegation was also attended by representatives from Tocumen, S.A. and the Autoridad del Canal de Panamá. Several U.S. companies expressed interest in investing in Panama, particularly in the aeronautical and oil industries, and plan to visit the country in June to gather more information on legal, fiscal, and logistical matters.

**Panama Asks India to Adhere to the Neutrality Treaty of the Canal Amid US Crisis**
Panama's Foreign Minister, Javier Martínez-Acha, has officially asked an Indian parliamentary delegation, led by Shashi Tharoor, to consider joining the Neutrality Treaty of the Canal, amidst the crisis caused by US President Donald Trump's intentions to 'reclaim' the canal. 'This is a very important point for us and we are working to get more countries to adhere to the neutrality pact, so we would like to collaborate with you to achieve that goal,' Martínez-Acha said, according to a statement from the Panamanian Foreign Ministry. Tharoor, a former candidate for UN Secretary-General and member of the opposition Congress Party, replied, 'We know how important this issue is for Panama and it's a very important point we are studying. We commit to you, Minister, in that sense.' Tharoor also explained that the adherence to the historic treaty 'has been considered for some time, as the new Panamanian ambassador to India, Alonso Correa Miguel, has presented it to various government institutions in New Delhi,' according to official information. The Neutrality Treaty 'declares that the Canal, as an international waterway of transit, will be permanently neutral according to the regime established in this treaty,' according to the official document. At least 40 countries from Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa have already adhered to this treaty, signed in 1977 along with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which marked the transfer of the Canal to Panama. Trump has expressed his intention to 'reclaim' the Panama Canal since December, citing China's influence, denied by the Panamanian government, and complaining about the payment of tolls for US ships.

**White House Disputes Pentagon's Investigation into Panama Canal Leak**
The White House does not believe the Pentagon's investigation into the 'leak of a top-secret document' regarding the Panama Canal. The investigation is about an incident involving data leaks about the US options for regaining control over the Panama Canal. In April, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth fired three senior advisors and accused them of leaking information. Hegseth's lawyer, Tim Parlatore, claimed that there was evidence of their involvement in the leak - they were wiretapped. However, this explanation worried Trump's advisors - the wiretapping was likely illegal and could have made the scandal even bigger than the leak itself. Parlatore later denied making such statements and claimed that he received the information from other sources within the Ministry of Defense. After this, Trump's advisors began to doubt the credibility of the investigation. One of them suggested that the investigation might have been used as a pretext to fire assistants involved in conflicts with the first head of Hegseth's office, Joe Kasper, who was also fired in April. On April 10, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth reported to Trump after a visit to Panama: 'We are returning control over the Panama Canal. China has become too entrenched there, and this happened during the Obama era and others who allowed them to gradually infiltrate. Together with Panama, we had a very successful visit. The President of Panama, Muñoz, conveyed warm words to the United States as a great ally. And it seems they want the communist China to leave. Now our military is working together with Panamanian forces, and we have a chance to completely expel the Chinese.' After Hegseth's report, Trump spoke about the redeployment of American troops: 'We have redeployed many units to Panama, filling areas that we previously controlled but later lost. Now they are under our control again. And, in my opinion, this is a very positive step towards stability and control.'

**US Studies Military Options to Regain Control of Panama Canal**
The Pentagon is studying all options to ensure the United States regains control of the Panama Canal, which was transferred to Panamanian authorities in 1999. A provisional document of national security guidance, circulating in the Trump administration, asks the US military to analyze military options to ensure US access to the canal. According to sources, Donald Trump is willing to use all means to regain US control over the canal, a major engineering work that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through an 82-kilometer canal. The canal has become a vital strategic navigation route. 'The canal belongs to the Panamanians. The canal is operated by Panamanians. And in case of a threat, the only one who can appeal to other nations to defend the operation of the canal is our country, is the President of the Republic,' said Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martínez-Acha in response to the news. 'Let the Panamanian people be assured that the canal remains ours and will continue to be so. There is no threat.' The use of military force to regain control of the canal, which was controlled by the US until 1977 and then jointly managed with Panama before being transferred to Panamanian sovereignty in 1999, is just one of the options outlined in the provisional document, which also includes less drastic measures. According to Trump, the canal is currently controlled by China. A group of investors led by BlackRock announced last week that they plan to spend $22.8 billion to acquire the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal, as well as 43 other ports, from CK Hutchison. The announcement was met with a negative comment from the Chinese state newspaper Ta Kung Pao, which called it a 'betrayal' to the Chinese people and 'cowardly servitude.' This led to a loss of over 6% of the company's value on the stock exchange, according to CNN. 'I don't know if there is a need for Chinese regulatory approval, given that CKH maintains all Chinese ports,' said Dan Baker, Morningstar analyst. However, 'there is a possibility that other influences may be exercised over the company that could put the agreement at risk.'

**Panama's President Denies Trump's Claims on Regaining Control of the Panama Canal**
Panama's President, José Raúl Mulino, stated that 'US President Donald Trump is lying again' about his administration's efforts to regain control of the Panama Canal. Mulino said in a post on the 'X' platform on Wednesday: 'President Trump is lying again, and his claim that Panama is being restored is not true.' He added: 'This issue has not been discussed even in our talks with US Secretary of State Mark Rubio, and on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, I reject this new attempt to distort the truth and our national honor.' Mulino emphasized that the canal belongs to Panama and will remain so, citing the clear agreements between the two governments on shared interests. He reiterated that the canal is for the Panamanians and will continue to be so. Trump stated in a speech to Congress on Tuesday that his administration is in the process of regaining control of the Panama Canal. In his first speech after taking office in January 2024, Trump said: 'China is running the Panama Canal, we gave it to Panama, not China, and we will take it back.' In 1977, US President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos signed two historic treaties, which stipulated the transfer of sovereignty of the Panama Canal to Panama by December 31, 1999, with guarantees of the canal's neutrality and continued use for international navigation.

**Five Key Numbers to Understand Why the Panama Canal Matters to the US**
The Panama Canal has been under American pressure since Donald Trump's inauguration on January 21. On February 6, Panamanian President Paul José Mulino withdrew from the Chinese infrastructure project of the New Silk Road. This decision came a few days after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit to counter Beijing's influence on the Panama Canal. A controversy has sparked tensions between Panama and the US after a State Department publication on social media on February 5 announced that Panama would exempt US government ships from taxes. The Panamanian president then denied the information. Here are five key numbers to understand why the Panama Canal is so important to the US. The Panama Canal has been under American control, either total or partial, for 86 years. In 1903, Panama gained independence from Colombia, but became an American protectorate, and the Panama Canal zone passed under US control. The canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, was finally inaugurated in 1914 after 30 years of work and an investment of $375 million, making it the most expensive project in US history. In 1977, the Torrijos-Carter treaties were signed between Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos and US President Jimmy Carter to authorize the transfer of control of the canal to Panama. A joint administration was set up to ensure the transition, and it took over 20 years for Panama to take full control in 1999. Donald Trump threatened to 'reclaim' the canal on January 20, 2025, saying, 'China is exploiting the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're going to take it back.' He also claimed that US ships were 'heavily overtaxed.' However, the canal's toll is determined by the ship's capacity and cargo type, not the country of origin. A commercial ship can pay over $100,000 to cross the canal. In August 2024, the container ship MSC Marie became the 'largest cargo ship to have ever crossed the interoceanic waterway,' according to the Panama Canal Authority, measuring 366 meters long and 51 meters wide, and paying $1.3 million in tolls. The US remains the canal's main client, with 74% of the total cargo transported. China is in second place, followed by Japan, South Korea, and Chile. The canal is also a key route for US trade, with over 40% of US container traffic, worth around $270 billion annually, passing through it. A ship traveling from New York to San Francisco can save around 13,000 kilometers of travel by using the canal. The canal's tolls generated $4.986 billion between October 2023 and September 2024, a record figure despite the droughts that have affected the canal in recent years, which reduced maritime traffic by 20% compared to the previous year.

**Rubio Pursues US Dominance Over Panama Canal, Backed by Trump's Threats**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama on Sunday to pressure for American dominance over the Panama Canal, backed by Trump's threat of illegal seizure of the canal. The Panama Canal Authority has bowed to the threats from the world's largest military power, stating that it will 'optimize transit priority' for American warships, while Bloomberg reported that Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino 'assured Rubio that American warships would enjoy free passage.' Mulino also announced on Sunday that Panama would not renew its participation in China's Belt and Road Initiative, becoming the first country in Latin America to do so. He also expressed the intention to terminate Panama's current agreements with China on the Belt and Road Initiative, which expire in 2026. Rubio hovered over the announcement, writing on X on Monday, 'Yesterday's announcement from President Jose Raul Mulino that Panama will allow its participation in the [Chinese Communist Party's] Belt and Road Initiative to expire, is a big step forward for US-Panama relations.' The Panama Canal is the world's second busiest shipping route. Originally constructed by the US in the early 20th century, control was transferred to Panama in 1999 under the terms of a 1977 treaty. Under Trump's inauguration on January 20, Trump threatened, 'We gave [the Canal] to Panama, and we're taking it back.' Just days later, Trump confirmed that he threatened to use 'military force' to annex Panama, as well as Greenland, the Arctic territory controlled by Denmark. Trump said, 'We need them for economic security.' Trump reinforced his threats of illegal seizure of the Panama Canal on Sunday, before Rubio left, saying, 'China runs the Panama Canal. It was not given to China, it was given to Panama, stupidly, but they're breaking the agreement and we're going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen.' His threats against Panama are part of his efforts to consolidate control over the American continents and their central waterways, as part of a military buildup for war with China. The Wall Street Journal noted, commenting on Rubio's trip, 'Most of Rubio's predecessors over the past decade have visited London or other major American allies on their first foreign trips. The choice of Panama as his first stop reflected how much Trump has upended American diplomatic priorities and refocused US attention on the western hemisphere.' The State Department wrote, in a report from the meeting between Rubio and Mulino: 'President Trump has taken an interim decision that the current position of the Chinese Communist Party for influence and control over the Panama Canal area is a threat to the canal and represents a breach of the Treaty on Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal. Secretary of State Rubio made it clear that this status quo is unacceptable, and that, in addition to immediate changes, it would require the US to take necessary measures to protect its rights under the Treaty.' The claim that Panama is breaching the treaty is a lie. Panama allows ships under all flags to pass through the canal, as specified in the treaty. What Trump seeks is preferential treatment for American warships, ships and cargo, and the seizure of the canal to carry out a blockade of China in the event that Trump launches an illegal and aggressive war against the country. Trump has seized upon the fact that cargo terminals at the ends of the canal are operated by Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong-based port operator, as a pretext for alleged breaches of the treaty. Earlier this month, the Panamanian government announced that it had initiated a review of Hutchison's operations, in line with demands from the Trump administration. Ahead of his departure for Panama, Rubio claimed that China has a contingency plan to close the Panama Canal in the event of war with the US. 'And if the government of China in a conflict tells them to close the Panama Canal, they will do it,' Rubio said. 'And I have no doubt that they have contingency plans to do it. It's a direct threat.' On New Year's Day, Trump posted on Truth Social that 'China's fantastic soldiers' 'lovingly but illegally operate the Panama Canal.' These claims are a lie. Hutchison has no control over the transit of ships through the ports, and the company could not have prevented American ships from transiting the canal in the event of war with China. The use of military force to secure US dominance over the canal is not unique. In 1989, the US invaded Panama to illegally overthrow the government of Manuel Noriega, killing 500 Panamanians. In response to the ongoing US press campaign, the Financial Times commented, 'Panama's government and business elite are starting to panic, diplomats said, realizing that even if Trump's rhetoric can be inflammatory, the US president and his allies are serious about pressuring their small country to make concessions and reduce China's presence - even if it means tearing up legally binding agreements.' In an interview with Politico published over the weekend, Panama's former president Ernesto Pérez Balladares raised the very real threat of a US invasion of Panama, saying, 'I think there will be many, many victims on our side,' he said, 'and international condemnation of the US.'

**Rubio's Visit to Panama Met with Resistance Over Canal Dispute**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit to Panama was met with resistance, with protesters holding signs that read, 'My country, my sovereignty, my canal.' They were burning American flags and effigies of Rubio and US President Donald Trump, who had announced plans to take back the Panama Canal, if necessary with military force. Panama's President José Raúl Mulino had previously stated that he would not negotiate or initiate a negotiation process over the canal, saying, 'The canal belongs to Panama.' Mulino also expressed understanding for US concerns over Chinese presence in the canal, but stated that Panama has full control over the waterway. The US Department of State said that the influence and control of the Chinese Communist Party over the Panama Canal area is a threat, and that the current situation is unacceptable. Rubio's visit was also focused on countering Chinese influence in the region, and Panama announced that it would withdraw from the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. Mulino described the meeting with Rubio as respectful, and agreed to continue cooperation on combating illegal migration and organized crime. Panama has already seen a significant reduction in migrant numbers, with a 41% decrease in 2024 and a 94% decrease in January 2025. The US has been financing the repatriation of migrants, and Mulino expects that the recent developments in US-Venezuela relations will lead to a significant decrease in Venezuelan migrants passing through Panama.

**Trump Threatens to Take Back Panama Canal, but Panama's President Disagrees**
US President Donald Trump has made a statement about the Panama Canal, saying 'We will either take it back or something will happen.' Trump claimed that China is controlling the Panama Canal, despite the US having given it to Panama. However, Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino stated that the canal's sovereignty is not up for discussion and that it will continue to be operated by Panama. Mulino also informed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Panama will not renew the agreement with China, which was signed in 2017 as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Trump had previously mentioned the idea of taking back the Panama Canal in his first presidential address, saying 'China is operating the Panama Canal. We gave it to Panama, and we are taking it back.' Mulino responded to Trump's statement on January 20, saying 'The Panama Canal belongs to Panama and will always belong to Panama.'

**Protests Erupt in Panama Against US Threats to Reclaim Canal Control**
Protests erupted in Panama on Sunday in a 'patriotic day' against US President Donald Trump's threats to reclaim control of the Panama Canal and against the presence of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who met with Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino. 'The idea of Trump retaking control over the Panama Canal is absolutely illegal,' said protesters. The protesters, led by the United People's Alliance for Life, marched peacefully from the Parque Porras to the Presidential Palace, but were blocked by police and anti-riot forces. 'One territory, one flag!' and 'This country is not for sale!' were among the chants shouted by the protesters, who included members of the National Union of Construction Workers (Suntracs). The situation escalated with the burning and trampling of images of Trump and Rubio. This comes after previous protests in which nationalist reaffirmation actions were taken through symbolic 'planting of flags' in Panama. On Friday, clashes broke out between police and students at the University of Panama during a protest in defense of national sovereignty. Since taking office on January 20, Trump has targeted Panama's relations with the US, threatening to reclaim control over the canal in response to China's influence in the interoceanic route and major ports in the country. Mulino has insisted that the canal 'is and will remain Panamanian.' Mulino and Rubio met on Sunday amidst the dispute over the canal, which Trump has threatened to 'recover.' Rubio's visit to Panama is part of his first trip as Secretary of State, which includes a visit to the Miraflores locks in the canal and a meeting with canal authorities. The Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and transits 3% of global trade. The canal was opened by the US in 1914 and its control was transferred to Panama on December 31, 1999, under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977.

**Blinken to Warn: Panama Canal Must Not Be Controlled by CCP**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Panama and other Central American countries from February 1 to 6. During his visit, Blinken will emphasize that the Panama Canal is a strategic asset that cannot be controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This is the first overseas trip by Blinken since he took office, and it marks the first time a US Secretary of State has chosen Latin America as the destination for their first official trip. According to Mauricio Claver-Carone, the US Special Envoy for the Western Hemisphere, Blinken will visit Panama first and will inspect the Panama Canal. Claver-Carone said that the CCP's control of the canal is not only a threat to US national security but also a threat to Panama's own security and the security of the region. 'If the 21st century is to be the century of the United States and the golden age of the Americas, then this strategic asset cannot be controlled by the CCP, whether in fact or in law,' Claver-Carone said. The Panama Canal was built by the US in 1914 and was transferred to Panama in 1999. However, the CCP has been increasing its influence in the region, and Claver-Carone said that the situation has 'completely gotten out of control.' The US has expressed concerns about the CCP's control of the canal, and President Trump has repeatedly criticized the CCP's control of the canal. Claver-Carone said that the US and Panama are responsible for the security of the canal, and the US has three questions that need to be answered. Blinken will discuss these issues during his visit. The US has also expressed concerns about the construction of a new bridge in the canal by a Chinese company, which could potentially close the canal and disrupt trade. The bridge is being built by a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies and is expected to be completed in 2026. 'If the CCP government demands that they (Panama) close the Panama Canal, they must do so,' Blinken said. 'This is a direct threat.' Blinken will also visit El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and the Dominican Republic during his trip. The US State Department has announced that it will pay more attention to developing relationships with Western Hemisphere countries and strengthening their own capabilities to resist countries like the CCP that make many promises but few deliveries.

**US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Visit Panama Amidst China Concerns**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to visit Panama, where he will discuss immigration and the future of the Panama Canal, amidst criticism from President Trump over China's presence on the canal and plans to return the canal to US control. Trump has claimed that Panama has handed control of the canal to China, but both Beijing and Panamanian President Jose Raúl Mulino have denied this. The Panama Canal is a 82-kilometer waterway that connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. While the US built the canal in 1914, Panama gained full control in 1999. However, the US still has the right to use military force to regain control of the canal if its neutrality is threatened. The canal is a crucial trade route, with around 40% of all US container shipments passing through it. China is the second-largest user of the canal. However, China's growing presence around the canal has raised concerns in Washington that Beijing may gain control of the canal, especially if a conflict breaks out between the two superpowers. US General Laura Richardson testified in Congress in 2024 that China's investments in Latin America are 'peaceful' but many will give China strategic access for its military and serve as a base for its naval fleet. China's President Xi Jinping has stated that Beijing seeks objective cooperation with Panama. However, Professor Evan Ellis of the US Army War College believes that in the event of a military operation by China against Taiwan, Beijing will use its influence and technical expertise to try to limit or stop the exploitation of the canal. This could be done through 'organizing' a ship sinking or physical or cyber sabotage of the locks.

**Panama's President Rules Out Negotiations with US Over Panama Canal Ownership**
Panama's President Laurentino Cortizo said, 'We will not be holding any negotiations with the US regarding ownership of the Panama Canal.' Cortizo expressed hope that the upcoming visit of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio would allow them to focus on shared interests, including migration and combating drug trafficking. Rubio is visiting Panama as a representative of US President Donald Trump, who previously stated his intention to regain control of the Panama Canal. Cortizo emphasized that 'we cannot hold negotiations' about transferring the canal to US control and that 'it is impossible.' He stated that the Hong Kong consortium manages the ports at both ends of the canal, but Panama controls it. 'The canal belongs to Panama,' Cortizo concluded. Trump previously announced his intention to regain control of the Panama Canal in December 2024, to which Cortizo responded that 'every square meter of the Panama Canal belongs to Panama and will belong to Panama.' During his inauguration speech on January 20, Trump stated that he wants to 'take the Panama Canal' from Panama, accusing the country's government of failing to fulfill promises regarding canal tariffs. Cortizo responded on the same day that the canal belonged to and would belong to Panama, and that his administration would remain under Panama's control regarding its permanent neutrality. Cortizo added that there is no country in the world that would intervene in Panama's management.
