**Europe Delays Stricter Banking Rules to Keep 'Level Playing Field' With US Rivals**
The European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, has delayed the implementation of stricter banking rules, known as the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, until 2027. The rules, part of the Basel III international banking reforms, aim to create global standards for banks to measure risk and withstand shocks. However, the delay is seen as a response to the US's less stringent regulations, which have allowed US investment banks to thrive. As JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley reported record revenue from their equity traders in the first quarter, the EU's investment banks may face a disadvantage if the new rules are implemented now, said the European Commission. 'We want to maintain a level playing field with our US rivals,' said the Commission. The delay will give the EU's investment banks a one-year reprieve, but the rules will still be implemented in 2027.

**Canadian and US Funds Eye Mexico for Investment Amid Global Uncertainty**
Despite the uncertainty caused by Donald Trump and the upcoming renegotiation of the TMEC, Mexico continues to attract the attention of global investors, said the Mexican Association of FIBRAs Inmobiliarias (AMEFIBRA). 'Canadian and American funds, as well as those from other countries, are showing a strong interest in investing in Mexico,' said Jorge Ávalos, vice president of AMEFIBRA. He highlighted the rapid growth of industrial development in the country, with 117 new industrial parks under construction, including 13 that were inaugurated in the first quarter of 2025. 'This represents a growth of nearly 100% driven mainly by the relocation of supply chains and the demand for modern and efficient infrastructure,' he said. The growing need for logistics infrastructure, combined with sustainable strategies, makes Mexican FIBRAs key players in a increasingly demanding and environmentally conscious global market, Ávalos added.

**Markets in Flux: Geopolitics Redraws the Map of Global Investing in 2025**
Geopolitical tensions have increased in 2025, causing investors to reassess traditional safe-haven assets and hedge against systemic risk. The renewed conflict in Yemen and rising tensions between India and Pakistan have accelerated a change in how global risks are perceived, with each military conflict now evaluated for its potential to destabilize trade routes, energy markets, and monetary policy worldwide. As a result, investors are increasingly cautious, with gold and Bitcoin standing out as key ad hoc shelters rather than traditional safe-haven assets. The Middle East will likely remain in an unstable zone in 2025, with existing tensions persisting for two years and the risk of escalation between 2026 and 2028. This could lead to an increase in global energy prices and push for higher inflation. The Strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage and one of the world's most critical shipping arteries, could be blocked, pushing oil prices to $90 to $100 per barrel and tightening liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets. Gold demand has risen 16 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025, driven by investment demand soaring 170 percent. However, even safe-haven assets are now subject to whiplash as sentiment shifts rapidly. Investors are deploying gold more strategically, using it for income and timing market cycles, not just as a panic exit.

**M'sia secures RM90bil approved investments in 1Q**
Malaysia secured RM89.8bil in approved investments for the first quarter of 2025, a 3.7% year-on-year increase despite global economic challenges. The investments, spread across 1,556 projects, are expected to generate over 33,300 new employment opportunities. Foreign investments dominated, contributing RM60.4bil or 67.3% of total investments. Investment Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Aziz said the increase in higher-skilled jobs reflects the country's success in creating better-paying jobs. He noted that the investment environment in 2025 will remain challenging due to geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, but Malaysia's clear policies should attract more investments from Asia's growing economy. Mida CEO Datuk Sikh Shamsul Ibrahim Sikh Abdul Majid said the projects support the national effort to build a more diversified and resilient economy, and that Malaysia will strengthen its local ecosystem to remain a choice location for high-performing companies.

**Volatility and Trade Wars Drive Migration to Low-Risk Assets**
The global economic uncertainty, fueled by market volatility and the resurgence of trade tensions between the US and China, is redefining investment strategies in 2025. As a result, investors are migrating towards low-risk assets, such as money market funds and high-quality bonds, seeking to protect their capital without sacrificing moderate returns. According to the Investment Company Institute (ICI), money market funds reached a record high of $7.03 trillion in assets at the end of the first quarter, with a weekly growth of over $51 billion. Tudor Securities' report 'Volatility, Risk, and Opportunity: The New Investment Map for 2025' notes that this shift reflects a change in priorities among investors, who are seeking refuge from an international environment characterized by monetary tightening, global trade deceleration, and the effects of the new US government's protectionist policies. 'The reactivation of a trade war with China and other economic powers has increased tensions in the markets. New tariffs, combined with possible reprisals, have generated disruptions in supply chains, increased production costs, and inflationary pressures that complicate investment decision-making,' the study says. In this context, traditional instruments such as high-quality sovereign, municipal, and corporate bonds are also gaining prominence. For example, J.P. Morgan reports that corporate bonds are offering yields above 5%, making them an attractive alternative to variable income, especially for conservative or moderately risk-averse portfolios. Juan Pablo Cortés, senior Private Banker at Tudor Securities in Colombia, notes that 'the investment focus for 2025 should start from the understanding of a challenging global environment, marked by geopolitical tensions and trade wars. In that scenario, prioritizing defensive assets like fixed income or money market funds allows navigating uncertainty without losing exposure to returns.' Although variable income remains attractive in the long term, especially in sectors like technology or energy, experts agree that recent volatility in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices has encouraged a tactical retreat of capital towards safer positions. This trend translates into a reconfiguration of portfolios, which now incorporate more liquid and lower-risk assets in a more balanced way. The report also notes that this preference for conservative assets does not necessarily imply a renunciation of profitability, as some hybrid instruments, such as structured notes, are offering annual returns of up to 20%, with different levels of capital protection depending on the investor's profile, keeping in mind that these products require a higher level of advice and market understanding.

**CareTrust REIT: Institutional Investors See Opportunities**
Institutional investors are increasing their stakes in CareTrust REIT, despite the volatile healthcare market. The company's clever expansion strategy, including an international twist, has caught the attention of big players. GAMMA Investing LLC, Vanguard Group, and FMR LLC have all increased their positions in the first quarter of 2025. CareTrust REIT recently raised its quarterly dividend to $0.335 per share, representing a 4.6% annual yield. Analysts remain optimistic, with an average price target of $31.17, and some predicting $32. However, the company's ability to meet expectations with its international expansion remains a question. The next quarterly earnings will provide clarity on this matter.

'The results of our first quarter are a record performance for the company, as both revenue and net income attributable to common shareholders have reached the highest levels in the first quarter since our transition from MFRI to Perma-Pipe in 2017. In addition, net income attributable to common shareholders during the first quarter represents approximately 55% of the company's full-year fiscal 2024 results,' said President and CEO Saleh Sagr. 'We are satisfied with the level of commercial activity we are seeing in various markets, which has contributed to the overall increase in revenue and profits during the first quarter. We are also encouraged by the level of performance in both the Americas and the MENA region, which have produced similar results during the first quarter,' said Sagr. 'The solidity of our first quarter results gives us a significant boost towards the other quarters of fiscal year 2025. We believe we are well-positioned to continue to leverage this momentum and generate further participation in MENA development programs and gain further market share in the North America region,' concluded Sagr.

**IMF Sees 'Positive Surprises' in Emerging and Developing Economies**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has seen 'positive surprises' in the growth of emerging and developing economies in the first quarter of the year, related to the reductions and pauses in the trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump. According to IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack, 'We have observed some positive surprises in the growth of the first quarter for this group of countries, including China. We have also seen recent reductions in some tariffs, which represents an upside risk to our forecast.' The IMF had previously reduced its global economic growth forecast to 2.8% in April, due to the effects of Trump's trade war, with a decline for emerging and developing markets from 4.3% in 2024 to 3.7% this year. However, the pauses in the application of tariffs by Washington and the agreements reached with the UK and China have modified the economic landscape, which the IMF will take into account for the review of its projections, to be published by the end of July. The IMF suggests a 'multifaceted policy response' to the 'complex and uncertain economic landscape' for emerging and developing economies. According to Kozack, 'First, it is necessary to calibrate carefully monetary policy and macroprudential or prudent policies to maintain stability in countries. We also recommend that this group of countries rebuild their fiscal margins.' The IMF has also encouraged countries to 'pursue the necessary reforms to avoid further delays in reforms associated with the boost to productivity and long-term growth.' 'Addressing debt is important, of course, through fiscal consolidation, but also, and very importantly, promoting growth and increasing productivity,' Kozack warned.

**IMF Observes 'Positive Surprises' in Emerging and Developing Economies**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has observed 'positive surprises' in the growth of emerging and developing economies during the first quarter of the year. According to IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack, these surprises are due to the recent reductions and pauses in the trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump. The IMF had previously reduced its global economic growth forecast by half a percentage point to 2.8% in April, due to the effects of Trump's tariff policy. However, the pauses in the application of tariffs and the agreements reached with the UK and China have changed the economic landscape. The IMF recommends a multi-faceted policy response for emerging and developing economies, including monetary policy to carefully calibrate monetary policy and macroprudential policies to maintain stability in countries. Additionally, rebuilding fiscal margins to boost long-term growth and productivity. The IMF projects a global economic growth of 2.8% for this year, while for Latin America and the Caribbean, a 0.5-point reduction is expected in 2025 (2%) and 0.3 points in 2026 (2.4%). For Mexico, the IMF projects a growth of 1.4% for 2025, highlighting challenges due to deceleration of consumption and investment.

**US Investment in Nuevo León Doubles in First Quarter of 2025**
In the first quarter of 2025, the United States (US) invested 1.453 billion dollars in Nuevo León (NL), Mexico, a 133.98% increase from the same period in 2024. This investment represents 54.34% of the total foreign direct investment (FDI) in NL, making the US the primary source of FDI in the state. NL received a total of 2.674 billion dollars in FDI during the first quarter, a 6.91% annual growth. According to Jorge Moreno, economist and researcher at the UANL Faculty of Economics, 'the nearshoring is the engine that drove the growth and economic recovery of our state, as a leader and entity of national growth. This will not change; the state will be the preferred place to locate, due to the quality of the workforce, the favorable business environment, and the great social infrastructure.' However, he also warned that this scenario is exposed to risks: 'a blow to nearshoring that affects Mexico will also harm the state, perhaps to a lesser extent, but it will not be the indicators that many expected. In the face of uncertainty and international changes, that flow of investment could stop.'

**International Direct Investments in Turkey Increase by 89.3% in First Quarter of 2025**
International direct investments in Turkey increased by 89.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, reaching $3 billion, according to the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB). The total value of international direct investments in Turkey as of March 2025 was $13.1 billion, the highest level since May 2023. Kazakhstan was the top investor in the first quarter, followed by the Netherlands and the United States. The sectors that received the most international direct investments in the first quarter were wholesale and retail trade, accounting for 48% of the total, followed by manufacturing with 22.2% and financial and insurance activities with 9.4%. This increase is seen as a result of Turkey's stable economic policies and strategic location, despite global economic uncertainties. According to the Investment and Finance Office, 'We have positioned Turkey as an economic power center in line with our vision of being the 'Hub of the World'. Turkey's geostrategic location, skilled workforce, and advanced infrastructure have made it a significant player in global value chains, outperforming emerging markets. In 2024, global direct investments decreased by 8%, but Turkey increased its investments by 9.8% to $11.7 billion, showing resilience to global trends. Our successful performance continues in the first quarter of 2025, with a 89.3% increase and a total value of $13.1 billion. This is a clear indication of investors' confidence in the Turkish economy. The focus on wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing, and financial and insurance activities highlights the diversity and resilience of our economy. We expect the quality and quantity of international direct investments to continue to increase, particularly in the field of qualified investments. We will continue to work on improving the investment environment in line with our strategy.'

The office's head, Dağlıoğlu, stated, 'We have positioned Turkey as an economic power center in line with our 'World's Connection Point' vision.

In 2024, despite a 8% decline in global direct investments, Turkey attracted $11.7 billion in investments with a 9.8% increase, showing a remarkable resilience. Our successful performance, led by our President, continues in the first quarter of 2025. The $3 billion increase in IDI and the $13.1 billion total IDI amount are clear indicators of investors' confidence in the Turkish economy. The focus on wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing, and financial and insurance activities highlights the economy's diversity and resilience. We expect the quality of IDI to increase in the coming period, and we will continue to improve the investment environment in line with our strategy.'

**US Economy Contracts by 0.3% in First Quarter of 2025**
The US economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, falling short of the market consensus of a 0.2% decline. According to Mauricio Guzmán, head of Investment Strategy at SURA Investments, the main factor behind this result was a 41.3% increase in imports, as companies and consumers sought to stock up on goods before the imposition of tariffs announced by the government of Donald Trump. This surge had a direct impact on the trade deficit, which subtracted around 5 percentage points from the Gross Domestic Product, the largest negative impact on record. Additionally, the reduction in public spending also hindered economic growth. Consumer spending grew 1.8%, slightly above expectations, but at the slowest pace since 2023. However, a more precise measure of consumption - final sales to private domestic consumers - grew 3%, slightly above the previous 2.9%. Experts remain neutral between fixed income and variable income, highlighting that personal consumption - which accounts for two-thirds of the US economy - remains resilient. As a result, the US remains a preferred option. Globally, a positive view is maintained towards Japan, due to its favorable position in trade negotiations and the good performance of its companies. In the bond market, a longer duration is expected, considering that volatility will remain present and US Treasury bonds could act as a safe haven in case of shocks.

**Auto tariffs jump the gun**
U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a 25% tariff on imported vehicles has caused a global stock market downturn. The tariff, which was announced on Wednesday, has led to a 6% drop in General Motors and a 3% drop in Ford. Counter-threats of retaliatory tariffs have also been made, increasing the risk of a full-blown trade war. The U.S. imported $474 billion worth of automotive products in 2024, with Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Germany being the biggest suppliers. The dollar retreated after an initial burst to a three-week high, with the euro rallying after euro zone data showed credit growth accelerating last month. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that the U.S. government will probably risk defaulting on some of its $36.6 trillion in debt as soon as August, unless Congress acts to raise the nation's debt ceiling. The U.S. Net International Investment Position (NIIP) has hit a record high of $26.2 trillion, with the value of portfolio equity and investment fund shares jumping by $676 billion in the final quarter of 2024 to some $18.4 trillion. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's 'GDPNow' model now shows the U.S. gross domestic product contracting by 1.8% in the first quarter, but an adjusted version shows a marginal expansion this quarter of 0.2%.

**US Treasury Bonds: An Opportunity in 2025?**
In a global environment characterized by volatility and uncertainty, US Treasury bonds emerge as an attractive investment option. Despite macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, international analysts project a reduction in US Treasury rates throughout 2025. Specifically, the 2, 5, and 10-year bond rates, currently at 4.29%, 4.37%, and 4.53%, are expected to decrease by 71, 62, and 43 basis points (bps) this year. This trend favors the appreciation of these instruments, solidifying them as a safe and profitable option for investors. 'We consider that, in a scenario of reduced rates and appreciation of fixed-income titles, US Treasury bonds represent a key option for diversifying portfolios and optimizing returns,' said the analysis and strategy team at Aval Casa de Bolsa. The attractiveness of US Treasury bonds lies in their relationship with other financial assets. In the case of Colombian TES, with yields of 8.75%, 10.20%, and 11.60% for 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively, the projected reduction of 67, 70, and 52 bps implies a revaluation of these instruments. However, analyzing the rate differential between Treasuries and TES, it is evident that US debt offers a lower risk, making it an attractive refuge in the face of uncertainty in emerging markets. The inclination of the yield curve is also a key factor. The projection indicates that the TES curve will shift downward, leading to a general appreciation of debt titles. In this context, longer-duration bonds are the most profitable, as they present the highest Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for holding. For the fourth quarter of 2025, it is expected that the 10-year TES will maintain a projected yield of 14.95%, compared to 12.85% for the 5-year TES and 9.55% for the 2-year TES, reinforcing the investment strategy in long-term instruments.
