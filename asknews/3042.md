**Tropical Forests Disappearing at Record Rate Due to Forest Fires**
The world's tropical forests are disappearing at a record rate due to an increase in forest fires. In 2024, a record 6.7 million hectares of forest were destroyed, an area roughly the size of Panama. The fires have surpassed deforestation for agriculture as the main cause of forest loss. According to Global Forest Watch, 'we are facing a global red alert.' Elizabeth Goldman, Senior Research Manager at Global Forest Watch, explains that the loss of these ecosystems is a major concern, as they are crucial for the planet's oxygen production, carbon storage, and biodiversity. The fires have caused over 3 gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to all the CO2 emitted by India through fossil fuel use. The main cause of the fires is human activity, with most of them being started to clear land for agriculture. The report highlights that many countries in Latin America, including Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru, have experienced significant increases in forest loss due to the fires. The Amazon rainforest suffered its largest loss since 2016, with a 110% increase in forest loss between 2023 and 2024. Goldman emphasizes that to stop and reverse forest loss by 2030, the numbers need to decrease by 20% each year compared to 2024 levels, requiring sustained political leadership, desvinculating production of raw materials from forest loss, and investing in early warning systems and rapid response teams.

**Tropical Forest Loss Doubles in 2024 Due to Fires**
The loss of primary tropical forests has doubled in 2024 due to fires, with 6.7 million hectares of pristine forests lost, equivalent to 18 football fields per minute. For the first time, fires have surpassed agriculture as the main cause of deforestation, accounting for 50% of the devastated area, according to data from the Global Forest Watch (GFW) platform. Brazil was the country that lost the most forest cover, with 42% of the global loss, and the drought, the most severe in the past seven decades, exacerbated the consequences of the fires, which were responsible for 66% of the destruction. 'We are alarmingly far from fulfilling this commitment,' said a statement, referring to the commitment made by leaders of over 140 countries to stop deforestation by 2030, as stated in the Glasgow Declaration in 2021.

**Amazonas Has Lost More Than It Can Tolerate: Record Deforestation in 2024**
The World Resources Institute (WRI) has reported that tropical forests lost 6.7 million hectares of forest in 2024, primarily due to deforestation. This is the worst year on record, with a 80% increase in deforestation compared to 2023. The rate of deforestation is equivalent to 18 football fields per minute. The main cause of deforestation is human-made forest fires, often started to clear land for agriculture. The 2024 forest fires were exacerbated by climate change and El Nino, leading to larger and more widespread fires. The loss of tropical forests in 2024 accounted for 3.1 gigatons of CO2 emissions, more than India's annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. According to the report, we are 'alarming far from' meeting the goal of stopping and reversing deforestation by 2030, signed by 140 countries including Norway in 2021. 'These destructions reinforce climate change by releasing CO2 stored in the forest. In addition, the food security of indigenous peoples and local communities is affected, and animals and plants are victims of the fires,' said Anders Haug Larsen, director of international impact at Regnskogfondet. 'If this continues, we will have no more tropical forests left?' 'The fires are dramatic because Amazonas has already lost more than it can tolerate to maintain its ecosystem functions,' said Larsen. 'It is terrifying to see that the rainforest is not able to withstand drought. Connected rainforests should be so wet that they do not burn. We fear that we are at a tipping point, where the ecosystem can no longer perform basic services such as carbon storage and rain production.'

**Record-Breaking Deforestation in 2024: A Global Red Alert**
According to the Global Forest Watch report, 2024 has seen a record-breaking level of deforestation, with over 6.7 million hectares of primary forest destroyed, equivalent to the size of Panama. This represents an 80% increase from 2023. Elizabeth Goldman, co-director of the observatory, warned that this level of destruction is 'completely unprecedented in over 20 years of data' and is a 'global red alert'. The main cause of deforestation is fires, which surpassed agriculture as the leading cause for the first time. The extreme conditions, fueled by the El Niño phenomenon and massive fossil fuel combustion, made the fires 'more intense and difficult to control'. The fires released approximately 3.1 billion tons of CO into the atmosphere. In Brazil, 2.8 million hectares were destroyed, with two-thirds attributed to fires. However, some fires were intentionally set to clear land for soybean or cattle farming. The Amazon rainforest in Brazil has seen its highest level of destruction since 2016. Despite progress made in 2023, the expansion of agriculture threatens to undo these gains. In Bolivia, the equivalent of triple the surface area destroyed in 2023 was lost due to fires. However, some countries like Indonesia and Malaysia offer hope, as policies to prevent forest fires have slowed deforestation and limited the number of fires. Peter Potapov, co-director of the Global Forest Watch, emphasized that 'primary tropical forests contain the most biodiversity of all ecosystems and store more carbon than any other forest'. Preserving these forests is crucial in the fight against climate change.

**Fires in the Amazon drive record-shattering global forest losses in 2024 - Atin Ito | Ontario’s First Filipino Community Newspaper – Trusted News and Stories for the Filipino-Canadian Community**
Massive fires fueled by climate change led to a record-shattering global forest loss in 2024, according to a report issued by the World Resources Institute and the University of Maryland. The loss of tropical pristine forests alone reached 6.7 million hectares (16.6 million acres), an 80% spike compared to 2023. Brazil, which hosts the next global climate summit in November, struggled to contain fires in the Amazon amid the worst drought ever recorded in the rainforest. Matthew Hansen, co-director of the University of Maryland lab, said, 'The signals in these data are particularly frightening.' The report found that more than 4.1 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases were released due to forest fires last year, more than four times the emissions released from air travel in 2023. Bolivia overtook the Democratic Republic of Congo as the second country with the most tropical forest loss, with a 200% surge in forest loss due to drought, wildfires, and agricultural expansion. However, some regions, such as Charagua Iyambae in Bolivia, were able to resist forest loss through land-use policies and early warning systems. Southeast Asia also saw double-digit decreases in primary forest loss, attributed to domestic conservation policy and community efforts. Countries hit hard by fires included Latin America, with the Amazon biome hitting its highest level of primary forest loss since 2016. Brazil lost 2.8 million hectares (6.9 million acres), the most of any country, and wildfires also ravaged Canada and Russia, leading to record-high tree loss in boreal forests.

**European Farmers Lose €28 Billion Annually Due to Climate-Related Events, Deforestation Reaches Record High**
European farmers lose €28 billion annually due to climate-related events, according to a joint report by the European Investment Bank and the European Commission. Weather anomalies lead to a 6% decrease in crop yields in Europe each year, with some seasons seeing losses of over 10%. Southern countries like Spain and Italy are particularly affected, with losses reaching up to €20 billion. Droughts are the main cause of crop failures, responsible for over 50% of losses. The report warns that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, crop losses will exceed €40 billion by 2050 and potentially reach €90 billion. The agricultural sector is becoming increasingly unpredictable, with changing climate cycles and earlier springs leading to premature fruit tree blossoming. Sudden cold snaps can destroy crops. Today, 20-30% of European farms are insured against weather-related crop failures. The report calls for the implementation of new financial instruments, increased insurance coverage, and support for farmers to adapt. Deforestation has reached a record high in 2024, with 6.7 million hectares of tropical forests lost, according to Global Forest Watch. Brazil was the hardest hit, with 40% of losses attributed to the country. Fires, fueled by the worst drought in recorded history, accounted for 66% of deforestation. For the first time, more forests were burned than cleared for agriculture. The rate of deforestation not related to fires has also increased by 14%, the largest rise in 10 years. China has reduced its CO2 emissions for the first time, driven by a surge in renewable energy production. According to Carbon Brief, CO2 emissions decreased by 1.6% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the previous year, and by 1% over the past 12 months. This may mark the beginning of a sustainable trend, which many have been waiting for from the world's largest polluter. However, the overall volume of emissions remains just 1% below the historical maximum, and China can easily increase emissions again. The country's long-term strategy remains uncertain, and it significantly lags behind its climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. Coca-Cola has changed its labeling after being accused of greenwashing. The company agreed to revise its packaging after a complaint from the European Consumer Organization and ClientEarth. The company was accused of making misleading environmental claims, such as '100% recyclable' and 'suitable for secondary recycling', which do not reflect the actual composition of the packaging. The company will now clarify which parts of the packaging are made from recycled materials. The company must also update its website and social media information. Green organizations consider this a step in the right direction, but a long way to go. 'This is a signal to the entire industry: misleading environmental claims now carry legal risks,' said ClientEarth lawyer Kamil Drzewiecka. National regulators will continue to monitor not only Coca-Cola but also other major beverage producers operating in the EU. However, the main problem with plastic remains - only 10% of plastic waste is collected for recycling, while the remaining 90% pollutes the planet.

**Frequent wildfires under warming climate turning forests into super carbon emitters - SLSV - A global media & CSR consultancy network**
A new policy brief by the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health warns that global carbon mitigation policies fail to account for increasing emissions from forest fires. The report states that forests and peatlands, once considered carbon sinks, are now becoming 'super' carbon emitters due to rising temperatures and frequent wildfires. Citing examples, it notes that Canada's 2023 wildfires released nearly three times more carbon than the country's entire economy, and that Siberia's taiga experienced its third-highest carbon emissions in two decades in 2024. The paper challenges the idea that planting more trees will always help capture more carbon, and instead advocates for an adaptive, anticipatory governance approach that accounts for extreme weather, droughts, and future fire risks. It recommends reworking carbon mitigation frameworks to include dynamic climate and ecological conditions, and suggests near real-time satellite monitoring to assess changes in forest environments. The brief concludes that in the absence of a reformed process, the estimated carbon capture measured from reforestation may not be entirely reliable and can misinform forest management decisions. As noted by the report, 'Such massive carbon emissions are often ignored or underestimated by VCMs, and carbon offset schemes. Accordingly, they fail to adequately account for the dual functionality of forests, mechanically assuming forests as carbon sinks.'

**Deforestation pledges will burn in flames if we ignore inequality**
For the first time on record, wildfires became the primary cause of tropical forest loss, with 6.7 million hectares of tropical primary forest destroyed last year, roughly the size of Ireland. This spike in fire-driven deforestation is a clear sign that global pledges to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030 are falling flat. Experts say that while droughts set the stage for last year's devastation, only a tiny percentage of fires were due to 'natural causes', with organised crime networks largely responsible. In Brazil, the host of this year's climate summit, an area roughly three times the size of Scotland burned to dust, with a 79 per cent increase in fire-related forest loss last year. In Colombia, primary forest loss increased by nearly 50 per cent after a progressive government took office, highlighting the need for sustainable livelihoods to stop deforestation. Indonesia and Malaysia were two of the few bright spots last year, with deforestation rates dropping due to efforts to tackle poverty and reduce wildfires. However, a change of government in Indonesia planning to clear an area of rainforest in Papua nearly as big as Belgium may shift priorities. Protecting the world's forests is far easier said than done, and achieving the pledge to end deforestation by 2030 requires empowering the people who live with and make their living from forests themselves, including indigenous peoples and poor people living across these regions.

**Wildfires push tropical forest destruction to 20-year high**
Tropical forest loss reached a 20-year high in 2024, with close to 7 million hectares of primary tropical forests destroyed, nearly half due to wildfires. According to a report from the World Resources Institute and the University of Maryland, wildfires also swept through boreal forests in Russia and Canada, resulting in 30 million hectares of trees being lost globally, and an estimated 4.1 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions. This comes as the EU has delayed anti-deforestation rules and pulled back other environmental protections to boost economic competitiveness.

**2024 Saw Record-Breaking Forest Loss, with Brazil and Bolivia Leading the Pack**
According to the WRI Global Forest Watch platform, tropical primary forest loss reached 6.7 million hectares in 2024, equivalent to the size of Panama. Fires are the main cause of this loss, with five times more primary forest fires occurring in 2024 compared to 2023. These fires released 4.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide, four times the amount produced by all air travel in a year. Brazil was the country that lost the most forest in 2024, accounting for 42% of all tropical forest loss. Fires accounted for 66% of this loss, with agricultural fires, climate change, and El Niño-driven drought exacerbating the situation. Bolivia came in second, with a 200% increase in forest loss, surpassing the Democratic Republic of Congo, which saw a 150% increase in forest loss due to fires. Colombia's forest loss increased by 50%, but this was not primarily due to fires, but rather due to factors such as the breakdown of peace talks, illegal mining, and cocaine production. Fires also affected northern forests in Russia and Canada, making 2024 the first year on record where both tropical and boreal forests experienced fires. However, some countries showed positive developments, such as Indonesia, which reduced forest loss by 11%, and Malaysia, which achieved a 13% reduction. These successes were attributed to local community-led conservation projects and land-use policies. However, the overall picture remains bleak, with forest loss far from the 2030 target. Kelly Levin from WRI stated, 'The data highlights a stark contrast between the progress made and the promises given.'

According to new research from the University of Maryland, the world lost 6.7 million hectares of tropical primary forest in 2024, nearly double the amount lost in 2023. Wildfires, fueled by climate change, accounted for nearly half of total forest destruction worldwide, marking a major shift in the drivers of deforestation. The blazes released an estimated 4.1 gigatons of greenhouse gases, more than four times the emissions generated by all global air travel. Researchers say the fires have also worsened air pollution, damaged water resources, and endangered the livelihoods of millions of people.

**'Global red alert': Forest loss hit record levels in 2024**
Global forest loss reached a record high in 2024, with wildfires destroying 6.7 million hectares of tropical primary forest, nearly double the previous year's loss. Fires, not agriculture, were the leading driver of tropical forest loss for the first time, according to data from Global Forest Watch. The loss of tropical primary forests, which store carbon and support biodiversity, amounts to an area nearly the size of Panama vanishing at a rate of 18 football fields per minute. Globally, fires emitted 4.1 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases, more than four times the emissions from all commercial air travel in 2023. Brazil accounted for 42% of all tropical primary forest loss in 2024, with fires responsible for two-thirds of the loss in the country. To meet the goal of halting forest loss by 2030, the world needs to cut deforestation by 20% each year starting now, but in 2024, tropical forest loss increased by 80%.

**Global Deforestation Hits Record High in 2024, Report Reveals**
According to the Global Forest Watch (GFW), forest fires are the main cause of destruction, surpassing agriculture, and Brazil leads the ranking of devastation in terms of area. In Brazil, the situation is even more concerning, as 66% of the loss of forest cover was attributed to forest fires, a significant increase compared to the previous year. The total area of primary forests destroyed reached 2.8 million hectares, of which 1.8 million were lost due to forest fires. Globally, the destruction of tropical primary forests almost doubled compared to 2023, totaling 6.7 million hectares. Forest fires not only devastated vegetation but also emitted 4.1 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases, compromising air quality and putting the lives of millions of people at risk. The situation is critical, as the resulting emissions have a direct impact on global warming and climate change.
