**Presidential Memorandum Directing Agencies to Repeal Environmental Regulations**
On April 9, 2025, President Trump issued a memorandum directing federal agencies to repeal certain environmental regulations. The memorandum lists 10 Supreme Court decisions as the basis for this directive, with a focus on four cases with direct environmental implications: Loper Bright, Ohio v. EPA, Sackett, and West Virginia. Agencies have been given a 60-day review period to identify unlawful and potentially unlawful regulations, and must then take steps to repeal them or submit a summary of each regulation that has not been targeted for repeal. According to the memorandum, Agencies may invoke the 'good cause' exception in the Administrative Procedure Act to suspend certain administrative requirements, potentially allowing some rules to be repealed without public notice or comment. As stated in the February 2025 Executive Order, Agencies must submit a one-page summary of each regulation to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within 30 days after the conclusion of the review period. BCLP will continue to monitor and analyze these developments, providing insights and guidance as to the Memorandum and subsequent regulatory repeal initiatives.

**House Republicans cut green programs, boost fossil fuels in budget bill**
The House Energy and Commerce Committee's proposed budget bill, aimed at advancing President Trump's agenda and funding the government, targets several green programs and regulations, including funding for the Energy Department's loans office and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs. The bill seeks to bolster fossil fuels by repealing Biden-era rules expected to push the market toward electric vehicles and setting up a program to guarantee approvals for natural gas export projects. Environmental activists have criticized the bill, saying it would lead to more pollution and higher energy costs for low-income communities. House Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie described the legislation as a 'common sense budget reconciliation bill,' while Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, called it a 'reckless assault on the progress we've made in deploying cheaper, cleaner energy.'

**Trump signs legislation to reverse Biden-era regulations - Conservative Institute**
President Donald Trump signed four bills into law on May 9, 2025, which effectively eliminate several energy-based regulations implemented by the Biden administration. The bills, H.J.R. 20, H.J.R. 24, H.J.R. 42, and H.J.R. 75, rolled back regulations on consumer gas-powered water heaters, walk-in coolers and freezers, household appliances, and commercial refrigerators and freezers, respectively. According to White House staff secretary Will Scharf, these regulations negatively impacted everyday Americans and were a result of the Biden administration's 'attack on consumer choice.' The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allowed Congress to undo these regulations with the president's approval, and the Republican majority in both chambers made it possible to pass these bills. Trump has repeatedly criticized appliance efficiency regulations, calling them an attack on consumer choice, and the Democrats' claims that these regulations were needed to combat climate change and help American consumers have been disputed.

**Holland & Knight Defense Situation Report: April 2025**
The U.S. Congress is working on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and annual defense appropriations bills. The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services (HASC) and U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services (SASC) have accepted requests from stakeholders for the FY 2026 bill. The HASC and SASC are expected to mark up the FY 2026 NDAA in late spring or early summer. The President's Budget Request (PBR) has been released, and the two chambers will conference this summer. A final NDAA bill text is expected to pass both chambers later this fall. The defense section of the CR included adjusted totals for each account-level appropriation and an additional $8 billion in a flexible fund for 'U.S. military operations, force protection, and deterrence.' The HASC reconciliation bill was released on April 27, 2025, with a joint statement from SASC Chair Roger Wicker and HASC Chair Mike Rogers. The bill contains 11 primary funding objectives, including improving capacity across the maritime industrial base and integrated air and missile defense. The bill was approved by a bipartisan vote of 35-21. The DOD's general transfer authority was adjusted from $6 billion to $8 billion. Secretary Hegseth directed the U.S. Secretary of the Army to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy, including streamlining force structure, eliminating wasteful spending, and reforming the acquisition process. The DOD announced the Software Fast Track (SWFT) Initiative, which will reform the way the DOD acquires, tests, and authorizes secure software. The DOD also announced three requests for information (RFIs) to gather market information and capabilities in accelerating secure software delivery to the federal government. President Trump signed an EO, 'Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in the Defense Industrial Base,' which directs the defense secretary to provide a plan for accomplishing this goal by giving a 'first preference' for acquisition of commercial solutions and a 'general preference' for use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA). The EO also directs that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) be reduced to only those provisions required by statute or which are otherwise necessary for certain limited purposes. President Trump signed another EO, 'Ensuring Commercial and Cost-Effective Solutions in Government Contracts,' which directs a strong preference for agencies to utilize commercial products and services. President Trump signed an EO, 'Reforming Foreign Defense Sales to Improve Speed and Accountability,' which is geared toward establishing a 'rapid and transparent' foreign defense sales system in order to enable 'effective defense cooperation' with U.S. allies. President Trump signed an EO, 'Restoring America's Maritime Dominance,' which tasks the national security advisor to coordinate across agencies and submit a Maritime Action Plan (MAP) within 210 days of the EO's signature. The MAP will provide a strategy with specific actions to restore and create sustained resiliency for the American maritime industry.

**New Tax Bill Threatens U.S. Clean Energy Boom**
The latest budget reconciliation proposal in the U.S. House of Representatives would roll back federal clean energy tax incentives and overturn critical EPA programs, threatening the American-made energy boom and domestic manufacturing. According to Environmental Defense Fund, the draft legislation would repeal or prematurely phase out critical incentives for clean energy deployment, manufacturing, energy efficiency, and clean transportation, which have catalyzed more than $400 billion in private investment since 2022 and supported hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide. 'This draft pulls the rug out from under businesses and consumers alike,' said Joanna Slaney, Vice President for Political and Government Affairs at Environmental Defense Fund. 'It would increase energy costs, jeopardize jobs, block innovation and cede U.S. manufacturing leadership to other countries while inviting more pollution into our communities.' Independent analysis shows that fully repealing the tax incentives could raise household electricity bills by as much as 20% in some states by 2026.

**Federal judge halts Trump's mass layoffs for two weeks**
A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's mass layoffs of thousands of federal workers, citing that the President lacks the authority to restructure the government without legislative approval. According to Judge Illston, 'The President has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch.' The judge noted that no statute authorizes such drastic changes, and that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) do not have the authority to restructure the government. The decision comes after Trump urged Congress to pass legislation to approve broad changes in his first term.

**Reconciliation text includes $500 million for modernization and AI at Commerce**
The House Energy and Commerce Committee included $500 million for federal IT modernization and artificial intelligence in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill text. This will allow the Commerce Department to replace or update legacy business systems and deploy AI through 2035. Additionally, a moratorium on state-level enforcement of AI laws and regulations has been included, which will last for the next decade. According to Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the R Street Institute, 'A moratorium on new AI regulations will give this market time to grow and ensure American AI innovators can invest and compete against China and the rest of the world.' This move is seen as a way to promote AI development and deployment, following the administration's efforts to remove barriers to AI growth.

**House Energy and Commerce releases reconciliation bill**
The House Energy and Commerce Committee has released its section of the Republicans' reconciliation bill, which aims to cut spending and mandates from the Democrats' 2022 climate law. The legislation includes plans to repeal unobligated dollars from EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and scrap Biden-era vehicle-emissions rules. According to Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), the bill would 'reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, returning $6.5 billion in unspent funds.' The committee plans to begin marking up the legislation on Tuesday afternoon, but it's unclear when lawmakers will advance it. The bill also includes a new fee on natural gas export project permitting, with the Secretary of Energy deeming the application 'in the public interest' upon receipt and collection of the fee.

**Bill to Prevent Sudden Deaths in Events to be Debated in Congress**
A bill to prevent sudden deaths in events will be debated in Congress. The bill, proposed by José María Kramer, aims to establish a system for preventing sudden deaths in public and private spaces. According to Kramer, the law requires the installation of external automatic defibrillators (DEA) in certain private and public spaces and promotes basic first aid training, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and automated external defibrillation in the community. The installation of DEA will be the responsibility of the administrators or owners of public and private spaces. The law also requires that the DEA be placed in strategic locations, be clearly visible, and be designed in a simple and understandable way for non-medical personnel. Additionally, the bill requires annual training for the administrators or owners of public and private spaces, as well as for all provincial government agencies, their autonomous and decentralized entities, and both legislative chambers, on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of DEA. Those who do not comply with the training will be fined, and the proceeds will be used to fund campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of cardioprotected areas and the survival chain. Kramer argues that adhering to this national law, which was enacted in 2015 and regulated in 2022, will contribute to reducing cardiovascular mortality and making the province a cardioprotected one, as have other provinces such as Buenos Aires, Tucumán, La Pampa, and Santa Fe.

**Horizon - ESG Regulatory News and Trends - April 2025**
President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order to stop states from enforcing unconstitutional or preempted climate laws. The order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to halt enforcement of state- and local-level laws, regulations, and causes of action related to climate change. Trump stated that these laws are 'fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration's objective to unleash American energy.' The order specifically targets the climate superfund laws of New York and Vermont, and California's cap-and-trade statute. Meanwhile, the Trump Administration has eliminated the US Global Change Research Program, which was responsible for preparing the National Climate Assessment. The Administration has also reorganized the State Department, eliminating the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Change and other offices. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has criticized the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for 'mission creep' and called for 'key reforms.' The US is not currently planning to revoke the tax-exempt status of environmental nonprofits. California has introduced new legislation to expand disclosure requirements for companies, and the state is considering a bill to require large companies to report their climate-related financial risks. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation has released draft regulations to mandate GHG reporting by certain significant emitters. Canadian securities regulators have 'paused' the development of climate disclosure rules. The European Parliament has approved a stop-the-clock directive, delaying the implementation of key sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements. Australia has released new guidance on mandatory climate reporting. The Oregon Supreme Court has sent a greenwashing case against Tillamook back to the trial court. The Canadian Competition Bureau has issued proposed Draft Guidelines on environmental claims and the Competition Act. Flixbus has been fined for greenwashing claims in Belgium. Congress has repealed energy efficiency standards for commercial refrigerators. California Governor Gavin Newsom, Senate President pro tem Mike McGuire, and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas have announced their intention to ask the state legislature to extend the state's cap-and-trade emissions program.

**PFAS Legislative & Regulatory Developments - First Quarter 2025**
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized regulations for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). However, the Trump EPA may roll back these regulations. In the first quarter of 2025, several PFAS-related bills were introduced in the US Congress, including U.S. House Bill 705, which establishes a compensation fund for military firefighters exposed to PFAS, and U.S. House Bill 1267, which seeks to exempt water utilities from Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) liability. Additionally, several states have introduced bills to regulate PFAS, including comprehensive product bans, drinking water standards, and liability provisions. For example, California Senate Bill 682 proposes a ban on the sale and distribution of consumer products containing intentionally added PFAS by 2027, while Illinois House Bill 1295 establishes a ban on certain consumer products containing PFAS by 2026. Other states, such as Arizona, Indiana, Maine, North Carolina, Vermont, and West Virginia, have introduced bills to establish drinking water standards for PFAS. Furthermore, several states have introduced bills to provide immunity for PFAS receivers, including Georgia's House Bill 211, which defines PFAS as 'any perfluorochemicals, polyfluorochemicals, perfluoroalkyl substances, polyfluoroalkyl substances, and any related chemicals that degrade to PFAS/PFOA/PFOS, and any precursors to PFAS, PFOA, and PFOS.' Overall, there is significant PFAS-related activity at the federal and state levels, with many bills aiming to regulate PFAS in various ways.

**Congress debates bill to fast-track approval of Trump and Musk agency cuts**
A House committee debated the Reorganizing Government Act of 2025, which would allow President Donald Trump to submit a plan for restructuring federal agencies that Congress must vote on within 90 days. The bill would resurrect a lapsed authority that has been used by previous presidents, including Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. However, Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., argued that the bill is being pushed by congressional Republicans to hand over their powers to the president, citing the courts' findings that Trump's attempts to remove federal employees and eliminate agencies have been unlawful. The bill would bring back such authority through Dec. 31, 2026, and remove a limitation on the authority that previously prevented presidents from using it to abolish or transfer an executive department or independent regulatory agency.

**'Startup Nation' Groups Say They're Meeting Trump Officials to Push for Deregulated 'Freedom Cities'**
Several groups representing 'startup nations' are drafting Congressional legislation to create 'freedom cities' in the US that would be free from certain federal laws. The goal of these cities would be to have places where anti-aging clinical trials, nuclear reactor startups, and building construction can proceed without prior approval from agencies like the FDA, NRC, and EPA. According to Trey Goff, the chief of staff of Próspera, the startup nation, the Trump administration has been receptive to the idea and they hope to have drafted legislation ready by the end of the year. Goff says, 'The energy in DC is absolutely electric,' and that the coalition is considering three options for creating freedom cities, including interstate compacts, federal enclaves, and executive orders. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

**Energy & Sustainability Washington Update -- March 2025**
The Trump administration has initiated a tumultuous start to 2025, with a flurry of executive orders and policy shifts affecting the energy sector. The administration has halted disbursements for various energy-related programs, including funding for a loan guarantee for Montana Renewables, and placed the head of the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund on leave due to funding disputes. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program's amended policies will be published for public comment in the spring. Significant layoffs have swept through federal agencies, including the Department of Energy, where an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 employees were let go. The administration has also issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to coordinate policies with the White House, raising questions about the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's independence. Offshore wind projects continue to face setbacks, and efforts to craft a comprehensive permitting reform bill have yet to yield a viable alternative. Congressional developments and budget battles are also unfolding, with lawmakers racing to finalize a fiscal year 2025 spending agreement by March 14. A government shutdown is unlikely, given Republican control of both chambers. Progress on broader reconciliation legislation to preserve the Trump 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act tax benefits remains unclear. The House and Senate are pursuing different strategies, with the House looking to move a reconciliation bill that addresses border security, defense, energy, and taxes, while the Senate prefers to address taxes in a separate bill later in the year. Both sides have passed their budget proposals and must reconcile a single agreed-upon version. Notably, the House proposal calls on the House Energy and Commerce to find at least $880 million in cuts. Complicating matters is the debt ceiling, which the government technically reached on January 21. This indicates that a continuing resolution for FY25 spending is the most probable outcome, possibly stretching for the full year. Full resolution of the short- and long-term budget will almost certainly impact energy-related IRA and regularly appropriated programs, though we can expect that individual members will be lobbying hard to minimize the impact on their districts and maintain a 'scalpel not a sledgehammer' approach to the IRA. Major facilities like the DOE national labs are being defended by both parties and should continue to receive strong support. While budget negotiations proceed, Republicans are also targeting regulatory rollbacks using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), including EPA's methane fee and several recently issued DOE appliance standards. Separately, DOE also recently announced a hold on appliance standards -- including those for central air conditioners, clothes washers and dryers, general service lighting, walk-in coolers and freezers, gas instantaneous water heaters, commercial refrigeration equipment, and air compressors, which may be potentially reissued. The move was accompanied by a similar step at the EPA, where Administrator Lee Zeldin ordered regulators to overhaul federal water specifications governing kitchen faucets and other household equipment. In a separate push, Republicans are challenging California's authority to set its own emissions standards under waivers granted since the Clean Air Act of 1971. The legality of using the CRA to revoke these waivers is uncertain, but the broader objective appears to be to challenge California's ability to set its own emission standards, an exemption it has received since the Clean Air Act was signed in 1971. Capping off February, news report broke that the EPA was going to begin an aggressive review of the 'endangerment finding' under the Clean Air Act, as called for in EO 14154. Any action to reverse the finding will need to play out through the courts but could have broad impact on EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases for power plants, industrial facilities, and vehicles. Further administrative action is expected to revise fuel efficiency and emissions standards, which critics argue provide a disproportionate benefit to electric vehicles. Several key uncertainties remain, including the status of new tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which are currently scheduled to begin on March 4. The outlook for further negotiation, alteration, or cancellations at this point is not clear. Adding to the complexity, the DeepSeek announcement from China has sparked new questions about the energy demands of AI data centers, potentially influencing future policy decisions. Looking ahead, the trajectory of federal energy policy remains unpredictable, with ongoing legal battles, budget negotiations, and regulatory challenges shaping the landscape. Expect continued turbulence in the months ahead as the administration tests its authority and Congress navigates political and policy constraints. 'It is a tumultuous start to 2025,' said an administration official. 'We are committed to making America energy independent and will continue to take bold action to achieve that goal.'

**E15 to be Sold Without Restrictions in Parts of the US Starting April**
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it will maintain the current implementation date of April 28, 2025, to allow the sale of E15 (gasoline with 15% ethanol) throughout the year in various states in the Midwest. The EPA also noted that important negotiations are underway in Congress to find a legislative solution to permanently allow the sale of E15 throughout the year across the country. In response to the news, Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), made the following statement: 'We are grateful to the governors of the Midwest who took the initiative to create a year-round market for E15 in their respective states, and it is reassuring that the EPA intends to follow the law and move forward with implementation. As a national solution has remained elusive, we applaud the governors and EPA Administrator Zeldin for remaining steadfast in this approach. At the same time, Ohio's request to withdraw its E15 petition is a concerning sign that highlights the urgency of securing a federal legislative solution as soon as possible. A state-by-state approach would not be necessary if Congress were to pass the recently introduced bipartisan E15 national and annual legislation. The E15 bills have broad political and stakeholder support and meet President Trump's goal of removing regulatory bureaucracy and opening new markets for US farmers and the energy sector. Although a legislative solution is strongly preferred by all, we were also encouraged to see that the EPA is considering issuing emergency exemptions to allow for uninterrupted E15 sales across the country this summer if Congress does not act.'

**Beacon Hill Roll Call, Feb. 10-14**
The Massachusetts Senate has approved a fiscal 2025 supplemental budget that includes $425 million to fund the state's emergency shelter system. The bill would cap capacity in the system at 4,000 families for the period Dec. 31, 2025 through Dec. 31, 2026. Other provisions reduce the maximum length in a shelter from nine to six consecutive months and phase out the use of hotels and motels for emergency housing by the end of this year. Senate President Karen Spilka said, 'Today we struck a balance between our fiscal responsibility to Massachusetts taxpayers and our moral obligation to moms, dads and kids who are in a difficult moment.' The Senate also approved an amendment requiring the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities to study the feasibility of conducting a National Crime Information Center background check for each adult or beneficiary applying for the emergency shelter program. Additionally, the Senate adopted joint House-Senate rules for the 2025-2026 session, which include increasing the time for notifying the public about joint committee hearings from 72 hours to five days. The rules also require that all first meetings of a conference committee be open to the public and media. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell, along with 12 other attorneys general, filed a lawsuit challenging the exercise of executive power by Elon Musk. The lawsuit argues that President Trump has violated the United States Constitution by creating a new federal department without Congressional approval and by granting Musk sweeping powers over the entire federal government without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate. United States Attorney Leah Foley announced that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts collected $60.17 million in criminal and civil actions in fiscal year 2024. Gov. Maura Healey announced $158 million in low-income housing tax credit and subsidy awards for fourteen affordable housing projects across the state. Rep. Michael Soter filed legislation that would exclude tipped wages from taxable income, providing tax relief for service industry workers who rely on tips as a major source of their earnings.

**Kennedy champions bill to stop bureaucrats from crushing America’s chemical industry**
Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) has introduced the No Industrial Restrictions In Secret (No IRIS) Act to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from using data from the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) to make rules that punish America's chemical manufacturing industry. The bill would prohibit the federal government from using IRIS to inform its rulemakings unless Congress explicitly authorizes the program. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) is leading the companion legislation in the House of Representatives. The American Chemistry Council applauds Kennedy and Grothman for their leadership on this issue, stating that the IRIS program has a 'troubling history of being out of step with the best available science and methods, lacking transparency, and being unresponsive to peer review and stakeholder recommendations.' As of 2023, Louisiana was the second-largest chemical-producing state in the country, with its chemical industry paying $3.49 billion in wages.

**Harvey Colchado's Candidacy Blocked by Proposed Bill**
A bill proposed by Alejandro Soto of the APP party could block the path to Congress for Harvey Colchado. The bill aims to prohibit the candidacy of public officials who have had access to confidential or secret information that could affect national security. However, the bill excludes congressmen from this prohibition without providing a reason for the difference. Experts have pointed out that this is a clear case of discrimination, which could be unconstitutional. The bill also raises questions about the involvement of lawmakers in committees that handle sensitive information, such as the Defense and Intelligence committees. Soto needs to explain the real purpose of the bill and why he is exempting his colleagues from the same rules. 'It is necessary that the congressman explains to the citizens what is the real purpose of the law and why he is exempting his colleagues,' said an expert. 'There are many explanations that deserve to be given before an initiative like this.'
