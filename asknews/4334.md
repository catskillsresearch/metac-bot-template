**'Chess is perfect in jail': Magnus Carlsen's childhood coach turned prison chaplain and played with inmates**
Bjarte, Magnus Carlsen's childhood coach, worked as a prison chaplain in Norway and used chess as a way to connect with inmates. He said, 'Chess is the perfect sport for a person in jail because it takes such a long time. And time is the one thing people in prison have.' Through chess, Bjarte helped inmates boost their self-esteem and even encouraged some to take steps away from crime and drugs. He held weekly chess sessions in Kristiansand prison, where he saw inmates develop a sense of community and play among themselves. Bjarte worked for six years at Kristiansand, where he played chess with prisoners every week.

According to Gukesh, 'Could've Easily Gone Bad': World Champion D Gukesh Reflects On His Hard-Earned Victory Against Fabiano Caruana At Norway Chess 2025.

**D Gukesh gets his revenge against Magnus Carlsen, beats world No.1 from losing position: '99 out of 100 times I would lose'**
D Gukesh defeated Magnus Carlsen for the first time in a classical match at the Norway Chess 2025. Gukesh, the 19-year-old Indian Grandmaster, came from a losing position to win the game, saying '99 out of 100 times I would lose.' The secret to his win was his incredible calculative powers, which helped him find the right moves even when he looked like the weaker player. Carlsen, the world No.1, had beaten Gukesh in the first round of the tournament, but Gukesh's comeback was too much for him. Gukesh's win has forced Carlsen to share the lead at Norway Chess with Fabiano Caruana, while Gukesh is second on 8.5 points.

**Arjun Erigesi defeats Nakamura, Gukesh's decline continues**
Arjun Erigesi defeated Hikaru Nakamura, while D. Gukesh's decline continued. Erigesi won the classical game against Nakamura, who is ranked second in the world, and maintained his fourth position in the Norway Chess tournament. Magnus Carlsen, the former world champion, won another American grandmaster, Fabiano Caruana, in the Armageddon tiebreaker, increasing his score to 9.5. In the open section, all three games ended in a draw, and the Armageddon tiebreaker was used to decide the winner. Gukesh and Chinese grandmaster Wei Yi's game ended in a draw, with Gukesh's black pieces being in a strong position in the final stage. However, Wei Yi won the Armageddon tiebreaker, and Gukesh's decline continued. Nakamura said that Gukesh's tendency to attack Wei Yi from the start of the game shows that he struggled in the classical game. Erigesi won against Nakamura with a unique Slav Defense, and Nakamura had a big chance to win but got nervous and the game ended in a draw. Erigesi also lost the Armageddon tiebreaker, but Carlsen's win and Erigesi's draw kept him at the top of the leaderboard with 9.5 points. Caruana is in second place with 8 points, and Nakamura has 6.5 points. In the women's section, Koneru Humpy won the Armageddon tiebreaker against Lei Tingjie and took the lead with 8.5 points. R. Vaishali won against Sara Khadem, and with three points, she moved to fourth place with 6.5 points. Vaishali said, 'This win feels good. The first few games didn't go as I wanted. I hope the tournament goes well from here.'

**Carlsen Wins Thrilling Match Against Caruana in Norway Chess Tournament**
Magnus Carlsen, the world chess champion, won a thrilling match against Fabiano Caruana in the Norway Chess tournament. Carlsen, who was close to losing, managed to turn the game around and secure a draw. Caruana, who was under pressure to win, made a few mistakes that allowed Carlsen to escape. The match was part of the tournament's 'muerte súbita' format, where players have a limited time to make their moves. Carlsen praised the format, saying, 'I like the sudden death, but also the pace at which we play the classical game here because we don't get extra minutes after move 40, only 10 seconds per move, and that creates a tremendous pressure, much more demanding than in conventional tournaments.' Carlsen leads the tournament with 9.5 points, followed by Caruana with 8 points. In the women's tournament, Koneru is leading with 8.5 points, followed by Anna Muzychuk with 8 points.

**Magnus Carlsen Forced to Draw by 'The World' in Online Chess Match**
World chess champion Magnus Carlsen was forced to a draw by 'the world' in an online match, a surprising result after Chess.com had predicted a Carlsen win by a wide margin. The match, which began on April 4 on Chess.com, was the first online free-style game to feature a world champion. The team 'the world' - anyone in the world could sign up - voted on each move and each side had 24 hours to make their move. Carlsen played with the white pieces. The world team forced the draw in the 32nd move after putting Carlsen's king in check three times in the corner of the board where he couldn't escape. 'The world' played a very good game of chess, not always opting for the most adventurous options, but sticking to normal chess, which worked well this time,' Carlsen said in a statement on Friday when the draw seemed imminent. In a free-style game, the knights, bishops, rooks, queen, and king are placed randomly on the board at the start, while the pawns are in their usual positions. Free-style chess is popular because it allows players to be more creative and avoid memorization. 'We made history,' Microsoft said in a statement. Last year, Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand won his 'against the world' game against almost 70,000 players on Chess.com. In the virtual chat on Chess.com this week, players seemed divided on whether to force the draw and claim the glory or continue playing against Carlsen, even if that meant a loss in the end. 'Don't draw! Let's keep playing against Magnus,' one user wrote. 'This is an opportunity that won't come again. I'd rather play with the Master until the end and see if we can fight another 20 or 30 moves! Let's have fun!' another user added. 'Thanks Magnus for a game so grand. We made history,' another user said.
