**France's Recognition of Palestine: A New Diplomatic Battle with Israel**
France is planning to recognize Palestine as a state, which has sparked a new diplomatic battle with Israel. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will consider recognizing Palestine as a state at a UN conference in New York on June 18, but with certain conditions. These conditions include the release of Palestinian prisoners, the disarmament of Hamas, and the recognition of Israel's right to live in security. However, many experts believe that these conditions may be difficult to meet, especially the disarmament of Hamas. Israel has strongly condemned Macron's plan, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accusing Macron of 'persecuting the Jewish state'. The Israeli government has also announced plans to build 22 new settlements in the West Bank, which is a move that has been widely criticized by the international community. Macron's plan has also been met with criticism from the French far-right party, led by Marine Le Pen, who has accused Macron of 'rewarding' Hamas. Despite the challenges, France hopes that its move will bring other countries to take action and restart the two-state solution to end the Gaza conflict.

**Saudi Foreign Minister Calls on Europe to Recognize Palestine**
Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, emphasized the importance of European countries recognizing the State of Palestine. He stated that European positions on Israel are not sufficient and that the war must stop. He also said that 'those who see the two-state solution as the answer must recognize the State of Palestine immediately'. Furthermore, he called on the international community to see the Palestinian Authority's reform approach. He also stated that Israel is working to undermine the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. He added that Israel's refusal to allow an Arab ministers' delegation to visit the occupied West Bank 'shows its extremism and rejection of peace'. Jordanian Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, emphasized the importance of the international community taking practical steps towards a two-state solution. He also stated that preventing the joint delegation from visiting Ramallah is a sign of Israel's arrogance and disregard for international law. Egyptian Foreign Minister, Badr Abdelatty, stressed that Israel's position is a sign of extreme arrogance and confirms the lack of a genuine peace partner. He added that Arab countries will continue to confront all plans to expel Palestinians from their land with all their strength.

**US Ambassador Proposes Palestinian State in French Riviera**
US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Hakeem, has proposed the establishment of a Palestinian state in the French Riviera. This proposal comes as the US has announced its opposition to the upcoming French-Saudi conference in New York, which aims to support the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel has been trying to pressure France to prevent the conference, which is scheduled to take place from June 17-20. The conference is expected to see many Western countries declare their recognition of the Palestinian state. In response, Israel has announced the establishment of 22 settlements in the West Bank, with Defense Minister Yisrael Katz saying, 'This is a clear message to Macron and his friends: you will recognize a Palestinian state on paper, but this paper will end up in the trash of history. The settlement in the West Bank will strengthen, and Israel will thrive and flourish. Do not threaten us, we will not be intimidated, and we will not be subjugated.' US Ambassador Hakeem has confirmed the US opposition to the conference and its goals, saying, 'It is completely unacceptable, in the midst of Israel's war, for us to come and present something that I believe the Israelis are increasingly rejecting.' He added, 'If France is truly committed to seeing a Palestinian state, I have a proposal for them: take a part of the French Riviera and establish a Palestinian state. They are welcome to do so, but they should not impose this kind of pressure on a sovereign state (Israel). I find it disturbing that they think they have the right to do something like this.' Hakeem continued, 'I hope they will reconsider, but the US will not participate. Simply put, we will not be part of this charade.'

**US Ambassador to Israel Criticizes French Initiative to Recognize Palestinian State**
US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Hacabi, criticized the French initiative to recognize the Palestinian state, saying, 'If France is determined to recognize a Palestinian state, let them take a piece of the French Riviera and give it to them.' Hacabi stated in an interview with Fox News that the US will not participate in the peace conference called by France and Saudi Arabia, scheduled to take place this month, saying, 'We will not be part of this trick.' He also considered any attempt to impose recognition of a Palestinian state during the war on Gaza as 'unwelcome pressure on a sovereign state.' Hacabi emphasized that the US-Israeli relations are 'solid and cannot be broken,' describing them as a 'strategic partnership that goes beyond friendship or alliance,' based on a deep exchange of security and military information. He described Iran as 'the greatest threat to global peace,' saying, 'When someone threatens to kill you for 46 years, you should take it seriously.' Regarding the war on Gaza, Hacabi accused Hamas of prolonging the suffering, saying, 'It can end immediately if you release the hostages and leave Gaza. Israel is ready to deport its fighters to exile, but they do not have a way back.'

**US Ambassador to Israel Proposes France Allocate Territory for Palestinian State**
US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Hacabi, criticized France's efforts to establish and recognize a Palestinian state, even after the October 7, 2023 events. He suggested that France should allocate some of its territory to create a Palestinian state. Hacabi stated, 'It's not the right time to push for a Palestinian state, especially during Israel's war.' He added, 'It's unacceptable to propose something that I believe Israelis increasingly oppose.' He also proposed that France allocate a part of the French Riviera to create a Palestinian state. Hacabi emphasized that it's unacceptable for France to exert this kind of pressure on an independent state (Israel). The US will not participate in the conference hosted by France and Saudi Arabia at the UN later this month, regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state. The UN will host a conference on 'Solving the Two-State Problem' from June 17 to 20, co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France. French President Emmanuel Macron previously stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is not only a moral obligation but also a political necessity. He set several conditions for recognition, including the release of remaining hostages, disarming Hamas, and not allowing it to participate in governing the Palestinian state with a reformed Palestinian Authority, and recognizing the existing Palestinian state's recognition of Israel's right to live in safety.

**Will there still be a Palestine by the time we get to recognise it? - The Malta Independent**
The world is witnessing a media onslaught against Israel, with widespread coverage of the indiscriminate bombing and dire warnings of famine. However, amidst the chaos, there are stories of hope and resilience. In Gaza, 60,000 people queued for food at a US centre, and an angry crowd sacked a Hamas warehouse full of stolen goods. The US initiative to bring peace to the region will continue, and the campaign to recognize the State of Palestine is gaining support worldwide, including in Malta. However, the author argues that the real battle for Palestinian national identity is not being waged in Gaza, but in the West Bank, where settler violence and weak courts are allowing the Israeli far Right to take over land and harass Palestinians. The author warns that the Palestinians are becoming a subject people, and that the situation is as bad as it was for the Jews in the past.

**Israel's Ban on Arab Foreign Ministers: A Sign of No Palestinian State**
Israel has banned Arab foreign ministers from visiting Ramallah in the West Bank, citing that the area is under Israeli control and not Palestinian. This move is seen as a sign that Israel does not recognize a Palestinian state in the West Bank. The article highlights that Israel's control over the West Bank is not limited to security measures, but also extends to economic and social aspects, including the movement of officials and the recognition of Palestinian institutions. The author argues that the Israeli government is working to undermine the Palestinian Authority and prevent it from returning to Gaza, and that the current situation is the worst possible scenario for the Palestinian people. The article concludes that the only solution to this reality is for the international community to acknowledge that there will be no Palestinian state.

**Magliano Sabina Council Unanimously Approves Motion to Recognize Palestine as Sovereign State**
The Magliano Sabina town council has unanimously approved a motion to recognize the State of Palestine as a sovereign and independent state, in line with United Nations resolutions and international law. The motion, proposed by councilor Emanuele Eroli, urges the Italian government to take urgent action. 'The tragic events that have occurred since October 7, 2023, leave no room for further delays in involving two peoples with equal dignity as citizens of a free, independent, and sovereign state in a mediation table,' the motion reads. The councilor, Giulio Falcetta, stated, 'We understand that our actions may not change the world, but it is unacceptable that the international community has not taken a stance on this issue.' The motion will be sent to the Italian government and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, requesting that they work towards a ceasefire in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel, and the release of all hostages. 'It is not a genocide, it is absurd,' Falcetta said, 'children are dying, families are being torn apart, and people are being shot and killed while trying to bring food and supplies.'

**EU Raises Red Card Against Israel, Threatens Sanctions and Recognition of Palestinian State**
The European Union has raised the red card against Israel, imposing penalties and acknowledging the Palestinian state. The EU has announced that it will review the association agreement with Israel, which has been in place since 1995. The agreement is a framework for relations between the two parties and regulates trade, cooperation, and other areas. The EU has also threatened to impose sanctions on Israel if it does not stop its war on Gaza. The move has been seen as a significant escalation of the crisis and has been met with strong reactions from Israel. The Israeli government has accused the EU of hypocrisy and has warned that the move will have severe consequences for Israel's economy and international relations. The EU has also announced that it will consider recognizing the Palestinian state, which would be a major blow to Israel's international standing. The move has been seen as a significant shift in the EU's policy towards Israel and has been welcomed by the Palestinian leadership. The EU's decision has been met with mixed reactions from other countries, with some expressing support and others criticizing the move. The situation remains highly volatile and it is unclear what the future holds for Israel and the EU.

**Israel 'will not cooperate' with Arab ministers' meeting to recognize Palestine**
An Israeli official, speaking anonymously to Efe, stated that 'Israel will not cooperate with measures that aim to harm the country and its security.' The official was referring to a planned meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Ramallah, led by Saudi Arabia's Faisal bin Farhan, to discuss the creation of a Palestinian state. The official claimed that 'this state would undoubtedly become a terrorist state in the heart of the Land of Israel.' The meeting is part of preparations for a conference on the two-state solution, scheduled for June at the United Nations headquarters in New York, led by France and Saudi Arabia. The current Israeli government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, opposes the creation of a Palestinian state and has taken measures to deepen the occupation and annexation of the West Bank.

**UK and France Consider Recognizing Palestine as Sovereign State, Israel Warns of Response**
The UK and France are considering recognizing Palestine as a sovereign state, which could lead to a response from Israel. According to a report, Israel's strategy minister Ron Dermer warned the French and British foreign ministers that Israel could annex area C of the West Bank and legalize unauthorized outposts if Palestine is recognized as a state. Israel's foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar also warned that unilateral actions against Israel would be met with unilateral actions from Israel, such as expanding its sovereignty over settlements in the West Bank and parts of the Jordan Valley. The warning is related to the Oslo Accords of 1993, which divided the West Bank into three areas: A, B, and C. Area A is under full Palestinian control, area B has limited Palestinian autonomy, and area C is under full Israeli control. The recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state would likely require Israel to give up its control over area C, which it has not done. Israel has already annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, and has allowed new settlements to be built in area C. The recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state would be a significant step towards a two-state solution, but it would also be a challenge for Israel. 'Unilateral actions against Israel will be met with unilateral actions from Israel,' Sa'ar said. 'We will not give up our sovereignty over the West Bank and the Jordan Valley.' The UK and France have not yet made a decision on recognizing Palestine as a sovereign state, but the issue is expected to be discussed at a UN conference in June. 'We will not be deterred by threats or intimidation,' said a spokesperson for the UK government. 'We will continue to work towards a two-state solution.'

**Israel Threatens Unilateral Measures if Palestine is Recognized Internationally**
Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, has warned that if France and the UK recognize Palestine, Israel will take unilateral measures such as legalizing unauthorized settlements and annexing parts of the West Bank. Dermer made this statement in a conversation with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, saying that Israel would take 'measures unilaterally' if the international community recognizes Palestine. This comes as France and Saudi Arabia are set to co-host a summit in New York on June 18, where the recognition of Palestine is expected to be discussed. Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, has also made similar warnings to Barrot and his British counterpart, David Lammy. The UK has been in talks with France about the possibility of recognizing Palestine, but has stated that it will only support the measure if it has tangible consequences. Spain, which recognized Palestine last year, is now pushing for more countries to follow suit and has called for a conference to be held in the UN on June 17 to discuss the recognition of Palestine.

**Israel Threatens to Annex West Bank Settlements if Europe Recognizes Palestine**

Meanwhile, the US has informed Israel that it will not attend the conference, but will not publicly pressure other countries to do the same. Currently, 149 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine. The Palestinian Authority hopes that the number will increase after the conference. According to the Apartheid Wall and Settlements Committee, there are approximately 770,000 settlers in the West Bank, with 180 settlements and 256 unauthorized outposts. The Israeli military has expanded its attacks in the West Bank, and settlers have increased their attacks in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. According to official Palestinian figures, over 960 Palestinians have been killed and around 7,000 injured in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7, 2023. Israeli security forces have arrested over 16,000 people. The International Court of Justice has ruled that Israel must stop all new settlement activities and withdraw from all occupied Palestinian territories by July 2024, but Israel has rejected this decision.

**Israel Threatens Annexation of West Bank if Countries Recognize Palestine**
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar threatened to annex West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley if France, the UK, and other countries recognize Palestine's statehood. 'We will respond with our own unilateral actions to any unilateral step against Israel,' he said in an interview with Israel Hayom. This statement comes as an international conference on recognizing Palestine is being prepared, which is expected to take place on June 18 in New York with the participation of France, Saudi Arabia, and several other countries. According to the publication, the conference's initiator is French President Emmanuel Macron, who hopes that on this day many countries will officially recognize Palestine. Saar strongly criticized this initiative, despite the fact that, as the newspaper claims, Macron previously assured Israeli authorities that he would not take such steps without consulting with Tel Aviv. The US has informed Israel that it will not participate in the conference, but will not publicly pressure other countries to refrain from doing so. Currently, 149 out of 193 UN member states have officially recognized Palestine. The Palestinian administration hopes that the June conference will lead to an increase in this number. According to the Committee for the Struggle against the 'Separation Barrier' and Illegal Settlements, by the end of 2024, there will be approximately 770,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank, 180 official settlements, and another 256 unrecognized outposts, not recognized even by the Israeli government. In the context of the Gaza war, Israel has significantly expanded its military operations on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. Since October 7, 2023, over 960 Palestinians have been killed, around 7,000 injured, and over 16,000 arrested, according to Palestinian authorities. In July 2024, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel must immediately stop building new settlements and withdraw its citizens from all occupied Palestinian territories, but Israeli authorities refused to comply.

**Israel Threatens Unilateral Actions if Countries Recognize Palestinian State**
Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid warned that Israel will take 'unilateral actions' if any country recognizes a Palestinian state, in response to French President Emmanuel Macron's recent statements on the possibility of doing so. Lapid said, 'Any attempt to recognize a unilateral Palestinian state will only harm the prospects of a future two-state solution and will prompt us to take unilateral actions in response.' German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock defended the 'two-state solution' with mutual recognition between Israel and Palestine. She said, 'The two-state solution is the best chance for Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, security, and dignity, and it should not be complicated by the continued construction of illegal settlements or early unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state.' Around 150 countries recognize the Palestinian state. In May 2024, Ireland, Norway, Spain, and Slovenia took steps to recognize Palestine. Last month, President Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine in June for a UN conference in New York. Macron said, 'We must move towards recognition, and we will do so in the coming months.' He added, 'Our goal is to chair this conference with Saudi Arabia in June, where we can achieve a mutual recognition (of Palestine) with several parties.' Macron expressed his hope that the conference would allow for 'a series of recognitions' of Palestine, and that Arab and Islamic countries would recognize Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to reject the two-state solution and has repeated his government's rejection of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu considered Macron's statement a 'grave mistake.' Lapid said that achieving a two-state solution would be a 'reward for Hamas terrorism,' which carried out a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to a French news agency's tally based on official Israeli numbers. Among the 251 kidnapped during the attack, 58 are still being held in Gaza, including 34 announced killed by the Israeli army. At least 52,829 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to a health ministry in Gaza affiliated with Hamas, including at least 2,720 who died since Israel resumed its military strikes and operations on March 18.

**Editor's Notes: Visions of Israel reshaped, new politics and society**
The article explores how the 2023-2025 war in Israel has reshaped the country's politics, society, and identity. In the year 2075, a museum exhibit in Jerusalem, the October 7 Memorial and History Museum, showcases the war's impact on Israeli life. The exhibit highlights the transformation of Israeli governance, the rise of the Torah Zionists, and the emergence of the October Bloc. It also displays the atrocities committed by Hamas and the international response. The article also mentions the rebirth of kibbutzim, the overhaul of Israel's security doctrine, and the shift in the world's perception of Israel. The tour of the museum ends with a holographic tree displaying the names of those lost, and a timeline showing Israel's evolution in the decades since the war. The article concludes that the war has forced Israel to rebuild and has reforged Jewish unity worldwide.
