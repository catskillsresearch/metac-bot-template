**2.8 Billion People Worldwide Lack Access to Suitable Housing, UN Report Finds**
According to the United Nations' Habitat Programme annual report for 2024, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide lack access to suitable housing. Of these, 1.1 billion people live in poor or informal settlements, which is 'the main challenge for sustainable urban development', as stated in the report. Around 90% of the population of these poor settlements live in Africa and Asia, where there is a shortage of housing units of around 170 million. Anna Claudia Robisch, Executive Director of the United Nations' Habitat Programme, said in the report that 'climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters continue to force millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety, stability, and better living conditions.' The report estimates that 318 million people are homeless, equivalent to the population of the United States. Globally, 'one in four people lives in conditions that harm their health, safety, and well-being', according to the United Nations' Habitat Programme report. Only 14% of urban residents and 40% of rural residents have access to clean water, and two in five people do not have access to sanitation services. The report states that 'safe and managed sanitation is a fundamental element of human development and is often used as a measure of progress in reducing poverty, diseases, and premature deaths.' Anna Claudia Robisch called for 'rethinking urban policies, land use, laws, and financing to prioritize housing and basic services as key drivers of climate action and sustainable development.' By 2040, it is expected that 2 billion urban residents will be exposed to significant temperature increases. The United Nations' Habitat Programme member states adopted the programme's strategic plan for 2026-2029, which focuses on access to housing, land, and basic services, such as clean water and sanitation.

**ILO revises downward job creation estimates in 2025**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) has revised its estimates of job creation in 2025 downward, reflecting a decrease in global economic prospects. The ILO estimates that nearly 84 million jobs in 71 countries are directly or indirectly linked to American consumer demand, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for the majority (56 million). However, Canada and Mexico have the highest proportion of exposed jobs (17.1%). ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo stated, 'We know that the global economy is growing at a slower pace than expected. Our report now tells us that if geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions continue, and if we do not address the fundamental issues reshaping the world of work, they will certainly have negative repercussions on labor markets worldwide.' The report highlights concerning trends in income distribution, with the share of labor income decreasing globally from 53.0% in 2014 to 52.4% in 2024. Africa and the Americas have experienced the largest declines. If this share had remained unchanged, global labor income would have been $1,000 billion higher in 2024, equivalent to $290 more per worker in terms of constant purchasing power. The erosion of the global share of labor income is putting pressure on inequalities and highlighting a disconnect between economic growth and worker remuneration. The report notes a shift towards high-skilled jobs, with women leading this trend. Between 2013 and 2023, the proportion of women in high-skilled jobs increased from 21.2% to 23.2%, while the proportion of men in high-skilled jobs was around 18% in 2023. As education levels continue to rise globally, the labor market remains characterized by significant mismatches between education levels. In 2022, only 47.7% of workers had qualifications matching their job requirements. The proportion of under-educated workers decreased from 37.9% to 33.4% over the past decade, while the proportion of over-educated workers increased from 15.5% to 18.9%. The report also addresses the effects of new technologies on the world of work, finding that nearly one in four workers could see their job transformed by generative AI. A greater proportion of jobs in moderately skilled professions are moderately exposed, but a greater percentage of jobs in highly skilled professions are highly exposed, with existing tasks potentially being automated by AI.

**Two questions, two ironies the budget must address**
The upcoming 2025-26 budget in Bangladesh must address two pressing questions: how to bolster domestic resource mobilization and how to secure financing to mitigate post-Covid poverty and income losses. The country's tax-to-GDP ratio is 7.4 percent, far below South Asia's average of 10-12 percent and the global developing-country average. The British colonial legacy of resource extraction and the failure to translate historical legacies into equitable policies have contributed to this issue. The budget can present a reform strategy and a well-thought-out implementation plan, including institutional restructuring, modernization of the tax code, technology-driven surveillance systems, an effective transfer pricing law, and a green tax framework. The country is facing a polycrisis, with the national poverty rate projected to rise from 20.5 percent in 2024 to 22.9 percent in 2025. An ageing population, rapid urbanisation, and increasing population density lack corresponding economic productivity gains, and the country is at high risk of climate change, which could lose 5-7 percent of GDP. Many hope that the budget will propose a 'Universal Lifecycle-Based Social Security System,' a transformative initiative that could play a crucial role in overcoming 'low social traps' stemming from livelihood crises.

**Achieving child poverty target could cost £920m a year in benefits,...**
A report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) suggests that Scotland could meet its 2030 child poverty target, but at a cost of £920 million a year in benefits. The report, which examined the costs and impacts of different measures to tackle child poverty, found that increasing the Scottish Child Payment to £40 a week would have the best poverty reduction impact per pound, but would only bring the child poverty rate down to 18%. However, by supplementing the benefit for families with babies and single parents, and boosting take-up to 100%, combined with other measures such as boosting employment among parents in poverty, 90,000 youngsters could be lifted out of poverty, meeting the 10% target. Chris Birt, associate director at the JRF, said, 'Holyrood has the chance to prove that it's up to the task of not just setting lofty ambitions, but straining every sinew to deliver on them.' Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville welcomed the report and said, 'We are absolutely committed to meeting the 2030 child poverty targets and thanks to the actions we are already taking, families in the poorest 10% of households are estimated to be £2,600 a year better off in 2025-26.'

**Someone Wondered "What's A Sign That Someone Grew Up Poor?" And 26 Folks Online Delivered**
According to the World Bank, the number of people living below the poverty line is decreasing, but still far from improving. In the past, over 40% of the global population lived in poverty, compared to less than 10% today. A recent viral thread on social media identified behavioral patterns and signs that may indicate someone grew up in poverty, as shared by 26 individuals online. However, the article notes that the World Bank's data shows a significant decrease in poverty rates over the past few decades.

**USAID Cuts to Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under five years old. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.' Bill Gates has announced that he will increase his donations to global health programs to $10 billion annually and maintain the investment for 20 years.

**La España que trabaja pero sigue siendo pobre**
According to the 'Memoria sobre la situación socioeconómica y laboral' of Spain in 2024, more than a quarter of the population (25.8%) is at risk of poverty and social exclusion (AROPE), a rate that, despite having decreased from 26.5% in 2023, remains alarmingly high and reflects the persistence of social and economic inequalities in the country. This includes 16.3% of the working population, meaning one in six workers was at risk of poverty last year, a situation known as labor poverty, which remains at high levels, although below the 18% reached during the pandemic. The report highlights that the majority of households (53.1%) struggle to make ends meet at the end of the month, and nearly one in ten do so with great difficulty. The president of the Consejo Económico y Social (CES), Antón Costas, states, 'The economic growth by itself no longer brings prosperity for all.' The report also notes that the risk of poverty affects the unemployed, foreign-born individuals, and households with children, particularly single-parent households. The poverty rate for children under 16 is 34.7%, far above the European average of 24.8%, despite a 8.2% increase in disposable household income. 'The persistence of these social gaps does not correspond to the country's level of development or the social principles of the community framework,' denounces the CES, which calls for policies to address these inequalities, as recommended by the European Commission.

**9.5% of Georgia's Population Lived in Absolute Poverty in 2024**
According to a report, in 2024, 9.5% of Georgia's population lived in absolute poverty. The poverty rate was higher in rural areas (12%) compared to urban areas (7.8%). The report also noted that the poverty rate decreased by 1.6 percentage points in urban areas and 3.7 percentage points in rural areas. The highest poverty rate was among people under 18 years old (12.1%), despite a 4% decrease from the previous year. On the other hand, the lowest poverty rate was among people over 65 years old (6.7%), which can be attributed to the stability of their pensions. Men were more likely to live in poverty than women (9.8% vs 9%). The report also showed a slight improvement in income inequality. In 2024, the percentage of the population living below 60% of the median consumption decreased by 0.9 percentage points to 18.9%, and the percentage of those living below 40% of the median level decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 6.7%. The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, decreased by 0.02 to 0.35 (based on total income and resources). However, the coefficient remained unchanged at 0.36 and 0.40 based on total consumption and overall expenses, respectively.

**The Plight of the Working Class: A World Where the Rich Get Richer and the Poor Get Poorer**
The world is facing a stark reality where the top 1% of the population holds 63% of the new wealth generated since 2020, while the remaining 90% of the population receives only 37%. This is according to Oxfam, which also states that for every dollar of new global wealth earned by the 90% poorest, a millionaire earns 1.7 million dollars. The wealth of the rich is increasing by 2.7 billion dollars every day, while the salaries of at least 1.7 billion workers are growing below the rate of inflation. The article highlights the issue of tax evasion by the rich, with many billionaires paying a tax rate of less than 3%. In contrast, workers like Christine, a harina seller from Uganda, pay 40% of their income in taxes. The article also mentions the increasing use of automation and AI, which is expected to displace 300 million jobs by 2030. The author concludes that we are creating a world where we are becoming irrelevant, and instead of a utopia where everyone has well-being and creative leisure, we are creating a hell that benefits the 1%.

**India must redraw its poverty line to reflect economic progress**
India is expected to become an upper middle-income country by 2030, with a projected economy of $6.77 trillion and an average dollar income of $4,468 per person. However, the current poverty line of $2.15 a day is outdated and does not reflect the country's economic progress. The World Bank has two other international poverty lines: $3.65 a day for lower-middle income countries and $6.85 a day for upper middle-income countries. India needs to redraw its poverty line to reflect its new economic status and recalculate the number of poor people in the country. According to a recent survey, only 2.3% of Indians live below the extreme poverty line of $2.15 a day, while 28.1% live below the $3.65 a day mark. A higher poverty ratio may initially seem bad, but it will help the government reorient its anti-poverty programs and provide a more accurate picture of poverty in India.

**UN: Over a Third of Humanity Lives on $2-7 a Day**
According to the United Nations, more than a third of the world's population lives on a daily income of $2-7. The World Social Report 2025, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, highlights that 2.8 billion people live in vulnerable conditions, where even minor issues can push them back into extreme poverty. Experts note that economic instability is exacerbated by widespread job insecurity, with 60% of people worldwide fearing they may lose their job and be unable to find a new one. The report also notes that 65% of the global population lives in countries where income inequality is increasing, citing social inequality based on race, caste, place of birth, and family background as the main causes. The UN experts emphasize that growing social insecurity and increasing inequality erode trust in governments, with over half of the world's population not trusting their governments, and the rapid spread of misinformation and distorted data exacerbating these trends.

**Poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean Falls to Lowest Point in a Century**
According to the United Nations, the poverty rate in Latin America and the Caribbean (ALC) has fallen to its lowest point in the last century, with 27.3% of the population living below the poverty line of $6.85 per day (PPP 2017). The reduction in poverty has been slow since 2016, consistent with the low economic growth in the region. The expansion of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been significantly lower in comparison to other middle-income economies. In contrast, in 2009, the poverty rate in Asia and the Pacific was 30 percentage points higher than in ALC, but by 2023, both regions had similar levels, reflecting divergent development trajectories. Between 2021 and 2023, poverty decreased by 4.7 percentage points, with the indicator reaching one in four people. Chile and Uruguay have poverty rates below 10%, while Paraguay has a rate of 17.6%, and Guatemala and Honduras have rates above 50%. The strengthening of the labor market explains almost two-thirds of the reduction in poverty between 2021 and 2023, with improved employment rates contributing 1.8 percentage points, increased labor income adding 1.5 percentage points, and public transfers adding 1.1 percentage points. Other components, such as remittances and non-labor income, had a minor impact of approximately 0.3 percentage points each. The Index of Employment Quality (ICE) reveals that improvements in employment quality have been limited, with only five countries -Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Mexico- experiencing moderate advances, while six countries -Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay- saw a deterioration or no change in employment quality. The World Bank notes that the recovery after the pandemic has been gradual, with a less favorable impact on low-income households in 2023. Between 2021 and 2022, income grew more quickly among vulnerable sectors than among more affluent ones, but between 2022 and 2023, the growth rate of income slowed and showed a more homogeneous trend among different socioeconomic groups. For 2024, the international organization predicts a moderate economic growth, accompanied by a slight reduction in poverty in the region of 24.7%.

**World Bank: 622 million people will continue to live in extreme poverty in 2030**
According to the World Bank, 622 million people will continue to live in extreme poverty in 2030. Almost as many will suffer from hunger and malnutrition. The World Bank notes that the gap between rich and poor countries has widened, with only six of the 26 low-income countries expected to reach middle-income status by 2050. The World Bank also states that the debt of states has reached record levels, with public spending exploding without being accompanied by an increase in revenue. The bank also notes that the slowdown in global economic integration has had a particularly acute impact on low-income countries, which account for more than 40% of the world's population living on less than $2.15 per day. 'It is now clear that the great goals of the past decades will not be achieved,' the World Bank says. 'The perspectives of long-term growth of developing economies are at their lowest since 2000.' The World Bank also notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy, with a decline in global economic growth from 5.9% in the 2000s to 3.5% in the 2020s. 'For the rest of them, including the Sudan and Syria, the situation has simply not evolved: over the past 15 years, in these 26 low-income countries, the average annual growth of real GDP per capita (adjusted for inflation) has been less than 0.1%,' the World Bank says. 'This succession of vicissitudes highlights what developing economies have succeeded or failed to do in this first quarter of the century. It also highlights what they can do in the coming years to progress and chart their own course, independently of the circumstances prevailing beyond their borders.'

**Bridge the wealth gap to improve socioeconomic conditions**
According to 2024 statistics, 3.6 billion people worldwide, or 40% of the global population, earn less than US$6.85 per day, the poverty line set by the World Bank. The number of people earning below this threshold has not changed significantly since 1990. Economists and scientists note that geographical isolation, widespread disease, natural disasters, and lack of political accountability contribute to poverty. To bridge the wealth gap, scientists and experts recommend modernizing the agriculture sector, improving basic healthcare services, increasing education investment, and providing access to electricity, clean water, and sanitation. However, climate change and armed conflicts hinder poverty reduction. Governments can help by allocating funds, increasing taxes on the wealthy, and providing financial aid, but long-term solutions require significant investment in education and employment opportunities. By focusing on these areas, countries can reduce economic disparity and improve living conditions.

**The Growing Wealth Gap: A Report by UBS and the World Bank**
A recent report by the Union of Swiss Banks (UBS), Billionaire Ambitions Report, highlights the growing wealth gap between the rich and the poor. The report states that the global billionaire population has increased by over 100% in the last 10 years, with their combined wealth rising from $6.3 trillion in 2015 to $14 trillion in 2024. This represents around 13% of the world's total wealth, held by just 2,682 families. The report notes that the top three countries for billionaire growth are the US, Germany, and India, with a focus on tech, AI, and renewable energy. However, this wealth is concentrated in a small elite, while the majority of the world's population struggles to make ends meet. According to the World Bank's Poverty, Prosperity and Planet report, 8.5% of the global population, or 700 million people, live on less than $2 a day, and 35% of the population, or 2.8 billion people, live on less than $7 a day. The report warns that these issues will hinder the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. In Argentina, the government's fiscal and tariff adjustments have exacerbated poverty and inequality, with a decline in infrastructure, education, and healthcare in poor neighborhoods, and a decrease in income for millions of people.

**Ending Poverty for Half the World Could Take More Than a Century**
According to the World Bank's Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet Report, the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 is unlikely to be met, with it potentially taking three decades or more to eliminate poverty at the current threshold of $2.15 per day. The report highlights that almost 700 million people live on less than $2.15 per day, with 44% of the world's population living on less than $6.85 per day. Axel van Trotsenburg, World Bank Senior Managing Director, stated, 'After decades of progress, the world is experiencing serious setbacks in the fight against global poverty... We need a fundamentally new development playbook if we are to truly improve people's lives and livelihoods and protect our planet.' The report suggests that policies to reduce air pollution and invest in education and health can contribute to both climate and developmental goals. However, progress in reducing the Global Prosperity Gap has stalled since the COVID-19 pandemic, and 1.7 billion people still live in high-inequality economies. The report emphasizes the need for economic growth that is less carbon emissions-intensive and highlights the importance of tailored approaches based on income-level, prioritizing certain policies and managing synergies and trade-offs across goals.

**Poverty Facts and Stats**
According to the World Bank, almost half of the world's population, over three billion people, live on less than $2.50 a day. In developing countries, 27-28% of children are underweight or stunted, with South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa being the most affected regions. Water problems affect half of humanity, with 1.1 billion people lacking access to clean water and 2.6 billion lacking basic sanitation. The wealthiest 20% of the world's population account for 76.6% of total private consumption, while the poorest 20% account for just 1.5%. The world's billionaires, just 497 people, are worth over 7% of the world's GDP. The distance between the richest and poorest countries has increased, with the richest countries being 44 times richer than the poorest in 1973. Approximately 790 million people in the developing world are chronically undernourished, with Asia and the Pacific being the most affected regions. The use of the poverty line of $1 a day has been criticized for being arbitrary and using poor quality data, and the new poverty line of $1.25 a day has been announced by the World Bank. China's poverty rate has fallen from 85% to 15.9%, but excluding China, poverty has only fallen by around 10%.
