**Watch List 2025 - Spring Update (22 May 2025)**
The re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has brought a moment of reckoning for the European Union and its member states. Trump's administration has been constructed on the basis of loyalty to him and is more serious about realizing his preferences, which include a desire to free the U.S. from traditional relationships that he sees as expensive and entangling. He wants to pursue a transactional approach to international relations, using the U.S.'s enormous political, military, and economic clout to secure deals that will benefit the U.S. citizenry. This 'America first' foreign policy has been on display in Trump's recent trip abroad, where he visited Gulf monarchies and secured billions of dollars in investment commitments in exchange for transfers of arms and technology. While there may be certain upsides to Trump's approach, such as the unqualified support he enjoys from allies, it has mainly had downsides for European leaders, including the compromise of traditional trans-Atlantic cooperation. The EU and member states are scrambling to fill gaps in global aid budgets and are awaiting the results of a 'force posture review' to see whether it becomes the vehicle for a major shift of U.S. troops off the continent. The Ukraine file has been especially difficult for European leaders to manage, with Trump's administration manoeuvring the U.S. into a role that previously would have been unthinkable - acting as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine. The EU and member states must live with the possibility that Trump's patience will run out and they will be left with an enormous responsibility that will be onerous to meet. Meanwhile, the EU and member states are exploring how to use assets they have in a manner that reflects the budgets, threat assessments, and risk tolerance of the countries involved, and are seeking ways to invest in their joint security future without undermining immediate needs. Beyond managing their own security, there is ample room for the EU and member states to carve out greater autonomy from the U.S. in setting their course vis-à-vis the rest of the world. The EU is working to project itself as a reliable partner to a range of regional powers with whom deepened relations could provide economic, political, or security benefits. In the context of the Gaza crisis, the EU and member states have condemned the Israeli military campaign and have called for an immediate, full resumption of aid deliveries through tested existing channels. However, gestures will be ineffective unless linked to concrete steps aimed at curbing Israel's policies. The EU should use the review of Israel's compliance with the human rights provision of the EU-Israel Association Agreement as leverage, demanding that Israel end the war and allow immediate relief into Gaza in exchange for retaining its trading privileges.

**US Senate Rejects Bill to Ban Use of Foreign Aircraft as Presidential Planes**
A bill, '2025 Presidential Air Transportation Security Act', proposed by Schumer to ban the use of foreign aircraft as presidential planes was voted on in the US Senate. The Republican senators, who hold the majority, rejected the bill. Schumer stated on his X account that the jet gifted by Qatar is 'bribery' and 'national security threat', and that the Republicans sided with Trump and did not pass the bill. Trump had announced that he wanted to accept the Boeing 747-8 plane gifted by Qatar during his Middle East visit on May 12. He emphasized that the new plane would be 'completely free'. However, some Democratic senators argued that Trump's statement created a 'dangerous opportunity' for foreign intelligence services and adversaries seeking to harm the US, and opposed receiving such gifts from foreign countries.

**US Senate Rejects Bill to Prevent Trump from Using Qatari Jet as Presidential Aircraft**
The US Senate has rejected a bill proposed by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to prevent President Donald Trump from using a jet gifted by Qatar as a presidential aircraft. The bill, known as the '2025 Presidential Air Transportation Security Act', aimed to ban the use of foreign-owned aircraft as presidential planes. Schumer described the jet as 'bribery' and 'a national security threat', saying, 'Republicans sided with Trump and did not pass my bill.' Trump had announced that he would accept the 500 million dollar Boeing 747-8 jet gifted by Qatar during his Middle East visit on May 12. He claimed that the new plane would be 'completely free' and that the Pentagon would accept it as the new 'Air Force One'. However, some Democratic senators argued that Trump's proposal would create a 'dangerous opportunity' for foreign intelligence services and adversaries to harm the US. Schumer stated, 'Trump is willing to sell out the American people and the presidency for his own financial gain.' He also emphasized that making the jet secure would cost billions of dollars and that no changes would guarantee full security. Schumer concluded, 'The Senate must now prioritize our national security, protect Americans, and ensure that a foreign-owned plane never gets the 'Air Force One' call sign.'

**The US is losing its global leadership role in trade, warns economist Richard Baldwin**
Richard Baldwin, a renowned economist, believes that the US has become a 'hacker' of the global trade system, rather than its protector. China has won the trade war with the US, according to Baldwin. The US has been forced to stop its initial trade plans, which included 60% tariffs on Chinese goods, after the financial markets reacted strongly to the news. The current 10% tariffs on Chinese goods are seen as a victory for China. Baldwin notes that the US is heavily dependent on Chinese goods, and that a trade war with China would have severe consequences for the US economy. He also believes that the US is not in a strong position to negotiate with China, and that the EU is in a weaker position than China. Baldwin warns that the US is at risk of losing its global leadership role, and that the current trade tensions could lead to a decoupling of the global economy. He also notes that the US is not in a position to dictate trade policies to other countries, and that the global trade system is at risk of breaking down. Baldwin's central message is that the US is responsible for less than 15% of global trade, and that the other 85% of the world will decide the fate of the global trade system. He urges leading politicians to ensure that the US is the only country that systematically violates WTO rules, and that the other countries continue to follow the rules. Baldwin believes that the 2nd of April 2025, when Trump announced his 'reciprocal tariffs', will be a turning point in world history, marking the beginning of the end of the US's global leadership role.

**Geopolitics & Tech Are Reshaping the U.S. Economy in 2025**
The U.S. economy is undergoing significant changes due to geopolitical tensions and rapid technological advancements. Shifts in trade policies, tariffs, and global conflicts are driving uncertainty, while AI-driven algorithms are redefining the rules of finance, trade, and labor. The speed and complexity of these shifts are making it harder for businesses, investors, and policymakers to keep up. Experts attribute the uncertainty in currency markets to Trump's presidency and protectionist trade policies, which have led to higher tariffs and a chaotic foreign exchange market. Meanwhile, the rise of automated trading and AI-driven strategies has completely reshaped financial markets, bringing significant economic impact. However, this level of automation has also cranked up volatility and introduced systemic risks that demand constant monitoring and regulation. Technology is democratizing access to financial markets, breaking down traditional gatekeeping and making financial markets more accessible than ever. The U.S. government is cracking down on foreign tech companies, tightening data privacy laws, and demanding more control over the flow of information, which has massive economic consequences. The U.S. regulatory landscape is getting more complicated daily, especially regarding Tech, AI, cybersecurity, and cryptocurrency. Clear rules give businesses the confidence to innovate without second-guessing legal risks, while stronger consumer protections make the digital economy more trustworthy. Amidst all these changes, success is guaranteed to those investors and businesses that adapt to these changes.

**New law would stop foreign adversaries from 'buying up our country' while Americans can't afford homes**
Rep. Pat Harrigan, R-N.C., is introducing the Real Estate Reciprocity Act to stop foreign entities from buying up U.S. real estate, citing that while Americans struggle to afford homes, foreign adversaries are buying up land with cash. The bill would slap a 50% tax on real estate purchases by foreign nationals and entities with government ties if their governments do not allow Americans to buy property in those countries. Harrigan stated, 'While American families struggle to afford a home, foreign adversaries are buying up our country with cash - farmland, neighborhoods, even land near military bases.' The bill aims to address the issue of foreign entities buying up U.S. farmland, particularly near military bases, with China owning around 350,000 acres of farmland across 27 states as of last year. According to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, foreign entities and individuals held 43.4 million acres of U.S. agricultural land as of 2022, which is nearly 2% of all land in the U.S.

**Preparing for the Challenges of 2035: Taiwan Must Be Ready**
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has released a report titled 'Possible Scenarios for 2035' which presents three possible scenarios: China's economy stagnating, the United States' global leadership waning, and the global trust system collapsing. The report consulted with multiple think tanks, including the Brookings Institution, the American Enterprise Institute, and the RAND Corporation, to identify the driving factors behind structural changes and their potential far-reaching effects. It is not meant to predict the future, but rather to help countries understand how to respond to the changing trends and provide warnings and take action. The report highlights the importance of Taiwan being prepared for the challenges that lie ahead, regardless of the scenario that unfolds. Taiwan must be aware that China's economic stagnation or continued growth will bring different security and economic challenges. If China's economy stagnates, it may increase the possibility of Beijing taking more aggressive actions against Taiwan; if the US' global leadership wanes, Taiwan may face reduced US support in the region. In the event of a global trust collapse, Taiwan's economy, which is heavily reliant on international trade, will be particularly vulnerable.

**Europa-Forum Wachau 2025: New Leadership and Clear Mission**
The Europa-Forum Wachau 2025, taking place from June 11-13 at Stift Göttweig, is set to focus on new challenges and visions under the motto 'Facing Challenges - Embracing Visions'. The forum is undergoing a change in leadership, with Michael Linhart, a former diplomat and ex-Austrian Foreign Minister, taking over as president from Martin Eichtinger. Landeshauptfrau Johanna Mikl-Leitner emphasized the need for new strategies, particularly in security and defense policy, in light of the geopolitical shift caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the increasing pressure from global power shifts. 'Europe must be able to defend itself - politically, economically, militarily. Our defense capabilities are more than ever the foundation for peace and freedom in Europe,' she said. Mikl-Leitner also called for a more efficient and less bureaucratic approach, stating that 'Europe must move from talking to action.' She advocated for the 'one in, one out' principle for EU regulations, where each new rule replaces an existing one. Linhart expressed his enthusiasm for the new role, highlighting the forum's importance in international crises: 'Europe must not be driven by others, but must actively and confidently participate and shape the changes.' The forum aims to strengthen its role as a bridge between politics, economy, and diplomacy, with a focus on engaging the youth, including the development of a Europa-Forum Wachau app.

**Donor funding crisis goes global**
The global donor funding crisis has reached a critical point, with many countries embracing protectionist policies and wealthy nations failing to show solidarity in response to US President Donald Trump's hostile policies. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted Western governments' greed, undermining others' trust in their global leadership. The fact that Western governments have diverted funds away from other war-torn and desperately poor countries to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion has underscored their largely self-serving approach to foreign aid. As a result, essential organisations such as the World Health Organization, the United Nations World Food Programme, and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/Aids are facing significant budget shortfalls, which could lead to devastating consequences, including six times more HIV infections and a 400% increase in Aids deaths by 2029. Despite the minuscule sums required to fill the gap left by the US, only a handful of countries, like South Korea, have responded to the funding crisis, preventing the collapse of essential organisations. If wealthier countries refuse to provide for the global common good, the multilateral system as we know it will not survive.

**Deporting international students risks making the US a less attractive destination, putting its economic engine at risk**
The Trump administration's decision to terminate the immigration statuses of thousands of international students in early April 2025 has been reversed after courts determined the terminations lacked merit. The move comes as the White House seeks to enhance vetting and screening of foreign nationals. However, experts warn that inserting additional bureaucracy into current processes could make the US a less attractive study destination, ultimately hampering the Trump administration's 'America First' priorities related to the economy, science, and technology, and national security. International students contribute significantly to the US economy, with over $43.8 billion in tuition and living expenses supporting an estimated 378,175 US jobs during the 2023-2024 academic year. They also help maintain global leadership in STEM fields, with 45% of STEM workers holding a doctoral degree born outside the US. Further restricting international students' ability to study in the US will redirect talent to other countries, allies, and adversaries alike.

**Trump and Kim: What's the Fate of 'Wishful Thinking' in the First Term?**
The global security landscape is undergoing significant changes in 2025, raising questions about how Donald Trump will handle North Korea in his second term. With Trump's return to the White House, Washington is distancing itself from its European allies in NATO, and there is a tense but tangible communication with Moscow. This development poses a challenge to traditional alliance diplomacy in Northeast Asia. As the great powers adjust their strategies in a multipolar world, the ideological cohesion within alliances is weakening, allowing interest-based partnerships to form and shape the new international system, according to the American National Interest website. These changes will have profound effects on potential talks between the United States and North Korea, raising fundamental questions about whether diplomacy and nuclear disarmament will take priority or if the talks will be subject to the strategic interests of the major powers in Northeast Asia. Since the collapse of talks between Washington and Pyongyang in 2019, North Korea has recalibrated its foreign policy by deepening its relations with China and Russia to secure economic and security support to resist external pressure. With the outbreak of the Ukraine war in 2022, the growing military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow reflects a strategic alignment aimed at balancing US influence and its allies. In June 2024, Pyongyang and Moscow formalized their security relationship by signing a mutual defense agreement, under which North Korea provided military aid to Russia in exchange for economic and possibly advanced military technology support. This cooperation has strengthened North Korea's strategic position, while South Korea has deepened its military cooperation with the US and Japan, further necessitating Pyongyang's need for alternative security and economic backers. Trump's foreign policy goals are centered around his 'Make America Great Again' vision, prioritizing US strategic and economic interests over traditional alliance commitments, which has gradually reshaped the international system. This has accelerated the transition to a multipolar world where other major powers assert their influence and pursue their strategic ambitions. During Ukraine ceasefire negotiations, Putin and Trump emphasized the need to improve US-Russia relations and discussed broader global security issues, including conflict management and nuclear non-proliferation. For Trump, renegotiating treaties like the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) can reaffirm US leadership in making deals. For Putin, direct talks with Washington can enhance Russia's global standing after Europe's marginalization. If US-Russia disarmament talks materialize, the North Korean nuclear issue may become a shared concern. To maximize its strategic independence, North Korea will exploit great power competition to ensure that its alliances with Russia and China remain beneficial without becoming overly dependent on either power. The usefulness of US-North Korea talks remains uncertain, but Trump may seek a 'diplomatic victory,' which could either enhance or undermine US influence on Pyongyang. Many possibilities exist, but all depend on whether Trump will prioritize Russia's role in diplomacy or insist on direct, bilateral cooperation with Pyongyang. For North Korea, cooperation with the US remains a strategic maneuver, not a policy shift. Given the continued lack of trust, Pyongyang will maintain close coordination with Beijing and Moscow to leverage their support and maintain its nuclear deterrent as a final security guarantee.

**America First intel approach downplays Russia, ignores climate change - Asia Times**
The 2025 US intelligence services' annual threat assessment (ATA) has been criticized for downplaying the threat of Russia and ignoring climate change. The report, produced by 18 US intelligence agencies, prioritizes domestic security threats over foreign adversaries and fails to mention climate change as a critical threat to US security. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard stated that the report focused on 'the most extreme and critical direct threats to our national security,' but this response was deemed unconvincing by Senator Angus King. The report also notes that Russia 'seeks to restore Russian strength and security in its near abroad against perceived US and Western encroachment,' a softer tone than previous reports. The 2025 ATA also assesses that Russia 'has seized the upper hand in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and is on a path to accrue greater leverage to press Kyiv and its western backers to negotiate an end to the war that grants Moscow concessions it seeks.' The report's language on China is more ambiguous, describing Beijing as 'the most comprehensive and robust military threat to US national security.' However, the report's focus on domestic security threats and downplaying of Russia's threat has been criticized as a deliberate abdication of US global leadership.

**America 1st intel shift downplays Russia, ignores climate change**
The 2025 annual threat assessment (ATA) report, produced by 18 US intelligence agencies, marks a significant shift in America's security priorities under the Trump administration. The report prioritizes domestic security threats over foreign adversaries, ignores climate change as a critical threat, and softens the language regarding Russia. The report notes the security impact of melting sea ice in the Arctic and increasing cooperation between Russia and China in the region, but fails to provide credible evidence that the administration's 'America First' approach will make America more secure. According to David Hastings Dunn and Stefan Wolff, this is a deliberate abdication of US global leadership and a justification for an isolationist foreign policy approach. As Gabbard said, 'What I focused this annual threat assessment on … are the most extreme and critical direct threats to our national security,' however, this response is unconvincing given the report's omissions. The report describes China as 'the most comprehensive and robust military threat to US national security' and notes that Beijing is critical to the alignment of all four major state actors that pose threats to the US.

**The Unchanged American Strategy: A Continuation of Weakening Adversaries**
The American foreign policy strategy remains unchanged despite appearances, according to a recent analysis. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the US has maintained a consistent stance of supporting Ukraine while imposing severe sanctions on Russia. This approach has weakened Moscow economically and prompted Europe to reassess its energy dependence and strengthen its military capabilities, testing the continent's cohesion and economic stability. Meanwhile, China has adopted a more cautious approach to its geopolitical ambitions, particularly regarding Taiwan. However, with Donald Trump's return to the presidency in 2025, a seemingly abrupt change in direction occurred. Trump called for a swift resolution to the Ukrainian conflict, even receiving support from Russia and China at the UN Security Council for a ceasefire. This initiative, although surprising, is part of a 'realpolitik' logic aimed at redistributing global power. However, upon closer inspection, this approach may be seen not as a break, but as a continuation of the strategic line. The Biden administration had already begun a policy of weakening US adversaries, and Trump seems to be pursuing this trajectory with different methods. By ending the Ukrainian conflict, he reduces a major source of tension, while leaving Europe to manage the economic and security consequences of the war. Furthermore, by partially disengaging, he pushes European allies to take on more responsibilities, while maintaining American supremacy. This global strategy suggests that, despite differences in style and rhetoric between the Biden and Trump administrations, there is a coherent line of direction aimed at weakening Russia, China, Europe, and even Ukraine simultaneously, to consolidate the dominant position of the US on the international stage. Ultimately, this approach reveals a timeless truth of American foreign policy: the US has no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests. This maxim, often attributed to Henry Kissinger, resonates particularly in the current context, where American actions seem guided by a long-term vision to preserve their global hegemony, regardless of the cost to other nations.

**Singapore's Defense Minister Criticizes US Foreign Policy: 'From Liberator to Great Disruptor'**
The Defense Minister of Singapore, Dr. Ng Eng Hen, made severe criticisms of the United States' foreign policy in a speech at the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt Annual Leaders Roundtable on February 14, 2025. He stated that the US government has abandoned its role as a global stabilizer and has become an economic and political disruptor, prioritizing its own primacy over allies. 'The US has passed from liberator to great disruptor, to a lord seeking profitability,' Dr. Ng Eng Hen said, criticizing the new directions of US foreign policy, which, according to him, sacrifice bilateral and multilateral ties. He emphasized that this change deeply affects the global balance and requires a re-evaluation of international relations. The minister highlighted that the impact of these policies is already visible in global trade. During the US-China trade war under the Trump administration, bilateral trade between the two countries fell by 10%. More recently, Europe reduced its trade deficit with China from €396 billion to €292 billion in 2023, but its real GDP growth plummeted from 3.5% to 0.4%. Dr. Ng Eng Hen also warned that this geopolitical reconfiguration may affect ASEAN, a bloc formed by ten Southeast Asian countries. He reminded that most of these nations gained independence only between the 1960s and 1980s and that abrupt changes in the global scenario can compromise their development trajectory. In the face of US policy and increasing trade and technological tensions with China, the minister questioned whether any country or bloc can assume global leadership to preserve international common goods. He cited China's dominance in solar energy production and electric vehicle manufacturing as a factor that can influence the future of the global economy. In conclusion, Dr. Ng Eng Hen warned that, without a committed leader to global stability, worldwide progress and efforts against crises such as climate change will be at risk.

**Testing Assumptions About US Foreign Policy in 2025**
The Reimagining US Grand Strategy Program challenges the assumptions guiding US foreign policy. The program identifies nine core assumptions, including the role of US leadership in international agreements and the impact of US withdrawals on global cooperation. The article examines recent examples of US withdrawals from multilateral agreements, such as the Paris Agreement and the World Trade Organization, and concludes that US leadership is not necessary for certain types of international cooperation to succeed. However, the US maintains enough power to act as a spoiler towards any international agreement that it deems counter to its interests. The article also challenges conventional wisdom on several issues, including the US acquiring territory through force or monetary means, increasing weapons shipments to Ukraine, and military action against Iran. It argues that these approaches are flawed and may have unintended consequences, such as pushing Iran towards weaponization or sparking a wider regional conflict. The article concludes that a new agreement with Iran is the best path forward, and that a nuclear Iran is not a foregone conclusion even without such a deal. Finally, the article challenges the assumption that the Trump administration will be primarily focused on great power competition, arguing that many of Trump's highest priority issues are domestically oriented and that several of his early foreign policy initiatives pertain to allied countries and the Western Hemisphere.

**US Withdrawal from WHO: A Threat to Global Health Security**
The withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO) announced by President Donald Trump will make the world 'less secure', undermine US leadership in the world, and penalize scientific research and large pharmaceutical companies. According to an editorial in Science signed by Lawrence O. Gostin and Benjamin Mason Meier, experts in public health law and global health policy, respectively, the US has been a fundamental member of the WHO for over 75 years, contributing significantly to important achievements such as the eradication of smallpox. 'Retiring from the WHO would mean the loss of voting power and political leadership of the United States in the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the WHO, which would severely reduce its ability to set global health agendas, defend US interests, and push for crucial reforms of the WHO', they write. The US will remain on the sidelines while important decisions are made, including the adoption of a new pandemic agreement and the election of the next director-general in 2027. As global standards are set and scientific standards are promulgated, the absence of the US will compromise scientific research, public health security, and foreign policy, they add. The decision of Trump could have severe consequences also within the US. 'The withdrawal from the WHO would limit national health agencies and the US pharmaceutical industry, which depend on access to disease surveillance, pathogen samples, and genomic data shared through a vast network of WHO laboratories and other partners', they point out. In fact, 'the US is facing a significant outbreak of H5N1 avian flu in livestock and US scientists have reduced access to the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System to develop countermeasures that save lives against H5N1 and ensure seasonal flu vaccines', they emphasize. 'If the US were to become the only major country outside the WHO, allies would see the US as an unreliable partner', the editorial notes. 'This would fuel a subversive narrative that the US is not a fair partner with the Global South and would weaken US diplomacy worldwide. In the absence of US funding and leadership, the WHO could be severely weakened, undermining its ability to identify, report, and respond to public health emergencies', the message concludes.
