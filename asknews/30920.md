**Maritime Activities Resume at Port of Hurghada after Weather Improvement**
The Red Sea Ports Authority announced the resumption of maritime activities at the Port of Hurghada, following a significant improvement in weather conditions and a decrease in wind speed. According to a statement from the authority's media center, the port was reopened at 12:00 PM, after being closed for several days due to bad weather in the Red Sea, which led to the suspension of maritime traffic and tourist boat trips. The Governor of the Red Sea Ports Authority, Major General Mohamed Abdel Rahman, emphasized the importance of full compliance with safety procedures to ensure the safe operation of maritime activities. This move comes as part of the efforts of the concerned authorities to restore the normal activity of tourism and logistics, while ensuring the safety of passengers and marine facilities. It is expected that maritime tourism will return to its normal pace in the coming hours, with forecasts of continued stability in the weather conditions.

**Dutch Protesters Demand Action Against Maersk for Transporting Israeli F-35 Parts**
Protesters in Rotterdam, Netherlands, gathered on Wednesday to demonstrate against a Danish shipping company, Maersk, for bringing parts of Israeli F-35 fighter jets to the city's port. The protesters, mostly Dutch citizens, held signs that read 'Reveal Maersk', 'Maersk profits from genocide', and 'We are all Palestinians, cut ties with apartheid Israel'. They chanted slogans such as 'Boycott Israel', 'Your hands are stained with blood', 'Stop the ships', and 'Free Palestine'. This comes after a Dutch court ruled last year to halt the export of F-35 parts to Israel due to its violation of international humanitarian law in Gaza. The protesters also highlighted the ongoing Israeli atrocities in Gaza, which have resulted in over 175,000 Palestinian casualties, including 175,000 killed or injured, mostly children and women, and over 11,000 missing, as well as hundreds of thousands of displaced people, since October 7, 2023.

**Protesters block traffic in Rotterdam over docking of ship carrying F-35 parts from Israel**
A protest was held in Rotterdam on Wednesday after a ship carrying F-35 fighter jet parts from Israel docked at the city's port, despite a 2023 Dutch court ruling that ordered a halt to the export of F-35 components to Israel. Activists accused the Netherlands of enabling arms transfers to Israel, and protesters chanted 'Maersk profits from genocide.' Speakers at the protest claimed that Rotterdam municipality and port officials facilitated the docking of the ship through indirect channels, effectively aiding Israel's military industry. Demonstrators temporarily blocked the street and tram lines, and later marched through the city center, halting traffic at a busy intersection. The Dutch government has faced increasing public pressure over its military and trade links with Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza.

**Commercial-Scale E-Methanol Factory Opens in Denmark**
A.P. Moller - Maersk, a leading maritime transport company, has chosen to invest heavily in green methanol propulsion. The company is the main client of a new commercial-scale e-methanol factory in Denmark. The factory, owned by European Energy (Denmark) and Mitsui (Japan), will produce 42,000 tonnes of e-methanol per year, equivalent to over 50 million liters. The factory's cost is estimated at 150 million euros. The e-methanol will be used by Maersk, which has a fleet of 25 ships that can run on methanol or are ready to be retrofitted. The factory's e-methanol is produced by combining green hydrogen, produced by electrolyzing water using solar power, and biogenic CO2, captured from biogas plants and waste incineration. This production method distinguishes it from traditional methanol, which is produced from fossil fuels. Maersk aims to decarbonize a tenth of its 240 container ships by 2030, which would require two million tonnes of green methanol per year, according to its 2022 estimates.

**US-China Tariff Exemption Sparks Surge in Freight Rates**
After the 90-day tariff exemption between the US and China, American companies have quickly resumed their supply chains, leading to a surge in exports and a shortage of shipping capacity, causing freight rates to skyrocket. In response, shipping companies have raised their rates and redeployed ships from the US market to the China-US route. According to data from the Shanghai Shipping Exchange, the freight rates for shipping containers from Shanghai to the US West Coast and East Coast on May 16th increased by 31.7% and 22% respectively compared to the previous period. The Shanghai Export Container Freight Index (SCFI) also rose 10% compared to the previous period. The European route, which was once a 'replacement' for the China-US route, declined by 0.6% and the Mediterranean route declined by 0.3%. Shanghai Shipping Exchange explained in its report that due to the 90-day tariff exemption, US companies have quickly resumed their supply chains, and importers are rushing to process backlog orders, expecting a surge in cargo in the next few weeks. The demand for the China-US route has increased, with trade tracking firm Vizion reporting that the number of bookings for shipping containers from China to the US has increased by nearly 300% since the US and China reduced tariffs. Shipping companies, including Evergreen, Maersk, HMM, ONE, and COSCO, have announced plans to increase rates from mid-to-late May. CMA CGM and Mediterranean Shipping Company have also announced plans to increase rates from June 1st, with a peak season surcharge of up to $2,000 per 40-foot container. Industry insiders are concerned that the 90-day tariff exemption may end, and tariffs may be reinstated, which could lead to a delay in orders and impact the supply chain in the second half of the year. Many companies are taking advantage of the current window to ship as much cargo as possible. Robin International Freight Services' North Asia Vice President, Chen Yuanhan, said that some customers have prepared to rush shipments from warehouses, while others have asked suppliers to accelerate production to replace high-cost orders signed during the tariff increase period. It is expected that the next two to three weeks will see a surge in 'suppressed cargo' growth, with Chinese origin cargo expected to increase sharply and peak in late June. An industry insider also expressed concerns that there may be an overloading situation. In fact, this situation has already begun, with factories in Dongguan starting to work overtime to produce and book containers, and even causing traffic jams on the way to the port. According to industry media, at least 9 shipping companies have taken action, either launching new routes or reactivating suspended routes or increasing temporary overtime. Sea-Intelligence, a shipping consulting firm, reported that the volume of goods stranded in China is between 180,000 and 520,000 standard containers, and if these goods are transported in May and June, it will increase the demand for transpacific routes by 5% to 16%. The freight rates for transpacific routes are expected to rise sharply, while the capacity of transpacific routes will increase significantly, and other Asian export trade routes will see more blank sailings. JAS China's Chief Commercial Officer and EU Chamber of Commerce Logistics Committee Vice Chairman, Lu Zhen, said that the uncertainty of tariff policies is reflected in multiple aspects: one is that after August, what will happen to US-China tariffs? Two is that the tariff rates for different products are different, and whether they will be adjusted is also uncertain. Additionally, the US has imposed high fees on shipping companies that own Chinese-built ships, which may lead to a 10-15% increase in shipping costs on the US route, which is another uncertainty in the current market. Trump's tariffs have devastated the economic and trade market, causing stock prices to plummet.

**Maersk CEO: Uncertainty Surrounds US-Houthi Agreement, Red Sea to Remain Closed in 2025**
The CEO of Maersk, Vincent Clerc, stated that the consequences of the agreement between the US and the Houthis are uncertain and that the Red Sea will likely remain closed to shipping throughout 2025. According to Cairo News, Maersk has lowered its expectations for the global shipping market due to the disruptions caused by Donald Trump's trade war. Maersk has predicted a growth rate for the market in 2025 ranging from a 1% contraction to a 4% growth, citing the increasing uncertainty on both the economic and geopolitical levels. This prediction is lower than the previous estimate in February, which forecasted a 4% growth. Clerc explained that the trade war remains largely between the US and China, while the rest of the world continues to operate without interruption. He noted that customs duties have 'begun to have a real impact' on the container market in April, with trade volumes between China and the US decreasing by 30-40% in both directions as the trade war escalated.

**Houthi Deadline for Gaza Aid Puts Red Sea Shipping Security in Doubt**
The Houthi militant group has given Israel a four-day deadline to lift its blockade on humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. If Israel does not comply, the Houthis will 'resume our naval operations against the Israeli enemy,' said leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. This has put the security of shipping in the Red Sea in doubt, with ocean carriers such as Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) and Maersk hesitant to return due to the lack of safety guarantees. Soren Toft, CEO of MSC, called the Red Sea situation 'unpredictable' and said it's not safe for ships to pass through. Vincent Clerc, CEO of Maersk, estimated that costs would rack up in the 'hundreds of millions of dollars' if they were to return to the Red Sea. Despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the uncertainty surrounding the relations between the two parties has kept ocean carriers away from the Red Sea. According to data from Lloyd's List Intelligence, transits through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and Suez Canal did not grow across January and February, instead falling 11 percent and 21 percent, respectively.

**Containerships: Freight rates are dropping**
Container freight rates are falling due to increased shipping capacity from new vessel deliveries and the expected return of containerships from the Red Sea in 2025. Market analysts warn that US President Trump's proposed tariffs on Chinese, European, Canadian, and Mexican products could hurt consumption and reduce future cargo demand. Trade policies may also lead to new trade routes and alliances. According to the Container Shipping Outlook Report by AlixPartners, 200 more ships will be delivered this year, adding 2 million TEUs to the fleet, a 6% increase. The return of containership capacity and new ship supply 'could upset the balance of supply and demand, driving rates down and returning the industry to years of overcapacity.' Last year, 11% or 3 million TEUs of new capacity was added, but was absorbed by route diversions. The European trade route fleet increased by 31% according to Alix Partners. The Gemini partnership between Maersk and Hapag Lloyd aims to address the industry's reliability challenge, offering better market coverage, cost savings, and environmental benefits. 'If successfully executed, more than 340 vessels operating in a hub-and-spoke network could offer a viable alternative to the port-to-port model,' the report said.

**Trump's Gaza Plan Threatens Hopes of Red Sea Return**
The recent statements by US President Donald Trump regarding the control of the Gaza Strip and the deportation of its residents to other countries, as well as the complexities introduced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the second phase of the ceasefire agreement, have had a negative impact on maritime traffic in the Red Sea, and consequently on the Suez Canal. The head of the Suez Canal Authority, Osama Rabie, confirmed that Trump's recent statements and the uncertainty surrounding the ceasefire agreement in the second phase have had a negative impact on maritime traffic in the Red Sea. He added that there were other indicators that suggested an improvement in the situation, such as the passage of 6 ships belonging to the United States and England through the Red Sea on January 9, 2025, without any threats, considering this as an indicator that the threat in the Red Sea is beginning to recede. However, despite these indicators, ships are still avoiding the Red Sea and taking the Cape of Good Hope route. According to a report by Maersk, shipping companies are demanding more assurances about the safety of navigation in the Red Sea, saying: 'We have held meetings with 32 global shipping companies, and they were saying that they are waiting for more assurances on the safety of navigation, and there are no stronger assurances than the passage of the ships mentioned, in addition to the halt of the Houthis' attacks, which is a positive indicator.' Maersk, one of the world's largest shipping companies, has confirmed that the security risks to commercial ships in the Red Sea and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait are still high, which is driving them to adjust their maritime routes to ensure the safety of their operations. The company has stated that it will continue to sail around the African continent through the Cape of Good Hope, rather than passing through the Red Sea, until the safety of navigation in the region is guaranteed in the long term. Maersk has predicted that maritime traffic through the Red Sea will be opened in the best-case scenario by mid-2025 and in the worst-case scenario will remain restricted until the end of the year, which may lead to the company achieving a break-even point this year, but may see it achieve around $3 billion in operating profits, according to the British Financial Times. The CEO of Maersk, Vincent Clercx, said in the Financial Times that 'the return through the Suez Canal is a very complex process, so we need to make sure we don't return before a few months only. The customers do not want to be in a state of uncertainty.' He added, 'As long as there is doubt about how things will look after a few weeks, we will wait.' In the same context, the CEO of the Nordena Shipping Group, Jean Rendbo, said that Trump's proposal to control Gaza has shattered the hopes of returning to the Red Sea route after more than a year of turmoil, as the announcement has raised concerns that the Houthis will resume their threats against commercial ships passing through the Red Sea, according to the Financial Times. Lars Jensen, the CEO of the Danish shipping company FSPOTCHI MARITIME, which provides advisory services to shipowners and traders, said that the early hopes of returning to the Red Sea route have been shattered, adding 'a week ago there was a light at the end of the tunnel,' but now 'the possibility of returning to the Red Sea is fading.' Following the Houthis' announcement on January 19 to stop attacking ships, except for those registered in Israel or owned by Israeli entities, there was a slight increase in shipments coming from outside Yemen, and the number of ships passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which enters the Red Sea after Yemen, increased by 4% to 223 ships in the week that followed the Houthis' announcement, adding that around 25 ships of these ships have avoided the area since 2023 or have never sailed through the strait historically, according to Lloyd's Intelligence.

**Maersk to Continue Sailing Through Strait of Bab al-Mandab**
Maersk, a Danish shipping company, stated on Monday that its ships will continue to sail through the Strait of Bab al-Mandab. The company also emphasized that the security risks for ships in the Red Sea remain high. According to Osama Rabie, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, maritime traffic through the canal is expected to return to normal by the end of March, with a full recovery expected by mid-year, provided that the ceasefire in Gaza continues. Meanwhile, 32 ships currently pass through the Suez Canal daily, compared to 75 ships that passed through before the outbreak of the war in Gaza on October 7, 2023. Omar Qataya, the head of Zinth Interprise, stated in an interview with Al Arabiya Business that Maersk's decision to continue sailing through the Red Sea is a significant factor in the industry, and that political factors play a major role in this decision. Qataya noted that Maersk's recent statements indicated that the company does not see a justification for returning to the Red Sea at this time. However, a new statement was released yesterday indicating that the company is considering returning in the first or second quarter of the year. Qataya expects a gradual return of shipping companies to the Red Sea by April 2025, but at a reduced capacity. He added, 'We will see an organized process of returning ships to their natural navigation routes through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, which will lead to stability in global shipping prices and contribute to the organization of supply chains, ultimately benefiting the end consumer.' He also stated that major shipping companies, such as Maersk Line and Hapag-Lloyd, will return to more stable profit levels after experiencing unprecedented profits due to the use of the Strait of Bab al-Mandab. However, these companies have imposed adjustments on shipping costs, significantly increasing prices. With the return to the Red Sea, prices are expected to return to normal.

**Trump's Gaza Plan Threatens Resumption of Shipping in Red Sea**
US President Donald Trump's idea of establishing control over the Gaza Strip has undermined hopes for the resumption of shipping in the Red Sea, where commercial ships have been attacked by Houthis amid the Israeli-Hamas war. According to the Financial Times, after the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis announced that they would stop attacking most ships, but now, according to shipping company leaders, the likelihood of cargo carriers returning to the Red Sea has decreased. 'The picture of chaos and tension in the Middle East has been exacerbated, which may prolong the problem of the Red Sea,' said Jan Rindbo, head of the Danish cargo shipping company Norden. 'The risk that the Houthis will not just sit idly by has increased.' 'Last week, there was a glimmer of hope. [Now] the probability of returning to the Red Sea has decreased,' said Lars Jensen, CEO of the consulting company Vespucci Maritime. Danish shipping corporation AP Moller-Maersk has predicted that trade through the Red Sea will resume at best by mid-2025 and at worst will remain limited until the end of the year. 'As long as there are doubts about how things will be in a few weeks, we will wait,' said Vincent Clerc, CEO of AP Moller-Maersk.

**Trump's Statements on Gaza Increase Risk of Attacks on Ships in Red Sea**
Experts believe that US President Donald Trump's statements on the possibility of relocating Palestinians from the Gaza Strip have increased the risk of attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Lars Jensen, head of the Vespucci Maritime consulting company, agrees that the likelihood of shipping companies returning to the Red Sea has decreased. 'The impression of chaos and tension in the Middle East is strengthened, and the problem in the Red Sea may be prolonged,' said Jan Rindbo, head of the Danish shipping company Norden. Maersk, a Danish shipping company, predicts that active container shipping through the Red Sea may resume by mid-2025, but in the worst-case scenario, the demand for this route will remain low throughout the year. Trump's statement on February 4 that the US is considering long-term control of the Gaza Strip to develop it in the interests of peace in the Middle East has raised concerns among experts. 'The probability of returning [shipping companies] to the Red Sea has decreased,' said Lars Jensen. The Yemeni Houthi movement 'Ansar Allah' has warned that it will attack Israeli territory and prevent ships associated with it from passing through the waters of the Red Sea and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait until the operation in the Palestinian enclave is stopped. Since November 2023, the Houthis have attacked dozens of civilian ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. In response to the actions of 'Ansar Allah', the US authorities have announced the formation of an international coalition and begun an operation to ensure freedom of navigation and protect ships in the Red Sea.

**Maersk rides freight boom to 60pc profit jump**
Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, reported a 60% jump in its annual net profit to US$6.1 billion for 2024, driven by higher freight prices due to disruptions in the Red Sea caused by Yemeni rebel attacks. Despite having to take longer routes, the company delivered 'results significantly above initial guidance' and expects to resume Red Sea traffic by the middle to end of 2025. Maersk's chairman and CEO said that the crisis 'underlined the vulnerabilities of global supply chains' and that the company 'capitalised on higher-than-expected demand, strong operational execution and cost discipline'. The global container market experienced a 7% robust recovery in 2024, with export growth out of China being the main driver, increasing its share of global exports to 36% from 32% in 2019. Maersk expects an underlying profit of between US$6 billion and US$9 billion for 2025.

**Stability 'returning to Red Sea'**
Suez Canal Authority Chairman Osama Rabie has told shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk that signs of stability are returning to the Red Sea, urging the company to take this into account when planning sea routes. However, several major global shipping companies, including Maersk, have suspended Red Sea voyages and rerouted vessels around southern Africa to avoid potential attacks from Houthis. The disruption has cost Egypt around $7 billion in revenues from the Suez Canal in 2024. Meanwhile, Spanish ports have seen a 6 percent increase in the volume of goods moving through them in 2024, with Las Palmas and Barcelona experiencing 13 percent and 9 percent increases in volumes of merchandise, bulk liquids, and dry bulk. 'We seek to take into account the positive indicators observed in the Red Sea region when planning maritime schedules in the coming period,' Rabie said. 'Carriers will want to be assured there is an outlook for long-term safe passage before returning to the Red Sea,' said Emily Stausboll, a senior shipping analyst at freight platform Xeneta.
