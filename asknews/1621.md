**Hemoglobinopathies Market to Reach USD 25.68 Billion by 2032, Fueled by Gene Therapy Advances and Rising Newborn Screening Programs.**
The global hemoglobinopathies market is projected to grow from USD 9.63 billion in 2023 to USD 25.68 billion by 2032, registering a robust CAGR of 11.56% during the forecast period. Key factors fueling this growth include increased awareness, expanded newborn screening programs, and significant investment in innovative gene therapies and advanced diagnostics. The U.S. hemoglobinopathy market, valued at USD 2.58 billion in 2023, is anticipated to expand to USD 6.66 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 11.18%. The recent FDA approvals of gene-editing treatments like Casgevy and Lyfgenia are milestone achievements in the therapeutic paradigm. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), early diagnosis by means of new-born screening can avert up to 70% of deaths in children with the condition up to the age of five. National initiatives -- China's prenatal thalassemia screening and India's National Health Mission -- are raising awareness and treatment availability. Future growth is expected to arise from emerging therapies such as gene replacement and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.

**One-time therapy may be 'transformative option´ for treating deadly...**
A groundbreaking one-time treatment, lifileucel, has shown promising results in treating advanced melanoma, with almost one in five patients surviving for five years after receiving the treatment. The trial, led by Dr. Andrew Furness, found that tumours shrunk in 79.3% of patients, and 19.7% of patients were still alive with no new or delayed side effects at a five-year follow-up. Dr. Furness said, 'Results from this trial have shown that TIL therapy may change the outlook for people with advanced melanoma.' The treatment, which harnesses a patient's own immune system to fight the disease, is not yet approved for use in the UK, but was given the green light by the US FDA in February 2024. 'We're continuing our research into the use of TIL therapy, as well as other forms of cellular therapy, across a broader spectrum of cancers,' Dr. Furness added. Cancer patient Zoe Phillips, 46, who took part in the trial, said, 'Before coming to The Royal Marsden I was told that I would probably die, so hearing that my treatment had been successful was amazing, I was over the moon.'

**Saudi Arabia Advances Cancer Care with Potential Approval of Multikine Immunotherapy**
Saudi Arabia may become the first country to approve CEL-SCI Corporation's investigational immunotherapy, Multikine, for commercial use in treating head and neck cancer. The US-based biotech company has submitted an application to the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) for Breakthrough Medicine Designation, which could make Multikine available to patients as early as this summer. If approved, Multikine would be the first neoadjuvant (pre-surgical) immunotherapy available for advanced primary head and neck cancer. According to the SFDA, head and neck cancers account for 5% of all cancer cases in Saudi Arabia, with around 650-700 new cases every year. The approval of Multikine fits perfectly into Saudi Vision 2030, the national framework for economic diversification and innovation that includes transforming the healthcare and biotech sectors. The SFDA's Breakthrough Medicine Designation aims to expedite the approval of therapies that show significant clinical promise in addressing unmet medical needs. By targeting a cancer type with limited first-line advancements, Multikine qualifies as a prime candidate for such accelerated evaluation.

**California Senators Approve Bipartisan Bill To Create Psilocybin Pilot Program For Veterans And First Responders**
California Senators have approved a bipartisan bill to create a psilocybin pilot program for military veterans and first responders. The program, sponsored by Sens. Josh Becker (D) and Brian Jones (R), aims to study and develop 'psilocybin services' for eligible patients in up to five counties across the state. The pilot program would be carried out under the University of California (UC) system, with a focus on veterans and inactive first responders with post-traumatic stress disorder, end-of-life distress, or other specified conditions. According to Sen. Becker, 'every day, an average of 17.6 veterans die by suicide. First responders—those who run towards dangers to protect the rest of us—are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty.' The bill would establish a 'Veterans and First Responders Research Pilot Special Fund' to fund the work, and would require the agency to report specified information about the pilot program to the Legislature by January 15, 2030. Research suggests that psilocybin and psilocyn may offer significant benefits in treating mental health disorders, particularly those related to trauma and stress, and the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already granted a breakthrough therapy designation for a treatment that uses psilocybin as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression.

**Pfizer shelves haemophilia gene therapy Beqvez amid low demand**
Pfizer has decided to discontinue the global commercialization of its haemophilia gene therapy Beqvez (fidanacogene elaparvovec) due to low demand and interest. According to a Pfizer spokesperson, 'limited interest patients and their doctors have demonstrated in haemophilia gene therapies to date'. Beqvez was approved by Health Canada in January 2024 and by the FDA several months later. The European Commission approved the drug in July 2024. Pfizer will focus its efforts on Hympavzi, a non-factor treatment option for haemophilia A or B, which was approved by the FDA in October 2024. This decision highlights the challenges pharma companies face in keeping cell and gene therapies profitable, with narrow target populations and scalability challenges making sustained commercialization difficult.
