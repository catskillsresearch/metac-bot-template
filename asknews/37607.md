**Tanzania Blocks X Over Explicit Content**
Tanzania has blocked access to X due to explicit sexual content, including homosexual pornography, which the platform has allowed since last year. The Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC) in Tanzania called X's presence 'digital repression' before the presidential and parliamentary elections in October. LHRC finds it 'concerning' that government officials are still active on X despite the government ban. Other platforms like Telegram and Clubhouse are only accessible via VPNs. The block on X follows political tensions in the country, including the arrest of opposition leader Tundu Lissu and the expulsion of foreign activists, such as Kenyan Martha Karua. President Samia Suluhu Hassan denies the allegations, but her government is under fire for increasing repression. Amnesty International and other organizations call for an independent investigation. 'It is zorgwekkend that government officials are still active on X despite the government ban,' said LHRC. 'Silaa bevestigde echter in een interview dat het verbod verband houdt met het feit dat X sinds vorig jaar 'expliciet seksueel materiaal, waaronder homoseksuele porno', toestaat.'

**Tanzania announces shutdown of X because of pornography - MyJoyOnline**
Tanzania has blocked access to social media platform X due to the sharing of pornographic content, according to information minister Jerry Silaa. Silaa stated that the content is 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.' However, a Tanzanian rights group, the Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), has expressed concerns about the government's 'troubling pattern of digital repression' ahead of the October presidential and parliamentary elections. The LHRC noted that X faced a similar shutdown in 2020 and that the recurrence of restrictions raises 'serious concerns about the openness of digital space' in Tanzania. The rights group also pointed out that government officials and public institutions continue to use the platform, which 'confuses the public and undermines the credibility of the government's position,' according to LHRC.

**Tanzania blocks X because of pornography, says Information Minister Jerry Silaa**
Tanzania's Information Minister Jerry Silaa has confirmed that the government is blocking the social media platform X due to its hosting of pornography. However, the Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC) has criticized the move as part of a 'troubling pattern of digital repression' ahead of the October presidential and parliamentary elections. The LHRC notes that the government has a history of restricting digital freedoms, including a similar shutdown of X in 2020. The rights group also points out that government officials and public institutions continue to use the platform, creating an 'inconsistency' that 'confuses the public and undermines the credibility of the government's position.' Silaa linked the ban to X's decision to no longer block 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content, saying that the platform has 'permitted explicit sexual material, including same-sex pornographic content' in breach of Tanzania's online 'ethics guidelines.' The move comes amid a government crackdown on human rights campaigners, including the deportation of Kenyan activist Martha Karua and the detention of Ugandan activist Agather Atuhaire, who reported being 'violently' stripped and sexually assaulted in detention. Regional rights groups have called for an investigation into the allegations.

**Pornhub halts operations in France due to new laws**
Pornhub has temporarily stopped showing content in France due to new laws. The adult content websites Pornhub, YouPorn, and RedTube, owned by Aylo, will cease operations in France starting Wednesday. This decision was made in response to French authorities' requirements for age verification checks, according to Reuters. An Aylo representative confirmed that the company was forced to make a difficult decision to block access to its sites. The company also plans to address the French public through its communication channels. The French digital and audiovisual regulator, Arcom, has the authority to block adult content websites and impose fines if age verification measures are ineffective, Reuters reports. Clara Chappaz, France's junior minister for artificial intelligence and digital technology, commented on the issue on social media platform X (Twitter), stating that if Aylo decides to leave the French market instead of complying with local laws, the company has the right to do so. Arcom previously reported that approximately 2.3 million minors have access to adult content websites every month, despite existing legislative restrictions. Similar problems with child protection on adult content platforms have been observed in other European Union countries. Last month, EU regulators announced an investigation into several websites, including Pornhub, due to inadequate compliance with rules aimed at protecting minors. In the EU, measures requiring age confirmation are not considered sufficient to prevent minors from accessing adult content. The closure of Pornhub in France has sparked a discussion about age verification methods online and the possibility of stricter laws to protect minors. Some experts suggest considering alternative technologies, such as biometric data or electronic identification, to ensure reliable age verification. However, such measures may raise concerns about user privacy and security, creating a paradox in the digital age where data protection is increasingly important. Overall, the refusal of major companies to comply with local laws may lead to further restrictions on access to content that many users consider normal. This also raises questions about how countries can balance the protection of minors and users' rights to access information.

**X Experiences Global Outage on June 3, 2025**
Millions of users worldwide experienced unexpected interruptions on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, on June 3, 2025. The outage, which caught the digital community by surprise, prevented normal access to the app, as well as the posting of messages and interaction with other profiles. Users quickly began reporting their frustration with the errors, which appeared to affect multiple key functions of the service, owned by Elon Musk. As one user reportedly said, 'It's unacceptable that a platform like X, which is supposed to be always on, is experiencing these kinds of issues.'

**Now Pornhub ban spreads to EUROPE & it includes two other major X-rated sites**
Pornhub, the world's most visited porn site, has blocked access to its platform in France due to objections to a new law requiring age verification. The company, Aylo, argues that device-based age verification is a better solution than requiring porn sites to police the age of users. Aylo's VP for Brand and Community, Alex Kekesi, said, 'The French government refuses to take this simple step and instead are focused on futile and entirely symbolic regulatory actions which are unenforceable, do not protect children and expose your private data.' The company has also blocked access to its other popular sites, Youporn and RedTube, in France. French Gender Equality Minister Aurore Bergé welcomed the decision, saying, 'Pornhub, Youporn, and RedTube refuse to comply with our legal framework and decide to leave. Good!' This move comes after Aylo blocked access to its sites in several US states over age verification laws, which require porn sites to verify users' age. The European Commission has also launched an investigation into several adult websites, including Pornhub, over accusations they had not complied with regulations aimed at stopping minors accessing porn.

**Adult Websites Block Access in France in Protest of New Rules**
The owners of adult websites 'YouPorn', 'Born Hub', and 'Red Tube' have blocked access to their content in France in protest of new rules to protect minors. The company 'Ailo' that owns these platforms wrote in a message to users trying to access these sites: 'Freedom cannot be suppressed.' The message added: 'By suspending access to our site in France, we take a stance that rejects the infringement of your privacy through measures that, paradoxically, do not effectively protect minors.' In response, French Digital Minister Clara Chappaz said: 'Today, Born Hub and YouPorn have chosen to disconnect rather than take responsibility.' The French feminist organization 'Osez le féminisme' commented on Telegram: 'This industry, which earns billions, prefers to mobilize its resources to fight any attempt at regulation, with the help of lawyers and pressure groups, rather than giving up on unconditional and free access that fuels its economic model based on violence and the sexualization of all forms of oppression.' The company is protesting a French law passed in 2024 that requires adult content providers to implement an age verification system to prevent minors from accessing their content, under the threat of penalties from the digital and audiovisual content regulator ('Arcom') that can include blocking. According to a study by the regulator in the first half of 2024, around 40% of children in France visit adult websites monthly. For example, adult content providers should request a photo or ID document from users, providing at least one method that respects the principle of double anonymity, allowing users to prove they are adults without revealing their identity. 'Ailo', which says its adult websites attract 7 million daily visitors in France, is calling for a device and operating system-based age verification system. In contrast, other countries like the UK and Germany impose age restrictions on accessing adult content.

**French Government Blocks Access to Adult Content Websites**
The French government has blocked access to adult content websites Pornhub, Youporn, and Redtube from June 7th, citing a need to protect minors from explicit content. The law requires users to verify their age, and the websites' owner, Aylo, has decided to shut down its operations in France to protest the law. Aylo's representative, Solomon Friedman, called the law 'farligt och potentiellt integritetskränkande' (dangerous and potentially infringing on personal integrity). Clara Chappez, France's deputy minister for artificial intelligence and digital technology, responded by saying 'Om de hellre vill lämna Frankrike än följa våra lagar, så lycka till!' (If they prefer to leave France rather than follow our laws, good luck!). The EU has also implemented new regulations for online child protection, including age verification systems, and Aylo has expressed its support for this concept, but with the condition that users' identities are not required.

**Youporn, Pornhub, and Redtube to Block French Users Over Age Verification Requirements**
The French government's conflict with adult video platforms has intensified. Starting Wednesday, the sites Youporn, Pornhub, and Redtube will no longer share pornographic content in France, announced the Aylo group, the parent company of the popular sites. Access to these sites for French users will be blocked. This is a protest measure against the French state's requirement for age verification. According to Alex Kekesi, vice-president of community and brand at Aylo, 'We have taken the difficult decision to suspend access to our sites in France from tomorrow afternoon and to use our platforms to address the French public directly.' The European Union had announced an investigation into Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX, and XVideos in late May, accusing them of not taking sufficient measures to prevent minors from accessing their content. The European Commission pointed to the lack of 'appropriate tools' for verifying user age and protecting minors from adult content under the new Digital Services Act (DSA).

**Tanzania block access to X after hackers targeted police account - TV47 Digital**
Tanzania has restricted access to X (formerly Twitter) for the second time in recent months, following a cyber attack on the country's police account. The compromised account, with 470,000 followers, posted false claims that the President had died, sparking outrage among top government officials. According to NetBlocks, a global internet shutdown tracker, X became unreachable across all major internet providers in Tanzania on Tuesday, May 20. This latest blockage comes after President Samia instructed the police force to take measures to 'protect' social media platforms, signaling a growing concern over the spread of misinformation online. The incident follows the arrest and deportation of several Kenyan activists from Tanzania, who had traveled to observe the trial of opposition leader Tundu Lissu.

The Indian government has blocked the X (formerly Twitter) accounts of several Turkish and Chinese media organisations, including TRT World, Xinhua, and Global Times News, amid a crackdown on 'anti-India content' related to Operation Sindoor. The blocking of over 8,000 accounts, including those of international news organisations and prominent X users, was ordered by the Indian government, with X voicing disagreement over the orders, stating that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech.' The Indian government has also criticized Global Times for spreading disinformation, saying 'we would recommend you verify your facts and cross-examine your sources before pushing out this kind of disinformation.' Several independent media outlets and journalists remain blocked on X, including Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat, and Free Press Kashmir, as well as Anuradha Bhasin and Muzamil Jaleel.

X has expressed objections to the directive, stating that the government did not provide clear reasons for the blocking. The platform has received executive orders from the Indian government, which include demands to block access to accounts that allegedly broke India's regional regulations. X has said that it is investigating legal options to challenge the directive, but users who are impacted can contact the Indian government directly. This development may strain Elon Musk's business ventures in India, including Tesla's plans to launch showroom spaces and Starlink's operations.

Pakistan has restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban, which was enforced in February 2024 due to the platform being 'used to draw attention to instances of alleged election fraud.' According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, metrics show that access to X has been restored in Pakistan, allowing citizens to access the platform without the need for a virtual private network (VPN). However, other platforms such as Telegram remain blocked in the country. Pakistan has imposed 21 shutdowns in 2024, the highest number ever, and is reportedly building a Great Firewall-like internet censorship system with China's help.

However, X management has not yet implemented this decision, and the accounts are still accessible. It remains to be seen whether X will appeal this decision, as they have done in the past.

**The value of X**
Pakistan continues to block social media platform X (formerly Twitter), despite mounting legal and public pressure. The Lahore High Court is currently hearing petitions challenging the ban, which argue that restricting access to X violates Articles 19 and 19-A of the constitution, guaranteeing freedom of expression and access to information. The court has questioned why government institutions and officials, including the prime minister, continue to use X despite its official prohibition. The ban was imposed in early 2024 under the caretaker government, but its justification, citing confidential reports from intelligence agencies, is unconvincing and reeks of political expediency. The government's actions suggest an intent to normalise digital censorship under the guise of security, which is unacceptable. Free speech and access to information are fundamental to democracy, and an open digital space is crucial for political discourse. The ban on X should not become the new normal, and the government should engage in democratic debate, address misinformation through transparency, and strengthen public trust. Censorship is not the solution; dialogue and accountability are.

**X Blocks Signal Links, Sparking Controversy**
X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has been blocking links to Signal, a secure messaging service. According to users, X marks Signal links as spam, preventing users from accessing them directly from the platform. This move has sparked controversy, as it restricts users' ability to communicate outside of X. This is just the latest in a long list of controversies surrounding X, which has undergone significant changes since Elon Musk's acquisition in 2022. Other issues include the introduction of paid verification, a radical rebranding, and a decrease in transparency, including the removal of 'likes' visibility. As a result, alternative platforms like BlueSky have seen a significant increase in traffic, attracting users who miss the old Twitter experience.

**X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey: rights watchdog**
X, formerly known as Twitter, blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts include those belonging to Turkish journalists, activists, and media organizations operated by journalists living in exile, as well as some that have been inactive since 2015. This is not the first time X has complied with the Turkish government's censorship demands, having previously blocked access to over 100 accounts in October 2024. The move has been criticized by human rights and media freedom groups, who say it amounts to censorship. Turkey has a poor track record of online freedoms, with a score of 31 in a 100-point index, making it the lowest-scoring country in Europe. The Turkish government has been accused of muzzling freedom of expression and cracking down on people who express criticism of their government on social media.
