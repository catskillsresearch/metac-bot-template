**$TRUMP coin buyers spent $140 million to have dinner with President**
Buyers of the $TRUMP meme coin spent over $140 million for a chance to have dinner with former President Donald Trump on May 22. The top 220 holders of the digital currency were promised an 'intimate dinner' with Trump, causing a 40% surge in the coin's value. Individual buyers spent anywhere from $53,500 to $16.4 million for the coveted invite. The top holder remains anonymous, as do most participants, with transactions traced to offshore exchanges. This has triggered concerns among government watchdogs and lawmakers about political access being tied to financial investments in a Trump-branded digital asset. Tony Carrk, executive director of watchdog group Accountable.US, said, 'They are shrouded by their anonymous crypto usernames.' The dinner is scheduled for May 22 at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C. Eric Trump previously described the meme coin as 'the hottest digital meme on earth.'

**Donald Trump Will Reportedly Use Saudi Arabia Trip To Issue LIV Golf Ultimatum**
Donald Trump is reportedly planning to use his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia to issue an ultimatum to the country's Public Investment Fund, stating that any deal between the PGA Tour and the kingdom will be on the PGA Tour's preferred terms, with no long-term future for LIV Golf. According to Eamon Lynch of Golfweek, Trump will tell Saudi officials that the PGA Tour will not accept a deal that includes a long-term future for LIV. The PGA Tour currently has the upper hand in the standoff, with rising television ratings and notable golfers still exiled from the tour. Saudi Arabia has already poured billions of dollars into LIV, but it's likely that they will eventually cut their losses. Trump's message may serve as the catalyst for this development, but it's also worth noting that he has made money from LIV Golf events held at his properties.

**$TRUMP meme coin buyers spent more than $140 million to get dinner invite with Trump, data shows**
The $TRUMP meme coin's top 220 holders spent a total of over $140 million to secure an invitation to an 'intimate dinner' with President Trump. The announcement of the dinner promotion on April 23 led to a 40% increase in the value of the meme coin, reversing an 88% slump in the weeks prior. The top holders spent anywhere from $53,500 to $16.4 million to secure a spot, with the largest holder being an account named Sun VIP. However, the identities of the account owners remain anonymous due to the nature of digital wallets. Critics have raised concerns about the purchase of a Trump-branded asset being linked to access to the president, as well as the potential financial benefits to the Trump Organization from the meme coin's sales. Tony Carrk, executive director of watchdog group Accountable.US, expressed concern that the top holders are 'shrouded by their anonymous crypto usernames.' The dinner will take place on May 22 at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C. and will include a Private VIP Reception with President Trump and a Special VIP TOUR.

**Lexi Thompson shares image from a golf course where she once played with U.S. President Donald Trump**
Lexi Thompson, a semi-retired LPGA Tour player, has shared a picture from the Trump International Golf Club Palm Beach, where she played with U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019. Thompson had previously received criticism for playing with Trump, which led her to take a break from social media. She has since returned and is focusing on her personal life and golf. Thompson, who has competed in just four events this year, has made $145.6K on the LPGA Tour and has a best finish of T13 at the Founders Cup. She plans to compete in the 2025 US Women's Open starting May 25th at the Lancaster Country Club. 'I'm still very competitive, and yeah, but just trying to enjoy the few times I will play,' Thompson said. 'I love working out. I'm still striving to be better for when I do tee it up, because every time I tee it up, I still want to win.'

**220 Buyers Spend $148 Million on TRUMP Meme Coin, Winning Dinner with Former President**
A total of 220 buyers spent approximately $148 million to purchase the TRUMP meme coin, winning the opportunity to have dinner with former US President Donald Trump on May 22 at a private golf club in the Washington D.C. suburbs. However, this event has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and legal risks. Trump's first major event based on his own meme coin, the 'Dinner Competition', has officially ended. He promoted the event on his social media platform Truth Social as 'the most exclusive invitation in the world', promising to invite the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP coin to dinner with him, and the top 25 will also receive a 'super exclusive private VIP treatment' and a 'special VIP trip'. To ensure the event's safety, all invitees must undergo a background check to confirm their eligibility. Inca Digital announced on Monday: 'If you're among the top 220, congratulations, you'll be dining with President Trump on May 22.' The winners were ranked based on their 'time-weighted' $TRUMP holdings, calculated from April 23 when the competition was announced to May 12 when it ended. The price of $TRUMP skyrocketed to $75 after Trump announced its launch over the weekend, but then plummeted to $7.50. On Monday, as the competition ended, the trading price of $TRUMP was around $14. Democratic lawmakers have questioned the potential for conflicts of interest and illegal activities in Trump's cryptocurrency venture. Last week, Senator Blumenthal wrote a letter to the cryptocurrency company Fight Fight Fight LLC, announcing an official investigation into Trump's meme coin. The letter stated that Trump's activities in the cryptocurrency field may involve conflicts of interest and illegal risks, and requested the company to explain the project's operation and funding details. Senators Warren and Schakowsky also signed a joint letter criticizing Trump's actions, saying it is a blatant example of 'pay-to-play' and 'selling presidential-level access'.

**US-Saudi Agreement Sparks Hopes for PGA Tour and LIV Golf Integration**
The recent news of the US-Saudi strategic economic partnership agreement has sparked high expectations in the golf world, particularly regarding the potential integration of the PGA Tour and LIV Golf. According to Golfweek, a US golf media outlet, high-ranking officials, including Tiger Woods, visited the White House last week to brief President Donald Trump on the negotiation cards and messages. Trump's visit to the Middle East is expected to focus on the PGA Tour and LIV Golf integration issue. LIV Golf, backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), has spent over $5 billion in the past three years, but has yet to achieve significant results. Integration with the PGA Tour is crucial for its sustainability. Golfweek reported that Trump is likely to be actively involved in the negotiations between PIF and the PGA Tour, as his golf business could benefit from the Saudi funding. Trump earns a fee from LIV Golf for hosting tournaments at his golf courses, and the integration could lead to more Saudi investment in his business. However, some outlets have described Trump's involvement as a 'self-serving' move to reunify the divided men's golf tour.

**Social Security Payment Adjustments Projected to Be Lowest in Years, Group Predicts**
A prominent seniors group predicts that the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for next year's Social Security payments will be 2.4 percent, the lowest since 2021. This would be a 0.1 percentage point increase from their previous prediction. The group's director, Shannon Benton, expressed concerns that seniors will face additional financial pressure, as 73 percent rely on Social Security for at least half their income. The Social Security Administration will announce next year's COLA in October, based on the consumer price index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) data for September, August, and July. Benton also praised President Donald Trump's executive order to lower prescription drug prices, saying it is a 'big step for Medicare's ability to negotiate prices'.

**Trump's Middle East Tour: Economic Agreements and Diplomatic Efforts**
US President Donald Trump has begun a four-day tour of the Middle East, focusing on economic agreements. He was received with pomp in Riyadh, where he was accompanied by powerful business leaders, including his advisor Elon Musk. The Saudi minister of investments, Khalid al Falih, stated that 'although energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, investments and commercial opportunities in the kingdom have developed and multiplied.' Trump aims to secure a $1 trillion investment from Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the US industry and close over $100 billion in arms purchases. He also seeks to revive diplomacy between Arab countries, reiterating the idea of the Abraham Accords, signed during his first term between the UAE, Bahrain, and Israel. However, Trump's involvement with these countries goes beyond national interests, as his family members have business deals in the region, including a $5.5 billion golf club project in Qatar. The US has also maintained a strong alignment with Israel, approving $4 billion in arms sales in March 2025 and sharing ideological views, such as a video simulating a luxury resort in Gaza, where Trump appears with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

**Trump's $1 Billion Golf Trip: A Journey of Luxury and Diplomacy**
US President Donald Trump is embarking on a $1 billion trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, but will not be visiting Israel. The trip is expected to focus on luxury and glamour, with the US President set to travel on a private jet provided by Qatar, dubbed the 'flying palace'. The jet, which is reportedly owned by the Qatari royal family, boasts 76 meters in length, multiple bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, an elevator, a central staircase, five onboard kitchens, and several luxurious salons and conference rooms. However, the jet can only accommodate around 100 passengers, a fraction of the usual 600. This level of luxury may be symbolic of the trip's focus, with the US President prioritizing economic and diplomatic interests over pressing issues like the Gaza conflict and Iran's nuclear program. The decision not to visit Israel may also reflect a growing distance between the Trump administration and the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.

**Trump's Golf Obsession: A Third of His Time Spent on the Course**
Since taking office on January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump has spent a third of his time playing golf, according to data from The Alt Media. Trump's passion for golf has raised concerns among Americans, as he has managed to fit in golf sessions despite signing decrees and meeting with foreign leaders. 'He doesn't look at the clock when he's on the golf course,' said a source, 'which has resulted in 27% of his calendar being marked in green.' Trump has played golf in New Jersey, Florida, and Washington, spending 10 out of his first 37 days in golf courses. His golf habit has cost taxpayers an estimated $115 million, including travel and security expenses. Trump's love for golf is not just a hobby, but a vital part of his life, as he sees it as a way to maintain his focus, confidence, and composure. His granddaughter Kai, 17, has inherited his passion for golf and often shares photos with him on social media. Trump is not the first US president to enjoy golf, but his excessive golfing has raised eyebrows, especially considering his low productivity during his first term, with an average workday of just 6 hours, making him the least productive president since Franklin Roosevelt.

**Donald Trump's Golf Habits Under Scrutiny as He Spends 27% of Time on the Course**
According to The Alt Media, Donald Trump has spent 27% of his days since returning to the White House on January 20, 2025, playing golf. This translates to 10 out of 37 days spent on golf courses in Florida, New Jersey, or Washington. This statistic contrasts with the efficiency measures implemented by Trump, including the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, which requires government officials to justify their activities or face termination. Trump's golf habit has been a topic of controversy since his first term, with 247 games played over 1,461 days, or one game every 6 days, as reported by Fifty States. Trump had previously criticized Barack Obama's excessive golf playing during the 2016 presidential campaign. As Libération notes, Trump's 10 golf games since January 20 do not mean he spent a third of his term playing golf, but rather that he spent at least part of 10 days playing. The trips to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida for golf have already cost over $10 million in public funds, according to the HuffPost.

**Donald Trump 'spends 1/3 of time' on expensive hobby - not related to presidency**
US President Donald Trump has spent around 29% of his days in his second term golfing, according to a campaign group. The POTUS has also spent $10.7 million on golfing during his first month back in the White House. Jordan Libowitz of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said, 'It's clear that when the Trump administration considers the definition of corruption and wasteful spending, it doesn't count spending that ends up in the president's pockets.' Trump has been on a golfing trip every weekend since his return to presidency and has played golf at his own properties on nine of his first 30 days in office.

This has allegedly cost taxpayers $10.7 million in his first month back in office, with each trip to Mar-a-Lago costing $3,383,250. HuffPost reported that Trump has gone golfing every weekend since resuming the presidency on January 20, and has played golf at his own properties on nine of his first 30 days in office. The actual expenses are likely even higher, given that the report's figures are based on 2017 costs.

**Is Donald Trump 'Just Golfing' Through His Presidency? New Stats Leave Americans Baffled!**
According to Trump Golf Tracker, Donald Trump has spent almost 24.14% of his presidency playing golf, which translates to 7 days of golfing in the first 29 days of his second term. This data has sparked reactions from citizens, with some users on Reddit joking that he should be golfing full-time, while others criticize his lack of productivity. The data release comes as Trump has been making significant changes to policies, including those affecting the LGBTQA community, and has been criticized for involving Elon Musk in core political matters. Additionally, prices of daily usage items such as gasoline and eggs have been skyrocketing, with eggs costing $7.74 a dozen and gasoline at $3.13 per gallon. Trump has previously been scrutinized for his golfing habits, and this new information may lead to further criticism.

**Americans baffled as Donald Trump has spent 24% of his presidency golfing so far**
Donald Trump has been accused of 'working a part-time job' as a tracker suggests he has gone golfing on nearly a quarter of the days since his inauguration. According to the Trump Golf Tracker, the president has gone golfing on 7 out of 29 days in office, equivalent to 24.14% of his presidency. Trump has also met with PGA Tour's commissioner Jay Monahan and player director Adam Scott to discuss the future of golf. Tiger Woods praised Trump for his involvement in peace talks between PGA and LIV Golf, saying 'I think we're in a very positive place right now. We had a meeting with the President... and we have another subsequent meeting coming up.' The tracker also contains graphs displaying the price of eggs and gasoline, with eggs currently at $7.74 a dozen and gasoline at $3.13 per gallon.

**This viral Trump Golf Tracker shows that he’s spent 17% of his presidency golfing so far**
A new website, Trump Golf Tracker, has gone viral on social media, showing that President Donald Trump has spent 17.86% of his second term golfing, which is equivalent to five days out of 28. According to the tracker, Trump visited a Trump Organisation property on 428 of the 1,461 days of his first presidential term and played 261 rounds of golf, one every 5.6 days. The tracker also shows the increasing prices of eggs and gasoline, with the cost of eggs currently at $7.74 for one dozen eggs and gasoline at $3.13 per gallon. These price hikes have been linked to an ongoing bird flu and show no signs of stopping, despite Trump's campaign promises to bring prices down. As of the end of the Biden administration, the cost of eggs was $3.65, which has more than doubled in the last month.
