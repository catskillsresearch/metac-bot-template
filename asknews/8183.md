**AI Energy Consumption to Surpass Bitcoin Mining by 2025, Study Warns**
According to a new study, the energy consumption of AI systems is growing faster than expected and could surpass that of Bitcoin mining by the end of 2025. By then, AI will account for almost half of the global energy consumption of data centers, up from 20% currently. The study's author, Alex de Vries-Gao, criticizes the lack of transparency from tech companies about the actual energy costs of AI applications. He draws parallels with the cryptocurrency industry, where the 'bigger is better' approach has led to environmental degradation. The study warns that the US market could see a 25% increase in energy consumption from AI, Bitcoin mining, and traditional data centers by 2030. However, it's not just the amount of energy that matters, but also its source. For example, a search query in West Virginia generates almost twice as much CO2 emissions as the same query in California, where renewable energy dominates. Despite progress in efficiency and sustainability, the study finds the situation alarming. The global energy consumption of data centers could reach the level of Japan's total energy demand by 2026, according to the International Energy Agency. Additionally, the increasing demand for specialized chips and other components drives up the demand for rare earth materials, while water consumption for cooling systems is also on the rise. In some regions, the establishment of data centers and their water consumption is already in conflict with the needs of the local population.

**Do you really need "post-quantum" encryption for your VPN or storage?**
The advent of quantum computing poses a threat to modern encryption algorithms, particularly asymmetric cryptography. Researchers have developed 'post-quantum' cryptography (PQC) schemes to secure data against quantum attacks. PQC algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, and FALCON are being standardized by NIST. However, these new algorithms come with trade-offs, such as larger key and message sizes, and a lack of real-world testing. The practical integration of PQC is a massive hurdle, requiring software and hardware updates. For now, most personal needs are still secure with current encryption, but organizations handling sensitive data should prepare for a post-quantum transition. NIST expects organizations to have transitioned away from RSA-2048 and comparable ECC to PQC algorithms by 2030, and will disallow their use in 2035.

**Crypto Heists May 2025**
In May 2025, the cryptocurrency sector suffered significant security breaches, resulting in estimated losses of $244.1 million. The most notable incident was the Cetus Protocol exploit, which saw attackers steal $220 million by exploiting a bug in the protocol's 'most significant bits check' system. However, in a remarkable display of cooperation, Sui Validators and the Cetus Protocol team worked together to recover around $157 million of stolen funds, achieving a 71% recovery. Other platforms also suffered losses, including a $5.2 million cyberattack attributed to North Korean-affiliated hackers. The incident highlights the growing sophistication and audacity of state-sponsored hackers, particularly North Korea's Lazarus Group, which has been linked to several major hacks, including the record-breaking Bybit attack in February 2025. The engagement of North Korea in cryptocurrency hacks has been increasing, with over $1.34 billion stolen in 47 attacks in 2024. The reaction of the crypto market to these issues has been varied, with some instances of cooperation between platform validators, security companies, and law enforcers. However, the recurring nature of these threats requires constant monitoring and stronger security measures, frequent audits, and heightened user awareness to strengthen the industry's defense.

**Gold Prices $10,000 by 2030? - Live Trading News**
Analysts predict that gold prices could reach $10,000 per ounce by 2030, driven by historical trends, the declining value of the U.S. dollar, and rising geopolitical tensions. According to InvestingHaven, gold could exceed $3,275 in 2025 and reach $4,000 by 2026. Incrementum's Stoeferle projects gold could hit $4,800 by 2030, citing central bank buying and the erosion of purchasing power. Knightsbridge Gold's current trajectory and market sentiment also support a significant revaluation of gold. As CEO A says, 'The establishment often downplays gold's potential, focusing on short-term price corrections or the allure of cryptocurrencies.' However, this narrative overlooks the fundamental drivers of gold's value, including the structural shift driven by decades of monetary mismanagement and the fragility of fiat systems. Gold prices are poised for a significant upward move, potentially surpassing $10,000 per ounce by 2030.

**Google Study Reveals Vulnerability of Modern Cryptography to Quantum Computers**
A Google study has shown that a 2048-bit RSA encryption key, a modern standard for online security, can be broken by a quantum computer with less than a million qubits in just a few days. This finding has significantly reduced the requirements for the quantum computer configuration compared to previous estimates, which just a few years ago suggested a need for at least 20 million qubits. A quantum computer with a million qubits is still more of a fantasy than a reality, but the pace of progress in this field requires that we start transitioning to security measures that are resistant to quantum technologies now. The study, conducted by Craig Gidney for Google, provides a detailed description of future quantum attacks and calls on the global IT community to prepare for a post-quantum world. Gidney's conclusions are the result of advances in both quantum algorithms and error correction methods. Since Peter Shor discovered in 1994 that quantum computers can factor large numbers much more efficiently than classical computers, researchers have been trying to accurately determine what configuration of quantum equipment is needed to break real encryption. Gidney's latest work is based on recent algorithmic breakthroughs, such as the use of approximate modular exponentiation, which significantly reduces the number of required logical qubits. The study also includes a more dense model for storing qubits with corrected errors, using methods such as 'yoked surface codes' and 'magic state cultivation' to reduce the required resources. A hypothetical machine with a million qubits to break 2048-bit RSA encryption keys would need to work continuously for five days, maintain an extremely low error rate, and coordinate billions of logical operations without interruption. Current quantum computers work with hundreds or thousands of qubits, which is much less than the million-qubit mark. For example, IBM's Condor and Google's Sycamore with 1121 and 53 qubits respectively illustrate the current capabilities of quantum computing. D-Wave recently presented the most powerful quantum computer in the world, the Advantage2 system with over 4400 qubits. Like all previous D-Wave systems (except for the first generation), Advantage2 will be available only through the cloud. Physical systems will be delivered to customers later, with platforms of at least 7000 qubits, the time for which has not yet come.

**Breaking RSA encryption just got 20x easier for quantum computers**
New research from Google Quantum AI has revealed that RSA-2048 encryption could be cracked by a one-million-qubit system by 2030, 20x faster than previous estimates. This accelerated timeline for breaking current encryption standards is prompting enterprises to accelerate the adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). According to Google researchers Craig Gidney and Sophie Schmieg, 'For decades the quantum and security communities have also known that large-scale quantum computers will at some point in the future likely be able to break many of today's secure public key cryptography algorithms.'

**VanEck research reveals if Strategic Bitcoin Reserve can pay off US debt by 2049**
According to VanEck research, if the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve act is adopted, Bitcoin may offset 18% of the national debt by 2049. The research assumes that the U.S. treasury will collect one million bitcoins in five years and hold them for 20 years, with the bitcoins only being spent to cover the national debt. Based on this scenario, the total value of the bitcoins will amount to $21 trillion and will offset around 18% of the national debt, which is expected to reach around $116 trillion by 2049. However, to fully pay off the national debt, the government would need to purchase over five million bitcoins. Donald Trump has claimed that Bitcoin will probably pay off trillions of U.S. debt, but this is considered baseless at the current stage.
