**Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” could weaken the dollar further**
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's statement about the weak US dollar has been met with skepticism, as cyclical indicators are not turning higher and gold prices are rising. Meanwhile, Bulgaria is making progress towards adopting the euro by January 1, 2026, which may have a limited impact on the euro currency. The euro has recently appreciated by nearly 0.8% against the USD, but it's unclear how long this momentum will last. As Trump threatens trade actions, the euro has rebounded, but the long-term effects of his 'One Big Beautiful Bill' on the dollar are still unknown.

**Euro Gains Popularity as US Dollar Shows Signs of Uncertainty**
The euro is gaining popularity on the global currency market, while the US dollar is showing signs of uncertainty. According to JP Morgan analysts, 'as long as the US dollar is demonstrating clear indecision, the euro is gaining momentum, and the thesis 'sell America' is relevant again in the face of falling long-term bond yields.' Economist Eldar Shamсутдинov notes that the dollar is in a state of deep uncertainty, with a sense of slow rotation, but without a strong trigger to open new positions. Traders are holding long positions in the euro, British pound, and Australian dollar, and there is high interest in the yen. The eurozone's inflation data is supporting the euro's growth, but the European Central Bank (ECB) may be forced to maintain high interest rates due to the rising core inflation. In Kazakhstan, there is a strong demand for the euro, with purchases increasing by over 1.5 times after a three-year decline. The net sales of euros in the country have reached 68.1 billion tenge in the first two months of 2025, exceeding the total volume for the entire 2024 year.

**Euro Rises Towards Multi-Year High as Dollar Weakens**
The Euro has risen slightly and is approaching its multi-year high of $1.1573, which it reached in mid-April due to the trade tensions triggered by US President Donald Trump. The Euro had fallen below the $1.11 mark last week due to the progress in the trade war between China and the US, but has since risen again. The Euro has been on an upward trend since Trump's inauguration in January, particularly due to his erratic economic and trade policies, which have weakened the Dollar by 10% since mid-January. This week, there are few economic data releases, but on Friday, detailed data on Germany's economic development will be released at 8:00 AM, followed by French consumer confidence at 8:45 AM. In the US, new home sales will be released in the afternoon.

**Euro Remains Stable Above $1.13 USD**
The Euro has remained stable above $1.13 USD, with a current exchange rate of $1.1332. This follows a slight increase on Wednesday, where the Euro surpassed the $1.13 mark and continued its recovery. The currency is nearing its multi-year high of $1.1573, reached in mid-April after tensions over US trade policies. The Euro had previously fallen below $1.11 due to progress in the trade war between China and the US. However, doubts are now emerging about the sustainability of the easing of tensions, which is giving the Euro a boost. Since Trump's inauguration, US economic and trade policies have weakened the dollar, which has depreciated by 10% since January. On Thursday, Eurozone consumer sentiment indices and Germany's Ifo business climate index may cause market movement.

**EUR/USD Rises Despite Trump's Tariff Threat: What's Next?**
The EUR/USD exchange rate rose to its highest level since May 8, despite Donald Trump's threat to impose additional tariffs on the European Union, which would affect trade worth over $1.6 trillion. The rate rose to 1.1365, a 2.7% increase from its monthly low. Analysts believe that Trump's threat was a negotiating tactic, similar to his approach with China. Some investors consider the euro a better alternative to the US dollar due to the US's erratic policies. The euro has been in an upward trend since Trump initiated his trade war. The next key catalyst for the EUR/USD will be the upcoming US consumer confidence report on Tuesday. The other key catalyst will be the FOMC meeting minutes, which will be released on Wednesday. The US will then publish its latest GDP data on Thursday and the PCE inflation report on Friday. According to technical analysis, the EUR/USD has formed a golden cross pattern, indicating a continuation of the upward trend. The next key resistance level to watch is the annual high of 1.1572.

**Is the Dollar Losing Its Crown? Global Currency Shifts Explained**
The US dollar's status as the world's reserve currency is being challenged by growing global uncertainties. Humphrey Percy discusses the evolving role of the dollar with the euro potentially gaining traction, and how oil and gold factor into monetary dynamics. Central banks are preparing for the shifts ahead. Meanwhile, US President Trump has threatened a 50% tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025, and has recommended that iPhones sold in the US be manufactured in the US. The euro has rallied for the fourth time in five sessions as German GDP came in stronger than expected, and rising tariff tensions and dollar volatility support Euro futures. The EU's Maros Sefcovic has stated that the EU is fully engaged and committed to securing a deal that works for both sides.

**Euro Rises Amid Concerns Over US Debt Sustainability**
The Euro has been rising in value this week, nearing its multi-year high of $1.1573, which it reached in mid-April due to the US-China trade tensions. Despite a brief decline to $1.11 on Monday last week due to concerns about the sustainability of the trade truce, the Euro has been gaining value again. The Euro has been in an upward trend since US President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, largely due to his erratic economic and trade policies. According to Helaba, concerns about the long-term sustainability of US debt are currently driving the direction of the market, keeping the US dollar in check. However, the Euro is expected to maintain its current level and remain above the 21-day moving average of $1.1275. The next resistance levels for the Euro are at $1.1381, $1.1425, and $1.1473.

**Protecting Your Investments from the Decline of the US Dollar**
The decline of the US dollar in 2025 has significant consequences for investors. Those who have invested in US stocks, such as Apple, are affected by the dollar's value. For example, if Apple is worth $200 when the euro-dollar is at 1.05, it represents an investment of 190.50 euros. However, if the stock price rises to $210 while the euro-dollar increases to 1.12, the investment is now worth only 187.50 euros. To protect against this risk, investors can use options such as 'call' and 'put' to speculate on the dollar's decline. However, these options can generate significant losses if the trend reverses. Other instruments, such as warrants and turbos, are available to individuals, but they have their own risks and limitations. Even funds invested in US stocks or bonds can be affected by a decline in the dollar. Investors should consider the impact of exchange rates on their investments, including those in gold, oil, or bitcoin, which are priced in dollars. A weak euro can also increase the cost of imports and lead to inflation, affecting the real value of savings.

**Euro Strengthens as Investors Flee Dollar Amid Trade Uncertainty**
The euro has strengthened by over 10% against the US dollar since January, reaching a value of $1.1369 per euro on Monday, April 14. While some of this increase is due to US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies, the growing confidence in the eurozone economy is also a factor. The 20 members of the eurozone are recovering from a mild recession in 2023, with a growth rate of 0.8% last year and a predicted expansion of 1.3% in 2025. However, the impending 20% tariffs on EU imports to the US could still disrupt these prospects. Many foreign investors are shifting capital from the dollar to European stocks and bonds, further strengthening the euro. The euro's strength is also driven by divergent monetary policies, with the European Central Bank maintaining a tough stance on inflation, while the Federal Reserve has begun to cut interest rates. This makes maintaining dollars less profitable, causing investors to opt for the euro. 'Trump is eroding confidence in the rationality of US policy, the long-term growth prospects of the US, and the sustainability of its public finances,' notes Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. 'As a result, the dollar is losing value, but the euro is not a real alternative.' The large German stimulus package, approved by parliament earlier this month, has further boosted investor confidence in the euro. The package, worth €1 trillion ($1.13 trillion), includes defense, infrastructure, and climate protection spending. Much of the spending will be financed through new bonds, which will increase yields and attract foreign investors. Commerzbank predicts that Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio could rise to 90% in the next decade, making euro-denominated assets more attractive. 'One reason is that we expect a stronger growth in Germany to spread to neighboring countries,' wrote Sven Jari Stehn, chief economist for Europe at Goldman Sachs Research. The current strength of the euro is a blessing for consumers and businesses, who can buy US-made products at lower prices. Tourism to the US from Europe has also become cheaper, while dollar-denominated commodities like oil and gas have become more affordable. While some currency operators predict that the euro could continue to strengthen against the dollar before the end of the year, most major investment banks expect it to remain around its current level.

**Euro Reaches Highest Point Since 2022 as US Dollar Declines**
The US dollar is experiencing a sharp decline against major currencies, reaching its lowest point since 2024. The decline is attributed to the White House's decision on tariffs and uncertainty surrounding the US economic growth. In contrast, the euro has risen to 1.1282 against the dollar, an increase of 0.8% and reaching its highest point since the beginning of 2022, with a previous high of 1.1376 in the previous night. The British pound has also strengthened against the dollar, reaching 1.3015, an increase of 0.3%, and the Swiss franc has risen to 1.2202, an increase of 0.6% and reaching its highest historical point. 'The euro has reached its highest point since 2022, a sign of the dollar's weakness,' said no one in the article, but the data suggests a strong euro and a weak dollar.

**Euro Remains Above $1.08 as US Consumer Sentiment Deteriorates**
The Euro remained above $1.08 in US trading on Friday. About an hour before the stock market close on Wall Street, the currency was traded at $1.0826. The European Central Bank (ECB) set the reference rate at $1.0797 (Thursday: $1.0785). The dollar was worth 0.9262 (0.9272) euros. US consumer sentiment has deteriorated in March due to growing inflation concerns. According to a second estimate, the indicator fell to its lowest level since November 2022. Consumer expectations declined significantly, with the drop being even more pronounced than in the initial estimate. Additionally, the assessment of the current situation also worsened. 'Supporters of all political parties and independents expressed worse expectations regarding their personal finances, business conditions, unemployment, and inflation compared to February,' said Joanne Hsu, head of the survey on the University of Michigan's consumer climate, in a statement. Furthermore, inflation expectations among consumers rose more than initially reported. The core rate of personal consumption expenditures, which is closely watched by the US Federal Reserve, increased from 2.7% in January to 2.8% in February. Experts had expected a value of 2.7% for the previous month. The so-called PCE core deflator is an important indicator of price development, in which the volatile prices for energy and food are excluded. The Fed aims for a rate of 2.0%.

**Euro Falls to 1.0824 US Dollars**
The Euro fell on Monday, with the European Central Bank setting the reference rate at 1.0824 US dollars (Friday: 1.0827). This means that 1 US dollar is equivalent to 0.9238 (0.9236) euros. The Euro has experienced a significant decline, and its value continues to drop. As ECB officials have not made any statements regarding the current state of the Euro, it remains unclear what the future holds for the currency. However, the decline of the Euro is a cause for concern, and its value may continue to fluctuate in the coming days.

**Ukrainians Advised to Keep Savings in Dollars, Not Euros**
Economist Oleksiy Gerashchenko believes that in the short term, the US dollar is a more attractive currency for savings than the euro. He notes that the dollar has a stronger potential for appreciation, making it a more reliable and profitable option. However, Gerashchenko emphasizes that long-term planning is impossible at this time due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of current events. 'Practical conclusions are that in the short term, the dollar-euro pair wins for savings. And medium-term planning is currently impossible, because the picture is constantly changing, and it's not worth trying to guess the distant future, only follow the current dynamics and form short-term forecasts,' Gerashchenko said. According to Gerashchenko, the American conservative agenda outlined in Project-2025 would lead to significant changes in the country's economic policy, including a strengthening of the dollar. He predicts that in the short term, the dollar will appreciate against the euro, potentially reaching parity by the end of the year. 'In the short term, the dollar will strengthen relative to the euro. The euro cost 1.1 dollars in September, now it's 1.05... I think it will be a parity of 1:1 this year. Maybe the dollar will cost more than the euro this year,' Gerashchenko concluded.

**Dollar Seen as More Attractive Currency for Savings than Euro in Short Term**
According to economist Alexei Gerashchenko, in the short term, the dollar is a more attractive currency for savings than the euro. This is because the US dollar has prospects for strengthening, making it a more reliable and profitable currency than the euro. However, Gerashchenko notes that long-term planning is impossible due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of current events. 'Pragmatic conclusions are that in the short term, the dollar wins in the pair dollar-euro as a currency for savings. And there is no medium-term planning now, because the picture will change all the time, and it's not even worth trying to guess the distant future, only to follow the current dynamics and form short-term forecasts,' Gerashchenko said. The American conservative agenda, as described in Project-2025, aims to make significant changes to the country's economic policy. This, according to Gerashchenko, will lead to the strengthening of the dollar. 'In the short term, the dollar will strengthen against the euro. The euro was worth 1.1 dollars in September, now 1.05... I think there will be parity at 1:1 this year. Possibly, the dollar will be worth more than the euro already this year,' Gerashchenko concluded. According to OBOZ.UA, the exchange rate of the US dollar in banks will be between 41.6-42.3 UAH from February 24 to March 2.

**Dollar May Surpass Euro: Expert Reveals When This Will Happen**
According to economist Alexey Gerashchenko, the US economic policy outlined in Project-2025 could significantly impact the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro. The expert notes that the US has taken a course on re-industrialization, economic confrontation with China, and protection of the domestic market. 'If the US uses various administrative-tariff measures to move towards the set goal, it means that the conditional European BMW sells fewer cars in the US, accordingly receives fewer dollars, which in smaller quantities enter the market for exchange for euros,' Gerashchenko explains. Currently, the dynamics of the currency market already reflect these trends. If in September the euro was worth $1.1, now its value has decreased to $1.05. The analyst believes that this year, parity between the two currencies can be achieved, and in some periods, the dollar may even be worth more than the euro. However, the expert warns against making long-term predictions. A strong dollar may complicate American exports, leading to new trade conflicts. Additionally, other countries, especially those whose business is oriented towards the American market, may take protective measures, potentially escalating into a large-scale trade war. Gerashchenko emphasizes that such a policy corresponds to the general trend of deglobalization and weakening of the influence of international institutions. In the short term, the dollar looks more attractive for savings, but medium-term planning is currently complicated due to constant changes in the economic situation.'

**Euro Falls Against US Dollar Amid US Trade Policy Uncertainty**
The Euro has fallen against the US Dollar, trading at 1.0428 US Dollars on Tuesday afternoon. This decline is attributed to recent statements from the US government on potential future trade policies, which have boosted the Dollar.

ECB data shows that the Euro is worth 0.83868 British Pounds, 161.86 Japanese Yen, and 0.9441 Swiss Francs. The price of gold has risen to 2,756 Dollars per ounce, up 16 Dollars from the previous day. According to Helaba, new statements from President Donald Trump on trade policies have given the Dollar a boost.
