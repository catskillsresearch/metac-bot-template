**What Is an LLM, Really ?**
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model trained to understand and generate human language. It is 'large' due to its billions of parameters and massive training on text data, including books, articles, code, and conversations. LLMs are trained using self-supervised learning, where the model predicts missing or next words in datasets without manual labeling. The models are optimized using cross-entropy loss, adjusting internal weights to minimize loss across sequences.

**The Madrid Book Fair Looks to New York: Ten Novels About the Big Apple**
The 84th edition of the Madrid Book Fair is focusing on the city of New York, a cosmopolitan metropolis with multiple facets. According to Eva Orúe, the fair's director, 'the New York that speaks in Spanish' is one of the city's most notable aspects. The fair features 365 stalls in the Retiro's Paseo de Coches, where visitors can meet authors, buy books, and attend conferences with renowned writers such as Ana María Matute, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Paul Auster. This year's novelty is an Ibero-American pavilion, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, aimed at 'consolidating' the fair as a meeting point for the Spanish-language publishing sector. Notably, nearly a third of New York's residents have Spanish as their native language, and several Spanish-language authors from the city will participate in the fair, including Eduardo Lago, Kirmen Uribe, Claudia Salazar, and others. To kick off the event, we highlight ten books set in the Big Apple.

**Invasive Species ChatGPT On Track to Take Over by 2030**
According to the article, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are on track to take over by 2030. The author notes that LLMs have already begun to replace lower-level jobs and are now threatening higher-paying dream jobs. Companies are adopting AI-first hiring practices, outsourcing tasks to cheaper alternatives. The author suggests that LLMs have become so advanced that they can mimic human behavior by analyzing responses and prompts. As one might say, 'the Terminator results could come so soon.'

The NYT list includes novels such as 'Flashlight' by Susan Choi and 'King of Ashes' by S.A. Cosby, as well as nonfiction titles like 'How to Lose Your Mother' by Molly Jong-Fast. Goodreads has also compiled a list of 135 LGBTQ+ fiction, nonfiction, and YA books. Additionally, a group of library patrons in Texas sued over the removal of books from a public library, with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that library books are government speech and not subject to the Free Speech clause. Furthermore, readers discovered an AI prompt in a novel, highlighting the growing use of AI in publishing. Finally, Book Riot's editorial staff curated a list of 50 of the best beach reads of all time for summer reading. 'It's the human touch and unique perspectives I and others are questing for, not an AI masquerade,' said S. Zainab Williams, Executive Director of Content at Book Riot.

**Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 6 Months, Scientists Suggest**
A recent analysis of predictions from 8,590 scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts suggests that the singularity, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence, could occur within the next 6 months, according to the CEO of Anthropic. However, most experts agree that artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive before the end of the 21st century. The analysis, conducted by AIMultiple, found that the timeline for AGI has changed significantly with the arrival of large language models (LLMs), with some predicting it around 2040 and others around 2030. Experts believe that AGI is inevitable due to the idea that machine intelligence has no limits, and that computing power will continue to increase exponentially. However, not everyone agrees that AGI is a dead certainty, with some arguing that human intelligence is too multifaceted to be replicable. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun suggests that AGI should be rebranded to 'advanced machine intelligence,' and that AI can't make new discoveries on its own, but can aid in the process. 'More intelligence can lead to better-designed and managed experiments, enabling more discovery per experiment,' the report reads. 'Even the best machine analyzing existing data may not be able to find a cure for cancer.'

**The Current Perfection of LLMs  --  And Why That's Enough**
The author suggests that the current large language models (LLMs) are not a prototype, but the real thing, and that they have already achieved perfection. They cite an example of a child interacting with a language model, where the model adapts and responds in a way that is both sweet and curious. The author argues that these models are modular and can be embedded into systems, issuing precise instructions and managing context over time. They do not need to be improved, but rather recognized for their capabilities. The author concludes that the task before us is not to chase 'the next AI,' but to realize that the ideal structure already exists and that the safest and most powerful intelligence is already here. As the author states, 'Collapse must never proceed faster than understanding.'

**B.C. author claims AI company used his work without consent**
James Bernard MacKinnon, a B.C. author, is proposing a class-action lawsuit against San Francisco-based AI company Anthropic PBC, alleging it used his and other people's copyrighted work to train its computer system without consent. According to the claim, Anthropic used a dataset called Books3, which it downloaded from the internet without paying a licensing fee, to train its large language model (LLM). The claim asserts that MacKinnon's works, including a book he authored and another he co-authored, were included in the dataset without his permission. The lawsuit seeks damages, disgorgement of profits, punitive damages, and costs, and alleges that Anthropic's conduct was 'high-handed, arrogant, and displayed a reckless disregard for the rights of the class members.'

**Chicago Sun-Times Prints AI-Generated Summer Reading List With Books That Don't Exist**
The Chicago Sun-Times printed an AI-generated summer reading list for 2025 that included books that don't exist. This mistake is attributed to the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) that make incorrect calculations about word probability. According to Jeff O'Neal, CEO and co-founder of Book Riot, this is an embarrassment for the writer and a blow to the paper's credibility. O'Neal also discusses the trend of revising popular YA series for adult readers and the release of Jenna Bush-Hager's summer reading list for kids, 'Read With Jenna Jr 2025'.

**New Study Shows OpenAI Models 'Remember' Copyrighted Content**
A new study suggests that OpenAI's models 'remember' copyrighted content. The study, co-authored by researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Copenhagen, and Stanford, proposes a new method for identifying training data 'remembered' by models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. The researchers found that these models can reproduce screenshots from movies they were trained on and exhibit effective plagiarism in news articles. The study suggests that OpenAI's models may be 'remembering' copyrighted content, including parts of popular books and New York Times articles. Abhilaasha Ravichander, a University of Washington doctoral student and co-author of the study, said, 'To have large language models that are trustworthy, we need models that we can check, verify, and study from a scientific perspective.' The study aims to provide a tool for checking large language models, but there is a real need for greater transparency in the data used to train these models.
