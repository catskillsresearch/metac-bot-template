**EU Climate Advisors Warn of Weak Climate Goal for 2040**
The European Union's (EU) climate advisors are warning that a weak climate goal for 2040 will make it difficult for the EU to achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2050. The EU's climate goal for 2040 is currently being negotiated, and some powerful countries are pushing to lower the ambition level. Ottmar Edenhofer, chairman of the EU's climate council, says that a low goal will 'take the wind out of the transition' and make it difficult to reach the 2050 goal. The EU's climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, argues that flexibility is needed, including the possibility of buying climate credits from poor countries. However, this is seen as a watering down of the EU's climate goals. Jette Bredahl Jacobsen, a Danish economist and member of the EU's climate council, warns that buying climate credits will make the transition more expensive and inefficient. She also points out that the EU has a historical responsibility for climate pollution and should not lower its ambitions. The use of climate credits has also been criticized for being unreliable and even fraudulent. The EU has previously allowed companies to buy climate credits from other countries, but this has caused problems. The UN is currently working on a new set of rules to address these issues. Minister Lars Aagaard (M) wants the EU to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 90% in 2040, but will not comment on whether foreign credits should be included.

**EU Experts Call for Ambitious Climate Goal of 90-95% Emissions Reduction by 2040**
The European Climate Advisory Council recommends reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 90-95% by 2040, which would also benefit the economy and energy security, according to the experts. The council has reiterated its call for an ambitious climate goal for 2040, which would keep the EU on a credible path to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. If the goal is set too low, it would undermine the EU's long-term competitiveness and energy security, especially in a time of geopolitical uncertainty, the experts warn. The EU currently aims to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990, and the Commission has concluded that this goal is achievable. The EU also aims to become climate-neutral by 2050, but a binding intermediate goal for 2040 is still missing. The Commission had recommended reducing net emissions by at least 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 in 2024, and a draft law is expected in early July. The EU member states and the European Parliament will then negotiate the proposal, which is expected to be contentious. Some in the European Parliament and among the EU member states consider 90% to be too ambitious, and the Commission is expected to introduce more flexibility to achieve the goal, such as recognizing carbon credits from non-EU countries. The Climate Advisory Council advises against international emissions credits, instead recommending that the reduction be achieved through domestic EU measures.

**Germany's Top General Warns of Potential Russian Attack on NATO by 2029**
German Chief of Staff, General Carsten Breuer, believes that Russia may attack NATO within the next four years. He stated in an interview with the BBC, published on June 1, that NATO members must prepare for a possible Russian attack by 2029 or even earlier. According to Breuer, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never encountered in his 40-year career. He noted that Russia is rapidly increasing its military capabilities, producing around 1,500 main battle tanks per year and 4 million 152mm shells in 2024, not all of which were sent to Ukraine. Some of the military equipment is being stored in warehouses, awaiting a potential attack on the West. 'There is an intention and a buildup of reserves' for a possible future attack on Baltic states, he said. 'We must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it won't happen before 2029, I would say no, it's not. So we must be able to fight tonight,' Breuer said. He highlighted the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable areas. General Breuer asserts that NATO members must again increase their military forces. He added that it will take years for the European military-industrial base to ramp up to match the scale of Russia's military production.

**EU on Track to Meet 55% Emissions Reduction Goal by 2030**
The European Union is close to achieving its ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. According to the European Commission, the current reduction is at 54%, which is a promising result. This is a significant achievement, especially considering that the EU is one of the regions that is warming the fastest. The consequences of climate change are already being felt, with extreme heatwaves, frequent floods, and wildfires becoming a regular occurrence. However, there is a sense of hope, as many EU member states have taken concrete steps to accelerate the energy transition. The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, and in 2023, there was an additional 8% reduction. Some countries, such as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, are still lagging behind in defining their plans, while others are pushing for a slower pace on environmental regulations due to geopolitical tensions, energy price increases, and protectionism. The European Commission, however, remains committed to its goal and is now aiming for a 90% reduction in emissions by 2040, with some flexibility in the tools used, such as carbon credits.

**Belarus Moves Joint Military Exercises with Russia Deeper into the Country**
Belarus has announced that it will move the joint military exercises with Russia, 'Zakhid-2025', deeper into the country, away from the western borders. This suggests that Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has received several signals. According to Pavel Latushko, the deputy head of the United Transitional Cabinet of Belarus and head of the People's Anti-Crisis Management, Lukashenko asked Vladimir Putin to move the exercises after receiving these signals. This scenario is also beneficial for the Kremlin. Latushko stated that the joint military exercises previously posed a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland. As for Ukraine, even President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that Russia was 'preparing something' in Belarus. Latushko believes that there are several reasons for moving the main stages of the 'Zakhid-2025' exercises deeper into the country: 'Lukashenko received these signals. I am sure that he crawled on his knees to Putin and started begging him not to do this,' he emphasized. Latushko also noted that there is a certain game being played here - Russia does not want to stop the war in Ukraine, but in Belarus, it shows that it is withdrawing its troops from Europe. 'Here, there is a call for peace, and there - for war,' he said. Meanwhile, the head of the Institute of World Policy, Viktor Shlinchak, expressed the opinion that it was Putin who was hinted to move the exercises to Belarus. It is likely that this was done by the Americans.

**NATO Faces 'Very Serious Threat' from Russia, Says German General**
According to General Carsten Breuer, the inspector general of the German Bundeswehr, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never seen in his 40 years of service. Russia is increasing its military forces 'on a massive scale', producing around 1,500 main battle tanks annually. Not all of these tanks are sent to the front for the war in Ukraine, but remain in storage and in new military structures always oriented towards the West, said Breuer. Russia has also produced 4.152 million 152mm artillery shells in 2024, and not all of them have gone to war against Ukraine. Breuer stated that Russia is 'intentional' and 'stockpiling' for a possible future attack on Baltic countries. 'This is an assessment of analysts - (the attack may occur in 2029 - 24 Kanal) in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029, I would say no, it is not. Therefore, we must be able to fight today,' said Breuer. The minister named the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable points for an aggressor's attack. 'The Baltic countries are indeed very vulnerable to the Russians, are they not? And as soon as you're there, you really feel it... in the negotiations we're conducting there,' said Breuer. According to him, Estonians compare a possible war to being near a forest fire, where they 'feel the heat, see the flames, and smell the smoke', while in Germany 'it's probably just a little smoke on the horizon, and no more.' General Breuer said that this demonstrates different views among European states on the threat of a possible Russian attack.

**EU Adopts White Book of Security: A New Era for European Defense?**
European politicians have adopted the White Book of Security, which includes two sections on cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, including the creation of a joint military-industrial complex and the accumulation of 800 billion euros by 2030 for defense purposes. However, according to political scientist Oleksiy Buriachenko, the EU's bureaucratic nature is a significant obstacle. Buriachenko noted that the EU was not created as a security union, but rather as an economically horizontal confederation. He emphasized that the EU should not try to solve all of Ukraine's security and arms supply issues, as this is not its purpose. Instead, the EU should focus on its own security, which should be guaranteed by the US through NATO. Buriachenko believes that the EU has finally realized that a reset in relations with the US is inevitable. He warned that the EU's attempt to scale up arms production will require significant state orders, which may come at the expense of other programs, such as migrant support or social welfare. 'This is money that needs to be taken from somewhere,' Buriachenko said. 'For example, from programs supporting migrants, social or humanitarian spheres. If this is done, right-wing and ultra-right forces will immediately start playing on the fact that Russia is not their threat.' Buriachenko emphasized that Ukraine and Europe need to find a common system of coordinates and come to a realization that only together can they guarantee their own security without a third player. He suggested that the 'Coalition of the Willing' format, which includes countries such as the UK, Norway, and Turkey, could become a united Europe, and NATO could transform into the EU's army.

**Additional Opportunities for Economic Growth: Belarus Seeks Russian Expertise**
Belarus is currently developing programs for the next five-year period and a National Strategy for Sustainable Development until 2040. Belarus is interested in cooperation with Russian experts, including their ideas, research, and assessments of the current state of the Belarusian economy. The main task is to find new points of growth, and the meeting aims to develop strategic proposals and scientifically grounded ideas that can serve as the basis for Belarus' economic policy in the new five-year period, as stated by Turchin. 'We are interested in your ideas, research, and how you evaluate the current state of our economy, our strengths and weaknesses,' Turchin said. 'Therefore, finding new growth points is our top priority.'

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Ahead for 2040**
The European Union is on track to meet its 2030 climate goals, according to the European Commission. The EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 1990, and is expected to reach a 54% reduction by 2030, close to the 55% target. However, the Commission notes that there are disparities between member states and difficulties in protecting forests and sequestering carbon. The EU executive also highlights that most member states have aligned with its goal of reaching 42.5% of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Despite this progress, the Commission faces challenges in agreeing on the intermediate step of 2040, with some member states questioning the feasibility of a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2040. The Commission promises to submit a proposal before the summer and assures that the EU will be ready for the next UN climate conference (COP30) in November. However, this delay has raised concerns among environmentalists, who had hoped for a stronger European mobilization after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under Donald Trump. 'We must now build on this momentum,' said the Commission. 'It's a decisive moment: every sector, in every member state, must contribute,' added the Commission. 'Our forests' weakness, a consequence of their deterioration, is alarming and must be addressed as soon as possible,' the Commission warned. 'Good news,' said the executive, 'but we must act without delay to make our energy mix 'decarbonized'.'

**European Parliament's Tariff Proposal on Fertilizers Sparks Concerns for European Farmers**
The European Parliament's Committee on International Trade has approved a proposal to impose tariffs on fertilizers from Russia and Belarus, which will increase the cost of production for European farmers. The tariffs will be 6.5% and will also include a surcharge of between 40 and 45 euros per tonne between 2025 and 2026, which could increase to 350-430 euros per tonne by 2028. The European Parliament claims that the tariffs are necessary to prevent Russia from using the revenue from fertilizer exports to fund its war against Ukraine. However, the agricultural sector is concerned that the tariffs will have devastating effects on their businesses. COPA and COGECA, two European agricultural organizations, have expressed their deep disappointment with the decision, stating that the tariffs will increase the costs of production and reduce the competitiveness of European farmers. They also criticize the lack of alternative solutions and the absence of an adequate impact assessment. The organizations urge the European Parliament to reconsider the proposal during the next plenary session. The director general of Interporc, Alberto Herranz, has stated that the Spanish pork sector is prepared to face uncertainty, but the real concern is the indirect effects of the tariffs, such as the dependence on a single market and the risk of being trapped in bilateral tensions. He emphasizes the need for market diversification, which is a strategic necessity for the sector. Fernando Burgaz, president of the Fundación Foro Agrario, has also stated that this moment should be seen as an opportunity to seek new markets and diversify existing ones.

**EU Expansion: Costa Says Countries Can Join Before 2030 if They Implement Reforms**
According to European Council President Antonio Costa, the stability and prosperity of Europe depend directly on the expansion of the EU. He stated this before his diplomatic tour to six Balkan countries, which are candidates for EU membership. Costa emphasized that his mission in the Western Balkans is to ensure that Brussels maintains strategic control over the region. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the accession process for Ukraine and Moldova, but this is unfair to Western Balkan countries, which should therefore speed up their reforms, Costa explained. European institutions have previously mentioned 2030 as the target date for the accession of countries such as Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia. However, now in Brussels, they only mention Albania and Montenegro. 'I don't have a fixed date. Why 2030? And why not earlier? Accession is a merit-based process. If countries implement reforms, they can join even before 2030,' Costa concluded. Additionally, it was recently announced that the EU plans to provide Ukraine with an additional 900 million euros for the purchase of arms and ammunition. The funds will be allocated from the profits obtained from frozen Russian assets under EU jurisdiction, as per Costa.

**Belarusian Ambassador Justifies Placement of Russian Tactical Nuclear Weapons**
Belarusian Ambassador to Switzerland Alexander Ganichev stated that the placement of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus is justified in the face of European Union militarization. 'Unfortunately, at this stage, the EU has chosen the path of further militarization instead of cooperation. In this context, Belarus' concerns about the buildup of military contingents, additional forces and means along the Belarusian border, and the intention of our neighboring countries to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines are justified. In such a situation, the Belarusian leadership made an absolutely justified decision to create additional deterrent elements in the form of placing tactical nuclear weapons and modern hypersonic ballistic missile systems of Russian production on the territory of the republic,' he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in March 2024 that Moscow and Minsk had agreed to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Putin emphasized that Russia would not violate international obligations and would do the same as the US has done for decades, placing its tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. In June, Putin reported that the first nuclear charges had been delivered to Belarus in accordance with the Belarusian-Russian plans, and the plans would be fully implemented by the end of the year. The European Commission presented a new defense strategy 'Rearming Europe' on March 19, which provides for the allocation of around 800 billion euros over the next four years to strengthen the defense of EU countries and arm Ukraine. The name of the strategy was later changed to 'Readiness 2030' due to protests from several EU countries. The 'Readiness 2030' strategy provides for the allocation of around 800 billion euros over four years. A significant portion of the funds will be attracted from the budgets of European states (around 650 billion), while 150 billion will be used in the form of loans. The European Commission will provide budgetary relief to EU countries and redirect funds intended for regional development to military expenses. 'Readiness 2030' provides for an increase in the defense spending of EU countries by 1.5% of GDP. In recent years, Russia has noted an unprecedented activity of NATO at the western borders. The alliance is expanding its initiatives and calls it 'containment of Russian aggression.' Moscow has repeatedly expressed concern about the buildup of NATO forces in Europe. The Russian Foreign Ministry has stated that Moscow remains open to dialogue with NATO, but on an equal basis, and the West must abandon the course of militarization of the continent.

**Kubilius believes Russia could challenge NATO before 2030**
European Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius believes that Russia could challenge the collective defense commitment of NATO before 2030, according to a speech he gave to the Lithuanian Parliament. Kubilius presented the 'White Book on European Defense / Preparation 2030' to the Parliament in Vilna, which was published by the European Commission this month. The idea that Russia could challenge NATO before 2030 reflects the White Book's view that Moscow poses 'a significant strategic threat on the battlefield', which has forced Europe to face 'a high-intensity war on the European continent at a level not seen since 1945'. Kubilius admitted that 'it seems that the general trend is that the US will focus mainly on China and ensuring security in its continent'. As a result, European countries must consider that 'the presence of the US in terms of defense could decrease over time', so it is necessary to assume 'complete responsibility' for their own defense. Kubilius emphasized that the White Book urges all member countries to increase defense spending and improve transnational coordination of the defense industry, and noted that the Baltic states, which border Russia and Belarus, have already taken significant measures in this regard. 'I want to congratulate the Lithuanian government and welcome their decision to reach 5% of GDP in defense by 2026. Because this shows that Lithuania understands the situation very well. And in this regard, Lithuania acts as an example of how to react to the situation,' he said. Kubilius also emphasized that supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia and the future integration of Ukraine's defense industry with the European one are fundamental parts of the White Book. 'It is important that the White Book on European defense includes the defense of Ukraine as part of European defense,' he said, and called for measures to sharply increase European defense spending and the capacity of its industry in this sector. 'We cannot work slowly to increase our capabilities slowly. On the contrary, we need large increases and systematic support,' he stated to the Lithuanian deputies.

**EU Considers Russia a 'Fundamental Threat' to European Security**
The European Union considers Russia a 'fundamental threat' to European security, citing its aggressive nuclear posture and plans to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus. This is stated in the EU's White Paper on European Defense Readiness for the period up to 2030. The document, published on March 19 in Brussels, notes that Russia uses a 'network of systemic instability', including close cooperation with other authoritarian states. Moscow is constantly 'fueling tension and instability' in neighboring countries, including Western Balkan states, Georgia, Moldova, and Armenia, and is exerting growing destabilizing influence in Africa, the document emphasizes. 'If Russia is allowed to achieve its goals in Ukraine, its territorial ambitions will spread further,' the EU believes. The EU expects Russia's defense spending to exceed that of EU member states in 2025, in terms of purchasing power parity. The Russian military is seen as a 'serious strategic threat on the battlefield', the White Paper states. Russia's economy is now primarily focused on achieving military goals, relying on industrial mobilization and technological innovation, the document notes. In contrast, European defense spending is significantly lower than that of the US, and even lower than that of Russia or China, the EU is concerned. A major overhaul of European defense will require significant public and private investments over a long period, the EU concludes. The White Paper is seen as a step towards creating a European Defense Union, which is considered an integrative and step-by-step process. The EU has allocated around €800 billion for European rearmament, with €650 billion to be raised through new debt from individual EU member states, rather than joint borrowing, and the remaining €150 billion to be provided through budget-backed loans.

**Sergey Rachkov Discusses Ukraine Conflict and International Relations on 'PRO Army' Project**
Sergey Rachkov, chairman of the Permanent Commission of the House of Representatives of the National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus on International Affairs, will be a guest on the 'PRO Army' project on 'SB TV' at 12:00. Rachkov will discuss whether negotiations between Russia and the US will lead to peace, and why the desire to resolve the conflict in Ukraine has become a reason for discord in the West. He will also explain if there is a double bottom in the policy and peaceful agenda of Donald Trump, and why the US is 'peace' so far from it. Additionally, he will comment on the current situation in the European Union, explaining why Brussels, Warsaw, and Vilnius are so insistent on military escalation with Russia and Belarus, and what is behind the postponement of the EU's readiness to go to war from 2044 to 2030. The program will also discuss the Middle East, which has 'hidden' behind the Ukrainian conflict, and how Belarus' policy and international position are evaluated in the world today.

**Ukraine to Join EU Before 2030 if it Maintains Current Pace, Says von der Leyen**
Ursula von der Leyen stated that if Ukraine continues at the same pace, it will join the European Union before 2030.

Von der Leyen noted that if a specific date for Ukraine's EU entry is set, other candidate countries may request the same. 'If Ukraine continues at the same pace, it will join the EU even before 2030. So let's keep working, maintain that pace,' she said.

**EU President von der Leyen: Ukraine may join EU before 2030 if it continues to implement reforms**
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that if Ukraine continues to implement reforms at its current pace and quality, it may become an EU member before 2030. She praised the initiative of Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, calling it 'a very noble initiative, showing great political will and remarkable support'. Von der Leyen emphasized that the process of joining the EU always considers achievements and merits. 'It means having certain conditions and reforms that you must fulfill. You must implement them. Therefore, the conditions for accession must be correct and proper for both the European Union and the country joining. This is always necessary,' she noted. However, she warned that if a specific date for accession is set, other candidate countries will immediately ask for a similar date and will not consider the process. 'But I truly value the existing political will. I would even say that the process based on Ukraine's merits - if they [Ukrainians] continue at the same speed and quality, it may happen to them before 2030,' she said. Von der Leyen also thanked for 'providing a boost' and called for continued hard work from all sides: 'We need to maintain the dynamics.' European Council President Antonio Costa added that Ukraine's accession to the EU would be the most important guarantee of security for Ukraine's future. 'We have already decided that this new institutional cycle [the 2024-2029 period, - UNIAN] will be an expansion cycle for Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans, and we do not know how it will be with Georgia,' he said. He confirmed that this process takes into account the achievements of candidate countries. 'We are working hard from the European Commission to various candidate countries. And it is very impressive what Ukraine is doing,' he added. Costa believes that Ukraine is writing a new manual on how to implement reforms during a war. 'It's hard to imagine, but 'we are very motivated,' he said. He is confident that various EU member states, the European Commission on one side and Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkan countries on the other are working very hard to show results for this expansion.

**Petrishenko: We Will Prepare the Eurasian Economic Forum with Successful Experience in Mind**
Belarusian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Petrishenko met with the member of the Board (Minister) for Competition and Antimonopoly Regulation of the Eurasian Economic Commission, Maxim Yermolovich, to discuss the preparation for the Eurasian Economic Forum, which will take place in Minsk this year. Igor Petrishenko reminded that Belarus will chair the Eurasian Economic Union in 2025: 'In the address of the President of Belarus to the heads of state of the EAEU, the priorities of our work are clearly outlined, related to the development of industrial cooperation, scientific and technical aspects of the implementation of joint programs, energy issues (oil, gas, petroleum products markets), food sovereignty issues. It is also important to cooperate with friendly countries, international organizations, and organizations for the development of mutual trade.' Petrishenko noted that this year the implementation of the document defining the strategic directions of the development of Eurasian economic integration until 2025 will be completed. 'We need to summarize the results of this fundamental document and make a strong foundation for the implementation of the Declaration 'Eurasian Economic Way' until 2030 and up to 2045, so that our union develops, becomes strong, and people feel it,' emphasized Igor Petrishenko. This year's Eurasian Economic Forum will coincide with a number of important events, including the meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council, which Belarus will host as the chair of the EAEU. Additionally, the forum will coincide with an important date for the countries - the 80th anniversary of the Great Victory in the Great Patriotic War. 'Therefore, the President of Belarus invited the heads of state of the EAEU to the forum in Minsk in December last year,' said Maxim Yermolovich. 'And now we, having worked out various options for the conduct of this forum, want to discuss what goals will be set at its conduct, what program will be, and what level of saturation of this event is planned.' Igor Petrishenko expressed hope that all members of the Board for Competition and Antimonopoly Regulation will actively participate in the preparation of the directions and issues for discussion on the further development of Eurasian integration within the framework of panel discussions. 'We already have some experience, gained in other countries. I think, taking into account these successful practices, we will work smoothly on the preparation of the forum together with the college and all interested parties. We are ready for discussion,' he noted. Maxim Yermolovich also touched on the issue of developing the EAEU market, emphasizing that the task now is to make it more open to participants. 'Initially, it was planned to implement the principle of four freedoms: free movement of goods, capital, labor, and services throughout the Eurasian space. Today, this space includes five countries: the Republic of Belarus, Armenia, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. Observers in our union are Cuba, Iran, and Uzbekistan. Our family is already quite large - over 180 million people in the union. That is, it is a big, capable market that is quite self-sufficient. And, in order to ensure the freedom of movement of capital, labor, goods, and services, it is a matter of transitioning to more in-depth industrial cooperation. That is, creating joint ventures, ensuring food security, technological sovereignty,' emphasized the member of the Board (Minister) for Competition and Antimonopoly Regulation of the EEC. According to him, the task now is to make the countries of the EAEU more industrially strong, technologically sovereign, ensure their citizens with affordable and high-quality food, and also the full volume of food production on the territory of the union.
