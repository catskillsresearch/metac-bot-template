**Tsai Ing-wen's Four-Point Strategy to Counter China's Threat**
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen stated that Taiwan must prepare for the worst-case scenario and make the best preparations in response to China's potential invasion in 2027. She emphasized that Taiwan's position is different from other countries as it directly faces China's threat. Tsai pointed out that Taiwan's defense strategy includes four pillars: strengthening national defense, enhancing economic resilience, cooperating with democratic allies to deter China, and engaging in peaceful dialogue with China if it treats Taiwan with dignity and respect. Tsai also mentioned that Taiwan has been a peaceful and friendly nation, and has contributed significantly to China's economic development through investments and entrepreneurship. She expressed hope that China will recognize Taiwan's existence and understand the Taiwanese people's desire for democracy, freedom, and human rights. Tsai stated that Taiwan's choice is clear: to defend democracy and sovereignty, and to protect the democratic and free system. She emphasized that Taiwan's decision is not about choosing between the US and China, but about choosing between democracy and authoritarianism.

**US Reevaluates Defense Priorities as China's Nuclear Expansion Exceeds Expectations**
The US is reevaluating its defense priorities as China's nuclear expansion exceeds expectations. According to Nikkei Asia, China has over 600 deployable nuclear warheads, far exceeding the US's previous estimate of 200. By 2030, China is expected to have over 1000 nuclear warheads. In this context, the 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) report, led by Deputy Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, is seen as a significant signal that the US will enter a 'single-line main battle' stage against China. Colby, who was a key figure in reshaping the 2018 NDS, has long advocated for breaking the US military's traditional 'two-war' preparation principle, arguing that the US must 'concentrate resources and win against China.' Taiwan is not considered a 'survival interest' by Colby, who stated that 'blocking China's regional hegemony' is a core US interest. However, this statement has drawn a clear line between strategic defense priorities and commitment boundaries. The US is expected to focus on winning against China, while regional allies will be responsible for their own defense, with the US providing support. This approach has raised concerns among allies, who worry that the US may be withdrawing its commitment to defend them.

**Taiwan Stock Market Expected to See Short-Term Bull Run**
The Taiwan stock market is expected to see a short-term bull run following the US-China trade war truce. The US and China have agreed to reduce tariffs, with China lowering its tariffs on the US from 125% to 10% and the US lowering its tariffs on China from 145% to 30%. This move is expected to lead to further tariff reductions in the future. As a result, the Taiwan stock market is expected to see a short-term bull run, with electronic stocks being a key focus. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) ADR rose 5.93% in the US market. The Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) index is expected to rise towards 22,000 points. The article suggests that investors should focus on electronic stocks that are currently undervalued and have a positive outlook, such as Xin Xing and Stabilis. Additionally, the article suggests that ASIC stocks are expected to perform well due to the increasing capital expenditure of CSP big manufacturers in 2025 and their efforts to reduce their dependence on Nvidia.

**Taiwan Crisis Looms: Historian Niall Ferguson Predicts a Major Confrontation**
Historian Niall Ferguson predicts that a Taiwan crisis will occur during Trump's presidency, as the US and China will face a fundamental tension over Taiwan. Ferguson believes that Trump's administration has three different strategies for dealing with Taiwan, but none of them will lead to a peaceful resolution. He warns that China will not use military force to invade Taiwan, but will instead use its naval vessels to blockade the Taiwan Strait and force the US to make a choice: to engage in a major naval battle or to surrender to China's demands. Ferguson also notes that Trump's trade policies have damaged the trust of the US's allies, making it difficult for the US to unite the world against China. He concludes that the US's global dominance is at risk, and that a 20% adjustment in the US stock market could have severe consequences.

**Taiwan Conducts First Live-Fire Test of HIMARS Rocket System**
Taiwan conducted its first live-fire test of the HIMARS rocket system on May 12, marking a significant milestone in the country's military modernization. The 11 initial HIMARS systems were purchased from the US in 2024, with the remaining 18 units to be delivered in 2026. The system, widely used by Ukraine in its defense against Russia, has proven to be highly effective. Taiwan's military has the potential to use HIMARS to target Chinese coastal areas in the event of a conflict, with a range of approximately 300 km. According to Reuters, the test was conducted at the Jupen test center on the island's Pacific coast, with a group of Taiwanese military personnel trained by the US. 'I believe this rocket launch demonstrates our military's determination to protect our country's security and defend our beautiful homeland,' said Taiwanese military officer Ho Shiang-I. The test comes as Taiwan's Ministry of Defense predicts a potential Chinese attack in 2027, and as the US publication The Hill suggests that China is sending troops to Ukraine to gain practical experience in modern warfare, with the aim of preparing for a potential invasion of Taiwan.

**Taiwan: A Country Caught in the Crossfire of Chinese Aggression**
Taiwan is considered one of the most dangerous places in the world due to the threat of a Chinese invasion. According to The Economist, China could attack Taiwan at any moment with a powerful military strike. However, despite this threat, Taiwan has not been invaded and it is unlikely that it will be in the near future. The situation remains unchanged, as concluded by The Economist in a recent editorial and analysis. The Chinese government has made it clear that war will be inevitable if Taiwan declares independence. Taiwan considers itself a sovereign country and a majority of its population wants to become a recognized independent republic. The country's current president, Lai Ching-te, belongs to the Progressive Democratic Party, which has been in power for three consecutive periods and sympathizes with the idea of secession. Taiwan relies on its impressive technological development, which makes China dependent on its high-tech electronic components. China wants Taiwan to surrender 'key in hand', like Hong Kong did, but Taiwan is not willing to accept this proposal. Meanwhile, China continues to militarily pressure Taiwan with provocative maneuvers and is closing the diplomatic blockade around the Taiwanese government, which is equally dangerous. The exclusion of Taiwan from the World Health Organization (WHO) is also a threat to the universal right to health for the Taiwanese people, as it prevents the sharing of Taiwan's advanced healthcare experiences and technology with the rest of the world.

**Taiwan Affairs Office Compiles Report on China's 2025 Unification Work**
The Taiwan Affairs Office of the Republic of China (ROTC) has compiled a report on China's 2025 unification work, which includes five key points proposed by Chinese National People's Congress Chairman Wang Huning. Wang emphasized the need to 'shape the inevitable trend of national reunification.' The report highlights China's efforts to promote unification, including the use of 'law to suppress separatism' and the establishment of a 'Taiwan independence' reporting system. China has also increased its military presence in the Taiwan Strait, with the Eastern Theater Command conducting joint exercises and deploying naval vessels to patrol the area. In addition, China has strengthened its economic ties with Taiwan, encouraging Taiwanese businesses to invest in China and promoting the development of the Taiwan region. The report also notes that China has urged other countries to respect its 'one China' policy and not to interfere in Taiwan's internal affairs. Wang Huning has stated that China will do its utmost to achieve peaceful reunification, but will not compromise on its sovereignty. 'We will not abandon our commitment to the 'one China' policy,' Wang said. 'We will not tolerate any external interference in Taiwan's internal affairs.'

**Taiwan's arms buildup shows shift to asymmetric defense strategy | Taiwan News | May. 11, 2025 16:07**
Taiwan is transitioning from a conventional defense strategy to an asymmetric one, focusing on mobile and cost-effective weapons systems to deter a potential Chinese invasion. The goal is to make China 'think twice before attacking,' or at least delay its forces long enough for Taiwan to secure US assistance. Taiwan's air defense arsenal includes domestically developed Sky Bow, land-based Sky Sword II, and Antelope missile systems, along with US-made Patriot and NASAMS. The country is also expanding its drone fleet with suicide UAVs such as the Chien Hsiang and plans to acquire more than 3,000 domestically made drones over the next five years. However, Taiwan faces major challenges, including a need to boost defense spending to 10% of GDP, which Premier Cho Jung-tai has deemed 'impossible.' Defense budget cuts proposed by the opposition have also hindered Taiwan's deterrence efforts, and the country struggles with military recruitment, with only 78% of positions filled by the end of 2023.

**China's Taiwan Invasion: Experts Warn of Devastating Global Consequences**
China is reportedly preparing for a potential invasion of Taiwan in 2025, with analysts predicting one of three possible scenarios: a full maritime blockade, massive rocket attacks and cyberattacks, or a rapid capture of Taipei. According to experts, a Chinese invasion could have devastating consequences for the global economy, particularly for the microchip market, where Taiwan is a world leader. A military conflict would also threaten regional stability in the Indo-Pacific and test the West's willingness to respond collectively. As one expert notes, 'even if China has not yet made a final decision, active strategic planning indicates the seriousness of its intentions.'

**Taiwan's war game to prepare for ‘worst case scenario’ amid invasion fears**
Taiwan has launched 14 days of war games to prepare for the 'worst case scenario' of a Chinese invasion. The war games, part of the annual Han Kuang series, will simulate a full-scale assault on the island and 'grey zone' activities, which are aggressive attacks just short of a full-scale invasion. Taiwan's Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo said the exercises are based on a hypothetical invasion by China in 2027. Institute for National Defense Security Research expert Su Tzu-yun said the purpose of the drills is to assess any shortcomings in Taiwan's readiness for war. The war games come amid fears that China will invade the island as it assembles vast numbers of warships, jets, and barges. China has also been conducting its own military drills, including satellite pictures showing the country's giant D-Day style invasion barges moored off the coast. 'When China is conducting naval and air patrols around Taiwan it normally deploys around six to ten warships,' said Tzu-yun. 'And if each of these were equipped with vertical launching systems, there could be about 500 land-attack cruise missiles ready to strike targets across Taiwan in just three minutes.' The war games will also feature new weapons acquired by Taiwan, including M1A2T tanks, HIMARS rocket systems, and land-based anti-ship missile systems. Taiwan's Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo said, 'This year’s exercises are based on a hypothetical invasion by China in 2027.' Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Ting-yu said that the public used to think that a strike by China would likely come in the form of a missile attack, but now it seems more likely to involve maritime militia vessels, sand dredgers, and drones. Tzu-yun warned that this kind of attack could be even more deadly. 'Taiwan has previously accused China of using generative AI to ramp up disinformation against Taiwan,' said the article. 'The island believes the Chinese leader is using the technology to 'divide' its population.' Beijing has already shown signs of preparations for a potential war, including intensive work in Chinese shipyards suggesting a massive amphibious assault. 'China is already engaged in what experts call a 'war of words' against Taiwan,' said the article. 'Read More on The US Sun'

**Former National Defense Director: China Won't Invade Taiwan in 2027**
Former National Defense Security Research Institute director Shen Ming-shih believes that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) will not invade Taiwan in 2027. Shen made this statement on a recent TV show, saying that the timing of a potential invasion is not fixed and can be adjusted. He pointed out that the US has a commitment to Taiwan's security, including the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances, which have been supported by both Democratic and Republican presidents. Shen also emphasized that the PLA's military capabilities are not yet strong enough to defeat the US, and that Taiwan's defense capabilities have been strengthened in recent years. He concluded that Taiwan does not need to worry too much about an invasion in 2027, citing the current economic and internal situation in China, as well as Taiwan's strategic environment. According to Shen, 'I don't think they will attack Taiwan in 2027.'

**China Completes War Plans for Invasion of Taiwan**
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, China has completed its war plans for an invasion of Taiwan. The report outlines a five-step scenario for a Taiwan war, including air attacks, establishing a blockade, and isolating Taiwan from the rest of the world. China is expected to deploy a large number of fighter jets, helicopters, and drones, and will likely begin with air attacks on Taiwan's military installations, ports, airports, and energy infrastructure. China's military capabilities include approximately 1,900 fighter jets and 500 bombers, as well as over 3,000 missiles. The report also states that China's submarines will lay sea mines off Taiwan's major ports to prevent trade ships from entering, and that Chinese cargo ships will be used to sabotage Taiwan's underwater cables. Taiwan is considered vulnerable to a blockade, as it relies heavily on imported energy (96% of its electricity comes from imported oil, coal, and natural gas) and 70% of its food is imported. China can take advantage of this by imposing new inspection rules for ships heading to Taiwan, allowing them to hold back energy resources and food. The report concludes that a war between China and Taiwan is likely to break out in 2027, with most experts predicting a Chinese victory.

**Drills to focus on invasion preparation - Taipei Times**
The Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense has announced that its Han Kuang exercises this year will focus on China's 'gray zone' tactics and the possibility of a Chinese invasion in 2027. Former US Navy admiral Philip Davidson predicted that China would attempt a Taiwan invasion by 2027, but China denied the claim. Despite this, countries have frequently referred to 2027 as the deadline when discussing military budgets and strategy. Taiwanese defense expert Su Tzu-yun said it was normal to use timelines as a reference for defense strategy. Chinese President Xi Jinping has told the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to 'be prepared for invasion' by 2027, but there has been no sign that a formal decision has been made to resort to force by then. US Air Force Strategic Commander General Anthony Cotton said China is accelerating its military expansion, especially in terms of dual-use shipyards and nuclear weapons launch platforms, which are part of plans to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027. Su said that think tanks have given different deadlines for an invasion, including 2035 and 2049, but the Han Kuang exercises' focus is understandably based on the assumption that China will attempt an invasion in 2027. 'It would form a perfect storm,' Su said, adding that the ministry's 'immediate response drills' that concluded last week followed the principle of risk control, which were aimed at deterring China from 'turning exercises into war.'

**China's Military Modernization and the Risk of Invasion of Taiwan**
According to the US Strategic Command, China's military is expanding at an unprecedented rate, and there are indications that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered the military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. However, some experts believe that China's military modernization will not be completed until 2035, making 2035 a more critical and dangerous time for Taiwan. The Chinese military's ability to invade Taiwan will depend on its ability to modernize and integrate its military forces, which will take at least 10 years. Even if China's military is able to invade Taiwan, it does not necessarily mean that it will do so. The current situation is complex, and it is difficult to predict what will happen. The US and other Western countries have expressed opposition to China's plans to invade Taiwan, and the international community is watching the situation closely.

**Taiwan's Defense Ministry Predicts Chinese Invasion in 2027**
Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has publicly stated that a Chinese invasion of the island is likely to occur in 2027. The ministry released a document outlining future military exercises, which simulate a Chinese attack, and included the date as a reference point. According to the ministry, the 'Han Kuang' exercises always set a timeframe of one to two years in the future to allow for the acquisition and training of new equipment. However, it is unclear how the inclusion of 2027 will affect the exercise program, or if the date is more of a political signal. China's President Xi Jinping has set a goal for the People's Liberation Army to become a 'modern force' by 2027 and a 'world-class force' by 2047. US officials stated last year that China is preparing to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, citing China's increase in fighter jets, warships, and doubling its stockpile of ballistic and cruise missiles since 2020.

**Still not confident enough: China isn’t likely to move on Taiwan in 2025**
Despite China's rapid military advancements, it is unlikely to use large-scale force against Taiwan in 2025. The Chinese leadership's concerns over military command quality, economic weakening, uncertain social stability, and the effects of the Trump administration will likely prevent any large-scale military maneuver. However, China will continue to apply pressure on Taiwan throughout 2025. China's military has improved significantly, with a growing navy, amphibious fleet, and aviation force. However, the Chinese leadership remains uncertain about the military's ability to conduct sophisticated urban warfare and long-distance logistics. Domestic factors, such as an aging population, low birth rates, rising violence, and a faltering economy, will also influence any decision to use military force. Beijing will likely want to carefully balance its actions to avoid damaging international relationships. According to the article, '2027 almost certainly remains a short-term goal for military modernisation, not a date for a Taiwan invasion.' The likelihood of large-scale use of force against Taiwan in 2025 remains low.

**China's Invasion Risk of Taiwan Rapidly Increasing, Report Warns**
A recent threat analysis report by Recorded Future's Insikt Group suggests that the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is rapidly increasing. Although a short-term invasion is unlikely, the report states that the risk will continue to rise from 2027 to 2049. The report highlights several factors that contribute to this assessment, including China's growing assertiveness, its efforts to improve its economic self-sufficiency, and its increasing military capabilities. The report also notes that Taiwan's political and social environment is trending towards a permanent rejection of unification. The report concludes that China may establish a certain level of preparation in military, economic, social, and other areas by 2027, allowing its leaders to consider a 'war of choice' against Taiwan. The report advises businesses that may be affected by a potential invasion to consider taking measures such as establishing relationships with alternative suppliers, purchasing war risk insurance, and conducting stress tests to identify operational and investment vulnerabilities. US and Taiwanese officials have stated that while a Chinese invasion is not imminent, the risk is increasing and that they are preparing for the possibility. The report notes that a Taiwanese invasion would likely have severe global economic consequences, disrupt critical transportation routes, and damage the semiconductor industry, with widespread costs for Taiwan, China, and the US. 'It is almost certain that Taiwan will be severely affected,' the report says. 'The impact will be felt globally, with critical transportation routes disrupted and the semiconductor industry severely damaged. The costs will be widespread, affecting Taiwan, China, and the US.'
