**Hamilton By-election Could Be Litmus Test for Scotland's Shifting Political Allegiances**
The upcoming by-election in Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse is expected to be a litmus test for Scotland's shifting political allegiances ahead of the 2026 Holyrood elections. The seat, previously held by the Scottish National Party (SNP), is being contested by the SNP, Labour, and Reform UK. Labour's 4.1-point gain in vote share in the 2021 Holyrood election has given the party a plausible chance of reclaiming the seat. The SNP's candidate, Katy Loudon, has pledged to defend public services and oppose austerity, while Reform's Ross Lambie is campaigning as a voice for disillusioned voters. Voter dissatisfaction with devolved SNP governance remains in key areas like health, education, and transport, and Reform has focused on systemic mismanagement by the political establishment. With days to go before ballots are cast, the campaign has become a test of shifting loyalties, voter frustration, and the future direction of Scottish politics. As Loudon said, 'Take the issue of rising energy bills: under Labour, pensioners are being hit hard with cuts to winter fuel payments. The SNP is committed to bringing these payments back, to help those most in need.' Meanwhile, Lambie stated, 'We don't need to spend years of debate and millions of taxpayers' cash on court cases to establish what a woman is. No we don't.'

**Will Reform rise in Scotland?**
Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, is expected to make significant gains in the upcoming by-election in Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse, Scotland. The party has been focusing its energy on these towns, which have traditionally voted for the SNP or Labour. Farage's visit to the area has sparked controversy, with Scottish Labour accusing him of 'sectarian politics' after a social media advert funded by Reform UK was branded 'racist'. The advert used a clip of Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar speaking at an event celebrating Pakistan's independence, with text saying 'Anas Sarwar will prioritise the Pakistani community'. Sarwar denied making this claim, and both Labour and the SNP have complained to Meta about the video. Farage has doubled down on his attacks, accusing Sarwar of 'sectarian politics'. The by-election is seen as a bellwether for the Scottish Parliament election next May, with Reform UK potentially splitting the unionist vote and pushing support for Scottish independence to 58%.

**'Reform UK could be about to unleash a storm on Scottish politics'**
The upcoming by-election in Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse is a crucial test for Labour, the SNP, and Reform UK. A Labour third-place finish would raise questions about their message, candidate selection, and ability to engage with working-class voters. A narrow SNP win would do little to alleviate fears of decline, while a loss could be seen as a symbol of fragmentation. Reform UK's victory would provide legitimacy and prove their appeal extends beyond English market towns. The by-election is a 'reconnaissance in force' that may shape strategies and national mood heading into the 2026 Scottish Parliament election.

**Is Starmer's failure putting the union at risk? Support for Scottish independence hits record 54% amid Reform surge - with fears Labour could come THIRD in Hamilton by-election this week | Daily Mail Online**
A recent poll by Norstat found that 54% of Scots support Scottish independence, the highest level ever recorded. This surge in support comes as Reform's popularity grows, with the party potentially surpassing the Tories in the Hamilton by-election. Labour's leader, Keir Starmer, is facing criticism for his handling of the situation, with Nigel Farage's Reform party gaining momentum. According to Opinium research, Starmer's personal ratings have hit a new low of -37. In contrast, Reform's popularity has increased, with 58% of Scots saying they would vote Yes in a second independence referendum if Farage were Prime Minister. Sir John Curtice, a polling expert, believes that the SNP will remain the largest party at Holyrood due to the unionist vote fracturing. John Swinney, the SNP's deputy leader, said that Labour is 'out of this contest' and that it is now a two-horse race between the SNP and Reform. 'I want to make sure that Farage's politics don't get any hold in Scotland, they are damaging,' he said. Mark Diffley, of pollsters Diffley Partnership, added that the rise of Reform represents an increasing threat to the Union.

**Scottish independence support surges over fears Nigel Farage could be next Prime Minister - Daily Record**
A recent poll by Norstat found that support for Scottish independence has surged to 54%, a joint record high, with 58% of Scots saying they would vote Yes in an independence referendum if Nigel Farage was already Prime Minister. The poll also found that Labour's popularity has dropped, with fewer than one in five Scots planning to vote Labour next May. The results could make it difficult for the SNP to achieve an IndyRef2 if a majority of MSPs reject their calls for an independence referendum. According to Mark Diffley, a pollster from Diffley Partnership, 'The prospect of Nigel Farage as PM would push support for independence close to the symbolically important 60 per cent.'

**Parties jockey for power in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election**
The by-election in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse will decide who represents the area in the Scottish Parliament following the death of SNP MSP Christina McKelvie. The outcome is significant, as it is the largest test of voter opinion in Scotland since the UK general election, where Labour heavily defeated the SNP. The by-election is also a chance to see if Reform UK's recent successes in England can translate to Scotland, which they call a 'tartan bounce'. The result will shape the political narrative in Scotland ahead of the national Holyrood election next May.

**By-election vote is now a fight for Scotlandâ€™s soul - Daily Record**
The by-election in Scotland has turned into a fight for the country's soul, with Reform UK's Nigel Farage making false claims that Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar wants to 'prioritise' Pakistani voters. Labour's candidate Davy Russell has been criticized for not participating in key debates, allowing Reform to spread their toxic rhetoric unchallenged. The SNP is now seen as the only party taking the fight to Reform, with First Minister John Swinney identifying them as a massive threat to Scotland. The top objective for voters should be to beat Farage and send a message that divisive politics is unacceptable. Labour supporters are feeling let down by the party's poor candidate choice, and some are considering voting for the SNP on June 5th to ensure Reform's defeat.

**Reform chief rules out IndyRef and claims party will be second biggest in Scotland - Daily Record**
Reform UK chief Richard Tice has ruled out another Scottish independence referendum, stating 'the answer is no, we don't need one. We're better off together.' He claimed that the Scottish Parliament elections next year will be a 'two horse race' and that Reform will be the second largest party in Holyrood. Tice also stated that his party will push for the removal of the ban on alcohol at football matches and on trains if they become the second largest party. He emphasized the importance of 'smart immigration' and claimed that the public are being misled about the need for migrant labor in Scotland, stating 'we're not short of people.' Tice also boasted about the efficiency savings made by Reform in their newly-acquired English councils, claiming they had identified 'almost a million pounds of efficiency saving' and blocked a 'daft project' worth Â£20m.

**John Swinney says Scottish independence will be 'central' to SNP 2026 election campaign - Daily Record**
John Swinney, the First Minister of Scotland, has stated that Scottish independence will be a central theme in the SNP's 2026 election campaign. He plans to use the next 12 months to argue that Scotland would be better off if it voted to end the Union. Swinney believes that the unpopularity of the UK Government among Scots and the rise of the Reform party have handed him a boost in his bid to remain in power. However, there remains uncertainty over how the Scottish Government can secure the right to hold a second referendum on independence, following their comprehensive defeat at the Supreme Court in 2022. Swinney aims to bring people together to show a 'clear and demonstrable' consensus among Scots for breaking away from the UK. He pointed to the 1997 referendum as an example of a 'demonstrable and clear' consensus of opinion that the country should have its own parliament. Lib Dem MSP Willie Rennie criticized Swinney's focus on independence, saying that it would 'waste more time arguing over independence' and that the Scottish Parliament should focus on delivering swift local access to healthcare, providing more support for teachers and pupils, and getting the economy growing again. 'The arguments for independence will be central to the SNP's election campaign for 2026 and that will run through many of the arguments I make in the course of the next 12 months,' Swinney said. 'What I want to do is bring Scotland together because Scotland is currently stuck, essentially because there's an aspiration in Scotland for us to have independence...but we have not got the means to achieve that because of the stances being taken by the United Kingdom government and I want to make sure is I bring people together sufficiently so there's a compelling voice for independence in Scotland,' he added. 'What I want to make sure is I lead the debate in Scotland in a way that brings people together to reach that conclusion that independence represents the best way forward for Scotland and that we should have the right to choose that,' he said. 'Here it is straight from the horse's mouth. John Swinney puts independence above action now on your job, your GP appointment or your children's education. Any vote for him will be taken as a vote to waste more time arguing over independence,' Rennie said. 'Scottish Liberal Democrats are clear that the purpose of the Scottish Parliament should be to deliver swift local access to healthcare, provide more support for teachers and pupils in classrooms and get the economy growing again. More of the same old arguments won't move this country forward,' he added.

**Rise of Reform set to split pro-Union vote, new poll reveals**
A new poll has revealed that Reform UK is on course to secure 21 seats at the next Holyrood elections, potentially splitting the pro-Union vote and leading to a pro-independence majority for the SNP and Greens. Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay has warned that this would be 'catastrophic' for Scotland and put independence 'back on the table'. He also claimed that Nigel Farage's Reform party would 'gladly gift the SNP another five years in power'. Findlay said, 'When I think about next year, my first thought is not what will happen to my party, it's what will happen to my country if Nigel Farage hands John Swinney another five years in power.' The Survation poll of 1,020 Scots puts the SNP ahead on the constituency vote with 33 per cent, followed by Reform and Labour in second place on 19 per cent.

**2026 Holyrood vote could deliver 'upsetÂ´ with rising support for...**
Pollsters have predicted that next year's Holyrood elections could 'deliver something of an upset' with rising support for Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. According to a poll by the Scottish Election Study, Reform UK is now tied in second place with Labour in the regional list vote, with 18% of voters planning to vote for the party. The SNP is 'firmly in the lead' in the constituency section of the ballot, with 33% of voters planning to vote for the party. Experts at the Scottish Election Study have found that Reform UK is attracting Scottish voters who were previously under-served by the political choices on offer, particularly among men and lower-class voters. However, Professor Ailsa Henderson of Edinburgh University noted that Reform UK's commitment to airing typically English grievances with the union and their unpopular leader in Scotland could act as future drags on support in Scotland.

**No independence referendum in next Holyrood term even if SNP wins, says Sarwar**
Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has stated that there will not be an independence referendum within the term of the next Holyrood parliament, even if the SNP wins again in 2026. Sarwar emphasized that the UK Government will not grant an independence referendum, and that Scottish Labour will focus on clearing NHS backlogs and addressing government waste. He also stated that the party will fight to 'win the trust of the people of Scotland' and win the election, while maintaining that independence is not supported by Labour. Sarwar said, 'We might ultimately disagree on the final destination for Scotland: I don't support an independence referendum, I don't support independence. That will be the position in our manifesto.'

**'Pro-UK, no ifs no buts': Reform rule out Scottish independence referendum**
Reform UK has ruled out supporting a Scottish independence referendum, contradicting earlier speculation that Nigel Farage might consider granting one. The speculation was sparked by a tweet from writer Neil Drysdale, who claimed an unnamed Reform supporter said Farage would promise a second independence referendum before the next election. However, Reform UK quickly stepped in to declare their support for the Union, attacking both the Scottish Tories and the blogger Wings Over Scotland. This is not the first time Reform's Unionist credentials have been questioned, as several candidates who stood for the party in last year's General Election confirmed they voted Yes in the 2014 referendum. Tory chairman Craig Hoy warned that even a few votes for Reform could elect an SNP MP by the back door, urging pro-Union voters to stay away from the party.

**Nicola Sturgeon: I am '100 per cent' sure I will live to see Scottish independence**
Nicola Sturgeon, the former First Minister of Scotland, has stated that she is '100 per cent' certain that Scotland will become independent in her lifetime. This claim comes despite her efforts to secure a second referendum ending in failure. Sturgeon has repeatedly expressed her conviction that Scotland will leave the Union, saying 'Sometimes things can feel really stuck, then suddenly they're not.' She has given similar answers in recent interviews, including one with the Financial Times, where she maintained that an independence referendum was 'off the radar' but still believed Scotland would become independent 'in our lifetimes.'
