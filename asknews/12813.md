**Neklynevsky District Hit by Heavy Weather, Over 50 Homes Flooded**
Heavy weather hit the Neklynevsky district, flooding over 50 homes. Due to the adverse weather conditions, a state of high alert was introduced in the area from June 1. Fortunately, according to preliminary information, no one was killed or injured in the incident. Water entered residential plots and courtyards, partially affecting outbuildings, and eyewitnesses reported that the water level reached knee-high on some streets. Rescue services immediately began working at the scene, conducting door-to-door checks to provide emergency assistance to residents and assess the damage. Authorities also organized water pumping from basements in response to three requests and planned to clear the territories of washed-out soil. While the Rostov region is preparing to get a 'fresh look' at its future by updating its development strategy to 2030, and society is concerned about reports of hazardous substances found in popular brands' products, regions often face more unexpected and acute challenges.

**Ryo Tatsuki's Predictions: A Tsunami in Japan and a New World Order**
Ryo Tatsuki, a 70-year-old Japanese manga artist, created a book called 'The Future I Saw' in 1999, which is a guide to his predictions. Although his manga was published in 1999, it wasn't until later that his predictions gained attention after several of them came true. For 2025, Tatsuki predicted a tsunami in Japan on July 5: 'A great earthquake accompanied by a tsunami of fire will ravage ancient cities, awakening ancestral fears.' He also predicted a natural disaster without precedent that will shake humanity, which he described as a tsunami and earthquake that will hit Japan on that day. According to his manga, a rift will open in the ocean floor between Japan and the Philippines, causing waves three times higher than the 2011 tsunami. Tatsuki's predictions have caused a massive cancellation of flights to Japan from the Asian region, with a 83% drop. He also predicted that in 2030, there will be 'a final judgment: a fusion of technology and spirituality that will open a new world order where the visible and invisible will mix, transforming our collective consciousness forever.'

**Countdown to 2030: Achieving global targets on disaster displacement**
A new report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) reveals that disasters triggered 264.8 million forced movements of people across 210 countries and territories between 2015 and 2024. In 2024 alone, disasters forced people to flee their homes nearly 45.8 million times, the highest annual figure on record. IDMC director Alexandra Bilak said, 'Disaster displacement is not a future problem. It's happening now, it's happening more often, and it can happen anywhere, although it is hitting the poorest the hardest.' The report highlights that while climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense, lack of preparedness, inadequate infrastructure, and high exposure to risks are also major factors in disaster displacement. The IDMC warns that displacement risk is likely to grow, with 100 million people globally at risk of internal displacement caused by disasters in any given year under a pessimistic warming scenario. Bilak added, 'Our window to act is closing. It's time to turn what we've learned from the data into political solutions and financial commitments.'

**Japanese Manga Artist's 2011 Prediction Comes True: A Devastating Earthquake and Tsunami in 2025?**
A Japanese manga artist named Ryo Tatsuki predicted a devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011, 12 years before it happened. His manga also predicted other events such as the death of Princess Diana and the COVID-19 pandemic. Tatsuki's latest prediction, made in 2011, was for a massive earthquake and tsunami to hit Japan in July 2025. Despite Japan's history of withstanding strong earthquakes, the country is on high alert for the predicted disaster. However, recent tourist numbers have been increasing, with 36.87 million international tourists visiting Japan in 2024, a record high since 1964. The country's economy is expected to benefit from tourism, with an estimated 291.5 billion USD contribution in 2024. However, experts warn that the predicted earthquake and tsunami could have a devastating impact on the country's economy and tourism industry.

**Elon Musk say it's '50/50' he'll land on Mars next year and he needs to 'get lucky' - Daily Star**
Elon Musk says there is a '50/50 chance' of landing a spaceship on Mars next year, and he needs to 'get lucky'. Despite recent test flight failures, Musk remains optimistic about progress towards establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. He believes reusable rockets will enable more than a million people to live on Mars within 30 years. Musk hopes to send 20 ships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with the goal of building a self-sufficient city that could survive even if cut off from Earth. He is scouting possible sites for a Mars city, with Arcadia Planitia being the leading candidate. Musk aims to fly 100 ships to Mars between 2030 and 2031 and 500 more in 2033. He said, 'This is, like, an incredible thing to have - this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet and a new world.'

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Trump's Cuts to USAID Will Cause 14 Million Deaths in Poor Countries by 2030**
A study by the ISGlobal institute estimates that the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration will cause 14 million deaths in poor countries by 2030, with a third of them being children under the age of five. The agency's programs have prevented 91.8 million deaths worldwide between 2001 and 2021, with a third of them being children under five. The study calculates that this year, 1.8 million deaths will be directly caused by the interruption of USAID programs, with 690,000 of them being children under five. If the Trump administration maintains the cuts to foreign aid programs, 2.5 million deaths will occur annually, resulting in a total of 14 million deaths by 2030. 'The situation on the ground is terrible. The problem has been the brutality of the cut, which was made without warning, without a transition period to adapt,' said Davide Rasella, researcher at ISGlobal. 'When the distribution of food to malnourished children is interrupted, unfortunately, they will die. Or when the antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in extreme poverty is interrupted.' Quique Bassat, director of ISGlobal, added, 'The image of the richest man in the world killing the poorest children in the world is not a pretty image.'

**Japanese 'Vanga' Predicts Catastrophe in Japan This Summer**
Japanese 'Vanga' Re Taitsuhi has predicted a major catastrophe in Japan this summer. Her predictions have come true 13 times before, including the Fukushima disaster. This time, she predicts a powerful earthquake and tsunami in July. Experts say that the Pacific Ring of Fire, which includes Japan, is a seismically active region with 328 active volcanoes. A marine geologist notes that underwater tremors and seismic activity can cause tsunamis and massive water displacement. The article also mentions the 1995 Neftogorsk disaster in Russia, where a massive earthquake killed over 2,100 people. Experts say that Japan has a risk of a similar disaster, and that the country's unique geography makes it prone to such events. 'Japan has a risk that part of the country may disappear into a crack,' says parapsychologist Elena Poretskaya. 'The Japanese predictor is connected to the subtle material for a long time, she feels the earth for a long time,' says parapsychologist and astrologer Viktor Bogdanov. 'There is no doubt that an earthquake will occur in Japan,' says Dr. Yuri Vinogradov, a scientist from the Russian Academy of Sciences. 'The end of the world is predicted for July 5th,' says Re Taitsuhi in her manga. 'Now there are many predictions about a major earthquake and catastrophe in Japan. Well, there's no hiding it. An earthquake in Japan will indeed occur,' says Dr. Vinogradov.

**The AI Tsunami Redefines Employment: What is the Real Labor Impact?**
According to the World Economic Forum's 'Future of Jobs 2025' report, by 2030, 92 million jobs will be destroyed and 170 million new ones will be created, resulting in a structural churn of approximately 22% of the 1.2 billion formal jobs analyzed, and a net increase of 78 million jobs. This means that in an environment of 100 jobs, 22 will change occupation or sector driven by technology, while the remaining 78 will retain their current functions. The report concludes that 59 out of 100 workers will need additional training by 2030 to remain relevant. The challenge for those who lose their jobs is significant, with some finding new opportunities in manual work or the informal economy, while others access upskilling programs to reposition themselves in technological or analytical areas. However, 11 out of those who require training will be at risk due to a lack of suitable conversion programs. This reality is particularly grave for recent university graduates, who face the paradox of an outdated educational offer compared to the pace of business innovation, leading to employment gaps and the chaining of temporary contracts or internships without a clear horizon. To address this scenario, the alliance between universities and companies becomes imperative, incorporating subjects like programming, AI ethics, data analysis, and soft skills into degree programs. The dual training model, where students alternate theoretical classes with corporate practices, could shorten the gap between what is learned and what is demanded by organizations. Governments have fundamental levers at their disposal: incentivizing continuous training through tax bonuses, sectoral conversion subsidies, and social protection networks that mitigate the impact of the transition. Without measures that ensure equal access to training and an economic safety net for those left out of the formal market, the adoption of AI risks exacerbating inequality and generating unprecedented social fragmentation.

**Japan Prepares for Potential Megathrust Earthquake in Nankai Trough**
Japan is analyzing the impact of a potential megathrust earthquake in the Nankai Trough, a region of high seismic activity. According to a recent report, it is estimated that 298,000 people could die in the event of a magnitude 8 or higher earthquake. This number is 10% lower than the previous estimate in 2012, due to efforts to mitigate the effects of a large-scale earthquake. The report projects that 12.3 million people, or 10% of Japan's population, would be evacuated, up from 9.5 million in the previous estimate. The earthquake would cause widespread destruction, with 764 municipalities in 31 prefectures experiencing tremors of at least 6 on the Japanese scale, and tsunami waves of at least 3 meters high. The economic losses would be estimated at 270 trillion yen (1.66 trillion euros), with 2.35 million buildings destroyed. The government is revising its disaster prevention plan to prioritize areas at risk of flooding and developing a new resilience plan for the 2026-2030 fiscal period, as said by the Japanese government, 'We will revise our disaster prevention plan to designate priority areas based on the risk of flooding and develop a new resilience plan for the 2026-2030 fiscal period.'

**Japan Warns of Potential 'Megaterremoto' in Nankai Trough**
Japanese authorities have warned of a potential 'megaterremoto' in the Nankai Trough, which could kill 300,000 people and cause widespread destruction along the southern coast of Japan. According to estimates, the 'Big One' could occur before 2050, with an 80% chance of a magnitude 9 earthquake, causing tsunami waves over 30 meters high. The Japanese government estimates that the disaster could result in losses of $1.66 trillion, with 9-12 million people needing to be evacuated and thousands of buildings destroyed. As Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said, 'regions will have only two minutes before the tsunami hits land.' The article also notes that Japan is particularly prone to earthquakes and tsunamis due to its location on multiple tectonic plates, and that the country has taken steps to prepare for such disasters, including advanced anti-seismic constructions and early warning systems.

**Baba Vanga's 2025 Prophecy Comes True: Humanity's Downfall to Begin This Year**
Baba Vanga's predictions for 2025 have come true. The Bulgarian mystic, who lost her sight in a childhood accident but gained the ability to see the future, predicted the downfall of humanity in 2025. According to Daily Mail, Vanga predicted several major world events, including the 9/11 attacks, Princess Diana's death, and China's rise to power, even after her death in 1996. Her other predictions for 2025 include a war in Europe that will reduce the continent's population and a global economic disaster. She also claimed that humanity's downfall will begin in 2025 and that the world will officially end in 5079, according to various reports. Recent earthquakes in Myanmar and Thailand, which had a magnitude of 7.7, have caused widespread panic and destruction, with thousands of people reported dead. Additionally, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the Pacific island nation of Tonga, prompting a tsunami warning. Baba Vanga's predictions for the future include: a devastating war in Europe in 2025 that will reduce the continent's population, humans discovering Venus as an energy source in 2028, the polar ice caps melting and sea levels rising in 2033, and humans abandoning Earth in 3797 because it will be uninhabitable.

**Japan Braces for Catastrophic Earthquake and Tsunami by 2043**
A recent Japanese government report warns of the devastating consequences of a powerful earthquake followed by tsunamis, which could cause up to 298,000 deaths and massive economic losses. According to the report, the estimated economic losses would be 1,800 billion euros, equivalent to nearly half of Japan's GDP. 'The Japanese government is already heavily indebted, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 250%. A disaster of this magnitude would require a significant increase in public spending, threatening the country's financial stability and potentially leading to a sharp decline in the value of the yen or increased inflation,' said Atsushi Takeda, an economist at the Itochu Research Institute. The report highlights the high probability of a major earthquake hitting Japan in the next 18 years, with an 80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake occurring by 2043.

**Up to 298,000 Could Die in Japan's Next Megathrust Earthquake, Authorities Warn**
Japanese authorities estimated that up to 298,000 people could die in the event of a megathrust earthquake in the Nankai Trough, one of the most seismically active areas in the world. This number, published in a report on Monday, is 10% lower than the previous estimate in 2012, due to Japan's efforts to mitigate the effects of a large-scale earthquake. The report also projected that the number of evacuees would increase from 9.5 million to 12.3 million, equivalent to 10% of Japan's population. A total of 764 municipalities in 31 of Japan's 47 prefectures would experience earthquakes with a magnitude of at least 6 on the Japanese scale, with a maximum of 7, and tsunami waves of at least 3 meters high. The economic losses from such an earthquake would reach 270 trillion yen (1.66 trillion euros), compared to the previous estimate of 214 trillion yen (1.32 trillion euros). According to the report, 215,000 of the 298,000 projected deaths would be caused by tsunamis, assuming that only 20% of the population would evacuate immediately. The government aims to increase the speed of evacuations. In addition to the 298,000 direct deaths estimated, the government also projected between 26,000 and 52,000 'disaster-related deaths', caused by situations such as the deterioration of sanitary conditions in evacuation shelters. The government will review its disaster prevention plan to designate priority areas based on flood risk and develop a new resilience plan for the 2026-2030 fiscal period.

**Japan Estimates 298,000 Deaths in Potential Megathrust Earthquake**
According to an official report, approximately 298,000 people could die in Japan if a megathrust earthquake occurs in the Nankai Trough, a region of high seismic activity in the Pacific Ocean. The report, published by the Japanese government's seismology team, estimates that 215,000 of these deaths would be caused by tsunamis, assuming only 20% of the population would evacuate immediately. The government aims to increase the speed of evacuations. The report also projects between 26,000 and 52,000 'disaster-related deaths', caused by situations such as deteriorating health conditions in evacuation shelters. The most deadly scenario involves a magnitude 9 earthquake occurring during a winter night, with damage concentrated in the Tokai region. The Japanese government will review its disaster prevention plan and designate priority areas based on flood risk, and develop a new resilience plan for the 2026-2030 period.

**'Can kill nearly 300,000 people': Japan govt warns on mega earthquake in new forecast. What is Nankai Trough earthquake?**
The Japanese government has revised its estimate for casualties in the event of a mega earthquake in the Nankai Trough, predicting that at least 298,000 people could die. The estimate, released on March 31, is a downward revision from the initial estimate made in 2012, but still falls short of the government's goal to reduce the death toll by 80%. The majority of deaths, 215,000, are expected to be caused by a tsunami, with only 20% of people able to evacuate immediately. However, a 70% increase in evacuation speed could reduce the death toll to 94,000. The government is implementing a disaster response plan, including the creation of a new agency for disaster prevention in 2026.

**Japan Estimates 300,000 Deaths in Case of Massive Earthquake**
Japan estimates that nearly 300,000 people could die in the event of a massive earthquake followed by a tsunami, according to a new estimate made by the country's authorities on Monday (March 31, 2025). The government will review its disaster prevention plan to designate priority areas based on flood risk and develop a new resilience plan for the 2026-2030 fiscal period. The calculations consider a 800-kilometer-long earthquake along the Nankai Trough, a submarine trench south of the country. Experts have been warning of the possibility of a massive earthquake. The disaster management team estimates that up to 215,000 people would die from a tsunami, 73,000 from building collapses, and 9,000 from fires. However, the total number of victims predicted (298,000) is lower than the 2014 estimate, which put the number of deaths at up to 323,000. The economic losses from such an earthquake would reach 270 trillion yen (1.66 trillion euros), compared to the previous estimate of 214 trillion yen (1.32 trillion euros), while 2.35 million buildings would be completely destroyed. Scientists say it is extremely difficult to predict earthquakes, but a government expert group said in January that the probability of a massive earthquake of this type occurring in the next 30 years has increased slightly, with a probability of between 75% and 82%.

**Japan Faces Up to 298,000 Deaths in Potential Megathrust Earthquake**
A recent report by the Japanese government's task force on earthquakes estimates that up to 298,000 people could die in a megathrust earthquake in the Nankai Trough, a 900km-long depression in the ocean floor off the coast of Japan. This number is a 10% reduction from the previous estimate in 2012, but still falls short of the government's goal of reducing deaths by 80% as set out in its 2014 disaster prevention plan. The report highlights the need for radical revisions to evacuation strategies and infrastructure improvements. The estimated number of displaced people has increased to 12.3 million, or around 10% of Japan's population, with 764 municipalities in 31 prefectures expected to be affected by earthquakes of at least 6 on the Japanese seismic scale or tsunami waves of at least 3 meters. The estimated economic losses are $1.8 trillion, up from $1.4 trillion in the previous estimate. The report also notes that 215,000 of the 298,000 expected deaths would be caused by tsunami, assuming only 20% of people would immediately evacuate. Increasing the evacuation rate to 70% could reduce tsunami-related deaths to 94,000, emphasizing the importance of rapid evacuation. The area expected to be flooded with at least 30cm of water has increased by 30% due to improved topographic data analysis. The government will review its disaster prevention plan to designate additional priority areas based on the expanded flood risk zones and develop a new national resilience plan for the 2026-2030 fiscal year to accelerate infrastructure development. A new disaster prevention agency will also be established in 2026.
