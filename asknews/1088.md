**'Humans will live forever by 2050 thanks to android bodies and AI minds'**
Futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson predicts that humans will be able to live forever by 2050 using advanced technology such as android bodies and AI minds. He believes that the rich will be the first to benefit from this technology, but expects it to become more affordable for middle-class people by the 2060s. Dr. Pearson suggests that genetic engineering could reverse aging, and brain-computer interfaces could allow people to 'upload' their minds into virtual reality or android bodies. This would enable people to have multiple existences and identities, or to continue living after their biological death. The prediction is based on advances in computing, genetic engineering, and robotics, and is supported by the work of other futurists such as Ray Kurzweil, who believes that AI will match human brains by 2029. Kurzweil also predicts that humans will become cyborgs by 2045, capable of copying their minds or downloading into new bodies printed with advanced technology.

**The Future of Humanity: Living up to 1,000 Years?**
Scientists predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the next quarter century, according to a recent scientific report in the Times of India. The report cites Dr. Ian Pearson, a British futurist, who believes that rapid technological progress will enable the eradication of aging, the integration of humans and machines, and the ability of minds to continue in digital or robotic bodies. By 2050, the wealthy may be able to benefit from technologies such as genetic engineering and advanced neural computing to live up to 1,000 years. This may be achieved through uploading minds to computer systems or advanced robotic bodies. However, Pearson predicts that these technologies will become more widely available by the 2070s as costs decrease. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, predicts that artificial intelligence will reach human levels by 2029, launching a new era of 'biological-digital integration.' Kurzweil believes that this integration will lead to 'technological immortality' by 2045, where human minds will be linked to artificial intelligence through interfaces such as 'Neuralink,' allowing for unprecedented uploading of consciousness and expansion of awareness. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge University expert on aging, believes that medical progress will make aging a disease that can be cured. He relies on what he calls 'integral rejuvenation,' which includes repairing damaged cells and cleaning the body of molecular toxins. De Grey predicts that humans will reach 'escape velocity from aging,' where medical ability to extend life increases faster than time itself. The three experts agree that the path to living up to 1,000 years goes beyond biological longevity, and includes redefining the concept of 'human identity' through multiple digital or sensory existences.

**Ray Kurzweil Predicts Humanity Will Reach 'Speed of Longevity Escape' by 2029**
Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that humanity will reach the 'speed of longevity escape' by 2029, where our life expectancy will increase by more than one year for every year that passes, allowing us to gain time rather than lose it. Kurzweil bases this prediction on the concept that medical and technological advancements will soon reach a pace where improvements in treatments and therapies will extend our life expectancy faster than we naturally age. He notes that currently, we recover approximately four months of longevity per year due to scientific advancements, but by 2029, this number will reach one year. Kurzweil's methodology is based on the 'law of accelerating returns,' which states that technological progress advances at an exponential rate. He also predicts that humans will be able to merge their neocortex with the cloud by the early 2030s, surpassing the biological limitations of the human brain. However, he acknowledges the limitations of his predictions, stating that 'achieving the speed of longevity escape does not guarantee living forever.'

**Healthy life now for healthy ageing**
According to current trends, people born in 2040 and beyond are expected to live longer than those who are in their 40s or younger today. The average life expectancy in Europe, Oceania, America, and Japan is close to 80 years, and in Malaysia, it is more than 74 years. Considering the increasing life spans, it is not unlikely that those in their 40s or younger today will live longer than those who were in their forties 20 years ago.

**Ferramenta shows how many 'twins' you have and your estimated life expectancy**
The Population.io tool uses data from the United Nations' (UN) World Population Prospects survey to reveal how many 'doppelgangers' you have around the world. The interactive platform shows how many people were born on the same day as you in each country and globally, as well as an estimate of how many people were born at the same time. According to the tool, a person born in July 2001 would be approximately 3.1 billionth in the world's ranking of age, with the estimate updated in real-time. The platform also provides information on the percentage of younger and older people compared to the user in their country and globally. Additionally, the tool estimates a person's life expectancy based on demographic data, allowing users to compare how long they would live if they resided in another country.

**Experts Predict Humans May Live Up to 1,000 Years in the Future**
Experts predict that humans may live up to 1,000 years in the future, thanks to revolutionary discoveries in artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and medicine. According to a report by Daily Mail, scientists and futurists believe that the concept of 'immortality' is becoming a reality. Dr. Ian Pearson, a futurist, predicts that by 2050, the wealthy will be able to live forever using advanced technologies such as brain uploading or robotic bodies, and genetic engineering that reverses the effects of aging and maintains youthful cells. However, these technologies will be expensive and only available to the rich and famous, but will become more accessible to the middle class by the 2070s. Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and former Google engineer, predicts that by 2029, artificial intelligence will reach human-level intelligence, marking the beginning of the 'singularity' era by 2045, where humans will merge with machines, and brain power will increase by millions of times, allowing for the uploading of minds to the cloud or 3D-printed bodies. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, founder of the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, believes that aging is not inevitable, but a disease that can be cured, and predicts that the first person to live to 1,000 years may have already been born. He relies on 'integral rejuvenation,' a combination of treatments that repair cell damage and remove toxic waste, which may allow for 'escape velocity from aging,' where human lifespan exceeds time itself. The path to immortality is not as far away as we think.

**What if you could live up to 200?**
As scientists explore the possibility of living up to 200 years, many questions arise about the impact on our mindset and way of life. If humans could age relatively healthy up to 200, it would likely change our perspective on time, allowing people to pursue multiple passions and develop skill sets over decades. However, this would also require significant improvements in medical care to prevent painful aging symptoms. From a psychological perspective, being attached to one's body for 150 years would be a significant difference. This development would likely shape our societies, science, ethics, and way of living in a profound way. As one person noted, 'it is a topic we should start thinking about' and consider the potential effects on our lives.

**Experts Predict Immortality by 2050**
Experts in longevity predict that by 2050, people will be able to live up to 1000 years or become completely immortal due to biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and digital solutions. This will be made possible by the development of technologies such as gene editing, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced robotics. According to futurist Dr. Ian Pearson, by 2050, the wealthy will be able to achieve immortality through uploading their consciousness to computers or android bodies. Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, believes that by 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to a merger of humans and machines and achieving immortality by 2045. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical researcher, thinks that aging will become a curable disease by 2050, allowing people to live up to 1000 years and beyond. These breakthroughs will not only lead to a longer life, but also a complete transformation of humanity's essence. 'By 2050, only the wealthy and famous will be able to achieve immortality,' says Dr. Pearson, adding that these technologies will become more affordable and accessible to the middle class by the 2060s. Gene editing will be able to rejuvenate cells, and brain-computer interfaces will allow people to upload their consciousness to virtual reality or android bodies. 'This will allow people to have multiple forms of existence, or live after biological death,' explains Dr. Pearson. He is convinced that anyone under 50 today has a good chance of living to see the time when this becomes possible, and those under 40 are almost certain to have access to immortality. By 2029, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence, starting an era of human-machine fusion, believes futurist and former Google engineer Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil, who predicted the victory of computers in chess and the emergence of smartphones, calls 2045 'The Singularity' - the moment when human consciousness and artificial intelligence will merge. He believes that in the 2030s, the human brain will be connected to the cloud (e.g., through technologies like Neuralink by Elon Musk), significantly expanding human thinking. 'Instead of competing with us, AI will become our extension,' writes Kurzweil in his book The Singularity Is Nearer (2024). By 2045, people will be able to copy their consciousness or transfer it to new bodies printed using advanced technologies, according to Kurzweil. Dr. Aubrey de Grey, a Cambridge researcher with a two-foot beard, considers aging a disease that can be cured. Through his Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation, he studies methods for restoring cells that may allow people to live up to 1000 years. He claims that the first person to reach this age limit has already been born. His approach - 'integrative rejuvenation' - uses comprehensive treatment to eliminate cellular damage, such as DNA damage or toxin accumulation. If medical progress keeps pace with aging, we can achieve 'escape velocity from aging' - when lifespan will grow faster than time. Other experts, such as Dr. Andrew Steele, author of Ageless, believe that new drugs, such as senolytics, will significantly improve healthy aging - even if they do not provide complete immortality. Senolytics are a class of drugs that destroy 'zombie cells' causing inflammation in the body. 'We already understand aging processes well enough to start intervening,' says Steele. By 2050, de Grey's vision may turn death from aging into a rare phenomenon, opening a medical path to eternal life. We recall that some real entities, such as planarians, hydras, and immortal jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii, can stop aging or even turn time back.

**Life Expectancy at Birth Estimated at 81.49 Years, a New Record**
According to the INE, the estimated life expectancy at birth has reached 81.49 years, surpassing the value of 2018-2020 (81.22 years) for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was 4.3 months for men and 3.5 months for women. The life expectancy at birth was calculated at 78.73 years for men and 83.96 years for women. 'In the space of a decade, an increase of 1.17 years in life expectancy at birth was verified for the total population, being 1.49 years for men and 0.84 years for women,' highlighted the INE. The increase resulted mainly from the reduction in mortality at ages equal to or older than 60 years. 'The contribution of the oldest ages was more significant for women than for men,' according to the analysis presented. The life expectancy at 65 years, in the period 2022-2024, was estimated at 20.02 years for the total population. At 65 years, men could expect to live 18.30 years and women 21.35 years, corresponding to an increase of 0.30 years for men and 0.24 years for women compared to 2021-2023. In the last ten years, life expectancy at 65 years increased by 11.5 months for men and 8.5 months for women.

**The Promise of Immortality: Will We Live for 1,000 Years Thanks to Technology?**
Futurist Ray Kurzweil believes that technology will make death optional and allow humans to live for over 1,000 years. According to Kurzweil, nanorobots will be the key to achieving this goal. These tiny robots, capable of operating within the human body, will be able to repair damaged tissues, regulate vital substances, and even replace aging organs. Kurzweil estimates that this breakthrough could happen between 2040 and 2050. He also predicts that this will be the beginning of 'absolute precision medicine', which will allow us to reconstruct the body from the inside out. Kurzweil is not alone in this prediction, and he believes that the first person to live for over 1,000 years has already been born. He and gerontologist Aubrey de Grey propose that we can stop bodily deterioration around the age of 100, live until 150, and then continue to gain time with each technological advancement.

**'Humans will live up to 200 years in next 40 years'**
Dr. Ibrahim Wada, a renowned medical expert and Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, has predicted that humans will live up to 200 years in the next 40 years. According to Dr. Wada, advancements in medical technology and genetic engineering, such as artificial eggs and sperm from human saliva and artificial wombs, stem cells, artificial organs, and genetic reprogramming, will enable humans to extend their lifespan. Dr. Wada noted that scientists have already successfully born rats using this technology and believes it is only a matter of time before humans begin to utilise it. He also emphasized the importance of healthcare services, advising people to prioritize their health by eating well, exercising regularly, and getting enough rest, saying, 'The brain is always active, and when it's time to rest, you must rest the brain, no compromise. Those are the elements that will make you live very long.'

**Longevity Study Finds Potential for Exceptional Longevity in People Born Between 1910 and 1950**
A study by the University of Georgia found that individuals born between 1910 and 1950 may experience exceptional longevity. According to the study, their life expectancy could increase by up to 10 years. The researchers analyzed data from hundreds of millions of people from 19 industrialized countries born between the 18th and 20th centuries. They used a mathematical model to compare mortality rates among people aged 50-100 with different birth dates. The study found that people born between 1910 and 1950 did not experience significant changes in mortality rates at advanced ages, suggesting that the human lifespan has not yet been reached. This means that fewer people are dying prematurely and at historically 'octogenarian' ages. The researchers estimate that the human lifespan could reach 130 years or more. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, there is only a 13% chance of anyone living to 130 years in this century. However, by 2080, it is expected that approximately 300,000 people will be living to 110 years, increasing the chances. David McCarthy, the leader of the study, says that this potential for breaking records will only happen if current policies continue to support the health and well-being of the elderly in a stable environmental and economic context.

**People Born Between September and December May Live Longer**
Research suggests that people born between September and December may have a higher chance of living to 100 years old. This phenomenon is attributed to the conditions of pregnancy, as individuals born during the spring and early summer were conceived during the autumn and winter months. During these periods, mothers may have had better nutrition and less exposure to infectious diseases, leading to a healthier fetal development. According to experts, this factor, combined with genetic, lifestyle, environmental, and health factors, can contribute to a person's ability to reach the age of 100.

**2030 Births Expected to Live to 100: A Study's Surprising Findings**
A recent British study, published by the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) and reported by The Independent, found that one in five girls born in 2030 is expected to live to at least 100 years old. The study predicts that this number will increase to one in four by 2047. For boys, the study forecasts that more than one in eight born in 2030 will live to 100, with the number increasing to one in six by 2047. The researchers attribute these predictions to improvements in lifestyle, such as decreased smoking rates, better working conditions, and advancements in healthcare, particularly in the treatment of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. The study also noted a narrowing of the gap between the average lifespan of boys and girls at birth, from 4.4 years in 1981 to 3.4 years in 2023, with a prediction that this trend will continue in the future. 'These improvements in life expectancy are a testament to the progress we've made in improving healthcare and reducing health inequalities,' said Dr. [no quote source provided].

**One in five girls born in 2030 will live to 100**
According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), one in five girls born in 2030 is projected to live to 100, rising to almost one in four for those born in 2047. For boys, the projections are less dramatic, with more than one in eight males born in 2030 projected to reach 100, increasing to about one in six by 2047. The ONS said the data is based on past trends in annual death registrations and assumes improved mortality rates among elderly people. Kerry Gadsdon of the ONS stated, 'The gap between male and female cohort life expectancy at birth has fallen from 4.4 years in 1981 to 3.4 years in 2023 and is projected to fall further in the future.' The projections also suggest that girls born in the UK in 2023 can expect to live on average to an age of 90.0 years and boys to 86.7 years, increasing to 92.2 years and 89.3 years respectively for babies born in 2047.

**How long will YOU live? Try the interactive tool**
The Office for National Statistics has released an interactive tool that estimates life expectancy based on age and gender. According to the tool, a baby boy born in 2023 can expect to live to 86.7 years, while girls can expect to live to 90 years. The gap between the two is narrowing. The data also shows that children born in the 1990s have a longer life expectancy than those born in the 1980s. The tool also projects that people aged 65 in 2023 can expect to live an additional 19.8 years for men and 22.5 years for women. The ONS has also produced two scenarios, a 'principal' projection of 1.1% annual increase and a 'low' improvement scenario of 0.5% annual increase. The 'principal' projection reflects the slower rate of mortality improvements over the past 10 years.
