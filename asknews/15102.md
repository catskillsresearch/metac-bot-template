**Israel's Military Operation in Gaza Intensifies Amid Efforts for Ceasefire**
Israel's military operation in Gaza is intensifying, despite efforts by mediators to secure a ceasefire. The Hamas has welcomed the efforts and agreed to 'immediately initiate a round of indirect negotiations to reach an agreement on the disputed points'. The goal is a 'permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal' of the Israeli army. However, the Israeli government has so far rejected a ceasefire that would bring an end to the war. Israel's military chief, Zamir, stated that the operation will continue until 'the conditions for the return of the hostages and the decisive defeat of Hamas are created'. The Hamas is losing control over the Gaza Strip. According to the Israeli Defense Minister, Israel Katz, the army has been instructed to continue advancing in the Gaza Strip and to achieve all declared war goals 'regardless of any negotiations'. The hopes for a ceasefire have been dashed for now. The Hamas had agreed to a 60-day ceasefire and the release of some of the hostages it is still holding, but set additional conditions. The Arab states of Qatar and Egypt, who are also mediating in the conflict, stated that they want to bring the positions of both warring parties closer together and clarify disputed points. The Hamas claimed that 30 people were killed and dozens injured in Israeli attacks on humanitarian aid distribution centers, but this could not be independently verified. The Israeli army denied the claims, stating that it had not fired on civilians near or inside the aid distribution centers. The International Committee of the Red Cross reported that 179 people were brought to a field hospital in Rafah, most with gunshot and shrapnel wounds, and 21 were killed. The survivors said they were injured while trying to reach a distribution center for aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which distributes aid, stated that their help was distributed without incident and that they are aware of rumors spread by Hamas about alleged deaths and injuries, which are 'untrue and fabricated'. Israel allows the foundation to distribute aid in the Gaza Strip to bypass UN and other humanitarian organizations, which have criticized Israel for using humanitarian aid as a weapon. The UN has criticized Israel for not providing evidence that the Hamas is diverting humanitarian aid.

**Israel Rejects Ceasefire with Hamas, Intensifies Military Operations in Gaza**
Israel has rejected a ceasefire with Hamas, despite ongoing efforts by mediators Qatar and Egypt to negotiate a truce.

Israel has allowed the foundation to distribute humanitarian aid in Gaza, but the UN has criticized this move, saying it is an attempt to bypass humanitarian organizations.

**Israel Intensifies Gaza Operations, Hamas Welcomes Ceasefire Efforts**
Israel's military is intensifying its operations in the Gaza Strip, with Generalstabschef Ejal Zamir ordering the expansion of the ground offensive to additional areas. The Hamas has welcomed the efforts of the mediator states Qatar and Egypt to restart indirect negotiations for a ceasefire, stating that they are willing to 'immediately initiate a round of indirect talks to achieve an agreement on the disputed points.' The goal is a 'permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal' of the Israeli army. However, the Israeli government has so far rejected a ceasefire that would bring an end to the war. Israel's military chief said, 'We are in the middle of a strong and relentless operation.' The operation will continue until 'the conditions for the return of the hostages and the decisive defeat of Hamas are created.' The Hamas is losing control over the Gaza Strip. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz has stated that the army has been instructed to continue advancing in the Gaza Strip and to achieve all declared war goals 'regardless of any negotiations.' The hopes for a ceasefire have been dashed for the time being. The Hamas had agreed to a 60-day ceasefire and the release of some of the hostages they are still holding, but set additional conditions. The Arab states Qatar and Egypt, who are also mediating in the conflict, stated that they will work to bring the two warring parties closer together and clarify disputed points. The Hamas had claimed that 30 people were killed in Israeli attacks on distribution centers for humanitarian aid, with dozens more injured. However, this could not be independently verified. The Israeli army denied the claims, stating that a preliminary investigation had found that the military 'did not shoot at civilians who were near or inside the humanitarian aid distribution center, and that the reports are false.' The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that 179 people were brought to a field hospital in Rafah in the south, most with gunshot and shrapnel wounds. There were 21 fatalities. The survivors said they were injured while trying to reach a distribution center for aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which distributes meals through the centers, stated that their aid was distributed without incident. They also stated that they were aware of rumors spread by the Hamas about alleged deaths and injuries on the day in question, which they described as 'untrue and fabricated.' Israel allows the GHF to distribute aid in the Gaza Strip in order to bypass humanitarian aid organizations of the UN and other initiatives, which the UN has criticized and accused Israel of using humanitarian aid as a weapon. Israel had allowed humanitarian aid shipments to the starving population in the Gaza Strip after almost three months of blockade, but only in limited quantities. Greta Thunberg and other activists plan to sail to Gaza with a ship to bring aid.

**Egypt Prepares for the Worst-Case Scenario as Israel Mobilizes Forces**
Egypt is preparing for a long summer vacation, while Israel is mobilizing its forces, calling up 450,000 reserve soldiers, claiming to be preparing for a comprehensive war in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies from the right-wing religious parties insist that this war will be the one that will end all wars. However, the Egyptian government is optimistic, believing that the war is unlikely to affect Egypt. Egypt's confidence stems from its belief in the capabilities of its army, which has undergone a comprehensive modernization process, expanding its presence in all strategic directions, including the Sinai Peninsula, the Libyan Desert, Sudan, and the Bab al-Mandab Strait. Despite the gloomy regional situation since October 2023, the average Egyptian citizen has continued to live a normal life, largely unaffected by the regional tensions. Egypt has managed to avoid involvement in the conflicts in the region, which have included small battles and large-scale operations in Gaza, the West Bank, South Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, and Libya. However, the risks and threats are increasing, with US President Donald Trump's administration exerting pressure on Egypt to achieve its goal of taking control of the Gaza Strip and forcibly relocating Palestinians from it, with the aim of turning it into a massive real estate project, which Trump described as a 'resort' in the Middle East. Egypt has made diplomatic efforts to counter Trump's plan, mobilizing Arab and Islamic blocs, as well as engaging in intense diplomacy with European and Asian powers. However, Trump's response was simply 'let's see.' Meanwhile, the Israeli government, led by Netanyahu, continues to mobilize its forces, calling up 450,000 reserve soldiers, claiming to be preparing for a comprehensive war in Gaza, while also announcing the establishment of over 20 new settlements in the West Bank. This has led to concerns in Egypt that Israel may be planning to forcibly relocate Palestinians to the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is preparing for the worst-case scenario, mobilizing its forces and preparing for a potential war. However, Egypt's confidence stems from its belief that the Israeli government is divided, with some factions opposing the war, while others are in favor of it. Egypt's President has stated that the country will not engage in a war that is not in its interests, and will only do so if it is necessary to defend its sovereignty. Egypt is also counting on the fact that Israel is uncertain about its future leadership, and is struggling to define its role in the region. Egypt's Ambassador to the US has stated that the country will not engage in a war that is not in its interests, and will only do so if it is necessary to defend its sovereignty.

**31 Palestinians are killed heading to a Gaza aid site, witnesses say. Israel denies responsibility**
At least 31 Palestinians were killed and over 170 were wounded when Israeli forces opened fire on crowds heading to a Gaza aid distribution site. Witnesses described the scene as 'horrible' with people shot in the upper part of their bodies, including the head, neck, and chest. The Gaza Health Ministry said the majority of the wounded were men. The Israeli military denied responsibility, saying troops fired warning shots at suspects advancing toward them. However, witnesses and the International Committee of the Red Cross disputed this claim, saying people were trying to reach the aid site. The new aid distribution system, promoted by Israel and the US, has been criticized by UN agencies and major aid groups for violating humanitarian principles. 'It's essentially engineered scarcity,' said Jonathan Whittall, interim head in Gaza of the UN humanitarian office. The conflict has left Gaza's population almost completely reliant on international aid, with the war having killed over 54,000 people, mostly women and children. Mediators Qatar and Egypt are continuing efforts to broker a ceasefire agreement.

**Egypt and Qatar Pursue Ceasefire in Gaza Strip Amid Ongoing Crisis**
Egypt and Qatar are continuing efforts to resolve differences and achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to a joint statement released by the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday, June 1. Both countries have called on all parties to support the efforts of mediators to end the war. Meanwhile, on June 1, the city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip was attacked. As a result of the shelling near a US-run humanitarian aid distribution point, at least 31 people were killed and over 176 were injured, according to AFP citing local health authorities. Additionally, the Hamas-controlled government of the Gaza Strip claims that another aid center called GHF was shelled, resulting in one reported death and dozens of injuries. The Gaza Strip government has accused Israel of carrying out the attacks. However, Israeli military officials claim that they are 'unaware of any casualties' resulting from the attacks. GHF has stated that the reports of their center being shelled are 'false and fabricated' and are 'actively being spread by Hamas.' Earlier, US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, whose plan called for a 60-day ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of 28 Israeli hostages, called Hamas' response 'unacceptable' as they repeated demands for a ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. These conditions were previously rejected by Israel. The development of a plan is taking place against the backdrop of a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and an escalation of Israeli military operations in the region. Israel's military actions in recent weeks have been criticized by traditional allies, including Germany.

The ministry also reported that 111 more people were injured and transferred to hospitals, bringing the total number of injured to 116,156. The Israeli army launched a surprise air campaign on the Gaza Strip on March 18, killing 1,574 people and injuring 4,115 others, despite a ceasefire agreement and prisoner exchange that went into effect in January. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty held talks with his Omani and Iranian counterparts, as well as US envoy Steve Witkoff, to ease regional tensions and establish a durable ceasefire in Gaza. The French government aims to reduce its budget deficit by €40-50 billion to meet its 2026 budget target. The Gabonese presidential election was won by Brice Oligui Nguema with 90.35% of the vote. At least 52 people were killed in clashes between M23 rebels and pro-government militias in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo.

**Israel Accused of Inciting Against Egyptian Army, Threatening to Occupy Sinai**
Israel has been accused of inciting against the Egyptian army and threatening to occupy Sinai. According to Israeli media, the Egyptian army has been building military infrastructure in Sinai, which Israel considers a 'serious breach' of the peace treaty. Israel has warned that it will not tolerate the current situation and that the issue is a top priority for Defense Minister Yair Lapid. The Israeli government has expressed concern over the growing strength of the Egyptian army and has accused Egypt of violating the peace treaty. The US has also been involved in the issue, with some lawmakers expressing concern over the growing military presence in Sinai. The Israeli military has also been accused of planning a hypothetical scenario in which it would attack the Aswan Dam in Egypt, leading to a major conflict between the two countries. The scenario, which has been described as 'hypothetical', would involve the Israeli military launching a surprise attack on the dam, leading to widespread flooding and destruction in Egypt. According to Israeli media, the scenario could result in up to 1.7 million deaths, although this number could be higher if the Egyptian government is unable to respond effectively. The Israeli government has denied any involvement in the planning of this scenario, but the issue has raised concerns over the potential for conflict between Israel and Egypt. The peace treaty between the two countries, signed in 1979, has been in place for over 40 years, but tensions have been rising in recent years over issues such as the military presence in Sinai and the construction of military infrastructure. The Israeli government has expressed a desire to maintain the peace treaty, but has also made it clear that it will not tolerate any violations of the agreement.

**Israel Expands Military Operation in Gaza, Escalating Conflict and Humanitarian Crisis**
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz announced the expansion of Israel's military operation in Gaza, which will involve seizing large areas of the enclave and incorporating them into Israeli security zones. Katz stated that the operation will lead to the large-scale evacuation of Gaza's population from conflict zones, further deepening the humanitarian crisis. Israeli forces have resumed airstrikes on Gaza and deployed ground troops back into the enclave. Diplomatic efforts led by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to revive negotiations aimed at ending the conflict have yet to yield progress. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reiterated that military pressure remains the most effective means of securing the release of the 59 hostages still held by Hamas. The military campaign was launched after Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,200 Israelis and the abduction of 251 hostages. In retaliation, Israel's operations in Gaza have led to the deaths of over 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities.

**Israel-Hamas Conflict Escalates as Israeli Youth Refuse to Serve in Military**
The conflict between Israel and Hamas has escalated, with over 5,000 Palestinians killed and Israel facing pressure from Hamas and other armed groups. The Egyptian government has proposed a new ceasefire plan, which includes the release of five Israeli hostages and a two-stage implementation of the ceasefire. However, Israel has not yet responded to the proposal. Meanwhile, a growing number of Israeli youth are refusing to serve in the military, with some even stating that they would rather be imprisoned than participate in the war. This trend reflects the deep divisions within Israeli society over the ongoing conflict. The United Nations has announced that it will temporarily withdraw around 1/3 of its international staff from Gaza due to the escalating violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing internal and external challenges, including a growing opposition movement and international criticism over his handling of the conflict. Netanyahu has launched a military operation in Gaza, which has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians and has sparked widespread condemnation from the international community. The situation in Israel is increasingly volatile, with some analysts warning that the country is on the brink of civil war.

Israeli strikes have resulted in the deaths of over 65 Palestinians, including women and children, as reported by the Gaza Health Ministry. This escalation comes after Israel resumed air and ground operations, breaking a ceasefire with Hamas. The 17-month conflict has led to a death toll of over 50,000. Amidst the violence, Egyptian officials have proposed a deal to revive the ceasefire, which involves Hamas releasing five hostages, including an American-Israeli, in exchange for humanitarian aid and a pause in fighting from Israel. The Israeli military has also acknowledged firing on a Red Cross office in Gaza, mistakenly identifying a militant threat, and stated that the incident will be reviewed.

**Israel continues Gaza massacre as Egypt floats new truce proposal**
Israel's ongoing war on Gaza has resulted in the deaths of 21 more Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Meanwhile, Egypt has proposed a new truce plan to de-escalate the conflict, which includes Hamas releasing five Israeli hostages each week in exchange for Israel implementing the second phase of the cease-fire. Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Katz, claimed that the country is fighting against Hamas and not Gaza civilians, but Hamas denies using the civilian population for military purposes. Thousands of people are trapped in the Tel al-Sultan area of Rafah, with no access to basic necessities like water, food, and medicine. The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service estimates that 50,000 residents remain trapped in Rafah. The Egyptian proposal has been agreed upon by the U.S. and Hamas, but Israel has yet to respond.

**Israel Kills 330+ in Airstrikes on Gaza, Shattering Ceasefire | Egyptian Streets**
At least 330 people, including many children, have been killed in Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, following the failure of negotiations to extend the ceasefire. The Israeli military described the bombardment as 'extensive,' targeting what it called 'terror targets' belonging to Hamas. The UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Muhannad Hadi, condemned the resumption of hostilities, calling for an immediate reinstatement of the ceasefire. 'This is unconscionable. A ceasefire must be reinstated immediately,' Hadi said. 'People in Gaza have endured unimaginable suffering.' The humanitarian situation in Gaza grows more desperate, with aid agencies warning of further civilian casualties and worsening conditions for those already displaced by the months-long conflict.

**Israel and Hamas Resume Ceasefire Talks in Cairo**
The second phase of the ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas has resumed in Cairo, Egypt, with the hope of bringing lasting peace to the Gaza conflict. The talks were delayed after Israel's military admitted to 'completely failing' to prevent the 2023 attack that sparked the war. Egyptian mediators said that Israel, Qatar, and the US representatives had held 'intensive' talks in Cairo to discuss the next stage of the ceasefire agreement. According to the Egyptian National News Service, 'the parties have held intensive talks to discuss the next stage of the ceasefire agreement and are continuing to work to ensure the implementation of the previously agreed upon understanding.' The first phase of the ceasefire agreement is set to expire on Saturday, March 1, and has largely halted the violence sparked by Hamas' breach of the Gaza security fence on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 Israelis, mostly civilians. The Hamas-controlled health department in Gaza reported that Israel's retaliatory actions have resulted in over 48,000 deaths in Gaza, a figure deemed credible by the UN. In exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Hamas handed over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, prompting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to send his negotiating team to Cairo. An internal Israeli military investigation report, released on Thursday, acknowledged that the military 'completely failed' to prevent the attack, citing 'overconfidence' and a 'misunderstanding' of Hamas' military capabilities. Netanyahu vowed to destroy Hamas and bring all hostages home, but his handling of the war and hostage crisis has faced criticism and protests at home.
