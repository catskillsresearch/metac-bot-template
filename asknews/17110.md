**US copyright verdict offers a glimmer of hope for artists vs AI**
A US Copyright Office report has concluded that the fair use defence does not apply to commercial AI training, potentially offering a glimmer of hope for artists. The report states that while AI training may be transformative, its commercial use of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets goes beyond established fair use boundaries. The report suggests that practical solutions, such as licensing agreements, are needed for uses that may not qualify as fair. However, the conclusions may be short-lived, as the director of the Copyright Office was fired just one day after the report's release, reportedly due to her refusal to rubber-stamp Elon Musk's efforts to mine copyrighted works for AI training. As Luiza Jarovsky, co-founder of AI Tech and Privacy Academy, wrote, 'It's GREAT NEWS for content creators/copyright holders,' but the long-term impact of the report remains uncertain.

**U.S. Copyright Office Report Backs Licensing for AI Training and Rejects Compulsory Models**
The U.S. Copyright Office has released a report supporting the idea of licensing copyrights for AI training, while rejecting compulsory licensing and opt-out approaches. The report notes that licensing could be a 'practical solution' for commercial AI models, but not for non-commercial uses such as analysis or research. The Office also recognizes that most stakeholders do not support statutory changes or government intervention in this area. The report suggests that a compulsory license would have significant disadvantages, including setting fixed royalty rates and terms that can become difficult to undo. The Office leaves it up to copyright owners and AI companies to figure out the right way to license and compensate for training data, but explores options such as compensation structures based on a percentage of revenue or profits, and Extended Collective Licensing (ECL). The report marks the Office's third report on generative AI and its impact on copyrights since it launched an initiative in 2023.

**The Magic Under the Hood: How AI Companions Create Meaningful Conversations in 2025**
In 2025, AI companions have become increasingly sophisticated in their ability to engage in natural, flowing conversations. At the core of these advanced AI chatbots is a Large Language Model (LLM) that is trained on vast datasets of human text, allowing it to predict what words should come next in a sequence. AI companions use context retention to maintain a 'memory' of the conversation, ensuring responses feel connected and coherent over time. Careful character design and fine-tuning are also crucial in creating engaging AI companions. These models undergo additional training focused on conversation, emotional intelligence, and relationship dynamics, and use reinforcement learning from human feedback to improve their responses. The most advanced AI companions use sophisticated NLP components to create responses that feel thoughtful and relevant, and learn from conversations to adapt to the user's communication style and preferences over time. Developing AI companions requires careful ethical consideration, and responsible platforms implement safeguards to ensure that the experience remains within appropriate boundaries. As AI companions continue to evolve, they are becoming more personalized and emotionally intelligent, and are able to handle ambiguity and subtext in conversations.

**UST's Wang Xingxing Reveals Humanoid Robot Industry's Hot Trend and Future Prospects**
The sixth Shanghai Innovation and Entrepreneurship Youth 50 Forum was held on May 10, 2025, where Wang Xingxing, CEO of UST, revealed that the humanoid robot industry has experienced an unprecedented hot trend, with many companies accelerating the landing of downstream scenarios. Many humanoid robot manufacturers have gone out of stock, including UST, which is currently facing a shortage of personnel in various positions. Wang Xingxing believes that in the next 2-5 years, the problem of end-to-end artificial intelligence will become the core of technical research and development. Therefore, the strongest humanoid robot company must be a company with artificial intelligence capabilities. Currently, hardware issues are also hindering the development of the industry, and how to produce low-cost, long-lasting hardware is a key factor in large-scale production. UST has become a leader in product sales, with a sales volume of 23,700 units in 2024 and a market share of nearly 70%. The company has also delivered over 1,500 humanoid robots. With the continuous progress of technology, humanoid robots are expected to become the next generation of large-scale deployment of intelligent terminals, bringing about a wide range of market opportunities. The 2025 World Robot Competition - the first Humanoid Robot Sports Festival will be held on August 15-17, 2025, with a comprehensive competition including football, track and field, and pharmaceutical sorting. The festival will also include a theme conference and a carnival. The festival is organized by the China Electronics Society, the Wuhan Investment Holding Group, and the China Humanoid Robot Association. The event will showcase the comprehensive capabilities of humanoid robots. Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, has been a focus in the industry. In June 2024, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would perform a major hardware upgrade on Optimus in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, and would enter the limited production stage in 2025. On March 21, 2025, Musk announced that Tesla had completed the manufacturing of Optimus on the production line in Fremont, California. Tesla plans to produce 5,000 units of Optimus in 2025 and 50,000 units in 2026. To accelerate the mass production of Optimus, Tesla has published multiple job postings on its website, mostly for engineers, including machine learning engineers, deep learning operation engineers, and reinforcement learning engineers. This indicates that Tesla is still investing heavily in artificial intelligence to improve the overall capabilities of Optimus. On April 19, 2025, the Beijing Humanoid Robot Half Marathon was held, which attracted widespread attention and discussion. It was found that multiple companies' humanoid robots had shown impressive performance. Figure is another focus humanoid robot manufacturer. On February 21, 2025, Figure released the Helix end-to-end humanoid model, which first applied the 'visual-language-action (VLA)' to humanoid robots, enhancing the robot's learning ability and limb control ability. The Helix is composed of two AI modules, playing the roles of 'brain' and 'little brain'. The 'brain' module is a 70 billion-parameter multimodal model that can process multimodal information at a frequency of 7-9 Hz. The 'little brain' module is an 8 million-parameter AI that converts the 'brain' module's instructions into actions at a frequency of 200 Hz. As the humanoid robot industry develops, AI chips (realizing robot brain and small brain intelligence), reducers, dexterous hands, PEEK materials, motors, lithium batteries, and silk rods (transmission devices) will also have development opportunities. According to iFinD financial data terminal, the concept stocks of humanoid robots include: Huaan Technology, Bluesky Technology, iFlytek, Three Flowers Intelligent Control, Shanghai Electric, Guangqi Technology, Billion Energy, Rui Xing Micro, Peng Ding Holdings, Sheng Hong Technology, Guangqi Group, Li Yi Intelligent Manufacturing, and Zhonglian Heavy Industry.

**Bank of America Expects Strong AI Spending in 2025**
Analysts at Bank of America (BofA) said in a note on Friday that expectations for spending on data centers and artificial intelligence in 2025 remain strong, citing positive recent indicators from major US 'hyper-scaler' companies. BofA highlighted Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) as its top picks for this trend, and said increased spending has also made Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Marvell Technology Inc (MRVL) more attractive. BofA noted that while global hyper-scaler companies spent $92.0 billion on artificial intelligence in the first quarter, which was slightly lower than the expected $93.8 billion, most of these companies have shown a willingness to continue investing in AI in the coming quarters. BofA expects total AI spending to reach $414 billion in 2025, up 44% from last year, and $432 billion in 2026. Despite multiple concerns about a slowdown in spending over the long term, especially after the launch of the Chinese DeepSeek AI model earlier this year, which sparked a rush towards more efficient AI models with lower hardware requirements, BofA said that expectations for AI spending remain strong. Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have confirmed their expectations for 2025, while Meta (META) has raised its expectations to $64 billion - $72 billion from $60 billion - $65 billion. Amazon (AMZN) has not updated its expectations of $105 billion for 2025 since the fourth quarter earnings, but its partner Marvell has increased its production volume. BofA analysts wrote in the note: 'We expect AI to continue expanding in: 1) traditional training before/after advanced models (model sizes double every six months), 2) derived models (e.g. DeepSeek), 3) expanding test time for inference (up to >100x compared to standard inference), and 4) sovereign/enterprise AI which is still in its early stages.' Hyper-scalers in Wall Street are the largest investors in AI infrastructure, with a significant gap, committing hundreds of billions of dollars to this rapidly growing technology over the past two years. Manufacturers of chips that serve this industry have greatly benefited from this, leading to a sharp increase in market valuations for major companies like Nvidia. TSMC has also greatly benefited from this trend.

**SoundCloud's AI Surge Sparks Backlash and Industry-Wide Debate**
SoundCloud recently updated its terms of service in February 2024, stating that user-uploaded content could be used to train artificial intelligence models. However, the platform announced that artist content has not been used for this purpose yet. SoundCloud's Communication Director Marni Greenberg told The Verge that third parties are strictly prohibited from using SoundCloud content for AI training. Greenberg also emphasized that the platform has implemented technical measures, such as the 'AI shouldn't be used' label, to prevent unauthorized use. SoundCloud currently uses AI for personalized recommendations and fraud detection, and plans to expand its AI applications in the future. However, licensed content from major record labels is exempt from this training process. To provide artists with an exit strategy, SoundCloud plans to introduce an 'opt-out' option for users to exempt their content from AI training. Despite this, the silent update has led to a loss of trust among users, with some questioning the platform's commitment to transparency. The move is seen as part of the growing pressure on the music industry to adopt ethical AI usage. Over 400 music organizations have issued statements on the use of AI for training, copyright, and fair revenue distribution. Major labels like Warner Music Group and Sony Music have explicitly banned the unauthorized use of their content for AI training. This development follows a collective resistance movement, including an open letter from over 200 musicians to tech companies, protesting the use of their content for AI training without permission. The industry is moving towards creating transparency and standard licensing frameworks. The distribution of royalties and artist income from AI-generated music is also a topic of debate. The rise of AI music tools like LANDR has sparked significant change in the industry, but most listeners remain skeptical of vocal-based AI content.

**John Henry Fought the Machine, but You'll Just Train It  --  Until It Trains Itself.**
The article argues that the claim that every new technology creates new jobs is misleading. While AI has created some new jobs, such as Prompt Engineering, these jobs are being quickly eliminated as Large Language Models (LLMs) progress. The author also criticizes Amazon's announcement of new robots for their warehouses, suggesting that they will replace human workers and make them less necessary. The author notes that Amazon's robots can pick 3/4 of the warehouse, implying that they will not need a human companion for every robot, but rather one human to help multiple robots. The article concludes that the expense of robots will lead to job losses and reduced job creation.

**UK's Collective Licensing Initiative Aims to Harmonize AI and Copyright Law**
The UK's Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA), Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society (ALCS), and Publishers' Licensing Services (PLS) have announced plans to launch a collective licensing framework for AI training. The opt-in license would allow AI developers to use text-based published works while ensuring creators are compensated. The license is expected to roll out in Q3 2025, following further consultation with publishers. The framework is designed to complement direct bespoke licensing deals and provide an accessible fallback for smaller creators and independent publishers. Exact compensation models are still under negotiation, but will aim to balance affordability for AI developers against fair, sustainable remuneration for creators.

**New AI Model 'Prospect' Trained on 57 Million NHS Health Records**
A new AI model called '前瞻' (Prospect) has been developed using 57 million anonymized health records from the English National Health Service (NHS). The model can predict hospitalization risks, heart attacks, and hundreds of other diseases. According to Dr. Angela Wood, a health data scientist from the University of Cambridge, this is a 'breakthrough' in using AI in health research. 'If the AI's predictions are proven valuable in different populations, it could ultimately guide individual patient care and help allocate NHS resources,' she said. The model has been trained on data from 2018 to 2023, covering approximately 100 billion medical events. The data has been anonymized to protect patient privacy. The model can only be run on NHS computer systems, and any research predictions generated by it will be reviewed before publication. However, Dr. Luc Rocher, a data privacy researcher from the University of Oxford, has expressed concerns that anonymizing the data may not be sufficient to prevent patient privacy breaches. The model is currently only being used for approximately 100 existing projects related to COVID-19, which are being conducted by the British Heart Foundation and NHS England. Any further use of the model will require additional approval. Researchers will also test the model's ability to predict which of approximately 1000 diseases a patient is likely to develop in 2023, given their medical history from 2018-2022. 'This allows us to get as close as possible to the 'real situation', ' said Dr. Chris Tomlinson, a health data scientist from University College London. 'The potential of NHS data in training such generative health models is exciting,' said Dr. Moritz Gerstung, a health data scientist from the German Cancer Research Center. 'The large scale of NHS data will improve the accuracy of medical AI and enable it to predict rare diseases or interpret atypical medical histories.'

**Trump, Newsom push AI training for students and workers**
President Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have announced plans to require generative artificial intelligence training for students and workers in a rare display of bipartisan support. The governor's office said state agencies will be the first in the country to use generative AI to reduce highway congestion, improve roadway safety and enhance customer service. Mr. Trump's executive order directs the Education and Labor Departments to prioritize funding and opportunities for high school students to take AI classes and certification programs. Mr. Newsom said, 'We know that state government can be more efficient, and as the birthplace of tech, it is only natural that California leads in this space.' Mr. Trump said, 'This is a big deal, because AI seems to be where it's at.' A growing number of K-12 schools, colleges and employers have launched AI training programs since OpenAI's ChatGPT took the world by storm in late 2022. 'Learning and integrating AI into education is essential for ensuring that our children remain competitive in the future,' said Peter Whitehead, CEO of Light AI in California.

**Three Breakthrough Cases Highlight AI Medical Commercialization Prospects, Sector Sees Valuation Repair Opportunities**
Recently, the 'Implementation Scheme for the Digital Transformation of the Pharmaceutical Industry (2025-2030)' proposed by seven departments aims to achieve full coverage of digital transformation for pharmaceutical enterprises by 2030, promoting the rapid development of AI pharmaceuticals. The scheme has included AI pharmaceutical equipment development in the central government's key support scope, forming a 'device-scene-platform' full-chain support system. The National Data Bureau's 'Medical Health Data Circulation Application Pilot Scheme' has established a clinical data de-identification sharing mechanism in 15 provinces, collecting over 8 million standardized medical image data by March 2025, providing a foundation for AI diagnosis model training. Meanwhile, domestic and foreign companies have increased their investment in the AI medical industry, resulting in three breakthrough cases. 1. English Intelligent: Its AI-designed TNKS inhibitor ISM801 showed an ORR of 47% in phase II clinical trials, with a development cycle shortened to 18 months (traditional mode requires 4-6 years), with an estimated value exceeding $5 billion. 2. Tencent's Medical Imaging Intelligence: By March 2025, the system had been connected to 1,800 medical institutions nationwide, completing 120 million AI-assisted diagnoses, and driving a 215% year-on-year increase in revenue for cooperating hardware manufacturers. 3. GE Medical's Edison platform commercialization: Its AI-enabled CT device Revolution Apex achieved global installations of over 2,000 units in 2024, with a single device generating $1.5 million in annual service revenue, with a China market contribution rate exceeding 40%. Looking ahead, McKinsey predicts that the Chinese AI medical market size will grow from $80 billion in 2025 to $45 trillion in 2030, with a CAGR of 41%, with AI pharmaceuticals growing at over 60%. IDC research shows that the medical large model parameter scale will exceed $100 billion in 2025, with multi-modal diagnosis accuracy expected to reach the level of top-tier hospital attending physicians, driving a $100 billion smart device update market. In terms of the A-share market, as of April 26, 2025, the Wind AI Medical Index dynamic PE is 38 times, lower than the 52 times of the Sci-Tech Board's biological medicine board, with a PEG of 0.83. Among the 45 AI medical companies that have disclosed their quarterly reports, 32 have achieved revenue growth of over 30%, with AI pharmaceutical CRO companies' gross profit margins increasing by 5-8 percentage points, and smart hospital solution providers' contract debt increasing by 120% year-on-year. It is worth paying attention to the valuation repair opportunities in the sector.

**AI training license will allow LLM builders to pay for content they consume**
The UK publishing body has launched an AI training license that will allow Large Language Model (LLM) builders to pay for the content they consume. This move promises 'legal certainty' for developers and money for creators. However, it remains to be seen if this initiative will be effective, given the current state of the industry. The UK org backing this initiative claims it will provide a solution to the long-standing issue of content creators not being fairly compensated for their work. As one industry expert noted, 'It's about time someone took responsibility for the content that's being used to train these models.' The AI training license is seen as a step in the right direction, but it remains to be seen if it will be enough to address the concerns of content creators and developers alike.

**AI race in 2025 is tighter than ever before**
The artificial intelligence (AI) race is becoming increasingly competitive, with Chinese AI models closing the performance gap with their US counterparts. According to the Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025, the top-ranked model scored 12% higher than the tenth-ranked model in early 2024, but only 5% higher in early 2025. The report highlights that notable generative AI models are getting bigger, but developers are also proving that smaller, sleeker models are capable of great things. 'The frontier is increasingly competitive -- and increasingly crowded,' the report says. The US continues to be the top producer of notable models, but China is catching up, and other regions are joining the race. The previous US lead in terms of model quality has disappeared, and China is now developing models that match their US competition in performance. 'Around 2015, China put itself on the path to be a top player in AI, and they did it through investments in education,' says Bart Selman, a computer scientist at Cornell University. 'We're seeing that's starting to pay off.' The field has also seen a surge in the number and performance of 'open weight' models, which allow users to freely view the parameters that these models learn during training and use to make predictions. 'It's certainly good for anyone who can't afford to build a model from scratch, which is a lot of little companies and academics,' says Ray Perrault, a computer scientist at SRI. 'OpenAI in San Francisco, California, which developed the chatbot ChatGPT, plans to release an open-weight model in the next few months.'

**Will Hollywood stars or tech giants win California's AI copyright battle?**
A new bill, Assembly Bill 412, has been proposed in California to require generative AI developers to document and disclose any copyrighted works used to train their models. The bill is supported by the Hollywood industry, including the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), which says it will increase accountability for AI developers and empower copyright owners to exercise their rights. However, tech and industry groups argue that the bill would undermine fair-use rules and make it difficult for AI models to be trained without facing a lawsuit. Some critics also point out that the bill could crush smaller startups and give big tech even more power. Chetan Kulhari, co-founder and CEO of Midcentury Labs, said, 'Right now, this bill risks entrenching the dominance of big tech since they’re the only ones who can afford complex compliance and licensing deals.' David Acost, co-founder and chief AI officer at ARBOai, added, 'Overly broad rules could crush startups, entrench monopolies, and fail to address core issues – for example, how copyrighted data is used, not just that it’s used.'

**Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches to AI Governance: Water Yoshino's Thoughts on a New Social Contract**
The upcoming EU-AI law, set to be implemented in 2025, will have a significant impact on AI governance. The law categorizes AI systems into four risk-based tiers and imposes regulations accordingly. Even non-EU companies that sell AI systems in the EU will be subject to these regulations, with severe penalties for non-compliance. The law also requires transparency from AI model providers, including the creation and updating of technical documentation, as well as the provision of detailed summaries of learning data. In contrast, the US and Japan are taking a more bottom-up approach to AI governance, focusing on performance and cost rather than regulatory compliance. This EU-led top-down approach is likely to play a central role in the 2025 AI governance debate. For latecomer AI companies, including those in Japan, the choice between open-source large language models (LLMs) and cloud-dependent small language models (SLMs) will be crucial, not only for business strategy but also for transparency and accountability in AI governance. The EU-AI law excludes regulations for AI systems and models that are open-source and licensed under a free and open-source license, but the definition of open-source in the AI field is still unclear. The Open Source Initiative has recently published a definition of open-source AI, which requires the provision of information about learning data and model weights, but not necessarily the disclosure of all learning data. The environmental impact and data valuation problems of AI are also left untouched by the EU-AI law, and are expected to be hotly debated in 2025. The development and dissemination of AI technologies that reduce environmental impact, as well as the use of licensed data sets and Fairly Trained certification, are seen as promising approaches. These bottom-up approaches not only provide a competitive edge for AI companies but also create opportunities for cultural innovation and AI governance.

**"To train AI or not to train; that is the question."**
Several countries have created exceptions in their copyright laws to allow AI companies to train Large Language Models (LLMs) without permission. However, this has raised concerns among copyright owners, who argue that they should be compensated for their work. The issue is complex, as some IP owners restrict access to their copyrighted materials, while others have business models based on licensing. The Digital Creators Coalition has objected to countries creating statutory exceptions for LLM training without authorization or compensation. In the US, OpenAI has submitted an open letter to the White House, asking for the right to scrape everything under fair use principles, while advocating against foreign LLM developers doing the same under US export policies. The debate is expected to continue as more LLMs appear around the world.

**2025年将开启AI大模型商业应用元年**
The year 2025 is expected to mark the beginning of the commercial application of large AI models. Since the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) was first proposed by British mathematician Alan Turing in 1950, humans have never stopped exploring the field of AI. The emergence of Chat-GPT in 2022 marked an important milestone in AI technology, showcasing its exceptional capabilities in tasks such as voice and image recognition, and natural language understanding. This breakthrough led to a rapid growth in the development of large models based on massive data and knowledge bases in 2023. In China, numerous large enterprises such as Baidu, Alibaba, Huawei, and Tencent have actively laid out their plans in the field of large models, marking the beginning of the 'big model war'. The development of large models has been extremely rapid, from its inception to practical application, and has quickly entered the price war stage characteristic of the internet industry. On December 26, 2024, a major news broke in the global AI technology field, particularly in China, which is currently in the midst of a price war - DeepSeek, a company under the Fantasy Group, officially launched its new series of models, DeepSeek-V3, and simultaneously open-sourced it. This version achieved a significant improvement in training efficiency and inference speed while reducing the training cost by 42.5%. This not only means that AI large models will gradually become more accessible, providing strong support for the widespread deployment of various AI applications, but also indicates that with the improvement in training efficiency, the demand for inference computing power will increase significantly, bringing about a golden opportunity for the accelerated commercialization of AI industry chain. AI large models are transitioning from technological innovation to industrial innovation, with algorithm innovation and model optimization leading to a significant decrease in inference costs. Numerous AI native applications are redefining our interactions with the digital and physical worlds. Chinese Academy of Engineering member Wu Haokun pointed out that although large models have shown excellent general capabilities, they are difficult to become a rigid demand for users in chat applications. To fully demonstrate the value of large models, it is crucial to apply them to specific industries and achieve landing. Baidu founder and chairman Li Yanhong believes that the true sign of humans entering the AI era is not the emergence of numerous large models, but the emergence of a large number of AI native applications. He emphasized that in the future, we will need tens of millions of AI native applications, rather than just a few dozen so-called large models. NVIDIA CEO Huang Renxun also predicted that the competition in the AI field will drive the emergence of a series of ready-to-use artificial intelligence tools, from chip design and software development to drug research and radiology, and various companies will integrate their unique technologies, data, and AI capabilities to achieve greater efficiency. How to utilize AI large models to achieve commercial value, especially how to combine AI technology with market demand, has become a key factor for enterprises to stand out. In the digital city of Hangzhou, where DeepSeek is located, the Zhejiang Water Conservancy Cultural Group Co., Ltd. has been keenly aware of the enormous potential of this field since AI large models were not yet widely recognized by the public. After years of technical accumulation and low-key development, the company innovatively developed the 'Shoot-AI' model, integrating AI with face recognition, intelligent shooting, and voice models, and integrating cloud computing, big data, and other cutting-edge technologies. Through relentless technical research and iteration, the company has gradually perfected its 'AI large model + scene application' layout, building a complete commercial application system. Customized 'AI model + scene application' solutions will be the main battlefield after the 'big model war'. The Zhejiang Water Conservancy Cultural Group has tailored a set of intelligent solutions for the tourism market, injecting new vitality into the development of the tourism industry and creating a pioneering model for the combination of AI large models and market demand. At the same time, the company has achieved a significant reduction in training costs through algorithm innovation and model optimization, with one engineer able to train a scene model on a single H-100 chip in a month, which has also saved costs. (The Zhejiang Water Conservancy Cultural Group has cooperated with scenic spots across the country to accelerate the commercial application of AI technology.) Since the 'Shoot-AI' model was launched, the Zhejiang Water Conservancy Cultural Group has rapidly expanded its commercial layout across the country, with over 500 scenic spots successfully applying the technology, and the platform has accumulated over 6 million users. Moreover, the company has extended the 'Shoot-AI' model to exhibition halls, competitions, and other scenarios, further expanding the possibilities of technology application. For example, in the exhibition hall, the Zhejiang Water Conservancy Cultural Group has partnered with the Hangzhou City Planning Exhibition Hall to use the 'Shoot-AI' model technology to analyze visitors' behavior and preferences during their visit, providing personalized tour videos to deepen their understanding and appreciation of history and culture, and also providing a new way and means for cultural dissemination. In the field of competitions, the company has also shown outstanding performance, with AI intelligent shooting systems able to accurately capture the highlight moments of each participating athlete in complex marathon competitions, which have become precious memories for the athletes and provided a highly infectious material for promoting the competition. In the midst of the intense competition in the AI large model industry, the Zhejiang Water Conservancy Cultural Group has relied on its rich practical application scenarios to provide high-quality services and value to users, while also winning a broad market space and development opportunities for itself. The company has broken through the scene innovation barrier, driving the fusion application of AI large models in various fields of the economy and society, and will promote the development of the entire AI large model industry towards a more healthy, orderly, and sustainable direction. In the future, with the continuous development and commercialization of AI technology, AI large models will create actual value in more fields, driving the comprehensive development of society and economy!

**The AI Act: KI only with a driver's license**
The AI Act, which came into effect in August 2024, requires companies using or operating AI models to ensure that their employees have 'sufficient AI competence'. This obligation will take effect in six months, on February 1, 2025. The EU directive is unclear about what 'sufficient competence' means and who is considered a 'operator' of a model. However, it is generally assumed that companies that operate their own Large Language Models (LLMs) have a basic level of competence. The main obligation is to train users of such models, which is undoubtedly necessary for all companies. A corresponding proof that such training has taken place should be available to protect against potential legal disputes. The rapidly evolving development of AI tools poses significant risks. For example, companies that have used Suno.ai's AI-generated music in the past six months may be confronted with the possibility that the tool is 'illegal' due to a GEMA lawsuit. There is no explicit obligation to external training, but internal training or AI guidelines can also convey the necessary knowledge. The question remains how to ensure that employees have actually read these guidelines. The Bitkom industry association recommends booking online courses, which has two advantages: it clearly documents the company's efforts and also conveys advanced AI knowledge that can further increase efficiency. In terms of 'sufficient competence', it is about technical knowledge, including the understanding of algorithm functionality. This does not involve code, but rather the fact that Large Language Models are trained with data and that as long as the source of the data is not clearly known, there is a risk of copyright infringement. Additionally, regulatory aspects should be trained, such as data protection (no customer data in the cloud), which is based on the GDPR, and the labeling of AI content or fact-checking. The third aspect concerns specific applications, such as image generation, where copyrighted images cannot be used as templates for the AI.

**Training AI Models May Not Require Massive Data Centers in the Future**
The training of AI models may not require massive data centers in the future. Distributed training is changing the rules, reducing costs while improving model generalization. The competition for supercomputing clusters, once a status symbol for billionaires, is becoming unsustainable. As the number of chips increases, so does the burden of synchronization, and the time spent on data transfer in data centers far exceeds the actual computation time, leading to diminishing returns. Computer scientists are exploring more intelligent and resource-efficient training methods. One possible approach is to abandon dedicated large-scale computing clusters and use multiple small data centers to complete training tasks in a distributed manner. Some experts believe that this could pave the way for even more radical goals: training without dedicated hardware. Google DeepMind engineer Arthur Douillard proposed an innovative solution: reducing the frequency of checkpoint recording. His team published a method called 'Distributed Low-Communication Language Model Training' (DiLoCo) in late 2023, which suggests dividing training into multiple 'island-style' data centers. The method has its trade-offs. Compared to models trained in a single data center, distributed training models perform slightly worse on specific tasks but better on novel problems. This may be because each 'island' can explore more paths in the absence of constraints, similar to group research projects. Prime Intellect founder Vincent Weisser developed OpenDiLoCo based on DiLoCo and used 30 GPU clusters to train a 10 billion parameter model called Intellect-1, showing significant efficiency gains. Weisser said that this method not only reduces dependence on scarce large data centers but also makes training resources more decentralized, avoiding over-concentration in a particular country or company. The ultimate dream is to completely eliminate dedicated hardware and distribute training tasks to consumer-level devices, such as billions of iPhones. However, this requires overcoming hardware performance and storage bottlenecks, as well as new computing technologies. Despite the challenges, the potential of distributed training methods is exciting. With reduced training costs, perhaps billionaires will need to find new competition.

**US Imposes New Restrictions on AI Chip Exports to Maintain Leadership**
The US government has announced new restrictions on the export of chips and AI-related technologies, aiming to maintain the country's advanced computational power and prevent China's access to it. The new regulations will limit the number of chips that can be exported to most countries, while allowing unlimited access to AI technologies for the US's closest allies. China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea will be excluded from exporting chips. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, 'The US leads in AI - whether in developing AI or designing chips, it's essential to continue this status.' These regulations are a culmination of four years of efforts by the Biden administration to prevent China's access to advanced chips that could enhance its military capabilities, and to maintain the US's leadership in AI through controlling the flow of chips and AI development globally. It is unclear how the Trump administration will implement these regulations, but both administrations share similar views on the competitive threat from China. The regulations will take effect 120 days after publication, giving the Trump administration time to intervene. New restrictions will be imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to run data centers necessary for training AI models, and most of these chips are made by NVIDIA, which is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Cloud service providers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon will be allowed to request global licenses to build data centers, which will exempt their projects from country-specific chip quotas, and to obtain approval, companies must comply with strict conditions, including security requirements, reporting requirements, and a human rights plan or record. Strong voices in the industry, such as NVIDIA, have criticized these regulations before their release, describing them as 'a significant overreach' and saying that the White House will tighten restrictions on 'technology already available in main gaming consoles and consumer devices.' Oracle, a data center provider, argued earlier this month that these regulations will give 'most of the global AI and GPU market to our Chinese competitors.' The regulations impose global licensing requirements on some chips, with exceptions, and set controls for 'model weights' for the latest 'closed-weight' AI models, which help determine decision-making in machine learning, and are often the most valuable elements in an AI model. The regulations divide the world into three categories, with about 18 countries, including Japan, the UK, South Korea, and the Netherlands, being largely exempt from these regulations, while about 120 other countries will face restrictions. Additionally, it is likely that US service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft will be allowed to obtain global licenses, but they will be allowed to deploy only 50% of their AI computing power outside the US, not exceeding 25% in any country in the first category, and not exceeding 7% in any non-first-category country. AI has the potential to increase access to healthcare, education, food, and other benefits, but it can also help develop biological weapons and other weapons, support cyber attacks, and assist in surveillance and other human rights violations. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said, 'The US must be prepared for a rapid increase in AI capabilities in the coming years, which could have a transformative impact on our economy and national security.'
