**The Örebro Mass Shooting: A Case of Downplayed Terrorism?**
The investigation into the Campus Risbergska mass shooting in Örebro, Sweden is complete. The police initially downplayed the incident, stating 'nothing suggests a political or ideological motive.' However, the investigation found that the shooter, Rickard Andersson, had a clear motive to kill immigrants. Despite this, the police and media have continued to portray the incident as a 'school shooting' and not a terrorist attack. The author argues that the police and media have been reluctant to label the incident as a terrorist attack due to the shooter's perceived lack of a 'radical' or 'främlingsfientligt' (anti-immigrant) motive. The investigation found that Andersson had planned the attack for over a year, stockpiling ammunition and choosing a location with a high concentration of immigrants. The author suggests that the police and media have been trying to downplay the incident and avoid labeling it as a terrorist attack. The article also criticizes the Swedish government's response to the incident, with the author stating that 'statsminister Kristersson får skynda sig lite så att han inte går till historien som den sista råttan som lämnade det sjunkande skeppet' (Prime Minister Kristersson should hurry up so he doesn't go down in history as the last rat to leave the sinking ship).

**Sweden to Try Swedish Citizen for Role in Burning Alive of Jordanian Pilot**
Osama Krayem, a 32-year-old Swedish citizen, will face trial in Stockholm on June 4 for his alleged role in the burning alive of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh in Syria in 2015. Krayem has already been linked to two major terrorist attacks in France and Belgium and has been sentenced to 30 years in prison in France and life in prison in Belgium. According to Swedish prosecutors, Krayem 'participated and acted in concert' with other IS members during the execution. 'The bestial murder of a captive being burned alive in a cage was staged in a carefully produced video that was spread globally,' said prosecutor Per Lindqvist to Swedish Radio. Krayem, who was born in Rosengård, Malmö in 1992, traveled to Syria in 2014 to fight for IS and was later identified on Facebook posing with an automatic weapon in front of the IS flag. He returned to Europe with a false passport and was involved in the IS network behind the Paris and Brussels attacks. 'It is painful for my parents to be confronted with this again, but we are grateful for the Swedish authorities' willingness to provide us with justice,' said the pilot's brother, Jawdat al-Kaseasbeh. This case is historic as Sweden is prosecuting crimes committed outside its borders. Krayem, who claims to be innocent, 'it was not me who lit the fire,' is being temporarily transferred from a French prison to face trial in Sweden. He will be returned to France to serve the remainder of his 30-year sentence and then to Belgium to serve his life sentence before facing trial in Sweden.

**Global Terrorism Index 2025: Terrorism Spreads as Lone Wolf Attacks Dominate the West**
The Global Terrorism Index (GTI) 2025 report reveals a significant increase in terrorist attacks worldwide, with 66 countries experiencing a terrorist attack in 2024, up from 58 in 2023. The number of deaths from terrorism remained constant at 11,000, but the number of countries experiencing a deterioration in terrorism increased to 45, while 34 countries improved. The four most lethal terrorist groups intensified their violence, resulting in an 11% increase in deaths. Lone wolf attacks now dominate in the West, accounting for 93% of fatal attacks over the past five years. The conflict in Gaza has intensified instability in the Middle East and fueled hate crimes in the West. Steve Killelea, founder and executive director of the Institute for Economics & Peace, said, 'The GTI 2025 highlights two key concerns: first, 98% of all terrorism-related deaths occurred in conflict zones, and 2024 saw the highest number of conflicts since the end of World War II. Second, social tensions and discontent within the West are fueling solo actor terrorism. The best way to control terrorism is to stop or reduce the number of conflicts.' The Sahel region remains the epicenter of global terrorism, with Burkina Faso, Pakistan, and Syria accounting for the majority of deaths. The Islamic State (IS) remains the most lethal organization, responsible for 1,805 deaths in 22 countries in 2024, a 1% increase from the previous year. The IS-Khorasan Province (ISK) has become one of the most active jihadist groups, carrying out significant attacks in Iran and Russia. The report also notes that the West saw its first significant increase in terrorist incidents since 2017, with attacks rising from 32 to 52. Sweden, Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Switzerland recorded their first attacks in over five years. Germany was the worst-performing country in Europe, ranking 27th globally after the Christmas market attack in Magdeburg.

**Sweden on the Brink of Civil War: A Crisis of Security and Identity**
Sweden is on the brink of civil war, with a severe security crisis unfolding. The country has seen a significant increase in gang-related violence, terrorist attacks, and explosions, with 391 shootings in 2022, resulting in 62 deaths. According to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå), the rate of firearm-related deaths is now more than twice the European average. The recent attack on a educational center, which killed 10 people, was described as 'the most shocking in Swedish history' by Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. The rise in armed violence is largely attributed to gang wars, where adolescents aged 14-19 are used as executioners by foreign criminal leaders. The Swedish justice system is also criticized for being ineffective in dealing with radicalization and gangs. Criminologist Erdvan Khoshnud argues that the current legislation does not allow for sufficient deterrent sentences for criminals, particularly young offenders. The government has announced drastic measures, including a proposal to revoke the citizenship of individuals with dual nationality who are deemed a threat to national security. However, the Swedish constitution currently prohibits the revocation of citizenship, and the government plans to submit a reform to a vote in 2026. The opposition considers this measure excessive and contrary to Swedish values.

**Sweden Shaken by Two Major Incidents: School Shooting and Murder of Salwan Momika**
Sweden was shocked by two major incidents this week. One was the murder of Salwan Momika, a TikTok user known for burning the Quran, who was shot and killed by an armed attacker while live-streaming on the platform. The other was a school shooting in the city of Örebro, where 11 people were killed. The two incidents occurred within a week of each other, raising questions about whether they were coincidental. The motive behind the school shooting, which was described by Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson as the worst attack in Swedish history, is still unknown, as well as the number of fatalities and the identity of the perpetrator. The Swedish police are reluctant to label the attack as a 'terrorist act', despite the fact that the attacker targeted a school that provides education to immigrants. The school, called Campus Risbergska, offers classes for adults, immigrants, and people with mental disabilities. The timing of the attack, which occurred just days after Momika's death, has raised questions about whether it was a revenge attack. In recent years, Sweden has seen an increase in armed and bomb attacks, often linked to organized crime. According to security forces, there were 296 armed attacks in Sweden in 2024, resulting in 44 deaths and 66 injuries. The highest number of armed attacks was recorded in 2022, with 391 attacks, 62 deaths, and 107 injuries. There have also been several violent incidents in Swedish schools, including a 2022 incident in which an 18-year-old student stabbed and killed two teachers in Malmö. The recent school shooting has also been compared to a 2015 attack on a school in Trollhattan, where a man stabbed and killed a teacher and a student. The attacker, identified as 21-year-old Anton Lundin Pettersson, was described as an extreme right-wing sympathizer and was shot and killed by police.

**Sweden's Rise in Violence: A Growing Concern**
Sweden, known for its peace and high quality of life, was shaken by a devastating attack that killed 11 people, including the perpetrator, in a school for adults. The attack, carried out with a firearm obtained illegally, has raised concerns in a country that was previously considered a safe haven. Despite initial investigations, authorities have ruled out any connection to terrorist groups or organized crime, but family and neighbors describe the perpetrator as isolated and introverted. This attack highlights a growing reality: Sweden, once considered one of the most peaceful countries in the world, is experiencing a rising wave of violence. In the last decade, the country has seen a significant increase in violent crimes, and in 2023, it became the second country in the world with the highest number of firearm-related deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. The main cause, according to the Swedish government, is a series of 'naive and passive' policies on crime and integration. The government has failed to regulate the entry of individuals into the country, leading to a alarming situation of insecurity. The main threats include organized crime groups such as the 'Mocro Maffia', which controls the European drug market and has established a strong presence in Sweden, using the port of Rotterdam as a point of entry for their merchandise. The government has acknowledged the magnitude of the problem and has stated that it will take at least ten years to eradicate these organized groups. The struggle between gangs for control of the drug and arms trade is a key factor in the increase in violence, with Sweden currently ranking second in the world in deaths by sharp objects and deaths by overdose.

**Sweden's Deadliest Attack: At Least 11 Killed in Shooting Attack**
At least 11 people were killed in a shooting attack in Örebro, Sweden, on Tuesday, making it the deadliest attack in Swedish history. The perpetrator, a 35-year-old unemployed man with a hunting license, was found dead at the scene. According to Swedish media, he used a hunting rifle during the attack. The police have confirmed that the attacker had no prior contact with the police and was not known to have any connections to crime. The attack occurred at a school where students who have not completed formal education or need to improve their grades to attend further education are taught. The police have not found any indications that the attack was motivated by ideology or terrorism. According to Swedish news outlet SVT, the attacker used a hunting rifle during the attack. Swedish Minister of Justice Gunnar Strömmer confirmed at a press conference on Tuesday that the attacker was a male. A relative of the attacker told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that he was a simple person with limited contact with his family. The attack comes at a time when Sweden is discussing gun control and the increasing number of armed robberies. Although Sweden has a high rate of gun ownership compared to other European countries, mainly due to hunting culture, the police are concerned about the growing problem of illegal firearms and their connection to crime. At least 30 gun attacks have taken place in January this year, and a man who set a mosque on fire was killed in a live broadcast, causing great concern among Swedes. The police are now investigating the attacker's actions before the attack and will release further information.

**Sweden's Worst Mass Shooting: 10 Killed in School Attack**
At least 10 people were killed in a mass shooting at the Risbergska Komvux school, an adult education institution in the Västhaga district of Orebro, Sweden, on Tuesday (4/2/2025) afternoon. This incident is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history. The perpetrator, a 35-year-old man, was reported to be carrying a heavy weapon and stalking the school corridors as students ran for their lives. In a video recording, the armed man appears to be walking back and forth in the school hallway before shooting himself. Swedish police immediately launched a large-scale operation involving special task forces, ambulances, and helicopters. The police also raided the perpetrator's home in the evening around 4:30 pm, followed by a large explosion. Police have not revealed the perpetrator's identity in detail, but confirmed that he acted alone and had no connection to terrorist groups or criminal gangs. However, the investigation is still ongoing to explore the possibility of other parties' involvement. 'We have not found any indications of terrorism in this incident,' said Roberto Eid Forest, Head of Orebro District Police, in a press conference. He also added that the perpetrator was not a member of any gang and assured there was no further threat. Six adults were airlifted to the emergency room at Orebro University Hospital, with five of them suffering gunshot wounds. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson expressed condolences to the families of the victims and described the incident as the worst mass shooting in modern Swedish history. The perpetrator was known to be a reclusive individual with a clean criminal record and held a firearms license. He lived alone in Orebro and wore green clothing during the incident. The police are still working to uncover more details about the incident, including the possible motives behind the brutal act.
