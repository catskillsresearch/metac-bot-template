**Gold Prices Reach $3309 per Ounce in Egypt on Thursday, May 22, 2025**
The Egyptian Gold and Precious Metals Branch announced the latest developments in gold prices in the local market during the morning transactions on Thursday, May 22, 2025, following the increase in prices during yesterday's trading, in line with the global rise in gold prices. The price of an ounce of gold reached $3309. Globally, gold prices reached their highest levels in a week, supported by the decline in the US dollar, amidst uncertainty over future financial policies in the United States. The decline in the dollar's performance comes after Moody's agency downgraded the US credit rating, as well as the escalating disagreements within Congress over the proposed tax law, which raises concerns about its potential impact on the US budget deficit and economic stability. These factors have driven investors to increase their demand for gold as a safe haven, with expectations indicating that the upward trend in gold prices will continue in the medium term, with close monitoring of any developments on the US economic scene.

The gold standard, introduced in the 19th century, provided economic stability and facilitated international trade.

**China's Gold Imports Reach 11-Month High**
China imported 127.5 thousand troy ounces of gold in April, the highest level in 11 months. According to reports, the volume of deliveries increased by 73% compared to March, despite the record price of gold at $3,500 per ounce. The growth in imports is linked to the People's Bank of China's decision to provide new quotas to some commercial banks. This move was made in response to high demand for the precious metal, both from large investors and the general public. Buyers are turning to gold to protect their savings from geopolitical risks. At the beginning of the year, this was the main driver of the metal's price increase. Even after prices decreased slightly in May, the demand from central banks around the world, which aim to reduce their dependence on dollar-denominated assets, remains high. As one expert noted, 'China's gold imports are a sign of the country's efforts to diversify its reserves and reduce its reliance on the US dollar.'

**New Record Price for Gold: What's Next?**
The price of gold has reached a new record high of $2,930 per troy ounce. Analysts believe that the next move will be crucial, with a steep correction possible or the price potentially breaking through the $3,000 mark. The US inflation rate remains high, with a 2.8% year-on-year increase in February, driven by rising costs in healthcare, transportation, and food. This has led to speculation that interest rate cuts by the Fed may be delayed. As a result, investors may turn to gold as a hedge against inflation, benefiting mining companies with gold projects, such as Gold Royalty and Osisko Gold Royalties. Gold Royalty saw a 146% increase in revenue in 2024, while Osisko Gold Royalties pays dividends and reported record revenues for 2024.

**Gold hits record high as Trump tariff worries mount**
Gold prices hit a record high on Friday, reaching $2,799.71 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets due to U.S. tariff concerns. President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada fueled the surge. According to IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong, 'Repeated tariff threats have fuelled safe-haven flows into gold... any downside surprise in the inflation reading could suggest greater policy flexibility for the Fed, potentially bringing forward rate-cut expectations and providing further support for gold.' The December U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report will be closely watched for further clues on interest rate trajectory. With 12.9 million troy ounces of gold delivered to COMEX-approved warehouses since late November, raising stocks by 73.5% to 30.4 million ounces, the highest since July 2022, further gains could be in store for gold if tariff threats become a reality. Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade, said prices could ascend to new highs north of the $2,800 level.

**Gold and Silver Expected to Reach New Highs in 2025**
According to a report by Troy Kıymetli Maden Ticareti, gold and silver are expected to reach new highs in 2025. The report predicts that gold's price will exceed $3,000 per ounce due to geopolitical risks and central banks' interest rate cuts, making gold more attractive to investors and driving its price to new highs. Silver had a strong 2024 and is expected to perform similarly in 2025, with prices potentially exceeding $40 per ounce due to interest rate cuts and increased industrial demand. The report also notes that 2025 will be a 'bull market' for precious metals, including gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, creating a positive environment for investors and driving the value of these metals up. Overall, the expectation is that 2025 will be a positive year for the precious metals market.
