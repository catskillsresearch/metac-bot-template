**AI could 'devastate' Earth's population down to the size of the UK by...**
Subhash Kak, a computer science professor at Oklahoma State University, predicts that the Earth's population will decline drastically due to the rise of artificial intelligence. He believes that AI will replace most human jobs, leading to a significant decrease in birth rates as people will be hesitant to have children who may be unemployed. According to Kak, the global population could collapse to as low as 100 million people by 2300, which is roughly the population of the UK. He notes that this trend is already happening, citing the declining birth rates in Europe, China, Japan, and Korea. Kak agrees with Elon Musk's warning that humanity should consider colonizing Mars to ensure its survival. 'It's going to be devastating for society and world society,' Kak said. 'I think people really don't have a clue.'

**Cambiamenti climatici: come 'visualizzarli' attraverso i ghiacci**
The 'Follow the Ice' project, supported by Sea Beyond, an educational initiative of the Prada Group, has begun its first expedition to the Corbassière glacier. The team, consisting of 13 members, including guides, a videomaker, and a nurse-cook, has extracted two ice cores. The results of the analysis will be known in the coming months. Victor Zagorodnov, a veteran of glacial drilling, described the psychological challenges faced in such hostile environments, comparing the experience to a long mental training. The collected ice will be divided: one part will be studied in Italy, the other will be preserved in Antarctica, where it will be stored in a specially carved cave to create a global ice archive. Carlo Barbante, co-founder of the Ice Memory Foundation, concluded that 'the ice will be a time capsule of the past, allowing us to understand the climate of the past and predict the future.'

**Is the Ozone Layer Repairing Itself? Scientists Think So**
New data from NASA and NOAA indicates that the ozone layer is on a path to recovery, with the hole over Antarctica shrinking to its seventh smallest size since 1992. According to NASA's ozone research team, the 2024 Antarctic hole is smaller than ozone holes seen in the early 2000s, reflecting the positive impact of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which aimed to phase out CFCs. Dr. Newman shared, 'The 2024 Antarctic hole is smaller than ozone holes seen in the early 2000s.' The protocol has helped limit damage to the ozone layer, allowing it to begin recovering gradually. Scientists believe the ozone layer could return to its natural thickness by 2066 if recovery continues, but caution that the full repair will take time due to the persistence of CFCs in the atmosphere.

**40% of Glaciers Already Lost Irreversibly, 11 cm Sea Level Rise Expected**
Even if global warming stops at its current level, 39% of non-polar glaciers worldwide will disappear irreversibly, according to researchers in 'Science'. This would already lead to an additional 11 cm of sea level rise. If the climate change continues to intensify as predicted to 2.7°C warming, 76% of glaciers would be lost. The team emphasizes that it is still worth striving for the 1.5°C goal. Glaciers are melting worldwide, from the Alps to Alaska, and the first ones have already disappeared. The accumulating meltwater threatens mountain habitats and increases the risk of rockfalls due to the lack of ice. Additionally, the shrinking ice masses lead to a decrease in water resources in many regions. The sea level rises due to the meltwater. The problem is that glaciers react slowly to climate change, taking decades to centuries to show the effects of the current warming. This means that a significant part of the currently intact ice has already been lost. 'The current size of the glaciers shows by far not the extent of the already occurred climate change. Their situation is much worse than what is visible in the mountains today,' says co-author Lilian Schuster from the University of Innsbruck. An international team led by Schuster and Harry Zekollari from the Free University of Brussels has now calculated the long-term ice loss of more than 200,000 glaciers outside of Greenland and Antarctica using eight different models. The scenarios included a sudden stop of climate change, as well as warming by 1.5°C and 2.7°C. The latter will occur if current climate protection measures are not strengthened.

**Expert Predicts Human Population Will Collapse to 100 Million by 2300 Due to AI**
Subhash Kak, a computer scientist and professor at the University of Oklahoma, predicts that the human population will drastically decrease by 2300 due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). According to Kak, 'computers or robots will never be conscious, but they will literally do everything we do, because most of what we do in our lives can be replaced.' He believes that the population will collapse and could reduce to just 100 million people worldwide by 2300 or 2380. Kak attributes this to the fact that people will be reluctant to have children who may be unemployed in adulthood, leading to a decline in birth rates. He also notes that many countries, such as Europe, China, and Japan, are already experiencing a rapid decline in population. Kak suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing other planets may be a viable option to ensure the survival of humanity, but remains cautious, stating that 'this all seems like science fiction. Nobody really knows what's going to happen.' However, he is certain that a population collapse is already underway.

**Jordan's Population Exceeds 11.8 Million as of June 2025**
According to the Jordanian Department of Statistics, the population of Jordan has reached 11,826,144 people as of June 1, 2025. This number reflects the continued demographic growth in recent years. The department emphasized that these figures are based on accurate data, updated regularly, using birth and death statistics, internal and external migration data, and previous population censuses. The population number is a key indicator used to support economic and social planning, determine resource distribution priorities, and improve infrastructure in various governorates. The announcement comes as the Department of Statistics prepares to conduct the general census of population and housing in November 2025, which is expected to be the largest and most comprehensive in Jordan's history. The department called on citizens to cooperate fully with the upcoming census teams, stressing that accurate data contributes to the development of effective policies that benefit everyone.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population ‘the size of UK’ by 2300 & turn entire countries into apocalyptic wastelands**
Computer science professor Subhash Kak warns that AI will lead to a population collapse, shrinking the world's population to 100 million by 2300, which is roughly the size of the UK's current population. He believes that AI will replace 'literally everything' that humans do, including decision-making in offices, leading to a devastating impact on society. Kak points out that demographers are predicting a population collapse due to AI, and that the great cities of the world will be abandoned if the population shrinks to 100 million. He also notes that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who will likely be unemployed in adult life. Kak refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, and suggests that Elon Musk's idea of colonizing space may be a viable option to ensure humanity's survival.

**Global Crises Hinder Efforts to Convince Millions to Quit Smoking**
According to a report presented to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the global crises have hindered efforts to convince millions to quit smoking. The report states that the delay has affected approximately 95 million additional tobacco consumers, who were supposed to stop smoking by 2025. Despite the success of governments in reducing the number of smokers, the failure to reduce the number by 30% means that 1.207 billion and 800,000 people are still smoking worldwide, instead of the target of 1.112 billion and 400,000, according to a Reuters report using smoking rates and population numbers from the report. As the report notes, 'this delay... has affected approximately 95 million additional tobacco consumers, who were supposed to stop smoking by 2025'.

**Population growth limit essential**
The article emphasizes the importance of limiting population growth to prevent ecological disaster. Nature has a carrying capacity that prevents overpopulation, but humans have not implemented similar checks. China's one-child policy from 1980 to 2016 was the only restriction, which kept the population at 1.4 billion instead of 1.8 billion. The article cites the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which reported that March 2025 saw global temperatures at historic highs, with every month since July 2023 being at least 1.5°C hotter than pre-industrial times. The high temperatures contributed to extreme weather events, including heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and droughts. The article also mentions the extent of disappearing Antarctica sea ice, which has reached an equivalent of five times the size of Malaysia. The author argues that three factors in Malaysia have led to human over-population: religious absolutism, economic narrowness, and communal primacy. Religious authorities encourage births without limits, citing scripture that commands humans to 'be fruitful and increase in number.' However, the author argues that these verses must be read in context, considering high newborn and child mortality rates in scriptural times. The article also criticizes the narrow focus of economics, which has resulted in a sharp economy-ecology imbalance. The author suggests that the emphasis on more births rather than climate action is contributing to Malaysia's declining climate survival score.

**French Population Expected to Remain Stable Until 2070 Despite Low Birth Rate**
According to a study by the French National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED), the French population is expected to remain stable until 2070, despite a low birth rate. The study predicts that the population will reach a peak of 70 million in the 2040s before declining to its current level by 2070. In 2025, the population was 68.6 million, with a growth rate of 0.25% over the past year. The natural balance, which is the difference between the number of births and deaths, has contributed only 10% to the population growth. The study notes that the natural balance has decreased from 140,000 in 2019 to 17,000 in 2024 due to an increase in deaths and a decline in births. Laurent Toulemon, a co-author of the study, estimates that 'there is a lot of effort to be made by society to well welcome migrants, who are an asset to the population and a richness if they are integrated.' If the birth rate and migration balance remain at their 2024 levels, the population will continue to grow for two decades, reaching a peak of 70 million in the 2040s, before declining to 68 million by 2070.

**French Population Expected to Remain Stable Until 2070**
According to a study published by the Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), the French population is expected to remain relatively stable until 2070. The population is currently estimated to be 68.6 million, with a growth rate of 0.25% in 2025. The growth is largely due to the positive balance of migration, which is 152,000 people in 2024. The natural balance, which is the difference between births and deaths, has contributed only 1/10 to the population growth, with 17,000 people in 2024. If fertility remains at 1.62 children per woman in 2024, the number of deaths will exceed the number of births from 2027. However, if the migration balance remains at the 2024 level, the population will continue to grow for two decades, reaching a peak of 70 million in the 2040s and then declining to 68 million by 2070. 'There is no reason to panic,' said Laurent Toulemon, co-author of the study. 'The population will age significantly, with a slight increase in men and a decrease in children.' However, the study warns that changes in fertility, migration, or health shocks could alter the size and composition of the future population.

**French Population Expected to Remain Quasi-Stable Until 2070**
A recent study predicts that the French population will reach a peak of approximately 70 million people in the 2040s before declining to around 68 million by 2070, close to the current estimated population of 68.6 million. Despite having fewer births, the population is unlikely to decline significantly due to an aging population and increased life expectancy.

**Immigration crucial to France's population future, study finds**
A recent study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) projects that France's population will reach a peak of 70 million in the 2040s before declining to 68 million by 2070. However, the study's authors, Gilles Pison and Laurent Toulemon, emphasize the crucial role of immigration in this future evolution. They note that without a change in the fertility rate and migration balance in France, the population will not decline for another 20 years, as the positive migration balance will compensate for the decrease and eventual inversion of the natural balance. However, after 2040, the number of deaths will be too high for immigration to compensate for this loss, according to Gilles Pison. The current fertility rate of 1.62 children per woman is not sufficient to achieve the 'demographic rearmament' desired by Emmanuel Macron. To address this, 'there is a lot of effort to be made by society to well welcome migrants, who are an asset to the population and a richness if they are integrated,' says Laurent Toulemon. The population of France is estimated to be 68.6 million at the beginning of 2025, with a growth rate of 0.25% over the past year, mainly due to the positive migration balance (+152,000 people in 2024). The natural balance, which is the difference between births and deaths, has contributed only 1/10 to the increase in population (+17,000 people in 2024). The natural balance has been strongly reduced since 2019 due to the increase in deaths and the decrease in births. If the fertility rate remains at 1.62 children per woman, the number of deaths will exceed the number of births as early as 2027, according to the Ined. However, if the migration balance remains at the 2024 level, the population will continue to grow for two decades, reaching a peak of 70 million in the 2040s before declining to 68 million in 2070. The population will then gradually decline to 68 million by 2070. In this scenario, the French population will be composed of slightly more men and slightly fewer children and elderly women in 2070. However, variations in fertility rates, migration balances, or health shocks, such as the COVID-19 crisis, could modify the size and composition of the future population, warn the researchers. 'It is still possible for fertility to remain high in France, as it has been for 20 years, due to the ease of reconciling family and professional life,' notes Laurent Toulemon. The only certainty is that the French population will age significantly, leading to an increase in the needs for personal services. According to an official report published in 2023, the number of French people aged 75-84 will increase by 50% between 2020 and 2030, from 4.1 to 6.1 million. In the following decade, the number of people over 85 will increase by more than 50%.

**Study Highlights Crucial Role of Immigration in Preventing Decline of French Population**
A recent study by the French National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) suggests that immigration will play a crucial role in preventing the decline of the French population. According to the study, if current demographic trends continue, the population of France will peak at 70 million in the 2040s before returning to 68 million in 2070, which is close to the current level. The authors of the study, Gilles Pison and Laurent Toulemon, emphasize the importance of migration in this future evolution. They note that without a change in the fertility rate and migration balance in France, the population will not decrease for at least 20 years, as the positive migration balance will compensate for the decline and eventual inversion of the natural balance (i.e., more deaths and fewer births). However, after 2040, the number of deaths will be too high for immigration to compensate for this loss, according to Gilles Pison. The study also highlights the importance of integrating migrants, who are a valuable addition to the population, to ensure their successful integration. The population of France is currently estimated to be 68.6 million, with a growth rate of 0.25% over the past year, mainly due to the positive migration balance (+152,000 people in 2024). The natural balance, which is the difference between the number of births and deaths, has contributed only 1/10 to the increase in population (+17,000 people in 2024). The natural balance has been significantly reduced since 2019 due to two factors: the increase in deaths, linked to the arrival of the baby-boom generations at high mortality ages, and the decline in births, which is more difficult to explain. If the fertility rate remains at 1.62 children per woman in 2024, the number of deaths will exceed the number of births as early as 2027, according to the Ined. However, if the migration balance remains at the 2024 level, the population will continue to grow for two decades, reaching a peak of 70 million in the 2040s before gradually declining to 68 million in 2070. In this scenario, the French population will be composed of slightly more men and slightly fewer children and elderly women in 2070. However, variations in fertility rates, migration balances, or health shocks, such as the COVID-19 crisis, could modify the size and composition of the future population, warn the researchers.

**French Population to Reach Peak in 2040s Before Declining**
Despite a declining birth rate, the French population is expected to remain relatively stable, reaching a peak of 70 million inhabitants in the 2040s before returning to its current level in 2070, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined). The population has been growing at a rate of 0.25% per year, with 68.6 million inhabitants as of January 2025. However, the natural growth rate, which is the difference between the number of births and deaths, has contributed only a tenth to the population growth. The study highlights that the number of deaths has increased due to the arrival of the baby-boom generations at older ages of high mortality, while the number of births has decreased due to a decline in fertility. If the fertility rate remains at 1.62 children per woman, the number of deaths will exceed the number of births as early as 2027. The population growth is now largely dependent on migration, with a net gain of 152,000 people in 2024. The researchers predict that if the fertility rate and migration rate remain at their current levels, the population will continue to grow until it reaches a peak of 70 million in the 2040s, before declining to 68 million by 2070. However, variations in fertility rates, migration rates, or health shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could modify the size and composition of the future population. 'With 0.8 children per woman, the population is divided by three every 30 years, there is a prospect of the disappearance of the population,' explains Laurent Toulemon, one of the authors of the Ined study. 'But in France, we are not in this situation at all.'

**Belgian Population Projections: 8 Million Flemings in 2070**
According to the new population projections by the Belgian Planning Bureau and Statbel, the population of Flanders is expected to grow from 6.8 million in 2024 to 8 million in 2070. The total population of Belgium is projected to reach 12.9 million by 2070, while the population of Wallonia and Brussels is expected to remain relatively stable. The growth in population is mainly due to the international migration balance, which is expected to remain stable at around 30,000 people per year until 2070. By the late 2030s, the natural balance (births minus deaths) is expected to become negative, with the number of births decreasing to 1.6 per woman by 2035, down from 1.9 in the late 2000s and 1.5 in the last year. 'The international migration balance will be the main driver of population growth until the end of the 2030s,' said the Planning Bureau. 'After that, it will be the only growth factor.'

**World Population to Peak at 10.3 Billion in 2080s, Then Decline**
According to the United Nations, the world population will reach a peak of 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, but then will begin to decline. The population growth rate is slowing down and will eventually turn negative due to a decline in fertility rates. The UN report highlights the differences in population growth rates among countries, with some countries, such as those in Africa, experiencing rapid growth, while others, such as Italy, Russia, and China, are experiencing a decline. The report suggests that the decline in population can be an opportunity to mitigate the effects of overpopulation and to implement more sustainable development and consumption models. However, the impact on climate change is uncertain, as a decline in population may lead to a decrease in emissions, but it may also lead to an increase in consumption and emissions.
