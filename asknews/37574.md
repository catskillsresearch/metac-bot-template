**Canada's summer forecast 2025: Hot and dry conditions a concern for wildfires  | Globalnews.ca**
Canada's summer forecast for 2025 is predicting a hot and dry season, particularly in southern British Columbia and most of Alberta. This could exacerbate the ongoing wildfire season, with heat waves and heat domes becoming increasingly likely in July and August. Northern B.C. is expected to see near-normal precipitation and temperatures. Central Canada will experience a transition from cool and unsettled weather in May to near-seasonal temperatures and frequent showers in June. The Prairies can expect warm and muggy nights, while Atlantic Canada is likely to have a mild summer with frequent showers and thunderstorms. NOAA is forecasting an active hurricane season, which could bring heavy rainfall to the region. Computer models are also showing a higher likelihood of low pressure across Canada's far north, which could limit Arctic ice loss and bring above-normal precipitation to the area.

**Summer 2025 forecast calls for 'overwhelmingly above normal' heat starting in June**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center has forecast an 'overwhelmingly above normal' heat for the summer of 2025, starting in June. According to Johnna Infanti, a meteorologist for NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, model guidance indicates that the U.S. and most of Alaska will experience hotter-than-normal temperatures. The hottest temperatures are expected in the West, Southwest, Florida, and New England. The summer forecast also calls for an overall hotter and drier season, with below-normal precipitation in the Northwest, Northern Rockies, and Great Plains, and drought persisting or expanding in these regions. The Eastern U.S. is expected to see a wetter summer, including drought relief later in June. Additionally, parts of the nation have a greater likelihood of significant wildfires, particularly in the coastal Southeast, central Texas, the Four Corners, and parts of California and the Pacific Northwest in June, and in Hawaii, the Southern Plains, and parts of the Great Basin, California, and the Northwest in July and August.

**Summer 2025: A Hot and Unpredictable Season Ahead?**
The first weather predictions for the summer of 2025 indicate that temperatures will be above normal. While a heatwave is not guaranteed, there is a risk of heatwaves, particularly in the south and east of France. According to Guillaume Séchet, a meteorologist, 'We are heading towards a hot summer, but it does not mean that there will be long heatwaves or that the season will be exceptionally hot.' He also notes that instability could be marked, with 'frequent thunderstorms, particularly in the south and east of the country.' The predictions are uncertain, and the models used by experts can only anticipate global trends, such as temperature or precipitation anomalies over a month. 'They cannot predict the occasional heatwaves or violent storms,' Séchet explains. The southwest of France could experience record-breaking heat in late May, indicating an unusually hot start to the season. The regions of the south and east are most likely to be affected by potential heatwaves. In contrast, the northwest, under the influence of the ocean, may remain cooler.

**More record heat expected after a decade of hottest years on record**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has projected that there is an 80% chance that at least one of the next five years will exceed 2024 as the warmest on record. The WMO's five-year forecast also states that there is a 70% chance that the next five years (2025 to 2029) will be 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer. This is due to Arctic warming, which is predicted to continue to outstrip the global average. WMO forecasters warned that every additional fraction of a degree of warming drives more harmful heatwaves, extreme rainfall events, intense droughts, and rising sea levels. WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett said, 'Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems, and our planet.' The warmer weather is expected to bring more rain and snow to places such as northern Europe, Siberia, and Alaska, and drier conditions in the U.S. and Amazon.

**NOAA Predicts Record-Breaking Summer Heat in the United States**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts that the summer of 2025 will be one of the hottest on record in the United States. Extreme heat could be widespread and relentless, with only the extreme north of Alaska potentially escaping unusually high temperatures from June to August. In fact, many parts of the country are already experiencing summer-like weather. In International Falls, Minnesota, temperatures around +32°C were recorded in early May, while in the southern region, hot and dry conditions have contributed to the spread of wildfires, prompting Governor Tim Walz to call in the National Guard. The NOAA's latest update warns that the lack of spring rainfall and extremely high temperatures are causing rapid snowmelt in the western United States, increasing the risk of summer drought and wildfires. The drier-than-normal climate has also exacerbated the ongoing drought in Florida and the Mid-Atlantic states. Meanwhile, experts fear that widespread personnel cuts and reduced funding for federal science, forecasting resources, and disaster response agencies will hinder efforts to ensure public safety. In Texas, where cuts to the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (Doge) of Donald Trump have left the Houston office of the National Weather Service understaffed and without permanent leadership, a record-breaking heatwave continues to intensify, with another intense hurricane season looming. A heatwave in mid-May in the Rio Grande Valley briefly made the region the hottest in Death Valley. Federal scientific agencies like the NOAA are now operating at reduced capacity despite the enormous meteorological threats. Hundreds of meteorologists have left the National Weather Service in recent months, and several offices, including the Houston office, have had to reduce services. Now, state and local officials, university staff, and non-profit organizations are taking on the task of educating the public about extreme heat and other meteorological phenomena. Climatologist Sylvia Dee and her colleagues at Rice University in Houston describe the excessive heat as a form of 'slow violence' that exacerbates other public health threats, such as air pollution and pre-existing conditions. 'There are so many things that revolve around heat stress,' she said.

**2025 may be second-warmest year on Earth, just behind 2024**
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2025 has a 39% chance of being the second-warmest year on record, behind 2024, and a 3% chance of being the warmest year on record. The first three months of 2025 were the second-warmest Q1 recorded, with the global average temperature for April 2025 being 1.08 degrees Fahrenheit above average. A heat dome is expected to persist, keeping temperatures 15 to 20 degrees above average, and the National Weather Service has issued heat advisories for areas in Texas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises residents to take precautions to prevent heat exhaustion or heat stroke, such as wearing light clothing, drinking lots of water, and avoiding exertion outside. As explained by William Gallus, professor of atmospheric science at Iowa State University, 'The heat dome can stretch over several states and linger for days to weeks, leaving the people, crops and animals below to suffer through stagnant, hot air that can feel like an oven.'

**NOAA's predictions for summer 2025 just got even hotter**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its updated weather outlook for the summer of 2025, predicting a hot summer across the United States. According to the Climate Prediction Center, all states are favored to see a warmer-than-average summer season, with the highest chances of extra-hot weather in parts of Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico, which have a 60% to 70% chance of hotter-than-normal temperatures. Climate change is likely expanding the summer season, meaning that hotter temperatures will start earlier and end later, according to Sylvia Dee, an assistant professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Rice University in Houston. 'I think that this is our new normal, for sure. I think we should be prepared as Texans, but also across the country, for these changes - higher temperatures, more persistent heat events,' Dee said. 'Somewhere every month and every year, temperature records are being broken,' Dee added. The precipitation outlook is less consistent, with the Pacific Northwest and a central band of the country favored to see less rain than usual, while the East Coast, Gulf Coast, Alaska, and Arizona are favored to see more.

**Scotland sees hottest day of 2025 so far warmer than California as scorcher continues - Daily Record**
Scotland has experienced its hottest day of 2025 so far, with temperatures reaching 25.4C in Auchincruive, South Ayrshire. This surpasses the previous record of 24.4C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, and even beats the average temperature in Los Angeles, California, which is 23.6C in May. The Met Office predicts that the heat will continue in Scotland, with Argyll and Bute expected to reach 23C on Tuesday, May 13, and the western Highlands reaching 25C on Friday, May 16. In contrast, England was hit by thunderstorms on Monday, with reports of hail, lightning strikes, and heavy rain. Met Office forecaster Ellie Glaisyer said, 'We have seen quite a few thunderstorms breaking out... mainly across central and southern parts of England and north-westwards over the past couple of hours into parts of Wales.' Met Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Dan Harris assured that high pressure will bring settled, dry, and warm conditions for the remainder of the week, with daytime temperatures well above average in central, southern, and western areas. 'The settled weather is expected to continue into the weekend too as high pressure remains centred over the UK,' Dan confirmed.

The Met Office has confirmed that today, May 1st, is the hottest day of the year so far with temperatures reaching 28C in the UK. This marks the warmest start to May on record, surpassing the previous record of 27.4C set in 1990. Despite the heat, forecasters say it is not hot enough to declare an official heatwave, and the UK Health Security Agency will not issue a heat-health alert. Michael Silverstone, deputy chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said, 'The weekend will bring cooler conditions, with more average temperatures for all parts by Sunday.' The weather is expected to take a step down from the glorious sunshine and heat experienced this week, with temperatures set to drop and some areas due to get typical British rain.

**2025 May Become One of the Hottest Years in History, According to Russian Meteorological Center**
According to Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia, 2025 may become one of the hottest years in history, possibly entering the top three or five warmest years on record. However, the calculations are still being refined, Vilfand said in an interview with RIA Novosti. 'Several forecasts suggested that this year would be among the top three or five warmest, and one forecast even predicted it would be second. But these are just calculations that remind me of inflation forecasts. We shouldn't take this seriously for now. This forecast will be refined in the middle of the year,' Vilfand noted. The abnormally high temperatures in 2024 were linked to the natural phenomenon of El Niño, which involves a rise in sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. This process affects global air and ocean circulation, leading to an increase in average global temperatures. El Niño lasted from May 2023 to April 2024, after which it transitioned to a neutral phase. However, its impact persisted, making 2024 the hottest year on record. Now, El Niño has been replaced by its opposite, La Niña, which involves cooling of the Pacific Ocean waters and affects the climate worldwide. According to preliminary forecasts, La Niña will be short-lived, transitioning to a neutral phase in April 2025.

**2025 May Enter Top 3 or 5 Hottest Years on Record, Says Russian Meteorologist**
Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, stated that 2025 may be one of the top three or five hottest years on record. However, these calculations will be refined in the coming year. Vilfand explained that the natural phenomenon of La Niña, which is characterized by a decrease in water temperature in the equatorial part of the Pacific Ocean, has been affecting the climate worldwide. However, according to forecasts, this phenomenon will be short-lived and transition to a neutral phase by April. 'Several forecasts suggested that this year would be among the top three to five hottest. One forecast even predicted that it would be the second-hottest year. But these are just calculations that remind me of inflation forecasts,' Vilfand told RIA Novosti. He emphasized that this forecast is not final and will be refined over the next year. The change in ocean currents is characterized by the fact that during La Niña, heat from the atmosphere is released into the ocean, while during El Niño, the flow rises from the ocean to the atmosphere, causing an abnormal increase in water temperature in the equatorial part of the Pacific Ocean. The last time El Niño was observed was from May 2023 to April 2024, after which it transitioned to a neutral phase, but its consequences affected the overall temperature on the planet, making 2024 the hottest year on record, surpassing the record of 2023. Climate scientist Nikolai Tereshonok previously stated that winters will become warmer with each passing year, exacerbating the difficulties in growing winter crops. According to him, due to warm temperatures during the winter, the soil does not freeze well, causing winter crops to sprout prematurely.
