**Germany's Chief of Staff Warns of Possible Russian Attack in 2029**
Germany's Chief of the General Staff, General Carsten Breuer, has stated that Russia is likely to attack in four years. According to him, Russia produces around 1,500 main battle tanks per year and significantly increases its military forces. 'Not all tanks are sent to war in Ukraine, but they also go to reserves and new military structures that are always directed against the West,' he said. Breuer also mentioned that in 2024, Russia produced 4 million 152mm artillery shells, not all of which are intended for the front in Ukraine. 'There is an intention and accumulation of reserves for a possible future attack on the Baltic countries,' he added. Breuer estimated that the attack could happen in 2029, but warned that it could happen earlier. 'This is what the analysts estimate - in 2029. So we must be ready for 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029? I would say no, it's not. So we must be ready for battle today,' he emphasized. Breuer named the Suwalki Gap - a section on the border of Poland, Lithuania, Russia, and Belarus - as one of the most vulnerable zones in case of aggression. 'The Baltic states are indeed vulnerable to the Russians, aren't they? And when you're there, you really feel it... during the negotiations we conduct there,' he said. According to him, Estonians compare their situation to feeling heat, seeing flames, and smelling smoke, while in Germany 'you probably see only a little smoke on the horizon.' Breuer also stated that Russia sees the war in Ukraine as 'a continuation' of a broader conflict with NATO and 'tries to find ways to penetrate our defensive lines and test them.' As examples of such actions, he mentioned attacks on underwater cables in the Baltic Sea, cyberattacks on public transportation, and the appearance of drones over critical infrastructure in Germany. Breuer called on NATO allies to urgently increase their defense potential. 'What we need to do now is really take action and say to everyone: 'Hey, increase... invest more in this, because we need it. We need it to be able to defend ourselves, and therefore to increase the deterrent potential,' he emphasized.

**NATO Faces 'Very Serious Threat' from Russia, Says German General**
According to General Carsten Breuer, the inspector general of the German Bundeswehr, NATO is facing a 'very serious threat' from Russia, which he has never seen in his 40 years of service. Russia is increasing its military forces 'on a massive scale', producing around 1,500 main battle tanks annually. Not all of these tanks are sent to the front for the war in Ukraine, but remain in storage and in new military structures always oriented towards the West, said Breuer. Russia has also produced 4.152 million 152mm artillery shells in 2024, and not all of them have gone to war against Ukraine. Breuer stated that Russia is 'intentional' and 'stockpiling' for a possible future attack on Baltic countries. 'This is an assessment of analysts - (the attack may occur in 2029 - 24 Kanal) in 2029. Therefore, we must be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that it will not happen before 2029, I would say no, it is not. Therefore, we must be able to fight today,' said Breuer. The minister named the Suwalki Corridor, a territory bordering Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Belarus, as one of the most vulnerable points for an aggressor's attack. 'The Baltic countries are indeed very vulnerable to the Russians, are they not? And as soon as you're there, you really feel it... in the negotiations we're conducting there,' said Breuer. According to him, Estonians compare a possible war to being near a forest fire, where they 'feel the heat, see the flames, and smell the smoke', while in Germany 'it's probably just a little smoke on the horizon, and no more.' General Breuer said that this demonstrates different views among European states on the threat of a possible Russian attack.

**Ukraine, Russia war escalates before peace talks**
The war between Ukraine and Russia escalated before peace talks, with Ukraine blowing up a Russian highway bridge and launching a bold attack on nuclear-capable bombers deep inside Siberia. At least seven people were killed and 69 injured in the bridge attack. Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov will sit down with Russian officials at the second round of direct peace talks in Istanbul on Monday. Despite the attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, 'We are committed to finding a peaceful solution.' Russia launched 472 drones at Ukraine overnight, the highest nightly total of the war so far. US President Donald Trump has demanded Russia and Ukraine make peace and has threatened to walk away if they do not. The two sides will present their respective documents outlining their ideas for peace terms in Turkey, but it is clear that after three years of intense war, Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart.

**Western Media Predicts Devastating War by 2025**
Western media has gathered predictions from four well-known psychics, including Nostradamus and Bulgarian Baba Vanga, who claim that a devastating war will occur by the end of 2025. According to their predictions, the war will be so catastrophic that it will 'destroy' the population and lead to the 'destruction of humanity'. Atoos Salome, a 38-year-old Brazilian, also known as the 'Living Nostradamus', warned that the world is on the brink of a Third World War, stating that 'it will not be just a war between people, but also between machines, and the worst is yet to come'. Nicholas Aujula, a hypnotherapist from London, agrees that 2025 will be a year of 'lack of compassion' in the world, predicting 'horrific acts of human cruelty and violence towards each other - in the name of religion and nationalism'. The article concludes by speculating that Russia's recent actions, including the annexation of Ukraine and the threat of nuclear war, may be a cause for concern, but ultimately, the predictions of the psychics are unclear and may be a form of propaganda.

**Kremlin Doubts Meeting Between Putin and Trump in 2025**
Kremlin representatives have expressed doubts about a possible meeting between Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump in 2025. According to Yuri Ushakov, Putin's assistant, the Kremlin needs results that can be discussed at the level of Trump and Putin. Ushakov stated that phone conversations between Trump and Putin have already yielded some results, but he is skeptical about an in-person meeting happening before the end of the current year. Ushakov emphasized that a meeting between Putin and Trump must be carefully prepared, as Moscow needs results that can be discussed at the highest level. 'It's not a fact that this will happen this year,' Ushakov said. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted that Russia has been sending 'signals' before the negotiations in Istanbul, continuing to make ultimatums and operating with maximalist demands, and Russian officials signaling an uncompromising position. This suggests that results from the meeting in Istanbul are unlikely.

**Ukraine-Russia Conflict and Israel-Palestina Tensions: Latest Developments**
The conflict between Ukraine and Russia may be entering its final stages, with the inauguration of Donald Trump as US President reportedly accelerating the peace process. Trump has made an offer to Canada, which has been described as a 'threat', and there are already talks of high-level meetings between the Kremlin and the White House to end the war. Meanwhile, Israel has broken the ceasefire with Hamas, and India and Pakistan have entered into conflict after India's recent attack. Other notable news includes: the British Army chief warning of the real threat posed by Russia, the UK praising Finland's efforts to defend itself against Russia, and satellite images showing Russia's actions on the border of NATO, described as 'concerning'. Germany is also preparing for war, fearing a Russian attack before 2029, and Russia has warned Germany of a 'very dangerous step'. Trump has also described Putin as 'completely crazy'.

**Portnikov Predicts War to Continue Until 2032**
According to political observer Vasily Portnikov, the hot phase of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which typically lasts 7-10 years, may continue until 2032. After that, a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings may begin. Portnikov emphasized the need to prepare for a peaceful next phase of the conflict, which could last at least 10-15 years, by receiving help from the Americans and Europeans, improving Ukrainian policy and mobilization, and enhancing Ukraine's military-industrial complex. 'We need to prepare and prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned. He believes that there are no objective grounds for the war to end in the near future, but suggested that under favorable circumstances (Russia's economic situation and US pressure), the fighting may stop in this or the next year. 'The war will not end in our lifetime. The fire will stop,' he stressed.

**Portnikov Predicts War Will Last Until 2032**
According to political analyst Vitaliy Portnikov, the large-scale war between Russia and Ukraine may continue until 2032. He stated that the hot phase of the war, which has been ongoing for 7-10 years, will eventually give way to a phase of conflict with possible battles and bombings. Portnikov emphasized the need to make efforts in the coming years to ensure that the next phase of the conflict is peaceful and lasts for at least 10-15 years. 'We need to prepare for a war that is still very short in terms of the nature of this conflict, very. This is only the first stage. There will be a second, third,' Portnikov warned.

**Pompeo: 'US cannot abandon Ukraine in its war against Russia'**
Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the US cannot abandon Ukraine in its war against Russia. 'The US cannot turn its back and walk away, leaving Ukraine to fend for itself. This would haunt us for the rest of our history. If we consider the situation in terms of a chess game, we do not view Ukraine as a pawn that can be sacrificed. It will not happen,' Pompeo said at the Black Sea Security Forum in Odessa. He added that the US has learned many lessons from the war, including the use of drones, and that American military can prepare to apply these lessons. Pompeo acknowledged that many of his Republican colleagues have been disappointed with their stance on Ukraine and expressed regret that more was not done in 2024. He also shared his thoughts on negotiations, referencing the Minsk experience. 'When Vladimir Putin lays down his arms, we cannot return to Russian gas. When Putin lays down his arms, it cannot be the same life as before. There must be an understanding that this can happen again - not in Ukraine, but on NATO's northern flank,' Pompeo said. US President Donald Trump promised to end the war in 24 hours, then 100 days, and now openly says that there is a possibility of the US withdrawing from the negotiation process. Despite negotiations, Russia continues to mass-attack peaceful Ukrainian cities. In light of Putin's apparent unwillingness to end the war, US lawmakers have prepared a bipartisan bill to impose new sanctions on Russia, including a 500% tariff on goods from countries that buy Russian energy resources. However, the bill has not yet passed the Senate and House of Representatives. Trump says he 'does not know' if he will support the strengthening of sanctions against Russia, saying he needs to see the bill first.

**Afghan Mathematician Predicts Global Upheavals and Russia's Rise**
Afghan mathematician and prophet Siddiq Afghani predicts a turning point in 2025, stating that 'America will be exhausted, and if Russia retreats, it will cease to exist.' He believes that numbers hold the key to fate, and his predictions have come true one by one. Afghani warns of serious upheavals and says that evil has already been marked. He claims that the root of global evil is the US, and its downfall is near. He also states that the war between good and evil is between England and Satan, with the US being the latter. Afghani believes that the US is on its last leg and will soon be exhausted. He also predicts the collapse of the European Union between 2027 and 2032, depending on Russia's resolve and gas supplies. He warns that a third world war will not occur before 2055, but instead, it will be a battle of codes, hackers, and networks. Afghani urges Russia to strengthen its army and develop technologies, as a step back in this confrontation could be fatal. He advises Russia to win in Ukraine, saying 'There is one step. One step back from Ukraine - Russia will not be. You will win in Ukraine. This is my advice.'

**Russia's Threat Goes Beyond Ukraine, Says Dutch Prime Minister**
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that the threat from Russia is not limited to Ukraine and is increasingly taking on hybrid forms. Rutte made this statement in a social media post on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands from Nazi occupation. 'The war that ended 80 years ago reminds us that freedom cannot be taken for granted. We see today on the eastern edge of Europe that Ukraine is seriously involved in the struggle for its future existence as a nation, as well as for its own peace and security. The threat from Russia also goes beyond Ukraine and is increasingly taking on hybrid forms,' Rutte said. According to Rutte, this is why Europe needs to invest more in its own security. 'European countries have a great responsibility to do what they can on a national level to develop a stronger European pillar in NATO,' Rutte added. The threat of a Russian attack on NATO is a possibility that has been discussed in the media and by experts. In 2023, Western media reported on the possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2025. In Germany, there were warnings of a possible Russian attack from 2026 or later. The American intelligence community has stated that Russia does not want a direct military conflict with the US and NATO, but will continue to engage in asymmetric activities that do not cross the threshold of a global military conflict. In December 2024, a Finnish newspaper reported that Russia was practicing an attack on Finland and the Baltic states, including Estonia, as well as Norway, and had not ruled out carrying out the attack. In January 2025, the Polish Minister of Defense, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, stated that Poland should be prepared for any scenario, including a Russian attack. In January 2025, the German Minister of Defense, Boris Pistorius, stated that the growing Russian army creates a possibility of a Russian attack on NATO countries in 2029-2030. He emphasized the importance of strengthening the defense capabilities of the Alliance before that time. Earlier, the Polish Foreign Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, stated that Russia is currently unable to attack another country because its army is engaged in the war against Ukraine. However, it is necessary to prepare for another Russian aggression by 2030.

**German Intelligence Warns of Russia's Preparations for War with NATO by 2030 - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency**
Germany's intelligence agency has warned that Russia is preparing for war with NATO by 2030. This warning comes as Russia continues to make aggressive moves in Ukraine, including a proposed temporary government under UN supervision, which the US has rejected. Additionally, Russia is reportedly preparing a new offensive in Ukraine's northeastern regions. Meanwhile, Poland is gearing up for war by training its citizens for potential conflict. The warning from Germany's intelligence agency highlights the growing tensions between Russia and NATO, with many countries in the EU preparing for the possibility of war.

**Russia Predicts 15 Possible Military Conflict Scenarios by 2045, Direct Threat to Poland**
Russia has predicted 15 possible military conflict scenarios by 2045, with six of them affecting Northern Europe. According to General-Major Vadim Skibitsky, deputy head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, countries in Northern Europe, particularly the Baltic states and Poland, are aware of the potential threat. Skibitsky stated that Poland is directly threatened by four possible military conflict scenarios. 'For Poland, there are only four scenarios of a possible military conflict. Poland now understands that this is a direct threat,' he said. Russia has previously prepared a forecast of events from 2026 to 2035 with a perspective to 2045, identifying four possible scenarios of the world order. The first scenario involves the absolute dominance of the US, the second the strengthening of China's role, the third a multipolar world where Russia aims to become one of the key players, and the fourth regionalization, or the division of influence into separate regions. Skibitsky noted that Russia's strategic documents clearly state the intention to complete the 'Ukrainian question' by 2026. He believes this is because a prolonged war for 5-10 years would prevent Russia from reaching the level of the US and China, leaving it a regional player in Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius previously stated that, considering the growth of the Russian army, there is a possibility of Russia attempting to attack NATO countries in 2029-2030. In response, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the Alliance's defense capabilities before then.

**Ex-NATO-General Warns of Possible Global War in 2027**
Former NATO General Sir Richard Shirreff has outlined a possible scenario for a global war in 2027. He believes that if Russia achieves its goals in Ukraine, it will expand its territorial ambitions, with 2030 being mentioned as a possible timeframe. Shirreff, a British expert, thinks that US President Trump and Russian President Putin will soon agree on a Ukraine deal, which Putin will then use to rearm and prepare for a total war with the West. In an article for the 'Daily Mail', Shirreff describes how the situation could escalate in March 2027. He warns, 'If we miss the chance to take our fate into our own hands, Putin will have control, not us.' The European Commission has also warned that the EU must prepare for the real possibility of a large-scale war with Russia. 'The history will not forgive us for inaction,' the Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen, states in a new strategy paper on the future of European defense.

**Germany's Intelligence Chief Warns of Russian Aggression if Ukraine War Ends Too Soon**
The head of Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND), Bruno Kahl, warned that if the war in Ukraine ends too soon, Russia's aggression towards Europe could also arrive sooner. Kahl expressed his concern about Russia's intentions to challenge Western unity, particularly by testing the mutual defense clause of Article 5 of the NATO treaty. He stated, 'We hope it won't be like that and we won't be forced into such a situation.' However, he added, 'We must assume that Russia is willing to test us and challenge the unity of the West.' Kahl emphasized the crucial importance of NATO's deterrent capacity. According to him, if the war in Ukraine ends before 2029-2030, Russia could reorient its military resources towards building a threat against Europe before expected. He warned, 'This could mean that a concrete threat to security - or even blackmail - from Russia towards Europe could emerge before expected.' Kahl suggested that Russia envisions a future world order where 'NATO's influence is repelled' and Russia expands its influence towards the west, ideally 'without US participation in Europe.' Ucranian officials have reacted indignantly to Kahl's words, with Andriy Kovalenko, director of the Center for Countering Disinformation of the National Defense Council of Ukraine, rejecting Kahl's reasoning. He wrote on Telegram, 'No, dear sir, you won't avoid war with Russia in four or six years just because you doubt acting now.'

**German Intelligence Chief Warns of Russian Threat to Europe**
The head of German intelligence, Kahl, stated that if the war in Ukraine were to last another 5 years, it would be safer for Europe. However, he believes that if the war between Russia and Ukraine ends before 2029-2030, Russia will be able to use its resources to create a threat to Europe sooner. 'A quick end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to use their energy where they really want to, namely against Europe', Kahl said. According to Kahl, Russia aims to restore the world order that existed in Europe in the late 1990s, without American troops on the continent and with an expansion of Russian influence in the West. Kahl also stated that Russia wants to test the unity of Western countries and the effectiveness of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which considers an attack on one NATO member country as an attack on all. 'We very much hope that this will not happen... But we must assume that Russia wants to test us, to check the unity of the West', Kahl said. The head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, responded to Kahl's statements. 'No, dear, you will still not avoid war with Russia in four-five years because you are lazy and do not want to change your society. Only the Nordics, Poland, and France are ready to resist. Germany is not even able to make a Tauros one move faster than in a year and a half', Kovalenko wrote in Telegram. He also stated that 'it will never be safer' and called on people to prepare 'already now'. 'I understand the psychology of the Russians - they will attack NATO countries regardless of us, as long as you are weak', Kovalenko emphasized.

**Russia 'Wants to Test Article 5 of NATO': What It Means and Why It Could Spark a European Crisis**
Russia is planning to test the unity of the Western world, particularly with regards to NATO's collective defense clause, according to Bruno Kahl, head of the German intelligence service BND. In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Kahl stated that Russia is evaluating whether to test the reliability of Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on an ally must be treated as an attack on all. 'We hope this is not true and that we will not be put in this difficult position,' Kahl said, acknowledging that 'however, we must assume that Russia wants to put us to the test, test the unity of the West.' The timing of this potential Russian test of the collective defense clause depends on the progress of the war in Ukraine, according to Kahl. If the war were to end before 2029 or 2030, this would allow Russia to use more resources, technical, material, and human, to create a threat against Europe, he observed. 'It is also possible that a concrete threat or a Russian attempt to blackmail Europeans will occur before what was previously calculated,' Kahl added. 'An early end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to direct their energy where they really want, namely against Europe,' according to the head of German intelligence. For Kahl, Russia imagines a future world order that resembles the situation in Europe at the end of the 1990s, when after the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a significant reduction of US forces in the Old Continent began.

**German Intelligence Chief: Russia May Test NATO's Collective Defense Before 2030**
The head of German intelligence, Bruno Kahl, believes that Russia will likely try to test the effectiveness of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on collective defense. He suggests that if the war in Ukraine ends in the near future, this risk will become greater. 'We very much hope that this will not happen... But we must assume that Russia wants to test us, to check the unity of the West,' Kahl said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, as reported by 'European Truth' citing dpa. Kahl believes that the time and likelihood of such a 'test' are directly related to the development of events in the Russian-Ukrainian war. If the war ends before 2029-2030, Kahl said, Russia will be able to become a threat to Europe more quickly. 'It is also possible that a specific threat or attempt at blackmail by Russia against European states will occur earlier than previously thought... An earlier end to the war in Ukraine would allow the Russians to redirect their energy to where they want it most - against Europe,' Kahl said. According to Kahl, Russia hopes that the future contours of the world order will be similar to those in the 1990s, and that Russia's sphere of influence will expand further westward, with the United States withdrawing its troops from Europe in the most desirable scenario.

**Danish Intelligence Warns of Possible Russian Military Campaign in Europe Before 2030**
According to a Danish intelligence report, Russia may launch a new military campaign in Europe before 2030 if it ends its operation in Ukraine. The report suggests that the US may not support NATO allies in this scenario. The Danish intelligence service estimates that this possibility could become a reality within five years if the Ukrainian operation ends. The report also suggests that this scenario could occur even if the Ukrainian operation is frozen, without a peace agreement or the end of the war. The premise is that Russia could prepare a new attack in six months after becoming available with resources from the Ukrainian operation. This is not the first time that the possibility of Russia targeting a NATO country in Europe has been speculated. Several governments have publicly acknowledged that it is a feasible option. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also stated last year that Russia could take some kind of step against NATO in the coming years. The report comes at a time when Donald Trump's return to the White House has increased calls for NATO allies to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP.
