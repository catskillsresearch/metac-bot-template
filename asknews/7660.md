**Xi Jinping could save America with a simple ad | Notice**
Matt Robison, a writer and former member of Congress, suggests that Xi Jinping could save America by announcing that China will be the first nation to win a human on Mars within the next ten years. This would spark a national response and a new space race, motivating American industry and the public to invest in space exploration. According to Robison, this would be a way to encourage the creation of new fortunes and to face an existential threat, rather than entering a real war. He believes that this kind of kick is exactly what America needs, what China needs, and what the world needs in 2025. Robison's opinion piece was published in Newsweek and is based on the idea that a powerful civilization can have long persistence, even after it has broken down. He references the example of the Roman Empire and suggests that America can learn from its history.

**New Discovery in China Reveals Origins of Mysterious Human Lineage**
Chinese scientists have discovered a mysterious human lineage, dubbed the 'Shenqi' lineage, after analyzing the skeletal remains of a woman who lived around 7,100 years ago in the province of Yunnan in southwestern China. The analysis of the DNA of the woman, named 'Shenqi', revealed that she belonged to a previously unknown human lineage, which was previously just a scientific hypothesis. The researchers analyzed 127 human genomes from the region, spanning a period of 1,400 to 7,150 years. The results showed that 'Shenqi' was not closely related to the populations of East or South Asia, but rather to an ancient human group that had separated early from the rest of humanity, which they called the 'Shenqi Asian basal lineage'. The study, published in the journal Science, suggests that this lineage had not mixed genetically with other groups for thousands of years, allowing it to preserve its unique genetic composition. Over time, the relatives of 'Shenqi' intermarried with groups from East Asia, contributing to the genes of some of the current Tibetan population. According to researcher Xiaoyi Fu, the discovery represents an important step in understanding the origins of the Tibetan population, where the 'Shenqi' lineage accounts for around 20% of their genetic makeup, while the remaining percentage comes from ancient northern Chinese populations. Despite the significance of the results, the researchers called for caution, citing the reliance on a single skeletal remains for the analysis, and emphasizing the need for further research to determine the exact relationship between this lineage and the Tibetan population.

**China Breaks Through in Quantum Direct Communication, Building 300-kilometer-level Network**
A team of researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai Power University has made a breakthrough in quantum direct communication, successfully building a 300-kilometer-level quantum direct communication network with four nodes. According to the People's Daily, this achievement lays an important foundation for the practical application of quantum communication networks. The technology can be applied to high-security fields such as military command, government communication, and financial transactions. The researchers achieved three key breakthroughs: first, they created a scalable and expandable fully connected architecture, breaking the traditional star-shaped network limit; second, they optimized the light source preparation technology to increase the transmission distance to 300 kilometers; third, they established a quantum state reconstruction-based error correction mechanism to ensure the stability of multi-node communication. The researchers used a novel double-pump laser phase-sensitive conversion technology to build a high-interference-resistant quantum entanglement distribution system. The experimental results showed that even after 300 kilometers of long-distance transmission, the quantum state fidelity between nodes remained above 85%, and the photon arrival rate was stable at 300-400 Hz, indicating a theoretical communication rate of several bits per second after encoding. IT Home noted that quantum direct communication is a high-security information transmission technology based on quantum mechanics principles, which has been widely concerned due to its high security. The theoretical system was first proposed by Professor Long Guilu's team at Tsinghua University in Beijing in 2000, and since then, many Chinese research institutions have conducted research on this technology. In 2020, China successfully developed the world's first quantum direct communication prototype. In 2025, researchers from the Beijing Quantum Information Science Research Institute achieved a world record of 168 hours of continuous stable transmission over a distance of 104.8 kilometers. Fast Science pointed out that the high security of quantum communication is based on the principle of quantum non-cloning, which states that a quantum state will change once it is measured. Therefore, any attempt to eavesdrop on quantum communication will be detected, and the sender and receiver can replace the key and re-distribute it to ensure the security of information transmission.

**7,100-Year-Old Skeleton Reveals New Human Lineage in China**
A 7,100-year-old skeleton has revealed a previously unknown human lineage in China. The skeleton, named Xingyi_EN, was found in the Shiggyi archaeological site in Yunnan Province, southwest China. Analysis of the DNA revealed that Xingyi_EN belonged to a deep branch of the human family tree, which is believed to have contributed to the genetic makeup of some modern Tibetans. The study, published in the journal Science, analyzed 127 skulls and human remains from Yunnan Province, which is one of the most linguistically and ethnically diverse regions in modern China. The researchers found that Xingyi_EN lived around 7,100 years ago and had a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. However, the surprise came from the complete genetic sequence analysis, which revealed that the woman belonged to a previously unknown human lineage, now called the 'Basal Asian Xingyi lineage'. This lineage is believed to have diverged from other modern human lineages over 40,000 years ago and remained isolated for thousands of years, with little genetic exchange. The discovery sheds light on the history of human evolution in East Asia and suggests that the ancient humans who lived in this region may have played a key role in shaping the genetic makeup of modern populations in the region. The researchers believe that Yunnan Province is a key area for understanding the genetic history of ancient humans in East and Southeast Asia.

**Canadian MPs Support US Legislation to Condemn China's Forced Organ Harvesting**
The US House of Representatives recently passed the 'Falun Gong Protection Act', which is the first legislation in the US to condemn China's forced organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners. Several Canadian MPs have expressed their support for the act, calling for the international community to adopt similar legislation to prevent becoming complicit in China's human rights abuses. Canadian MP Garnett Genuis, co-chair of the Congressional Friends of Falun Gong, said, 'I think we want to see the world adopt similar legislation.' He emphasized the importance of preventing Canada from becoming complicit in forced organ harvesting, saying, 'We want to make sure that no one in Canada is involved in forced organ harvesting, so that the persecuted can be protected.' Another Canadian MP, Michael Cooper, praised the legislation, saying it aims to impose sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for severe human rights abuses, including forced organ harvesting. He called for the Canadian government to take further action against China, saying, 'We need to call on the government to take more action against China, to impose sanctions on those who have committed crimes against humanity.' James Bezan, a Conservative MP, also advocated for legislation to punish Chinese officials for human rights abuses, saying, 'We know that the communist regime in Beijing is still engaging in forced organ harvesting, which is illegal and horrific, and we must put an end to it.' Kevin Lamoureux, a Liberal MP and former government leader, also expressed his support for the legislation, saying, 'Governments around the world can take concrete actions to stop illegal organ harvesting, which is a positive thing. I'm open to any suggestions on how to do this best.'

**The World's First Head Transplant Will Take Place In China**
Dr. Sergio Canavero, also known as 'Dr. Frankenstein,' is planning to perform the world's first human head transplant in China. According to Canavero, the surgery involves matching the body to the new head, keeping a steady blood supply, and fusing the spinal cord. He has already performed the surgery on dozens of mice, with some learning to walk in their new bodies. However, none have lived longer than a month. Canavero is now searching for a volunteer for the first human surgery, but his initial patient, Vladimir Demikhov, backed out due to concerns about his ability to walk or survive the surgery. Canavero remains optimistic about the procedure, saying that 'it's not a question of if, but when' a human head transplant will be successful.

**China Performs First-Ever Transplant of Genetically Modified Pig Liver into Human**
A team of Chinese scientists has successfully transplanted a genetically modified pig liver into a human for the first time in the world, according to a study published in the journal Nature. Dr. Lin Wang, one of the authors of the study, commented on the experiment and the successful transplant of a pig kidney into a person with renal insufficiency, saying, 'The pig liver transplant was a pioneering effort, and we are pleased with the results.' The xenotransplantation of the pig liver into an adult person diagnosed with brain death was performed in March 2024. A miniature Bama pig, seven months old, with six genetically modified genes, was used as the donor. The genetic modifications in xenotransplants are made to make animal organs similar to human organs. The study monitored the function of the graft, hemodynamics, and immune and inflammatory responses of the recipient for 10 days after the xenotransplant. Histological analyses showed that the pig liver 'regenerated correctly without signs of rejection' and 'remained functional until the end of the study.' Additionally, it produced bile and albumin, although in smaller quantities than human livers. Based on these data, the Chinese scientists concluded that their experiment demonstrates that the pig liver 'could survive in a human body and begin to function.' The team chose to perform a heterotopic auxiliary transplant, where the patient's liver was not removed and the pig liver was implanted in another area of the abdominal cavity.

**Chinese Woman Clones Her Dog for $22,000**
A Chinese woman has successfully cloned her dog, 'Joker', who died of a heart attack at the age of 11. The woman had been studying and consulting experts on the topic since 2017, when the first cloned dog was born in China. After years of visits to a specialized company, she decided to clone her dog, paying $22,000 for the procedure. The technology used involves taking a skin sample from the dog's body, such as the belly or ear tips, and combining it with an egg from another animal to create an embryo. The embryo is then implanted in a surrogate mother, allowing for the production of a genetically identical copy of the dog. The puppy was a perfect match for 'Joker', sharing the same birthmark and personality traits. This event sparked widespread reactions online, raising questions about the ethics of cloning pets. Cloning dogs is a complex process due to their unique reproductive cycles and difficult-to-handle eggs. However, technology has made significant progress in this area since the first successful dog cloning in 2005 in South Korea.

**Haustier-Klone in China: A Clone for Every Pet**
In China, there have been reports of people cloning their pets. A designer from Beijing, for example, decided to clone her cat Tomcat, who had been by her side for 15 years. After Tomcat's death, a cloning company quickly took skin samples, which were used to obtain cells with the cat's DNA. After two failed attempts using a surrogate mother cat, the woman was finally able to welcome 'Little Tomcat.' Another pet owner from Hangzhou cloned her Dobermann Joker, who died at the age of 11 due to heart problems. The woman, who was quoted as saying that her dog's death caused her 'severe pain,' also ordered a clone. The two dogs look very similar, including a black spot near the nose. While some people on Chinese social media understand the pet owners' decision, others criticize it, citing warnings from animal rights groups that cloning can have negative consequences for the surrogate mother animals. Many cloning attempts have also failed, leading to animal suffering. Clones for medical research are also under scrutiny, such as genetically modified pigs in Germany that are intended to be organ donors but also serve as test animals for the pharmaceutical industry. The first exact copy of a mammal, the sheep Dolly, was cloned in 1996 and named after the country singer Dolly Parton.

**The scientific community has overcome the technical hurdles of human cloning.**
Chinese researchers achieved a groundbreaking milestone in 2018 by cloning two crab eating macaques, Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). This technique, first used to create Dolly the sheep in 1996, involves replacing the nucleus of an egg cell with that of a somatic cell. The successful cloning of primates marked a significant breakthrough, demonstrating that human cloning is now technically feasible. However, the prospect raises profound ethical concerns, including undermining human dignity, disrupting the natural reproductive process, and potential psychological and social impacts on cloned individuals. As the scientific community continues to advance cloning technology, the world is left to grapple with the far-reaching implications of human cloning, sparking intense debate about the boundaries of science, ethics, and human values.
