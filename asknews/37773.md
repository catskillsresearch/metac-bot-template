**All the Juicy Gossip From the Michelle Obama Podcast**
Michelle Obama's podcast, 'In My Opinion' (IMO), launched in March with her brother Craig Robinson, has been a letdown for those seeking juicy gossip about the Obamas or other celebrities. Instead, the former First Lady focuses on addressing listeners' personal problems with guests like Tina Knowles and Seth Rogen. Despite decent ratings (ranked 95 on Apple's podcast chart and 72 on Spotify), the podcast is described as 'banal' by Vulture's Nicholas Quah, who notes that it's a far cry from Obama's previous warnings about the collapse of American democracy. However, Obama does occasionally share interesting insights, such as her thoughts on Malia dropping her last name. A roundup of the best gossip from IMO and Obama's guest appearances on other podcasts will be kept updated.

**Apple will let third party music apps show animated artwork on the iPhone lock screen, not just Apple Music - 9to5Mac**
Apple is introducing a new feature in iOS 26 that allows third-party music apps to display animated artwork on the iPhone lock screen, in addition to Apple Music. The new API, called MPMediaItemAnimatedArtwork, is currently available for developers to test and will be released to the public in the fall. This means that users of third-party music streaming apps, such as Spotify, will be able to show full-bleed animated art on the lock screen. While music is the primary intent of this feature, it is not limited to music streaming apps and could also be used by other audio apps like audiobooks or podcasts. As Apple Music's biggest rival, Spotify has been hesitant to adopt new platform features in the past, but it remains to be seen whether they will take advantage of this new API.

**🔥YouTube Just Launched Podcast Charts and the Rankings Are Already Wild**
YouTube has launched an official weekly podcast chart in the US, ranking the top 100 podcasts based on watch data from YouTube and YouTube Music. The chart includes both video and audio-first podcasts, and YouTube's move into public podcast rankings is seen as a power play in the broader shift in the podcast space.

The bigger question is what comes next, with potential implications for exclusive podcast deals, Spotify's video podcast UX, and how creators think about success in the podcast space.

**Meghan Markle's New Podcast Makes Lukewarm Debut on Spotify**
Meghan Markle's new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, made a relatively quiet entrance on Spotify's global stage, ranking at number 10 on Spotify's general top podcast chart in the United States. The first episode featured Markle in conversation with Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of Tinder and Bumble. Critics generally panned it, although it's worth noting that Markle's previous podcast, Archetypes, debuted at number one in its launch week in 2022, but quickly slipped down the rankings as listeners tired of the formula. According to Spotify's rankings, the show's relatively low ranking may be a disappointment for such a high-profile launch.
