**Liang Adjusts Target Prices for Giant and Merida Amidst Market Volatility**
According to a recent report by Liang, despite the impact of tax policies, the stock prices of Giant (9921) and Merida (9914) have declined. However, Liang maintains a positive outlook for the market from 2025 to 2026, but has temporarily lowered its target price due to short-term unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations and weak demand in the Chinese market. The target prices for Giant and Merida have been adjusted to NT$160 and NT$150, respectively. Liang notes that Giant, Merida, and Guimeng (5306) performed better than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with healthy inventory levels. However, the second quarter is expected to see a decline in shipments compared to the first quarter and the same period last year. Liang points out that despite the weak Chinese market, the overall outlook for this year is better than last year, mainly due to the reduced inventory days in the US and European markets, supporting the expected decline in bicycle industry inventory levels. Giant's inventory levels have decreased to around 2-4 months as of the end of the first quarter, while Merida's shipments from Taiwan to the US have recovered year-over-year. In April, sales in the US and most European countries remained healthy. However, the Chinese market is expected to see a decline in sales, with Giant's Chinese inventory levels increasing to around 3 months as of the end of the first quarter, and Merida adopting a conservative strategy to maintain low inventory levels. Liang estimates that Giant and Merida's sales in China will decline by 14% and 51%, respectively, this year. In terms of market share, Liang predicts that Giant and Merida's revenue from China will decrease from around 30% in 2024 to 25-30% in 2025. However, from the second half of 2025, the improvement in the US and European markets is expected to offset the weakness in the Chinese market.

**US new-home sales jump to highest since 2022 as prices fall**
US new-home sales rose unexpectedly in April to 743,000 annual rate, the highest level since February 2022, driven by builder incentives and lower prices. The gain was led by the South and Midwest, with sales increasing by 12% and 35% respectively. However, the optimism was tempered by sharp downward revisions to the prior three months and a lack of dent in the inventory of homes. Experts, such as Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, believe that the jump in new-home sales is a 'statistical illusion' and that a downward trend in sales is likely to emerge over coming months. Builders are helping to cushion the blow with greater use of sales incentives and cutting prices, but prospects for the residential real estate market remain clouded due to persistent affordability challenges. The median sales price decreased 2% from a year ago to $407,200, reflecting greater activity in more moderately priced homes.

**New Home Sales Jump in April, Defying Downturn Predictions**
The U.S. economy continues to defy recession predictions, with new home sales surging in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 743,000 units, a 10.9 percent increase from March and 3.3 percent above the level from a year earlier. The South and Midwest regions led the gains, while the Northeast saw a sharp 14.8 percent monthly decline in sales. Inventories of new homes for sale declined to 504,000 units, representing a supply of 8.1 months, and the median sales price rose modestly to $407,200. The data show continued strength in mid-range price tiers, with homes priced between $300,000 and $499,999 accounting for just over half of April's sales. The new home market continues to reflect a bifurcated economy, with demand supported by new household formation and limited resale inventory, but constrained by affordability challenges and financing costs.

**Home prices forecast to dip before the end of the year | FOX 51 Gainesville**
According to Redfin, the median US home-sale price is forecast to dip 1% year over year by Q4 2025, due to elevated mortgage rates, rising inventory, and economic uncertainty. In April, nearly 56,000 home purchases were canceled, representing 14.3% of all pending sales, the second-highest April rate on record. Redfin's head of economics research, Chen Zhao, said, 'We know there’s room to negotiate right now, so that’s the best way to take advantage of the changing market.' Redfin Premier agent Corey Stambaugh added, 'Even though we advise them to list at today’s market value, a lot of them decide to list high to recoup their money.' The study's results show a 1.1% year-over-year drop in home sales in April, while inventory rose nearly 17%, the highest in five years. Typical homes now take 40 days to sell, five days longer than a year ago. Buyers are gaining negotiating power, particularly on homes that have sat for weeks.

**The booming business of returned products in the US**
ReturnPro, a reverse logistics company, is booming in the US due to the surge in returned products. With US President Donald Trump's tariff war on China, retailers and wholesalers are expected to draw down their inventories of electronics, toys, clothing, and other goods. ReturnPro handles 259 categories of goods returned to retailers, which may have otherwise sold the products to liquidators for pennies on the dollar or sent them to a landfill at a loss. The company generates 25 US cents (32 Singapore cents) or more on the dollar for the retailers, and far more for products it refurbishes. 'It's a continuous cycle of one man's trash is another man's treasure,' said Colorado State University associate professor of supply chain management Zac Rogers. ReturnPro sells more than 70 per cent of the returns it receives on consignment from retailers, with up to 300 truckloads' worth of goods sent every week to wholesalers and liquidators. The returns business has been booming, with an estimated US$890 billion in goods returned in 2024, more than double the amount in 2020. ReturnPro's software uses algorithms to help retailers determine the potential resale value of returns, and the company expects to move 67 million units through its facilities in 2025.

**COMMENTARY: Key takeaways from the Q1 2025 Automotive Market Report**
The Q1 2025 Automotive Market Report reveals a mix of optimism and uncertainty for the industry. While new vehicle sales rebounded by 19% in March, used-vehicle sales showed steady resilience with a 10% quarter-over-quarter increase. However, inventory levels for both new and used vehicles saw increases in carryover units, and aged inventory continues to weigh heavily on dealership profitability. Pricing trends are shifting, and the once-rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) appears to be slowing. EV sales declined at three times the rate of ICE and hybrid vehicles, signaling a slowdown in consumer adoption. Dealers and OEMs must be prepared to navigate this complexity by aligning their inventory strategies with real-time demand signals. The report highlights the need for proactive inventory control, dynamic pricing, and a deeper understanding of consumer behavior. Success will depend on a dealer's ability to adapt quickly and make informed decisions based on real-time insights.

**Russian Offline Sales Plummet by 30% in 2025**
According to MTS Bank, in March-April 2025, clients made 22% more purchases on marketplaces compared to the same period in 2024, and fewer purchases were made offline. The average transaction value on marketplaces decreased by 9% to 1,710 rubles. The shift to online shopping had the greatest impact on cosmetics, shoe, clothing, electronics, and home appliance stores. The number of transactions in offline cosmetics stores decreased by 38%, but the average transaction value increased by 28% to 2,240 rubles. Purchases in shoe stores decreased by 29%, with an average transaction value increase of 3% to 4,220 rubles. Clothing purchases decreased by 24%, with a 16% decrease in average transaction value to 3,300 rubles. Electronics purchases decreased by 24%, with a 20% increase in average transaction value to 5,160 rubles, and home appliance purchases decreased by 23% (with a 5% increase in average transaction value to 8,490 rubles). Analysts attribute the decline in offline sales of cosmetics and clothing to the growth of new Russian brands using marketplaces as their primary sales channel, as well as the availability of products from brands that have left Russia on marketplaces.

**Apparel spending slips by 1.9% in New Zealand - Ragtrader**
Apparel spending in New Zealand fell by NZ$6 million in April 2025 compared to the prior month, offsetting the overall lift in retail spending, which rose just 0.2 percent. According to Stats NZ, apparel is the only category in the core retail industries to record a fall, with consumables, durables, and hospitality recording subdued lifts. Ann-Marie Johnson, Retail NZ advocacy manager, said, 'The tiny increase in core retail spending is not enough to improve the outlook for retail.' The overall spending lift across core retail rose just 0.6 percent or NZ$38 million, with total core retail sales down 4.2 percent month-on-month and up just 0.8 percent year-on-year. Johnson added, 'There's still a long way to go before we see any light at the end of the tunnel.' Retail NZ members are anticipating slow sales and uncertainty through this winter, and are hoping the upcoming Budget will help restore confidence to the marketplace.

**April Small Business Sales Improved from March, Though Consumers Continue to Trim Discretionary Spending**
According to the Fiserv Small Business Index, April 2025 small business sales improved from March, with a seasonally-adjusted Index at 151, a one-point increase. Despite this, consumers are continuing to trim discretionary spending, with a focus on essentials such as healthcare and grocery. Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv, said, 'Even as consumer spending shows resiliency, market uncertainties appear to be driving budget-conscious consumers to reprioritize where they spend their money.' On a year-over-year basis, small business sales (+3.2%) and total transactions (+6.9%) continued to show growth, with services outperforming goods. However, consumers are cutting back when eating out, with average ticket sizes down significantly (-7.8%) despite total transactions being up (+9.6%). Retail growth cooled, with sales and transactions growing slowly, led by Grocery (+7.0%) and Clothing (+5.3%).

**Secondhand stores poised to benefit if US tariffs drive up new clothing costs | Business | postregister.com**
The US trade war, led by President Donald Trump, may drive up new clothing costs, benefiting secondhand stores and online resale sites. American styles carry international influence, but nearly all clothing sold domestically is made elsewhere. The Yale University Budget Lab estimated short-term consumer price increases of 65% for clothes and 87% for leather goods. Industry experts predict that cost-conscious shoppers will turn to secondhand sites, consignment boutiques, and thrift stores in search of bargains or a way to turn their wardrobes into cash. Kristen Classi-Zummo, an apparel industry analyst, said, 'I think resale is going to grow in a market that is declining. What I think is going to continue to win in this chaotic environment are channels that bring value.' The secondhand clothing market was already flourishing before the specter of tariffs bedeviled the US fashion industry. Management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predicted that global revenue from pre-owned fashion would grow 11 times faster than retail apparel sales by this year. The number of mobile app downloads for nine resale marketplaces increased by 3% between January and the end of March, the first quarterly gain in three years. Companies operating e-commerce marketplaces are upgrading their technology to make it easier to find items, and brands are expressing more urgency to team up with resale programs. 'Tapping into all of the inventory that is already sitting in the US, either in people's closets or in warehouses not being used,' offers a revenue source while brands limit or suspend orders from foreign manufacturers, said Emily Gittins, CEO of Archive.

**Secondhand stores are poised to benefit if US tariffs drive up new clothing costs | New Orleans CityBusiness**
Secondhand stores are poised to benefit from US tariffs driving up new clothing costs, according to industry experts. The tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump, are expected to increase consumer prices for clothes and leather goods by 65% and 87%, respectively. This may lead cost-conscious shoppers to online resale sites, consignment boutiques, and thrift stores in search of bargains or a way to turn their wardrobes into cash.

The number of mobile app downloads for resale marketplaces increased by 3% between January and March, and sales of pre-owned clothing are expected to surge as consumers seek affordable alternatives to new fashion items. However, resale vendors are not immune to tariff-induced upheavals, and US sellers importing secondhand inventory from European Union countries may face a 20% duty if Trump moves forward with instituting 'reciprocal' tariffs.

**UK fashion suppliers face tough 2025 as Q4 sales dip, lead times rise**
According to Unleashed's Manufacturing Health Index report, UK fashion suppliers faced a tough Q4 2024 due to market volatility and changes in international tariffs. The report showed a 32.78% decline in average sales revenue to £352,000, a 49.49% drop in purchase orders, and a 34.2% decrease in lead times from 38 days to 25 days. The analysis also revealed a sector-wide decline in average sales revenue of over 40% and a nearly halved rate of purchase orders. Unleashed's parent company, The Access Group, noted that low consumer confidence and volatile international trading conditions are taking a toll on manufacturers, but also pointed out that Q3 2024 was a 'bumper quarter' and that manufacturers are controlling their inventory to weather the storm. 'Low consumer confidence and newly-volatile international trading conditions seem to be taking their toll on manufacturers across almost every category we looked at,' said Joe Llewellyn, GM of The Access Group's small business ERP. 'While many will be rightly concerned about this drop-off, it's worth bearing in mind that Q3 2024 was a bumper quarter, when we saw both sales revenue and POs surge.'

**U.S. Wholesale Inventories Rose in January by Most Since 2022**
U.S. wholesale inventories rose by 0.8% in January, the largest percentage increase since August 2022, according to Commerce Department data. This exceeded economists' expectations of a 0.5% increase. Inventories of durable goods increased by 0.9%, while nondurable goods rose by 0.7%. The inventory-to-sales ratio increased to 1.33 in January, from 1.30 in December, but decreased from 1.36 in January 2024. This metric is a key indicator of the U.S.'s quarterly gross domestic product.
