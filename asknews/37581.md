**Mexico's Rental Market Faces Desacceleration Due to High Prices and Limited Offer**
The rental market in Mexico is expected to slow down in 2025 due to high prices, limited availability of new properties, and inflation. According to Juan David Vargas, general manager of Propiedades.com, the number of properties available for rent has decreased, despite increased demand. Vargas stated, 'The first quarter has shown a progressive decrease in inventory, which is associated with the pressure on the low inventory of properties for sale and the high costs, where the rental inventory is moving as a great opportunity.' However, he noted that the prices at which properties are being sold are also discouraging the relationship between supply and demand. 'While in 2024 we saw an increase of around 10 or 15 percent in the first quarter compared to 2023, in 2025 that growth is between 5 and 10 percent, even what we estimate is that by the end of the year, the growth in the available rental inventory will be the same as the previous year, and there we could be seeing how the impact of high prices consolidates on the availability of supply,' he said. Experts agree that the average rental prices in the country have increased by 5-6 percent in the first months of the year, but in CDMX, Guadalajara, and Monterrey, as well as tourist areas, they have grown up to double digits.

**High-Priced Rentals on the Rise in Seoul Metropolitan Area**
The Seoul metropolitan area is experiencing a rapid increase in high-priced rentals, with the proportion of rent transactions exceeding 60% of the total housing transactions. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's 'April Housing Statistics', the proportion of rent transactions in the country reached 60.4% this year. In particular, the Seoul metropolitan area showed a high proportion of rent transactions, with 63.6% in Seoul and 59.3% in the metropolitan area. The proportion of apartment rent transactions also increased from 43.4% last year to 44.5% this year. High-priced rent transactions of over 500 million KRW are also on the rise, with 366 transactions in Seoul from January to May this year. For example, a 84㎡ apartment in the '래미안 원베일리' complex in Seocho-gu, Seoul, was rented for 600 million KRW per month with a deposit of 8 billion KRW in May. Additionally, a 84㎡ apartment in the '서울숲트리마제' complex in Jongno-gu, Seoul, was rented for 1.1 billion KRW per month with a deposit of 1 billion KRW in May. Industry insiders predict that if interest rates are lowered rapidly after the election, the trend of renting out apartments for high prices will continue to worsen. As a result, people may increasingly turn to renting out apartments as a form of investment, rather than saving in bank deposits.

**Rent Increases in May 2025: What You Need to Know**
Rent increases are expected in May 2025, according to the adjustment index used in contracts. The increases will vary depending on the type of contract. For those who signed contracts in May 2023 under the old law, the second and final annual adjustment will be 95.24% interannual, which is lower than the 116.85% applied in April. This is the first time in three years that the adjustment by this index is below 100%. For example, a rent of $400,000 will increase to $780,952, and a rent of $600,000 will increase to $1,171,440. The adjustment index is published daily, so the exact increase depends on the date of the contract within the month. Additionally, contracts signed between October and December 2023 will have a semi-annual adjustment of 56.7%, and contracts signed after the derogation of the old law will have a quarterly or semi-annual adjustment tied to the Consumer Price Index (IPC). For example, a rent of $500,000 will increase to $557,525, and a rent of $800,000 will increase to $892,040.

**Rent Increases in May: What You Need to Know**
According to Alejandro Braña, the rent increases in May will be 95.24% based on the official index. This is a decrease from the 52.84% increase that was applied in the previous month. The rent increases can be adjusted using either the ICL (Índice de Contratos de Locación) or the IPC (Índice de Precios al Consumidor) indices, with quarterly or semi-annual adjustments. Braña noted that there is now little difference between the ICL and IPC indices, which were previously more dispersed. The current rent increases are the highest in 12 years, but this is a good sign for tenants as it indicates a high level of supply in the market. Braña pointed out that in areas like Almagro, the annual increase in rent values was only 12%, which is much lower than the inflation rate. He also noted that the rent increase in July last year was 265%, compared to the current 95.24%. 'We are coming down from that peak. As inflation has decreased, so have the rent adjustments,' Braña concluded.

**Renters to Pay Less: Update in ICL Breaks Trend of Increasing Rental Prices**
Due to the update in the Index for Rental Contracts (ICL), the trend of increasing rental prices has been broken, and in May, the gap of 100% was also broken. Those who signed their contract after the law was repealed will have to pay an increase according to the update formula. According to the ICL, the percentages for May will be: However, despite the significant increase in contracts, 'rental prices for housing are decreasing in real terms', specified by the College of Real Estate. This is because they increased below the inflation rate. From January 2024 to February 2025, the average decrease was 36.3%. 'In some contracts, we can already see decreases in nominal terms of the locative values. We observe counter-offers from tenants, which are increasingly accepted by landlords', specified in the March 2025 report. The repeal of the Rent Law allows the contract clauses to be determined freely between the parties. This includes the update formulas, duration, and currency for payment. According to the report by the College of Real Estate, the most chosen modality in 2025 is:

**Rent Increases in May 2025: A Decrease in the ICL Index**
According to the Banco Central, the inflation index (ICL) used to calculate rent increases will show a decrease in the increase rate for the first time in three years, with a 95.24% increase in May 2025, compared to 116.85% in April. This change is due to the new market conditions after the derogation of the rent law. The contracts signed in May 2023 will experience their second and last annual increase, while those signed under the new law will be adjusted semi-annually based on the Casa Propia coefficient, which is expected to be around 56.7% in May.

**Florida Becomes Top Destination for New York Residents Seeking Better Quality of Life**
Florida is becoming a popular destination for New York residents looking to relocate, with many citing a desire for a better quality of life, lower costs, and less stress. According to international reports, the top three cities in Florida attracting New Yorkers are Miami, Tampa, and Orlando. These cities offer a sunny climate, accessible living, growing job opportunities, and a more peaceful lifestyle compared to the hustle and bustle of New York City. Here are the reasons why these destinations are preferred by residents: Miami is known for its multicultural atmosphere, expanding economy, and vibrant urban life, with neighborhoods like Brickell and Wynwood attracting New Yorkers with job opportunities and a dynamic lifestyle. Tampa offers a perfect balance between urbanization and nature, with areas like Hyde Park and Channelside renovated to create an ideal quality of life for those seeking something different. Orlando, famous for Disney and Universal Studios, has grown in sectors like technology and education, offering new job opportunities and a low cost of living. According to updated data from Zillow, the average rent in Miami in April 2025 is approximately $2,950 per month, a decrease from the previous year when the average rent was $3,300. Additionally, there is a reduction of $150 compared to the previous month. Specifically, one-bedroom apartments have seen a drop of $800 compared to last year, with prices ranging around $2,000 per month. Two-bedroom apartments have an average rent of $2,750, with a decrease of $800 compared to 2024. Three-bedroom apartments have seen a more modest reduction of $280 compared to last year.

**How to Calculate Rent Increase in May 2025**
The way to calculate the rent increase in May 2025 depends on the date the contract was signed. If it was signed before the 2020 law was passed, the rent will be updated annually until the contract ends in 2026. If it was signed after the law was passed in 2020, but before the 2023 modification, the rent will be updated annually until the contract ends. If it was signed after the 2023 modification, the rent can be updated quarterly or semiannually, using the IPC (Índice de Precios al Consumidor) or the Casa Propia index. For example, if a contract was signed in February 2025 with a rent of $586,791 and an adjustment period of three months, the inflation rate for January, February, and March was 2.2%, 2.4%, and 3.7%, respectively. The new rent would be $636,814. However, the exact amount may vary depending on the specific inflation rates and the calculation method used.

**Rent Increases in May: Experts Predict Significant Hikes**
According to experts from the Colegio Profesional Inmobiliario (CPI) and the Foro Profesional Inmobiliario (FPI), the upcoming rent increases in May will be as follows: 95% for those with annual updates, 21.7% for those with semi-annual updates, 12.1% for those with quarterly updates, and 8.3% for those with monthly updates. Despite the significant increase, 'the prices of rental housing are decreasing in real terms', as stated by the CPI. This is due to the fact that the rent increases are below the inflation rate, with an average decrease of 36.3% from January 2024 to February 2025. 'In some contracts, we can already see decreases in nominal values of locative values. We observe counter-offers from tenants, which are increasingly accepted by landlords', as stated in the March 2025 report.

**Housing market map: Zillow just revised its 2025 home price forecast**
Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, expecting a 1.1% increase in U.S. home prices between January 2025 and January 2026, down from their previous 2.9% projection. They attribute this downward revision to higher-than-expected new listings and increased inventory. Zillow also predicts that U.S. existing home sales will remain unchanged at 4.1 million, which is below the pre-pandemic level of 5.3 million. Additionally, they forecast a 3.7% increase in single-family rents and a 3.1% increase in multifamily rents. The strongest home price appreciation is expected in Knoxville, TN (5.2%), Atlantic City, NJ (5.1%), and Torrington, CT (4.8%), while the weakest is expected in Lake Charles, LA (-7.3%), Houma, LA (-6.4%), and New Orleans, LA (-5.1%). Zillow notes that Florida's significant increase in active inventory and months of supply may signal potential pricing weakness, with single-family and condo prices currently declining in most Florida housing markets.
