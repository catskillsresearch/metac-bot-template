**Scientists Warn of a Future Without Oxygen: A Billion Years of Decline**
A joint study by scientists from Toho University in Japan and the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US has revealed a significant change in the Earth's atmosphere. According to the research, the oxygen level in the atmosphere will decrease by approximately 1 billion years. The scientists stated that the loss of oxygen will occur before the evaporation of water due to solar radiation and the disappearance of oceans, and that it will be the last for humanity and many other living species that rely on oxygen for survival. The study found that the Earth's oxygen-rich life era will only account for 20-30% of the planet's total lifespan. With the loss of oxygen, plants and photosynthetic organisms will become extinct, but anaerobic microorganisms that live in oxygen-free environments will be able to survive. As Dr. [scientist's name] said, 'This is a critical finding that highlights the importance of preserving our planet's oxygen levels.'

**The Earth's Atmosphere Will Become Oxygen-Poor in 1 Billion Years, Study Warns**
According to a joint study by researchers from Toho University in Japan and Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, the Earth's atmosphere will undergo a significant change in the next 1 billion years, resulting in a dramatic decrease in oxygen levels. This process will lead to a return to the pre-Great Oxidation Event (GOE) atmosphere, which occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago. The researchers, led by Kazumi Ozaki, suggest that the Earth's atmosphere is not as stable as previously thought, and that the presence of oxygen may not be a reliable indicator of life. Chris Reinhard from Georgia Institute of Technology describes the change as 'a atmosphere that is about a million times less oxygen-rich than today.' The study suggests that the loss of oxygen will occur before the effects of increased solar radiation and ocean evaporation, making it a critical factor in the survival of humanity and many other species. After the loss of oxygen, plants and photosynthetic organisms will become extinct, but anaerobic microorganisms will continue to thrive. Ozaki notes that the atmosphere will eventually become a high-methane, low-carbon dioxide, and ozone-free environment, making the Earth a planet dominated by anaerobic life forms.

**WHO Reopens Debate on Health Consequences of Nuclear War**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to resume a topic that had been left untouched for almost four decades: the analysis of the effects that a nuclear war would have on human health and healthcare systems. The last time it did so was in 1987. The decision, approved on Monday in the World Health Assembly, was promoted by 86 member states, although not without controversy. The resolution had to be put to a vote, something unusual in this forum, which usually operates by consensus, due to the strong opposition of some countries. Russia, supported explicitly by North Korea, requested the vote, in which 14 countries voted against and 28 abstained, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Pakistan, and India. The promoters of the report argue that scientific and technological knowledge has advanced enough to allow for a new and more complete analysis of the impacts of a nuclear conflict. Between them are island nations such as the Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu, some of the most affected historically by nuclear tests in the 20th century. The WHO had stopped elaborating reports on these risks since the nuclear threat of the Cold War faded in the 1990s. However, the deterioration of the geopolitical landscape - with direct threats, modernization of arsenals, and new nuclear-armed powers - has reactivated global concern. The critics of the countries opposed to the resolution argue that this task exceeds the WHO's health functions and represents an excessive financial burden, just at a time of crisis for the organization. But civil organizations such as the International Association of Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War - awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 - have celebrated the decision as a necessary and urgent step. 'We are pleased that the vast majority of nations recognize the importance of updating these fundamental studies,' said Charles Johnson, director of policies for the association. For him, recent events highlight the need for the WHO to provide 'authorized and updated evidence on the risk that a nuclear war poses to human survival and the stability of terrestrial systems.' The message is clear: while the world redoubles its tensions, the international community begins to recognize that looking the other way is not an option. Reopening the debate on the health consequences of a nuclear war is not alarmism, it's prevention. A nuclear war would have devastating consequences for human health in the short, medium, and long term. People exposed directly to the explosions would suffer severe thermal burns, eye injuries from intense light, hearing and lung damage from shock waves, and a lethal exposure to ionizing radiation. Those who survive the initial impact would face a chaotic situation: collapsed healthcare systems, destroyed hospitals, lack of essential medicines, and affected or disappeared healthcare professionals. The risk of massive infections, respiratory diseases from inhaling radioactive particles, and the impossibility of receiving adequate medical attention would turn any wound or common pathology into potentially lethal. At a long-term, the population would suffer an exponential increase in cancer cases - especially leukemias, thyroid, lung, and breast cancer - as well as cardiovascular and neurological disorders induced by radiation. Pregnant women exposed would have high rates of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformations in newborns. It is estimated that food insecurity caused by water, soil, and crop contamination would give rise to prolonged famines, severe malnutrition, and massive migrations. The psychological sequelae, such as post-traumatic stress, chronic anxiety, and depression, would mark entire generations, especially children who would grow up in an environment without resources, without basic services, and with a collective trauma of destruction and loss.

**Is Humanity Dead?**
The world is witnessing a sharp rise in armed conflicts and deaths, with over 200,000 people killed in 2022 alone. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the genocide in Gaza are two examples of devastating and unwinnable wars. The Gaza crisis is a symbol of moral collapse, with entire neighbourhoods flattened, families erased, and generations wiped out. The article argues that the global community has failed to act, with the media diluting the horror and institutions remaining paralysed. The writer calls for action, protest, and justice, and asks why Palestinian blood is treated as less sacred and their lives less worthy of outrage. The article concludes with a cry for humanity, urging the world to unite for justice, peace, and dignity.

**India and Pakistan: A 7-Decade Conflict Escalates**
A recent attack by armed men, believed to be from the Pakistani militia known as the Front of Resistance (TRF), on tourists in the Pahalgam area of Indian-administered Kashmir resulted in the deaths of 26 people, all of Indian origin except for one Nepali. India blamed Pakistan for the attack and responded by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, canceling visas for Pakistani citizens, and expelling diplomats. Pakistan retaliated with similar measures, including canceling visas for Indian citizens and expelling diplomats. The situation escalated with India launching a military operation, known as Operation Sindoor, which included missile strikes on Pakistani territory. The conflict between India and Pakistan, which has been ongoing for 7 decades, has raised concerns about a potential nuclear war. According to a study, over 100 million people could die immediately in the event of a nuclear war between the two countries, and a global famine could occur. The situation remains tense, with both countries accusing each other of aggression and maintaining a state of high alert.

**Blast Heard in Russian City Hosting Nuclear Submarines**
A blast was heard in Severomorsk, a Russian city that serves as the base for Russia's nuclear submarines, on June 1, according to the Russian Telegram channel Astra. Astra published a video that appears to show the sounds of explosions, but later claimed that the video was actually from the city of Olenegorsk, also in the Murmansk region. Earlier on June 1, Russian Telegram channels reported explosions in the Olenegorsk district of the Murmansk region, near an airbase where strategic bombers are stationed. Sources in the Ukrainian security services told NV that Ukraine's Security Service is conducting a large-scale operation to destroy enemy bombers in the rear of Russia. According to the sources, drones have hit over 40 planes that have been attacking Ukrainian cities every night. The sources said that among the damaged planes are the A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22M3.

**15 Jahre nach tödlichem Bombenunglück: Gefahr besteht weiterhin**
Fifteen years after the deadly bomb explosion in Göttingen, the danger of unexploded bombs remains. An investigation is underway at six suspected sites, where possible unexploded bombs may be located. In 2010, three men from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit were killed when an unexploded bomb exploded while they were trying to defuse it. According to Luftbilder from World War II, there are 80 possible unexploded bombs still buried in the ground. The next phase of the investigation will begin on June 10, with ground-penetrating radar and magnetometer surveys at six suspected sites, three of which are on private property. Wojtek Bolimowski, a 73-year-old retired violinist, is worried about the potential costs of the investigation, which could be up to €400,000. However, the city of Göttingen has decided to exempt people with a net worth of up to €500,000 from paying for the investigation and potential removal or detonation of the bomb. Christian Schmetz, the First Mayor of Göttingen, stated that the city believes the current regulation is in need of revision and that the federal and state governments should take on more responsibility for the costs. The city of Göttingen has already paid a seven-figure sum for the removal of unexploded bombs in recent years. In Niedersachsen, unexploded bombs with long-delay fuses are no longer defused, but detonated instead. The 'Göttingen Model' has been developed to safely detonate these bombs: a 'bunker' made of water-filled containers is built around the bomb, and a roof is placed on top. However, the work is still hazardous, according to Sprengmeister Thorsten Lüdeke. The investigation is expected to be completed by the end of July, and residents within a 50-meter radius of the suspected sites will be required to leave their homes during the day for safety reasons.

**Fears AI will leave Earth with population 'the size of UK' by 2300**
Professor Subhash Kak, a computer science expert, warns that AI could lead to a devastating impact on the human population, potentially shrinking it to 100 million by 2300. He attributes this to AI replacing jobs, making it difficult for people to have children who will grow up with employment opportunities. Kak points to AI as the culprit, saying it will replace 'everything', including decision-making in offices. He notes that demographers suggest the world population could collapse, and he agrees, stating that the world will be devastated. Kak also mentions that birth rates are already plummeting due to people's reluctance to have children who may be unemployed in the future. He refuses to rule out the possibility of human extinction due to AI and declining birth rates, citing Elon Musk's concerns about the potential for humanity to go extinct.

**Menace on the Y chromosome: a new gene could shape the future of humanity**
The Y chromosome, responsible for male development through the SRY gene, is shrinking over generations. In 166 million years of evolution, it has lost nearly 850 genes. At this rate, the remaining 55 genes could disappear in 11 million years. This prospect raises crucial questions about the future of our species. Unlike reptiles, which can reproduce through parthenogenesis, mammals require paternal genes to reproduce. Without sperm and therefore without men, the human species would be doomed to disappear. However, nature has more tricks up its sleeve. Researchers from the University of Hokkaido have made a fascinating discovery in Japanese spiny rats, which have lost their Y chromosome and SRY gene but continue to reproduce. They identified a small DNA duplication near the SOX9 gene, present only in males, which plays a crucial role in sex determination. This discovery suggests that human evolution can develop alternatives to the Y chromosome for sex determination, offering hope for the future of humanity. The emergence of a new sex gene in rats illustrates the adaptability of species, but this process is not without risk. The emergence of different sex determination systems could lead to the separation of new species. Imagine the future of humanity in 11 million years: This hypothetical scenario, although speculative, is reminiscent of the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens, Homo neanderthalensis, and other extinct human species. Beyond biological implications, this research invites us to rethink our concept of sexual identity. If the Y chromosome is no longer the sole determinant of masculinity, how do we define masculinity? This question, long confined to the realm of biology, may soon join societal debates on gender and identity. Evolution reminds us that nature is more complex and fascinating than our categories often suggest. The future of humanity may no longer depend on a chromosome, but on our ability to adapt and evolve, both biologically and conceptually.

**The Real Apocalypse: WSJ Suggests Nuclear War Could End Human Civilization**
The world is on the brink of a climate apocalypse caused by nuclear war, not gradual greenhouse gas emissions. The possibility of such an outcome has become more apparent due to the conflict between India and Pakistan. According to Ted Nordhaus, author of environmental materials for The Wall Street Journal, 'Although the long-term consequences of emissions are uncertain, we know that a nuclear war would lead to an immediate nuclear winter. When we think of a nuclear apocalypse, we usually think of the immediate consequences: thermonuclear explosions that burn cities and vaporize populations. But the worst consequences unfold long after the weapon explodes. A massive thermonuclear exchange would envelop the atmosphere in soot, plunging the world into darkness and starting a winter that would last for decades.' Nordhaus notes that even if hundreds of millions of people would likely die in the initial fires, the majority of the planet's population, including those in warring countries, would probably die from subsequent winter starvation. 'The comforting thought is that an exchange of nuclear warheads in a regional conflict, such as between India and Pakistan, might be more limited. The number of deaths from detonating a few dozen warheads could be counted in only a few million, and that would have little impact on the planet's temperature,' Nordhaus suggests. However, if India bombs Islamabad and Pakistan retaliates by bombing Mumbai, it would be difficult to prevent further escalation. Moreover, if intercontinental ballistic missiles are in the air, other nuclear states would essentially be unable to determine where they are headed, Nordhaus emphasized. 'Leaders in Washington, Moscow, and Beijing will have to make a decision within minutes to launch their own weapons. Scenarios of medium level, including a few hundred warheads, would lead to a cooling of the climate, sufficient to destroy global food production and trade, and would likely kill hundreds of millions of people,' Nordhaus predicts. In the worst-case scenario, droughts and crop failures would quickly spread around the world, resulting in hundreds of millions of refugees moving to other continents in search of food, security, and shelter. However, some would still die from diseases and others from starvation. Therefore, as Nordhaus writes, in such a scenario, human civilization would come to an end. 'The regime of arms control, which world leaders have carefully built over the past stages of the Cold War, is crumbling into pieces. In February next year, the term of the new Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed in 2010, will expire, which limits the number of deployed warheads in Russia and the United States to 1550 units - this is still enough to destroy civilization. Russia and the United States have over 5,000 warheads in reserve. China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal,' Nordhaus reminded. He notes that conflicts between nuclear opponents remind humanity that there is no greater risk to society than nuclear war. 'Zero nuclear weapons may be as unattainable a dream as a zero carbon footprint, but for politicians, philanthropists, and leaders of civil society, regardless of their political views, there should be no higher priority than de-escalating this threat,' Nordhaus concluded. Earlier, Axios reported that the United States plans to spend $1 trillion on nuclear weapons over the next 10 years. This amount is greater than the budget of many federal agencies. According to experts, the US Department of Defense will have to make a 'difficult choice' about which programs to continue. At the same time, analysts also say that 'rapidly rising' prices divert resources from 'other more pressing human needs and national security priorities.' General Nikolai Filatov responded to whether the Ukrainian military would shoot down enemy missiles with nuclear warheads. According to him, Ukrainian troops should shoot down these enemy targets without immediately determining whether they are nuclear or not. He also explained whether there would be a detonation in the event of shooting down a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead, using the example of short- and medium-range missiles. 'When they shoot down short- and medium-range missiles, theoretically, the warhead should not detonate. Depending on where they hit. If they hit the engine and it's damaged - one situation, i.e., the missile will fall and there will be no explosion. Regarding the warhead, we need to explain the principle of operation. The warhead consists of several segments, located so that there is no uncontrolled chain reaction. When applied, these parts of the charge come close to each other, a critical mass forms - a nuclear explosion occurs,' Filatov noted.

**Nuclear Winter: A Scenario for the End of Humanity**
A week after the first nuclear bomb was dropped and a full-scale nuclear war broke out, the ruins of cities around the world are still smoldering. The 4,000 explosions that targeted the countries resulted in no remaining structures: The firestorms produced intense heat and almost all flammable materials were destroyed. According to Mark Lynas's new book, people who will experience the following events are lucky. Here is a scenario based on research that shows what could happen to the world and all living things on it, even when humanity is making nuclear bombs... EVERYONE IS A REFUGEE. The book, based on information from a draft of the British press, continues to describe what will happen: Survivors in cities are trying to move as much as possible. Regardless of their previous status or profession, everyone is now a refugee. Since the roads are covered with rubble, no one can use cars. There is no medical aid except for makeshift bandages made from torn clothes, and walking wounded will soon succumb to radiation sickness, blood loss, or sepsis. Human civilization has ended, and the first survivors will now experience what a nuclear winter means. A full-scale nuclear war could freeze the entire globe into an ice age, which has been known since the 1980s. Today, scientists understand these effects much better, thanks to climate models, which they also use to predict future scenarios. Even at noon, the sun is only visible as a faint, brownish haze, like a foggy day or a solar eclipse, and it will continue to fade as time passes. The upper layers of the atmosphere are heated by the smoke clouds rising from burning cities, and billions of tons of soot are spread across the northern and southern hemispheres. The temperature never drops below freezing during the day, and frost occurs every night. Despite the horror, some people are trying to form communities. Protection groups are formed to protect stores and supermarkets from looters, and primitive weapons are distributed. Very few people have guns, and ammunition will not last long, but clubs with nails are a temporary deterrent. Looters are hiding in the shadows. National governments collapse with the war. Electronic communication is cut off, and there is no media or internet left. The power grid also collapses, and there is complete darkness at night, except for the fires lit by refugees. Most armies and air force bases are directly destroyed by nuclear attacks, and there is no command center left for surviving soldiers to receive orders from. From space, the Earth looks like a light bulb that has suddenly been turned off. In the past, thousands of cities shone brightly at night, but now there is only darkness. Armed conflicts do not last long, as there is no medical aid, and diseases are spreading. A small gunshot wound can be fatal, and the wounded know they will be thrown into a 'pot' soon. Three months later, the temperature is almost constantly below zero. The difference between day and night has disappeared. There is no clean water. Occasionally, dirty snow falls, but the wind has also stopped. Even temperate regions are as cold as Siberia. The Earth has surrendered to the polar night. Finally, this scenario is not only for humans but for all living things. Without light, food chains collapse. Tropical forests are dying, and large fires break out when rainfall decreases. Phytoplankton in the oceans are dying, and marine life is rapidly disappearing. On land, frost is killing plants. The only living things that can survive are seeds that can last for a long time, roots, or small animals that live underground. The nuclear winter is similar to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, when a meteor hit the Earth and caused a 'nuclear winter.' At that time, 75% of all animals on Earth died. Today, if a nuclear war breaks out, the same fate awaits humanity.

**A Land Without Legends**
Human recklessness is driving civilization toward irreversible ruin, with climate change and nuclear war posing significant threats to the survival of culture. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), breaching a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures will lead to disastrous consequences, including deadly tsunamis, scorching heat, and mass extinction. Albert Einstein once said, 'I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.' A single nuclear exchange could trigger a nuclear winter, collapsing agriculture and dooming billions to starvation. Ongoing conflicts, such as those between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Palestine, are grim reminders of the devastating consequences of war. If Earth becomes a volcanic wasteland, all human achievements will vanish, and the proud history of our species will fade into nothing. As Albert Einstein said, 'I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.'

**10 Times Humanity Came Way Too Close To Total Extinction**
Humans have come close to extinction several times throughout history. Here are 10 instances: 1. The Spanish Flu (1918-1920) killed 50-100 million people, 3-6% of the global population. 2. Stanislav Petrov, a Soviet officer, prevented a nuclear war in 1983 by not reporting a false alert of a US missile launch. 3. The Toba Eruption, a massive volcanic eruption, could have wiped out all life on Earth if it had occurred closer to our planet. 4. The Bonilla Comet, a massive comet, passed close to Earth in 2012, but its fragments were detected by researchers. 5. A Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) in 2012 could have caused a global blackout and communication disruption if it had occurred six days earlier. 6. The Justinian Plague (541-542 CE) killed 25 million people, 13% of the global population. 7. The Shaanxi Earthquake (1556 CE) killed over 800,000 people and could have had devastating effects if it had occurred again. 8. A computer error in 1979 almost started World War 3 by warning of a Soviet missile attack. 9. The Black Death (1346-1353 CE) killed an estimated 200 million people, 45% of Europe's population. 10. The Cuban Missile Crisis (1962 CE) brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, but was resolved through diplomacy. 'I knew that if it were true, then within about half an hour I, and my loved ones, and Washington, and the majority of America would cease to exist,' said a national security adviser about the crisis.

**TOP-3 Scenarios That Could Potentially Destroy Humanity**
The Infographics Show YouTube channel has listed three scenarios that could potentially destroy humanity. According to Oxu.Az, citing potokmedia.ru, the first and most severe scenario is an unknown disease X, for which scientists cannot develop a vaccine. In this case, the extinction of our civilization would not be immediate, but the infection would slowly destroy each of us, leaving no chance for survival. Another terrifying scenario is a new global war that would gradually escalate into a nuclear one. In this case, there would be nowhere to hide, and those who survive the nuclear exchange would die from subsequent climate changes. Finally, a large meteorite collision with Earth would be the most devastating outcome, ending everything in a matter of minutes. The impact would create a massive column of fire, smoke, and destruction, and those who survive would be swept away by a massive tsunami or succumb to powerful earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. 'The consequences of such an event would be catastrophic,' said no one, but the channel's host, as the article does not quote anyone.

**The Path to Apocalypse: Top 3 Most Likely Catastrophes That Could Wipe Out Humanity**
According to The Infographics Show, the top three most likely apocalyptic scenarios that could wipe out humanity are a pandemic, a nuclear war, and a massive asteroid collision. A global epidemic of a new, unknown disease would be the most painful and long-term path to extinction, as it would spread rapidly and be difficult to contain. The world would likely cease to exist not from explosions and destruction, but in the silence of empty cities, overwhelmed by disease. A nuclear war, the second most likely scenario, would be characterized by its rapid and devastating speed. A conflict between nuclear powers would not be limited to pinpoint attacks, but would trigger a chain reaction, leading to the total destruction of infrastructure, the death of hundreds of millions of people, and subsequent climate catastrophes. The atmosphere would be filled with soot and ash, blocking sunlight and causing a global cooling, or 'nuclear winter.' Survivors would face radiation, hunger, mutations, and a planet devoid of resources. The third scenario, with the most immediate effect, is the collision of a massive asteroid with Earth. The consequences of the impact would be catastrophic: a massive explosion, comparable to thousands of nuclear bombs, followed by tsunami waves crashing onto continents, and tectonic shifts. Volcanic activity and dust emissions would cause prolonged atmospheric darkness, rapid cooling, and the disappearance of photosynthesis. Life, as we know it today, would become impossible almost instantly. Scientists have long considered and discussed other, less likely but no less frightening scenarios, such as an out-of-control artificial intelligence, an ecological collapse, or a solar superflare. However, a pandemic, nuclear escalation, and asteroid threats remain at the top of scientific assessments, historical analogies, and global risk levels. In the long term, life on the planet is doomed, even without external blows, according to researchers from NASA and the University of Tohoku. Their calculations, based on 400,000 simulations, predict that oxygen will disappear from the atmosphere in about a billion years, and biological life in its current form will cease to exist. This date, 1,000,002,021, seems infinitely far away, but current threats suggest that the end of the world may not be waiting in the future, but could start at any moment.

**What is More Likely to End Humanity: War, Climate Change, or Artificial Intelligence?**
Experts are debating whether climate change, nuclear war, or artificial intelligence (AI) poses the greatest threat to humanity's existence. While climate change is a significant concern, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests it is not a factor that will completely destroy human civilization. Research indicates that even in the worst-case scenarios, humanity will survive, but living conditions will become much more difficult. The question then arises: if climate change is not the end of the world, what could be? The topic of existential risk from AI has come to the forefront due to statements from leading experts, including Eliezer Yudkowsky and Geoffrey Hinton. Yudkowsky has explicitly stated that creating a superhuman intelligence could lead to the death of all humanity. He has even called for an international ban on developing powerful AI systems, suggesting that non-compliance could justify military intervention. While this position may seem radical, it is based on the assumption that a super-intelligence, acting on its own logic, may not consider human interests. Hinton, along with Joshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, has also warned about the risks associated with super-intelligent AI. They have even supported the statement of the Center for AI Safety: 'Mitigating the risk of extinction from artificial intelligence should be a global priority alongside other public health risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.' The Center for AI Safety presents several possible scenarios for a catastrophe: There are many experts who believe that the concerns about AI destroying humanity are unrealistic and divert attention from other, very important problems. 'The current artificial intelligence is far from being able to realize such risks. As a result, it diverts attention from short-term harm from AI,' said Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist from Princeton University. A nuclear conflict is one of the biggest threats to humanity. It can lead to the death of millions and cause a global cooling due to a nuclear winter. However, discussions continue about whether this winter will be so destructive as to threaten the very existence of humanity. Unlike a nuclear war, AI can be unpredictable. It can develop in an uncontrollable direction, and its decisions may contradict human interests. For example, a super-intelligence may optimize processes so that humanity becomes unnecessary or even a hindrance. The main problem is that there is no scientific consensus on the danger of AI. While there are proponents of catastrophic predictions, there are also critics. To avoid irreparable mistakes, humanity must thoroughly study potential risks. Understanding how AI works, why we develop it, and what can go wrong is key to survival and further prosperity of civilization. Toby Ord, a philosopher at the Institute for Future Humanity at Oxford University and a consultant for WHO, the World Bank, and the World Economic Forum, conducts large-scale analyses every few years on what the population of the Earth may suffer from the most. In his latest work, 'The Gap', natural risks, including asteroids and comets, supervolcanic eruptions, and star explosions, are estimated to have relatively low risks, combined, causing one chance in a million of extinction in a century. Addressing anthropogenic risks, the most obvious risk for human survival, it seems, is the risk of nuclear war, and we have approached it several times, mostly by accident. However, Ord doubts that even a nuclear winter would lead to the complete extinction of humanity or a global irreversible collapse of civilization. Similarly, Ord considers that although climate change may become a global disaster of unprecedented scale, it is not necessarily a threat to human extinction. He also believes that environmental harm does not demonstrate a direct mechanism of existential risk. However, he concludes that each of these anthropogenic risks has a higher probability than all natural risks combined (one in a million in a century). Future risks that Ord considers include pandemics, 'unconnected artificial intelligence' (super-intelligent AI systems with goals that were not aligned with human ethics), 'anti-utopian scenarios' (a world with an untouched civilization but locked in a terrible form), nanotechnology, and extraterrestrial life. The risk that pandemics pose is more anthropogenic, not natural, and is estimated at one in 30 in a century, making it the second-highest risk. According to Ord, the greatest risk comes from unconnected artificial intelligence.

**Doomsday Clock shows humanity closer to extinction than ever, but scientists still optimistic**
The 'Doomsday Clock' has been moved up to 89 seconds, the closest humanity has ever been to total annihilation. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, based at the University of Chicago, uses the clock as a metaphor to show how close the planet is to reaching human extinction. Although the change is small, it is a frightening indication of the world's current state. According to the scientists, the clock's new time is a reflection of the increasing threats to humanity, including nuclear war and climate change.

**US Nuclear Arsenal: A Legacy of Toxic Waste and a Growing Risk of Accidental War**
For 40 years, the United States produced four nuclear bombs per day, leaving a vast legacy of toxic radioactive waste. The plants in South Carolina, Washington, Ohio, and Idaho that helped produce the 60,000 atomic bombs have tons of waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years. The production of plutonium and bombs stopped in 1989, but with technological improvements, the country plans to reach a production capacity of at least 80 plutonium cores per year by the mid-2030s. Dr. Carlos Umaña, co-president of the International Association of Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, warns that a large-scale nuclear war would not only be quick but also extremely destructive: 'According to the Federation of American Scientists, there are currently 12,000 nuclear warheads in the world, of which 2,000 are at maximum alert, ready to be detonated in just 60 seconds,' he said. Umaña also explains that the detonation of these types of arms in the context of a large-scale nuclear war could destroy the planet in just 72 minutes. Umaña also highlights the risk of cyberattacks or human errors that could trigger a nuclear explosion accidentally, 'As technology advances, so does the risk of cyberterrorism and human error,' he said.
