**Venture debt finds a new home in the Middle East: Stride Ventures doubles down on Saudi Arabia**
Stride Ventures, a leading player in the global venture debt market, has announced significant expansion in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia. The move includes doubling its local team and opening a second regional office, as the Kingdom redefines the region's approach to startup financing. The global venture debt market has grown at a 14% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years, but the GCC, led by Saudi Arabia, has outpaced this by a factor of nearly four, with a 54% CAGR. Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is driving this transformation, with initiatives such as the Jada Fund of Funds and partnerships with global asset managers. Stride Ventures aims to triple its regional assets under management by 2026 and commit $500 million in the region over the next three to five years. The firm's approach offers sizable and flexible financing to ambitious startups, positioning it as a critical enabler of the region's next wave of unicorns. As Fariha Ansari Javed, Partner at Stride Ventures, says, 'Saudi Arabia is shaping the future of venture capital and private credit with intention and scale.'

**Deputy Points Out Problematic Issues in Regional Budgets**
Deputy Dania Espanaeva pointed out the problematic issues in the regional budgets. She reminded that the Parliament will consider new three-year laws in the fall: on general transfers, on the republican budget. These documents will be prepared according to the new Budget Code, signed by the President in March. The government is currently developing a new methodology for calculating how much money from the republican budget will be given to the regions. It is necessary to understand how effective this new system is, in order to eliminate its shortcomings before the law is passed. 'In the country, Atyrau region, cities of Astana and Almaty are donors, while the remaining 17 regions are recipients. They receive a significant amount of general transfers from the republican budget to cover their expenses. From the three donors, 470 billion tenge were received by the republican budget in 2024, while over 5.3 trillion tenge were allocated to the regions in the form of subsidies. You see the difference', said Dania Espanaeva. Almost the entire country depends on the central budget. Regional incomes are growing, but subsidies are also increasing. The volume of subsidies in 2014 was 978 billion tenge, in 2024 - 5.3 trillion tenge, that is, over 5 times more in 10 years. In addition, there are targeted transfers from the republican budget for the development of regions, for example, the construction of social facilities. However, the level of infrastructure and provision of services in the regions is different. This is reflected in the economic indicators of the regions. The difference in the level of life and income per capita in the regions can reach 10 times. Dania Espanaeva noted that when calculating the transferred funds, the regions' own forecasts are taken into account, and the amount of funds allocated depends on them. However, there is a real overfulfillment, even in individual cases reaching 40%. 'Then the question arises: is this an error in planning or a deliberate reduction in income forecasts to receive larger funds from the center', she asked. It was previously reported that local budgets will receive an additional 100 billion tenge in income from 2026.

**One of the most attractive  --  and sometimes secretive  --  ways the wealthy donate money could soon get even more popular**
Donor-advised funds (DAFs), a form of philanthropy where donors contribute funds, get a tax deduction, and advise on where to donate, are becoming increasingly popular among the wealthy. According to Daniel Heist, a professor at Brigham Young University, 'they're growing like crazy.' The tax bill proposed by President Donald Trump, which would hike taxes on private foundations, could make DAFs even more attractive. Donors can contribute non-cash assets, like appreciated securities or crypto, to DAFs, and the funds grow over time. While technically donors don't control the funds, they can direct the money to any accredited charity. Mitch Stein, the head of strategy at Chariot, said, 'As long as you're following the rules of the DAF provider, you should always have those recommendations honored.' The tax bill would raise the tax rate on private foundations' investment incomes, but DAFs would remain exempt from payout requirements.

**The Quest for Biological Origins: A New Era for Assisted Reproduction**
In the past, infertile couples had to come to terms with the possibility of never having children. Today, donors can offer their gametes and help people have a biological child. This altruistic donation (or interested donation in countries where it is monetized) has its benefits, but also raises the question of the right to know one's origins. This Swiss report explores the Quebec question, where thousands of people born through assisted reproduction (PMA) are searching for their origins. The province has started to address the legal question of those born through PMA. A journalist followed the tireless work of a woman who had to deal with online genealogical banks and 'genetic detectives' to finally find the person who had given her half of her genetic heritage. She was lucky and was able to discover and meet him, but this raises other questions: how should we refer to these genetic providers who are not parents? Switzerland has been recording donor information for nearly two decades to allow children to know certain elements and be contacted or not. Quebec is starting to explore this idea with its own registry in June 2025. However, in both cases, it remains the responsibility of the parents to declare the origin to their children, which is often avoided by the latter who fear the impact of having betrayed their offspring.

**We're The First 0.5% in Human Species  --  What We Owe The Future by William MacAskill**
William MacAskill's book 'What We Owe The Future' suggests that humans have only lived for 0.5% of their potential lifespan, which is one million years. This means that the next 99.5% of human civilization depends on how we act today. MacAskill argues that we have a duty to consider the interests and needs of future people, even if they may not exist or may be far in the future. He also discusses the importance of living in a 'high plasticity period', where our actions can have a significant impact on the far-distant future. MacAskill identifies three possible scenarios for the future: extinction, collapse, and stagnation. He argues that we need to take action to avoid these scenarios and ensure a bright future for all humans. One of the key insights from the book is that a larger population can lead to more opportunities for innovation and progress. MacAskill recommends effective altruism, which involves taking action to benefit future people, not just by being vegan or reducing plastic, but also by doing elections and donating.

**Significant private donation made to Kimberley skate, bike park**
A private donation of $100,000 from Rick and Daphne Hammond will improve Kimberley's skate and bike park. The City is working with volunteers and the Kimberley Trails Society to determine how to use the funds, which will enhance user safety and experience. Proposed improvements include dirt jumps, fencing, signage, and amenities such as benches and a gazebo. The Kimberley Trails Society plans to spend 90% of the funds in 2025 and the remaining 10% in 2026. Councillor Jason McBain praised the donation, saying 'It's just really cool to see folks out there providing significant funding to help some of the amenities around town.' CAO Jim Hendricks described the donors as 'genuinely generous folks' who have contributed to other local projects. Mayor Don McCormick called the donation 'a game changer for kids in town' and thanked Rick and Daphne for their generosity.

**Donor funding crisis goes global**
The global donor funding crisis has worsened, with many countries embracing protectionist policies and wealthy nations failing to show solidarity in response to US President Donald Trump's hostile policies. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted Western governments' greed, undermining trust in their global leadership. The fact that Western governments have diverted funds away from other war-torn and desperately poor countries to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion has underscored their self-serving approach to foreign aid. Despite Mr. Trump's termination of almost all US foreign-aid funding and programming, other donor countries have not stepped up to fill the gap. This lack of action has hindered the provision of global public goods, including health and climate stability. The concept of global public investment suggests that all countries have a stake in solving these challenges and should contribute resources to addressing them. However, the response of most rich countries has been appalling, with several European governments slashing foreign assistance and citing the need to channel funds to defence investment. The amounts required to plug the development-financing hole left by the United States are small, with the World Health Organization facing a US$1.9 billion budget shortfall in 2026-27 and the United Nations World Food Programme facing an estimated 40% reduction in funding. 'It's a similar story at other international organisations,' the article notes. 'The Joint UN Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS), which relied on the US for more than 40% of its financing, will need to cut more than half of its workforce and reduce or eliminate some of its essential programmes.' The article concludes that if wealthier countries refuse to provide for the global common good, the multilateral system as we know it will not survive.

**The Problem with "Effective Altruism"**
The author critiques the philosophy of 'effective altruism', which advocates for donating to the most effective charities to maximize the good done. The author argues that this philosophy disregards the importance of personal relationships, community, and cultural heritage. The author uses the example of the restoration of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, which was funded by 340,000 people from 150 countries, to illustrate the importance of preserving cultural heritage. The author also critiques the idea that charitable dollars are fungible and can be spent on any cause, arguing that human beings and communities are not interchangeable. The author suggests that the philosophy of effective altruism is a form of 'Communism' that seeks to immiserate individuals for the sake of alleviating others' misery. The author argues that art, culture, and community are essential to human flourishing and that charitable giving should prioritize these values. The author quotes various thinkers, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and David Bentley Hart, to support their argument. The author also references the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's critique of the philosophy of effective altruism. The author concludes that the philosophy of effective altruism is fundamentally antihuman and that charitable giving should prioritize the values of community, culture, and personal relationships.

**Musk loses bid to stop OpenAI's for-profit shift, but can make his case in trial**
A federal judge rejected Elon Musk's request to block OpenAI's planned conversion from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity, but expedited the case so that Musk's core claims can be addressed in a trial before the end of 2025. Musk claimed that OpenAI's for-profit conversion 'violates the terms of Musk's donations' to the company, but failed to meet the burden of proof needed for an injunction. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote that 'the Court is prepared to offer an expedited schedule on the core claims driving this litigation [to] address the issues which are allegedly more urgent in terms of public, not private, considerations.' Musk alleged that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 'took advantage of Musk's altruism in order to lure him into funding the venture' but was only 'pretending to share Musk's concern about the trajectory of the artificial intelligence industry.' Musk says he gave $44 million to OpenAI from 2016 to 2020. The trial is expected to take place in fall 2025.

**In a cost of living crisis, what compels people to give money away?**
New Zealanders are generous, but the country's giving landscape is complex. According to the CAF Giving Index, New Zealand ranks 17th, behind countries like Australia and the US. Philanthropy New Zealand's CEO, Rahul Watson Govindan, notes that New Zealand has over 27,000 registered charities, but most of the money goes to the top 10 or 20 largest charities. People give for various reasons, including a sense of connection with others, to feel good about themselves, and to make a difference in their community. Platforms like Givealittle allow individuals to fundraise for specific causes, but effective altruism advocates for donating to causes that can do the most good. Some effective altruists 'earn to give', while others focus on diseases with known prevention and treatment available. The ideology has received scrutiny, but some points are harder to refute, such as the importance of giving to places where basic needs are inaccessible. Many people feel connected to their community and donate to local causes, while others donate to global causes. Financial incentives, such as tax rebates, can encourage more people to give, but the process of claiming a rebate can be complex. Above all, giving to charity can reinforce a knowledge of one's relative fortune.

**The couple who want to make America procreate again**
Simone and Malcolm Collins, a couple from Pennsylvania, are enthusiastic advocates for a new pronatalist movement. They believe that having more children is necessary to avoid an apocalyptic future and are willing to take risks to achieve their goal. Simone has had six pregnancies since 2019 and has 32 embryos left. They have used technologies such as IVF and genetic selection to conceive their children and have donated three embryos. The Collinses have been criticized for their views on parenting, including their use of corporal punishment and their dismissal of solutions such as more housing or money to encourage people to have more children. They believe that making large families 'high-status' and removing car-seat mandates are key to increasing the fertility rate. Their ideas have caught the attention of people such as Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society, who has expressed concerns about the use of genetic selection and the potential for eugenics. The Collinses are investing in this technology via their nonprofit, Hard Effective Altruism, saying they want to make it accessible for everybody.

**Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute shuts its doors**
The Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) at Oxford University has shut down. According to a valedictory message on the FHI website, the institute made a valuable contribution to the study of the future, with topics such as existential risk, effective altruism, and AI alignment now being pursued by leading AI labs, government agencies, and specialized research centers. FHI was involved in the development of various ideas, including anthropics, human enhancement ethics, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. However, the philosophy of effective altruism proved 'very brittle' and was likely not welcome at Oxford's philosophy department, which FHI was a part of.
