**Spain Favored to Win UEFA Nations League, But Germany Seeks Redemption**
Spain, the 2024 European champion, is the favorite to win the UEFA Nations League, but Germany, which has never won the title, is looking to regain lost ground. The four teams that will compete in the 'final four' are Spain, France, Portugal, and Germany. Spain is seeking to repeat its 2023 success and win the title again, while France and Portugal, the previous winners, are also hoping to win. Germany, which has been growing in strength, is looking to recover from its recent losses. Portugal, which won the first edition in 2019, struggled to eliminate Denmark, while Spain needed a penalty shootout to defeat the Netherlands. France, the 2021 winner and 2023 finalist, also needed penalties to defeat Croatia. Germany, which has not lost since the Euro 2024, is looking to regain its status as a top team. The final will be played on June 8 in Munich, with the third-place match taking place in Stuttgart.

**In Defense of the Nations League**
The Nations League is often criticized for being a nuisance, but it has provided great matches and avoids meaningless friendlies. The tournament has a final four format and a division system (Liga A, B, C, and D). Previous editions have had high-level finals, with Portugal winning in 2019, France in 2021, and Spain in 2023. The author argues that the Nations League is a worthy tournament that should be valued, rather than being dismissed as inferior to the European Championship or World Cup. The author notes that the Nations League can be a stepping stone for teams, as seen with Spain's success in the 2023 tournament, which helped them win the 2024 European Championship. Spain will face France in one of the semifinals, a highly anticipated match featuring Lamine Yamal against Kylian Mbappé. The other semifinal will feature Germany and Portugal, with Marc-André Ter Stegen as one of the key players. 'It would be impossible to see these matches if it weren't for the Nations League,' the author says. 'And who knows, maybe in the future, having a Nations League title will be a source of pride and satisfaction.'

**Salvador Salvador and Costa Brothers Extend Contracts with Sporting until 2030**
Salvador Salvador and the Costa brothers, Kiko and Martim, have extended their contracts with Sporting until 2030. The trio, who are all Portuguese national team players, were instrumental in Sporting's impressive performance in the Champions League this season. They were also key players in Portugal's historic strong performance in the European Championship in the winter. Sporting's head coach, Francisco Costa, said, 'Três Bicampeões, o mesmo compromisso' (Three-time champions, the same commitment). The extension is a significant boost for the club, which has been on the rise in Europe. The three players will continue to play for Sporting until 2030.

**The football superpowers and the clubs that are just pawns in the game**
The European Super League, a proposed breakaway competition, was unveiled in 2021 by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and other top clubs. However, the plan was met with fierce criticism and ultimately collapsed. UEFA responded by announcing an expanded Champions League for 2024-25, which included 36 clubs playing 10 games each in a league phase. The plan was tweaked again to award two places to the leagues with the highest coefficient, rather than the clubs themselves. The current format has 36 clubs playing 8 games in a Swiss league phase, with the top 8 moving automatically to the knockout stage and the next 16 to a two-leg playoff. The article argues that the most powerful clubs threaten to break away, UEFA gives them more-or-less what they want, which is the guarantee of extra income. The FIFA Club World Cup is also criticized for being overblown and for handing out large sums of money to participating clubs. The article concludes that the current Champions League format is not ideal, but it is better than the alternatives.

**Argentina vs Spain: Finalissima 2025 to Take Place in March 2026**
The Finalissima 2025, a match between Argentina and Spain, is expected to take place in March 2026, before the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

According to FIFA, the match will be a repeat of the 2022 World Cup final, where Argentina defeated Italy 3-0 at Wembley Stadium. The match will be a precursor to the 2026 World Cup and a symbol of cooperation between continents, with the 2030 World Cup to be hosted by Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Spain, Morocco, and Portugal. The RFEF and AFA have confirmed that more details on the organization, venue, and ticket sales will be announced in the coming weeks.

**Conmebol Proposes 64-Team World Cup for 2030**
Alejandro Domínguez, the president of Conmebol, has proposed to FIFA that the 2030 World Cup, hosted by Spain, Morocco, and Portugal, be played with 64 teams 'for the first and only time'. This would significantly increase the number of teams from the 48 approved by FIFA for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Domínguez stated, 'We are convinced that the celebration of the centenary will be something unique, because only once 100 years are fulfilled. And that's why we are proposing, for the first and only time, to carry out this anniversary with 64 teams.' The proposal aims to give all countries the opportunity to experience the World Cup and make sure no one is left out of the 'party' of football, which will be played for the first time in three continents: Africa, Europe, and South America. The FIFA Council approved the decision to expand the number of participants in the 2026 World Cup to 48 in March 2023. The new format would see teams divided into 12 groups of four and play 104 matches, 40 more than the last edition, over 40 days. According to FIFA, the revised format mitigates the risk of collusion and ensures that all teams play a minimum of three matches, providing a balanced rest period for competing teams.

**UEFA Rejects Uruguayan Proposal for 64-Team World Cup in 2030**
The Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) has proposed to the FIFA that the 2030 World Cup feature 64 teams, but the idea has been met with strong opposition from Europe. The president of the UEFA, Aleksandar Ceferin, expressed his rejection of the proposal, saying, 'For me, that proposal was surprising. And I think it's a bad idea. It's not a good idea for the World Cup or for our qualification. I don't support that idea.' However, Ceferin noted that the UEFA had previously opposed the organization of the Club World Cup, which will have its first edition in June this year. The 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico will feature 48 teams, while the 2022 World Cup in Qatar had 32 teams. The proposed 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, with additional matches in Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, would require significant logistical challenges and alter the competition period, potentially extending it to six weeks.

**England boss Sarina Wiegman admits one eye is on Euros ahead of...**
England boss Sarina Wiegman is using the Nations League double-header against Belgium to prepare her team for the upcoming European Women's Championship. Wiegman said, 'I think it's important that we have a good picture of our team. Of course we go out to play Belgium twice and we want to win those games, but also getting the team ready for the Euros to know who we have available and know who's in good form.' England striker Alessia Russo has come into form at the right time, helping Arsenal advance to the Champions League semi-finals. England captain Leah Williamson praised Russo, saying, 'To be a number nine in any team you have to have that sort of not arrogance, but confidence about you and we all want to see her playing like she is so she carries that because she deserves it as a human, she works hard for it.' The UK is set to host the 2035 Women's World Cup, with FIFA president Gianni Infantino describing its interest as the 'one valid bid.' Wiegman added, 'It will be really great if that tournament will be held here. We know with the experience of the Euros how big the game is already here and what that momentum gets here in this country.'

FIFA President Gianni Infantino called the proposal 'interesting and worthy of a thorough analysis', but noted that it is unlikely to be approved by other FIFA members.

**European Leagues Oppose Winter World Cup in Saudi Arabia**
The top European leagues are likely to oppose any attempt to hold the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia during the winter. The FIFA Congress, which will be held online on Wednesday, is expected to announce Saudi Arabia's win to host the 2034 World Cup, possibly by acclamation. While opposition from national football associations may be symbolic at best, the real opposition may lie in holding the tournament in the winter, as was the case with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The European leagues, which include the English Premier League, are embroiled in a legal dispute with FIFA over the lack of consultation on the international match schedule. According to the British news agency PA, there are significant concerns among the top European leagues about the chaos that would be caused by holding the World Cup in the winter. The local leagues stopped during the 2022 World Cup, but it would be difficult to repeat the experience given the increase in the number of teams participating in European club competitions, as well as the increase in the number of participants in the World Cup to 48 teams. During the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, players will be with their national teams for about eight weeks between May 25 and July 19.

**UEFA May Host Champions League Matches in the United States by 2033**
According to media reports, the United States may host several matches of the UEFA Champions League, including the final, by 2033. This is due to the fact that the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is close to concluding a sponsorship deal with Relevent Sports on global commercial rights for European club competitions. UEFA and the Association of European Clubs (AEK) are in talks with Relevent Sports to transfer commercial rights for European men's club competitions from 2027 to 2033. This deal would mean that some Champions League matches, including the final, would be held in the United States. FIFA announced in April last year that it would consider amending its policy to allow national leagues to host matches in different countries. At the same time, FIFA signed a global agreement with Relevent - the media company accused FIFA of illegally banning foreign clubs and leagues from holding official matches in the United States. If the deal between UEFA and Relevent is completed, it will mark the end of UEFA's more than 30-year partnership with TEAM Marketing, which initially handled all key branding for the Champions League, including the design of the ball and the famous anthem. This may also put up to 170 jobs at risk in the company. According to a source, TEAM is shocked by these news. Relevent has previously signed a commercial rights agreement with La Liga and attempted to hold a league match featuring Barcelona and Girona at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. This request was rejected by the Royal Spanish Football Federation. Later, Relevent attempted to hold a league match between Barcelona (Guayaquil) and Guayaquil City, but the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) refused to sanction the game. Relevent is based in New York and is owned by billionaire Stephen Ross, who also owns the NFL's Miami Dolphins. Relevent is the organizer of the International Champions Cup - an annual football club friendly tournament in which mostly European clubs participate. As a reminder, the United States, Mexico, and Canada will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup together. The United States and Mexico have also submitted a joint bid to host the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup.
