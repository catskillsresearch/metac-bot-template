**EU Envoy Calls for Immediate Ceasefire and Negotiations to End Sudan War**
The European Union's Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa, Dr. Annette Weber, stated that the ongoing war in Sudan between the army and the Rapid Support Forces has caused devastating destruction and that it cannot be tolerated. She emphasized that the only way to exit the crisis is through direct negotiations between the two parties. Weber added that the EU is closely monitoring the situation in Sudan with great concern, particularly in light of the escalating humanitarian suffering and the targeting of civilians in several areas. She stressed the need for the region's countries to exert more pressure on the warring parties to push them towards a ceasefire and the start of political talks. Weber pointed out that the EU's focus is currently on maintaining the effectiveness of the Sudanese state, as around 14 million Sudanese are trapped inside the country, while others have fled to neighboring countries, threatening the collapse of state institutions and infrastructure. She emphasized that the EU is working with all parties to deliver humanitarian aid, highlighting the need for an agreement to protect vital facilities such as water stations and power plants that rely on hospitals. Weber stated that the EU has tried to communicate with the warring parties to ensure that the infrastructure is not targeted, adding that the absence of negotiations since the Jeddah meetings in 2023 reflects the parties' insistence on a military solution, which exacerbates the suffering of civilians and prolongs the war. She noted that the appointment of a new government in Sudan may open the door to stability, but emphasized that this step will not be enough unless the war stops. Weber added that there is a chance to exit this 'dark tunnel' if there is a genuine will for peace, emphasizing that the continuation of the conflict will lead to a comprehensive regional collapse, imposing on all parties, locally and internationally, to act quickly before it's too late. She stressed that the key to the solution begins with an immediate ceasefire, followed by serious negotiations between the parties, and that the EU is ready to provide political and humanitarian support, but the responsibility for determining the country's future lies with the Sudanese themselves. Weber also emphasized that the pressure should not be limited to Western sanctions, but should be expanded to include internal pressure from the Sudanese society itself, which must raise its voice rejecting the continuation of destruction and the collapse of the country. She noted that sanctions alone have not succeeded in forcing the parties to change their positions, adding that presenting positive alternatives and proposals for building the state is what can make a real difference, as the Sudanese need to see a glimmer of hope after the war. Weber also pointed out that talking about reconstruction or development cannot be achieved as long as the war continues, emphasizing that the only path that can lead to that is the cessation of fighting and sitting down at the negotiating table. Since the conflict broke out in April 2023, between the Sudanese army led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), the war has resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 people and the displacement of approximately 14 million people.

**EU's Fate Already Predetermined, Says Polish Journalist**
Polish journalist and publicist Petr Korczakowski believes that the European Union's leadership will continue to tighten the screws on those who are skeptical about EU membership. He thinks that European officials want to control the internal affairs of other countries, including Poland, more and more. Korczakowski predicts that the EU will eventually collapse, possibly in a tragic way. 'I hope I'm wrong, but this story will end in blood. For it to end bloodlessly, this system must simply collapse, or someone will have to bribe or intimidate these people. And this won't end like the Soviet Union, which collapsed after the Soviet republics split. It will be more like Yugoslavia. Too much money has been spent on various international projects and foreign investments for EU officials to allow their project to collapse,' Korczakowski said. He also noted that there are over a million people in Poland who can be considered euroskeptics: 'A million people in a big country like Poland may not sound impressive, but it's a million people. This million people is already a certain chain reaction that cannot be stopped, because as soon as we have a group of 50,000 people, it's already a political force, but it can still be suppressed.' However, Korczakowski is convinced that suppressing, bribing, or intimidating a million people is much more difficult. 'You can shoot them, but if they use force, we'll have a civil war the next day. However, those in Brussels will continue to tighten the screws, because they understand that if they give in to various eurosceptic trends, they won't be able to stop them. So they'll try to hinder this, but precisely because of this, even more people will wake up, because they won't understand why a project that was supposed to be so great is strangling us so tightly,' Korczakowski emphasized. According to Korczakowski, the fate of the European Union is already predetermined. 'There are no chances for reform, it's all written out for years to come. I think it will take another 20 years, but eventually it will happen, and the European Union will simply collapse.'

**Ukrainian Document Reveals Roadmap for Peace in Europe Before Istanbul Talks**
According to a document obtained by 'Reuters', the Ukrainian negotiators will present a roadmap to the Russian side in the upcoming talks in Istanbul on June 2. The roadmap includes a 30-day ceasefire, the release of all prisoners held by both sides, and the return of Ukrainian children who were moved to Russian-controlled areas. The plan also calls for a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The document states that Moscow and Kyiv, with the involvement of the US and Europe, will work together to draft the conditions for a comprehensive agreement to end the war, which is the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. Ukrainian officials said earlier this week that they had sent the plan to the Russian side before the Istanbul talks. The Ukrainian conditions for a peace agreement, outlined in the document, are largely the same as those previously proposed by Kyiv and include no restrictions on Ukraine's military power after a peace agreement, non-recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces during the war, and compensation for Ukraine. The document also states that the current front line will be the starting point for negotiations on territory, which differs significantly from Russia's publicly stated demands in recent weeks. US President Donald Trump has urged Moscow and Kyiv to work together to reach an agreement to end the war between them. Russia has proposed a second round of face-to-face talks with Ukrainian officials in Istanbul next week.

**EU Sends Three Times More Money to Russia Than to Ukraine**
The EU has sent three times more money to Russia than to Ukraine since the war began. According to Global Witness activist Mai Rosner, 'There is no real desire to limit Russia's ability to produce and sell oil.' The EU has purchased oil and gas from Russia for three times the amount of aid Ukraine has received, with 2,200 billion kronor flowing from the EU to Russia and 700 billion kronor in aid to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. In US dollars, this translates to 233 billion and 73 billion, respectively, according to numbers from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Oil and gas sales are crucial to Russia's war effort, accounting for nearly a third of the country's total income and over 60% of its exports. Despite efforts to limit EU imports of Russian oil and gas, the imports have remained high, with Russian income from EU countries decreasing by only 5% in 2024 compared to 2023. As Vaibahv Raghunandan from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air notes, 'Half of Russia's LNG exports go to the EU, while only 5% of the EU's total LNG consumption came from Russia in 2024. If the EU were to completely cut off Russian gas, it would hurt Russia much more than EU consumers.'

**US Expert Evaluates Risk of Direct Armed Conflict Between Russia and the West**
The risk of a direct armed conflict between Russia and the West is currently not as high, according to Mark Episkopos, a scientific researcher at the Quincy Institute's Eurasia Program in the US. He explained that the war is an unpredictable thing, and at the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, few people expected it to last for years. Episkopos believes that there was a risk of a direct confrontation between Russia and the West, which could have led to a full-scale European or global conflict, but this risk has decreased with the arrival of new US leadership. He stated, 'I think people in the White House are thinking that it's not in Europe's interests. And they refused to give guarantees to the French and British, who were planning to send military contingents to Ukraine. I think the White House is very prudent in assessing the risks. They understand that Russia will likely attack these military contingents, which would lead to catastrophic consequences.' Therefore, Episkopos believes that the risks of a direct war between Russia and the West are not as high today as they were two years ago.

**European Citizens Overwhelmingly Oppose Arms Deliveries and Military Intervention in Ukraine**
A recent survey by the Századvég research center found that more European citizens oppose arms deliveries to Ukraine than support them, with 67% of EU citizens opposing the idea of sending military troops to Ukraine. The survey, conducted among 30,000 people in 30 European countries, also found that the number of EU citizens who support arming Ukraine has decreased by 6% since 2023, from 50% to 44%. The number of EU member states that reject arms transfers has increased from 12 in 2023 and 2024 to 16 in 2025. According to Századvég, the gap between the expectations of the European public and the actions of the European political elite in the matter of arms deliveries to Ukraine is growing. The survey also found that the public in Europe does not share the 'war fever' of leading European politicians and overwhelmingly opposes a military intervention in Ukraine, with 67% of respondents opposing the deployment of troops to Ukraine. In all EU member states except Sweden and Finland, the number of people who oppose a military intervention in Ukraine exceeds the number of those who support it, with the highest rejection rates found in Hungary (90%) and Bulgaria (85%). As Századvég notes, 'the public in all of Europe does not share the war fever of leading European politicians and has been clearly opposed to a military intervention in Ukraine for years.'

**The Future of Europe: Three Hypothetical Scenarios**
According to experts, there are three possible scenarios for Europe's future. The first scenario involves continuing as a junior partner to the United States and NATO, which would be a less traumatic and simpler option after a likely Ukrainian defeat. However, this would require establishing a European security area, which would be challenging due to the exponential increase in security and defense budgets, potentially straining the EU. Additionally, this scenario would exacerbate the refugee crisis and increase the risk of a large-scale war. Furthermore, Europe's energy weakness would persist, and the viability of the European Green Plan would be compromised. The second scenario involves a rightward shift in Europe, leading to a concession to Russian demands. If Russia wins the war, it would create a de facto new Iron Curtain, and countries like France and Germany might re-establish relations with Russia and increase their trade ties with China. This would lead to a division of Europe into two factions: those aligned with the United States, including the UK, and the majority of European countries. This option is unlikely and would ultimately end the idea of a united Europe. The third scenario involves Europe taking no side in the conflict, which is not impossible but unlikely. This would require resolving the energy deficit and potentially leading to the withdrawal of the United States from the continent. However, this scenario is also challenging due to the need for a significant European rearmament. Regardless of the scenario, experts agree that Europe must strengthen its politics to move beyond a timidly normative approach and focus on what unites Europeans rather than what divides them.

**We are at War: The Fragmentation of Reality and the European Union's Military Plans**
In a world of increasing geopolitical polarization, the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will be a reflection of the fragmentation of our reality, which we will witness as spectators over the next two decades, looking towards the Far East. The author, a professor, has announced to their students that we are at war, just like they did in February 2022, when the drums of war were first heard. This time, the European Union is taking steps towards a possible war in five years, as announced in the Joint White Paper 'Rearm Europe 2030', which aims to prepare the European defense. The plan will cost an additional 800 billion euros over the next four years, on top of the general budget. As the author says, 'we are giving the enemy day and hour'.

**Do Europeans think World War III is imminent?**
A recent YouGov survey found that between 41% and 55% of Europeans in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain believe that another world war is likely to occur within the next five to 10 years. The majority of respondents expect that such a conflict would involve the use of nuclear weapons. The survey also found that European militaries are not prepared for a global conflict, with only France believing that its armed forces could effectively defend the country. The respondents were likely to take part militarily if another world war did break out, with Britain having the highest percentage of participants at 89%. The biggest obstacle to peace in Europe is seen as Russia, with up to 82% of Western Europeans considering it a major or moderate threat. Islamic terrorism is the second biggest threat, with Germany being the most concerned country at 78%. Tensions between Europe and the US are also seen as a major or moderate threat to continental peace, with more than half of the surveyed people in Spain, Germany, and France expressing this concern.

**Third World War Looms: Survey Reveals Growing Concerns**
A recent survey has found that a significant percentage of people in the US and Europe believe that the likelihood of a third world war is increasing. According to the YouGov survey, 41-55% of respondents in five European countries (UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) and 45% in the US believe that a third world war is likely to happen within the next decade. The survey also found that 68-76% of respondents believe that any future war would likely involve the use of nuclear weapons, and that a third world war would result in significantly higher casualties than the previous two world wars. The survey highlights the growing concerns about the role of nuclear weapons in any future conflict, with a majority of respondents (57-73%) believing that a third world war would lead to a significant increase in human casualties. The survey also found that there is a lack of confidence in the military capabilities of some European countries, with only 16% of Italian respondents and 44% of French respondents believing that their countries' armed forces are capable of defending themselves effectively in the event of a global conflict.

**Europeans Fear a Third World War is Looming**
A recent survey conducted by YouGov and published by The Guardian found that a significant portion of the European population, between 41% and 55%, believes that a Third World War is likely to occur within the next 5 to 10 years. According to The Guardian, 'between 41% and 55% of respondents in the five European countries surveyed (UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) said they thought it was very or fairly likely that there would be another world war in the next five to ten years, an opinion shared by 45% of Americans.' Additionally, a majority of respondents, between 68% and 76%, predict that a potential Third World War would involve the use of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, between 57% and 73% of respondents believe that a Third World War would result in more loss of life than the one that occurred between 1939 and 1945, and between 25% and 44% think that the majority of people on the planet would die in the conflict.

**Europe Reconsiders Russian Energy as US Reliability Comes into Question**
The US may not be a reliable energy supplier for Europe, according to some European industrialists and officials. Although the US provided liquefied natural gas to help fill the supply gap left by Russia in Europe from 2022 to 2023, the relationship between the US and Europe has been shaken by Trump's actions. As energy has become a bargaining chip in trade talks, some major European energy companies are considering a previously unimaginable possibility: re-importing part of Russia's natural gas. According to a roadmap planned by the EU after the start of the Ukraine war, the EU will stop importing Russian energy by 2027. However, talks between Europe and Qatar on increasing gas supplies have stalled, and Europe's renewable energy deployment is not yet sufficient to make Europe feel secure. As a result, Europe is reconsidering Russia's energy. A senior executive at Engie, a French energy company partially owned by the state, told Reuters, 'Russia can meet the EU's demand for about 20% to 25%, which is lower than the 40% before the war.' 'If a reasonable peace can be achieved in Ukraine, we can restore the gas supply to 60 billion cubic meters, or even 70 billion cubic meters, including liquefied natural gas,' he added. TotalEnergies, a French oil giant, emphasized the risks of over-reliance on US natural gas. He pointed out that France's energy supply needs diversification and multiple gas supply routes, rather than relying on a single or two supply lines. He said, 'Europe will never again import 1500 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia... but I bet that the import volume will reach 700 billion cubic meters.' Even in France, which is one of the most energy-diversified countries in Europe, the situation is dire. Germany's dependence on cheap Russian gas before the war is even more severe, and options are limited. According to Reuters, some companies in the Ruhr chemical park, one of Germany's largest chemical industry clusters, believe that 'Russian gas will return soon.' The local energy supply used to be about 60% from the Nord Stream pipeline, but one pipeline was blown up in 2022. Local officials quoted by Reuters said that 'restoring Russian energy imports or transportation is possible after a peace agreement in Ukraine.' A CDU parliamentarian even said, 'When Ukraine and Russia restore peace, sanctions will be lifted, and gas will be able to flow again, perhaps this time through an American-controlled pipeline.' The French World reported that the pipeline controlled by Americans may refer to American businessman Rich's consideration of acquiring the Nord Stream gas company. In March, the Russian Foreign Minister confirmed the existence of talks on the Nord Stream project. As of now, the European Commission spokesperson has refused to comment on the prospects of restoring Russian energy supplies.

**World War 3 to begin soon? Survival guides, nuclear bunkers, soldier recruitment... how Europe is getting ready to fight with Russia**
European countries are preparing for a potential World War III with Russia, with some predicting that Vladimir Putin could launch an attack around 2030. The European Union believes that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, Russia could attack, prompting the EU to prepare for a large-scale war. European countries are appealing to Britain to rejoin the EU, which would provide them with the support of Europe's second nuclear-armed country. France has issued an invasion survival guide for its citizens, advising them on how to defend the republic in the event of an invasion. France has also stationed fighter jets armed with hypersonic nuclear missiles along the border with Germany, and is considering granting Poland similar protection. The EU has launched a huge spending plan to rebuild its forces and support Ukraine, with a budget of up to 800 billion euros (£500 billion) on defence. Europe is also considering building a drone shield from the Baltic to the Black Sea to deter a Russian invasion and make it 'very painful' for Putin, according to the EU.

**Two Europes on the Brink of War: A Divided Response to the Russian Threat**
Two Europes emerged at the European Council summit in Brussels, with one group of countries, led by the Nordic and Baltic states, pushing for a more urgent military response to the threat from Russia. These countries, which are most exposed to Russia, are calling for the EU to arm itself more heavily in case Moscow decides to attack another border in the coming years. In contrast, the southern European countries, such as Spain, Italy, France, and Greece, are more cautious and are asking for more financial support and transfers to fund the military spending. The European Commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, warned that 'Europe must prepare for war', while the defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, spoke about the possibility of a Russian attack on NATO before 2030. However, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, have expressed concerns about the term 'rearmament' and have proposed alternative names for the plan, such as 'defending Europe'. The EU is also facing disagreements over how to finance the military spending, with some countries, such as the Netherlands, opposing the idea of increasing the budget. Despite these differences, the EU has reiterated its commitment to supporting Ukraine militarily and politically.

**Who will win the trade war between the EU and the US?**
The trade war between the EU and the US has escalated, with both sides imposing tariffs. Cecilia Malmström, former EU Trade Commissioner, believes this exchange of tariffs is 'definitely a conflict in escalation' and that 'it's a game where everyone loses.' She states that consumers and ordinary people will be the most affected, as prices will rise, affecting inflation, employment, and growth. Malmström also notes that the idea of a 'golden age of tariffs' coming to the US is an illusion, with only a few economists believing it. The EU has made it clear that it is fundamentally against tariffs. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, stated that the highest tariffs are altering supply chains, 'generating uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake and prices will rise.' The EU-US trade relationship is described as 'the most important commercial relationship in the world.' The trade in goods and services between the EU and the US reached 1.6 trillion euros in 2023, according to the European Commission in Brussels. Malmström is concerned about the automotive industry, which is a target of Trump's, and urges the EU to be 'as prepared as possible' for a prolonged and potentially damaging dispute.

**The Two Economies of War: Military Spending and Renewable Energy**
The European Union is expected to increase military spending, but it's also crucial to accelerate the transition to renewable energy, which will enhance security. The military spending is underway, and it's unclear what could stop it. The US, under Donald Trump, is now accelerating the effort, withdrawing the American shield that protected Western Europe for three-quarters of a century. This is a complete reversal. In France, military spending was over 5% of GDP at the beginning of the 5th Republic in 1958, but it decreased to 3% in the 1970s-1980s and 2% after the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War. It's expected to rise to 3% or even 5% according to some. The EU will have to find this money, and the temptation to borrow will be great. However, for heavily indebted countries like France and Italy, it will be dangerous to add to their debt. 'It's a real disconnect,' says sociologist Julien Damon, referring to the shift from social spending to military spending. In 1938, defense spending accounted for 50% of public spending, while in 2023 it was only 2%. Before reaching such extremes, politicians have targeted the transition to renewable energy. 'There's a real disconnect in the political sphere on the ecological transition, both financially, operationally, and regulatorily,' says Thierry Pech, director general of think tank Terra Nova. In France, the cuts seem limited, but behind it is a challenge to an ambition that costs hundreds of billions of euros at the European level, the same order of magnitude as the military effort. It would be dangerous to give up on the ecological effort, not just for environmental reasons, but also because it reduces dependence on fossil fuels, a major weakness as seen during the gas price explosion following the Ukraine invasion. It would be naive to think that the rest of the world doesn't care. In the US, financiers are closely monitoring the effects of climate change on the activity of the companies they invest in. Republican lawmakers have proposed a bill to impose tariffs on high-carbon imports. In China, the transition to renewable energy is seen not only as a constraint, but also as a major opportunity. Chinese industries have already become leaders in solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles. The EU will have to reconcile two economies of war, with efforts that could total 150 billion euros for a country like France, equivalent to 5% of GDP.

**Is the 'Amizade' of Trump and Putin the Gateway to the 3rd World War? Understanding What's at Stake**
The global geopolitical landscape is shifting, with the US and Russia drawing closer, while Europe is concerned and trying to protect itself. This delicate balance has some analysts warning of a possible global conflict. The US President, Donald Trump, has even mentioned the possibility of a 'Third World War' in his televised argument with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky. While no one expects a conflict of this scale to erupt soon, this time it's not being dismissed. 'Every war is unthinkable until it happens. Just before the Ukraine war started in 2022, analysts said a war in Europe was unthinkable at that time. The First and Second World Wars were unthinkable until they happened,' reflects Raquel Gontijo, a professor of International Relations at PUC Minas. The world has changed since the Second World War, and the start of a conflict will likely be different. There is at least one contemporary parallel with the dangerous scenario of the 1930s, notes the professor. 'An analogy that has been made is that, in the period before the Second World War, the UK perceived the territorial expansion of Germany and adopted an appeasement policy, allowing it to expand and thinking that a peaceful configuration would be reached later. Clearly, that did not happen.' The parallel with this case is Russia and its expansionist ambitions. The peace agreement that the US is trying to broker between Russians and Ukrainians favors Putin, who would grab at least a quarter of Ukrainian territory. What comes next is a mystery. 'What does Russia want? Just a part of Ukraine? The whole of Ukraine? More expansion in Eastern Europe? Where does this end? We don't know,' concludes the professor. The professor of international law at UFMG, Lucas Carlos Lima, analyzes the situation with caution. 'It depends a lot on what is meant by Third World War. If the sense is a conflict with a high number of participants, including nuclear powers, the risk exists. But, at the same time, there are many efforts to mitigate the risks. States are not economically or politically interested in a larger-scale conflict.' It is at this point that the apparent approach of Trump and Putin worries. In the field of international relations, movements are rarely transparent, and all that can be done is infer intentions from the actors. There are analysts who see in Trump's attacks on Zelensky and, consequently, in the affection for Putin, a attempt to distance Russians and Chinese. Others, that it is a personal issue of Trump, admired by Putin's power. Or, still, a political calculation to increase his prestige as one who ended a long war and saved resources for his country. 'The Trump administration has changed its position on the Ukraine war. This does not necessarily mean a general and unrestricted approach to Putin. Firstly, the intention may be to reduce American presence in the European conflict. Secondly, to reduce tensions with the Russian administration, which was approaching a proxy war. Thirdly, the approach may also serve to end Russian isolation, which automatically brought Moscow closer to Beijing,' reflects the professor Lucas Carlos Lima. In the way, is Europe. After Trump's attacks on Zelensky, European leaders rallied around the Ukrainian and announced billions of dollars to reinforce the continent's defense. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that 'Europe faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has experienced in our adult life.' Even between China, the US and Russia, Europe is a major military and economic force, one of the protagonists in the global political game. 'The problem is that it is not a country, but several overlapping blocks. Sometimes coordination fails, and each country will have its own interpretation, with governments more to the right, others more to the left. Acting as a block is difficult,' notes the professor Raquel Gontijo. To Latin America, for now, remains to watch the dance of the great powers, in a moment when a greater short-term threat to Brazil than a war is the economic one, under the specter of Trump's taxations.

**EU Faces Off Against US: Trade Between the Two Economic Giants, Sensitive Points for Europe, and Romania's Position**
The potential trade war between the US and the EU is a major headache for Europe, as the EU is a significant exporter to the US. The EU has a trade surplus with the US, and tariffs would significantly affect European companies. The main point of contention is the EU's trade surplus and a series of taxes that are higher for the EU. According to Politico, some countries are more exposed to the risk than others. The US is the EU's main trading partner, with a total trade value of over 1.5 trillion euros in 2023. Trump has repeatedly spoken about 'unfair trade practices' by the EU, blaming them for the US's large deficit with the EU, which reached approximately 157 billion euros in 2023. However, when considering services, this deficit is substantially compensated. The US enjoyed a surplus of 109 billion euros in services provided to the EU, mainly in professional and management services, intellectual property, and financial services. If Trump were to apply general tariffs on all EU imports, car manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies would be the most affected. The top three categories of European products (by value) sold in the US are machinery, pharmaceutical products, and vehicles. The EU exported vehicles worth over 57 billion euros to the US in 2023 – a key point for Trump, who lamented that EU countries 'send us millions of cars,' but 'don't buy our products, don't take our cars.' This statement is not entirely correct. The EU bought American vehicles worth nearly 14 billion euros in 2023 – which is, of course, much less than it sold. Some countries would suffer more from a trade war than others. Only Germany, Italy, and Ireland accounted for over 50% of exports to the US in 2023. Romania is also on the list, which has a trade surplus with the US: Tariffs on cars – which were carefully avoided during Trump's first term – would deal a potentially fatal blow to European car manufacturers (and especially Germans), who are already struggling with lower sales and concerns about the influx of Chinese cars in the EU.
