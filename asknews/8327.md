**International Project for Climate-Smart Livestock Development in La Araucanía**
A international project for climate-smart livestock development is being developed in the Cordillera region of La Araucanía, Chile. The initiative, led by Fontagro, the Ministry of Primary Industries of New Zealand, and INIA Carillanca, aims to improve the viability and resilience of food systems in indigenous Mapuche communities in Chile and Argentina through a comprehensive strategy of climate-smart agriculture (ACI). The project involves five communities in Argentina and one in Chile, where researchers from INIA Carillanca, INTA Argentina, and the New Zealand Centre for Agricultural Research on Greenhouse Gases have been working with local communities to develop innovative solutions to address the challenges of climate change. The project's goal is to promote sustainability and food security in Mapuche communities by incorporating climate-smart livestock practices, through active and participatory strategies. 'This project is a great opportunity to work with the Mapuche community in Icalma to develop innovative solutions that improve the quality of life of small-scale farmers,' said Héctor Cumilaf, Secretary of Agriculture. 'This is a technical cooperation that was born from the communities, prior to the development of other initiatives, which allows researchers from different entities and communities to interact and develop solutions to the problems presented in the productive area,' explained Dr. Paulina Etcheverría, director of the initiative in Chile and researcher at INIA Carillanca. The project aims to address the impacts of climate change on agriculture, including reduced food and water availability for livestock, decreased livestock condition, and increased mortality rates, as well as the risk of forest fires. 'Climate change is a global problem, all countries have similarities, issues to resolve and challenges, especially in terms of producing food without increasing greenhouse gas emissions,' said Dr. Lee Nelson. 'In New Zealand, the Maori communities have the same concerns as the Mapuche communities, so it is necessary to work together to generate a global benefit.'

**Egypt's Agricultural Projects Achieve Food Security and Provide Hard Currency**
Dr. Ashraf Kamal, professor of agricultural economics, stated that the Egyptian government has a clear strategic plan for sustainable agricultural development until 2030. This plan relies on two main pillars to achieve food security. The first pillar is the horizontal expansion through major national projects such as 'Future Egypt' and 'East Awantis', which have recently seen two important presidential events. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi inaugurated the wheat harvest season and discussed the project's progress with the planning and management team. The second pillar is the vertical expansion through increasing crop yields, which has seen a significant increase in wheat productivity from 8 to over 20 ardab per feddan, thanks to the efforts of the Agricultural Research Center. These agricultural projects are integrated with industrial projects such as potato factories and fruit centers, which have been recently opened, contributing to maximizing added value and providing hard currency through reducing import bills and increasing agricultural exports. Kamal emphasized that the grain silos project is a vital project that has received great attention from the government. The storage capacity for wheat has increased from 1.5 million tons in 2014 to 5 million tons currently, with a target of reaching 6 million tons, reducing the loss rate of 10-20% and ensuring the country's needs for grains more efficiently.

**Bashkiria Attracts 4.2 Billion Rubles in Federal Funding for Agricultural Development**
President Vladimir Putin has set a goal for Russian agriculture to become a leader in the global food market. To achieve this, a new national project 'Technological Support for Food Security' has been launched. The prospects for its implementation at the federal and regional levels were discussed at a meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture's collegium, where Bashkiria's Head Radik Haibullin spoke about the current state and plans for the development of the agricultural sector in the republic. Despite economic instability, the agricultural sector is developing, showing growth in several key indicators. The country has achieved its targets under the Food Security Doctrine, which has been implemented since 2020, in terms of grain, vegetable oil, sugar, meat, and fish supplies. This is due to the efforts of those working in the food and processing industries, as noted by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin at the meeting, who thanked the sector's workers for their professionalism. He pointed out that new jobs are being created in agriculture, previously abandoned arable land is being brought back into use, and the volume of deep processing of agricultural raw materials is increasing, as well as the scope of scientific research supported by the government. In addition, domestic consumption of agricultural products, particularly milk and meat, is growing, and the geography of exports to friendly countries is expanding. 'From this year, a new national project has started, which will involve work on the technological modernization of the agricultural sector using the latest developments. This will allow the sector as a whole to significantly increase its resilience and reduce risks for farmers,' According to the President, the agricultural sector faces a crucial task - to strengthen Russia's position as one of the leaders in the global food market. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop selection, genetics, and biotechnology, and to expand the production of modern agricultural machinery. The sector's future is impossible without highly qualified personnel, and it is necessary to continue the comprehensive development of rural areas, develop infrastructure, and improve the quality of life for rural residents.

**BNDES and Government Launch Project to Bring Healthy Food from Family Agriculture to Acre Schools**
The Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES) and the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MMA) announced the approval of the first project of the Amazônia na Escola: Comida Saudável e Sustentável initiative, which aims to bring healthy food from family agriculture to schools in the Acre state. The project, called Nosso Paneiro, will receive R$ 24 million from the Fundo Amazônia to strengthen family agriculture and ensure healthy school meals. The initiative will benefit indigenous populations, rural families, settled families, extractivists, and riverine communities in Acre, promoting their productive capacities and the purchase of their food by public schools in the region. 'This is another project that promotes productive inclusion, food security, and sustainable development in the forest,' said BNDES President Aloizio Mercadante. 'The government of President Lula has been promoting countless advances in these areas, and the BNDES has been a fundamental actor in these achievements,' he added. The project will be executed by the Associação SOS Amazônia, a Rio Branco-based entity with almost four decades of experience in environmental conservation and community strengthening projects. The Comissão Pró-Indígenas do Acre (CPI-Acre) will be responsible for the actions directly aimed at indigenous peoples. Minister Marina Silva celebrated the project's advancement and highlighted the restart of the Fundo Amazônia after years of inactivity. 'The Fundo Amazônia was inactive for four years and, since we took office, we have been working at full speed. We have a historic record of approval, execution, and, for the first time, a record of disbursement in a quarter,' she said. 'It's a huge joy to be able to make this delivery, and the first one here in Acre.' The expected results include the increase in productive capacity of the communities, the strengthening of their organizations, the expansion of the commercialization of healthy foods, and the direct impact on the quality of school meals. The proposal also aims to sensitize school networks about the procedures for purchasing these foods, promote food citizenship, strengthen the participation of women and young people, and qualify the execution of the Programa Nacional de Alimentação Escolar (Pnae).

**Paraná Launches Unmanned Agricultural Aircraft Project**
The State of Paraná has launched the New Arrangement of Research and Innovation (NAPI) Aeronaves de Pequeno Porte, with the goal of advancing aeronautical technology in the state. The initial focus of the research is on the development of an unmanned agricultural aircraft for crop spraying. The project aims to initially remotely pilot the AgroVANT (a fixed-wing aircraft weighing over a ton), with the long-term goal of achieving autonomous flight. The research will be funded by the State Government through the Fundação Araucária, with an investment of R$ 2.7 million. According to Douglas Renaux, a researcher at the Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná (UTFPR), the development of a digital control system for an unmanned aircraft, capable of autonomous flight, is a complex task and a pioneering initiative. 'We don't know of any aircraft of this size, for civil use, currently in operation in the world. Initially, it will be remotely piloted, with a person on the ground responsible for the pilotage. Over time, we want to increase the level of autonomy of the aircraft until we can have a 100% autonomous aircraft,' he explains. The project aims to increase efficiency, safety, and effectiveness in agricultural aviation, which is a high-risk activity. 'We expect a huge increase in efficiency, efficiency, and safety because today agricultural aviation is a cause of many accidents. By removing the pilot from the aircraft, we will be able to achieve significant gains,' emphasizes Douglas Renaux.

**Ceará Government Discusses Project to Increase Water Efficiency in Agricultural Sector**
The Government of Ceará, through the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State (SDE), is leading a project to improve the efficiency of water use in the agricultural sector in five hydrographic basins in Ceará. The pilot project, developed by the World Bank, involves the participation of other institutions, along with the SDE, in a visit from representatives of the University of California to discuss their methodology. The project aims to improve the water security of Ceará in the basins of Alto, Médio and Baixo Jaguaribe, Banabuiú and Salgado. 'The proposal is to improve the efficiency of water use in the agricultural sector, especially in irrigated agriculture,' said the executive secretary of Agronegócio, Silvio Carlos Ribeiro. The pilot project involved a joint work with the Fundação Cearense de Meteorologia e Recursos Hídricos do Estado (Fuceme) to strengthen the network of agrometeorological stations that provide information on the need for water that irrigated agriculture needs. Additionally, a system of advisory services to irrigators was developed with the Instituto de Pesquisa e Estratégia Econômica do Estado (Ipece). 'The University of California also helped us in this aspect with support in the development of technologies to measure the need for water in agriculture,' said Silvio Carlos. Eight stations called Surface Renewal were installed, a type of innovative methodology developed and implemented in the entire state of California by the University of California, Davis, which measures the real need for water of the main cultures that need more irrigation, in the case of the basins studied in Ceará, banana, melon, lemon and others. 'These cultures are studied all over the world, and the state of Ceará needed this refinement for local conditions. This project involves a strong work of research and has the accompaniment of the Program Cientista-chefe da Agricultura da SDE. Professor Daniele Zaccaria, from the University of California, came to Ceará to accompany these stations and also meet with representatives of Funceme, UFC and other institutions,' said Silvio Carlos. For the Secretary of SDE, Domingos Filho, 'the project is a milestone for the economic and sustainable development of Ceará. It is a great investment in innovation that will allow us to demonstrate the state as a potential supporter for generating efficient methodologies in favor of the agronegocio sector, benefiting various regions in the interior of Ceará,' concluded the head of the department.
