**Orban: Strong Conviction Among Europeans that Ukraine's EU Accession will be a Catastrophe**
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban stated that the European public opinion is increasingly convinced that Ukraine's accession to the European Union will create significant challenges that are difficult to handle. Orban explained that Europeans believe that accepting Ukraine into the EU will be a significant burden on the European community, saying, 'The important question is to what extent this opinion will affect the policies of European leaders.' Orban spoke during a local radio broadcast, saying, 'I held a conference in Hungary over the past two days, and I spoke with many participants from countries such as France, Italy, and Poland. I noticed that there is a strong conviction among European citizens that Ukraine's accession will be a difficult challenge for Europe as a whole.' He added that the main issue is 'the position of European democracy and the extent to which public opinions affect the positions of political leaders.' Orban also warned of the severe economic consequences of Ukraine's accession, saying, 'This decision will be a financial catastrophe and an economic suicide. It is true that there are some aspects that may benefit European companies in the short term, but in the long term, the consequences will be devastating for the European economy, starting from Hungary and passing through neighboring countries such as Poland and Romania.' He pointed out that his government conducted a survey on Ukraine's accession, in which 1.6 million Hungarian citizens have participated so far. Orban previously stated that the EU is seeking to absorb Ukraine before 2030, but the final decision will be made by Hungary. He warned that this accession will destroy the Hungarian economy. Orban also accused the EU of not wanting to help Ukraine, but rather 'colonize' it, pointing out that forcing Kyiv to continue the conflict is one of the methods of this colonization. He confirmed that Budapest supports the EU, but opposes Ukraine's rapid integration, and that without Hungary's consent, Kyiv will never be able to join the EU.

**Business Associations Urge Government to Postpone CBAM Implementation**
Business associations in Ukraine have called on the government to appeal to the EU to postpone the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). According to GMK Center, if the government delays, the significant impact of CBAM on Ukrainian exports could begin as early as November 2025. The Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (UUSIE) emphasized that the implementation of CBAM without considering the war situation is 'a direct blow to the competitiveness of Ukrainian exports.' The Federation of Employers of Ukraine (FEU) predicts that the introduction of the carbon tax from 2026 will reduce Ukrainian exports of goods subject to CBAM by $1.8 billion. Other business associations, including 'UkrCement', the National Association of Extractive Industry of Ukraine, Energy Club, and the European Business Association, have also joined the call, demanding that the government activate negotiations with the European Commission and initiate a postponement of CBAM's implementation for Ukraine during the war and recovery period. Members of parliament have also joined the call, with the parliamentary committee on economic development officially addressing the government on May 28 to urge them to take necessary actions to obtain a postponement. According to MP Musa Magomedov, the process should involve the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada, and business. An official request to the European Commission has not yet been submitted, although it is a prerequisite for activating Article 30.7 of the CBAM regulation, which allows for exclusion for countries in force majeure conditions. Experts stress that due to lengthy bureaucratic procedures, it is crucial to send the request as soon as possible, in order to avoid disruptions in trade with the EU. According to GMK Center, 14.5% of Ukraine's exports to the EU in 2024 will be subject to CBAM, including products from the metal industry, energy sector, cement industry, and chemical industry. Total export losses in 2026-2030 could reach $4.7 billion, and investments - an additional $2.7 billion.

**Data with destiny: European AI M&A heats up as the race for dominance intensifies**
Europe's AI industry is gaining traction, with the continent-wide market projected to reach $235.5 billion by 2031. The UK is the region's AI powerhouse, with over 3,700 AI companies contributing £5.8 billion to its economy. France and Germany are emerging as key contenders, with governments investing heavily in AI development. The European Commission's InvestAI initiative is funneling $207 billion into AI development, while the UK's AI Opportunities Action Plan has secured at least $14.3 billion in commitments from tech companies. Dealmaking is surging, with European M&A value soaring to $1.1 billion in 2024, driven by companies acquiring cutting-edge technology to stay relevant and the scarcity of AI talent. However, the road ahead is not without speed bumps, including the EU AI Act's strict rules on high-risk systems and general-purpose AI models, ESG concerns, and a lack of clarity in the act's definitions and requirements.

**European Cities Call for Ambitious Climate Goal by 2040**
The European Union (EU) must set a climate goal for 2040, aligned with the EU's Climate Law objective of net-zero emissions by 2050, according to a statement by the European Commission and the Cities/Commission European. The EU must remain firm on its emission reduction targets, as backtracking now would undermine credibility and momentum when it is needed most. Inclusive climate action Policies are only effective if they are just and inclusive. Cities see this up close every day, from families struggling to afford energy-efficient homes to workers needing support to transition to green jobs. Cities are already taking action, such as renovating buildings, providing energy advice to low-income families, and improving residents' skills. However, structural support is needed. At the same time, governance must reflect the central role of cities in the transition. Cities are not just implementers, but co-creators of Europe's climate future. Yet, they are often excluded from national planning processes. The current governance model is inadequate. Based on the success of the Mission for 100 climate-neutral cities by 2030 and other EU initiatives, the Commission should deepen direct collaboration with cities. A permanent and multi-level dialogue on climate is needed to ensure that local priorities are reflected in national and EU decision-making processes. Only with cities fully at the table can Europe conceive effective and just climate action. No more delays Each year without a 2040 goal means lost investment, credibility, and time. European cities are not standing still. However, to go further and faster, clear guidance from EU leaders is needed. Establishing a legally binding climate goal for 2040 of at least 90% net reduction in emissions is not just a matter of climate science. It's about securing our autonomy, protecting our people, and ensuring that cities can continue to lead the way. It's essential to give Europe and its cities a reason to believe and the tools to make it happen, conclude European mayors gathered with the Vice-President of the Commission. This is not about isolated efforts. It's part of a broader urban movement driving Europe's green transition. The Eurocities Pulse Mayors survey shows that 67% of mayors across the political spectrum consider climate action their top priority.

**EU Companies Call for 90% Carbon Emissions Reduction by 2040**
Over 150 companies, including EDF, Ikea, Unilever, and Leroy Merlin, have signed a public letter calling on the EU to commit to reducing its carbon emissions by 90% by 2040 compared to 1990. The EU Commission has set this goal, but it has not yet been adopted by the 27 member states. The signatories of the letter, led by an institute from the University of Cambridge, argue that a 90% reduction is a 'minimum ambition' and not a ceiling. They believe that a robust and ambitious climate policy will decarbonize economies, stimulate innovation, and create new business opportunities. The EU's climate roadmap, which must be submitted to the UN before COP30 in November, depends on the adoption of this goal. 'A strong objective, supported by a set of intelligent, ambitious, and coherent public policies, will decarbonize our economies and stimulate innovation and market opportunities for companies in all sectors,' the signatories write. They also argue that this goal will improve the EU's resilience to shocks, energy security, and competitiveness. 'Ultimately, climate risk is an economic and financial risk,' the companies say, supporting the commitments made at COP28 in Dubai in 2023 to exit fossil fuels, triple the deployment of renewable energies, and double energy efficiency. 'A strong objective (...) will be essential to create a predictable regulatory framework and send the right signals to investors to rapidly and at scale decarbonize our operations and supply chains,' says Rebecca Marmot, Director of Sustainable Development and Public Affairs at Unilever. 'We need visibility and a clear signal,' adds Gwenaelle Avice Huet, General Manager Europe at Schneider Electric, citing the need for a clear framework to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which requires an electrification rate of at least 60% by then, currently stalled at 23% in Europe.

**EU Launches €150 Billion Plan for Joint Military Purchases**
The European Union (EU) has launched a plan to mobilize up to €150 billion in loans to member states for joint purchases of military equipment. The instrument, called SAFE, will be funded by a joint debt issuance backed by the EU and will transfer the €150 billion in credits to member states that request them for joint purchases of defense material. The disbursements will be made based on national plans. The EU Council stated that 'to ensure economies of scale and interoperability and reduce the possible fragmentation of the European defense industrial and technological base, beneficiary member states must, in principle, make joint acquisitions with the participation of at least two participating countries to be eligible for loans.' Additionally, Ukraine and countries in the European Economic Area will be treated equally to EU member states in terms of this loan tool. 'Not only will they be able to join joint acquisitions, but it will also be possible to buy from their industries,' the EU institution specified. SAFE will also allow candidate countries to join the EU, potential candidates, and countries with which the EU has security and defense agreements (currently Norway, the United Kingdom, Moldova, Japan, South Korea, North Macedonia, and Albania) to join joint acquisitions. 'Furthermore, SAFE offers the possibility of concluding a bilateral or multilateral additional agreement with these third countries, whereby the eligibility conditions could be extended,' the Council stated. The EU has maintained the 'preference for Europe' clause, which requires that at least 65% of the components of each final product that form part of each purchase come from EU countries, Ukraine, or EEA member states. As a result, components and products manufactured in third countries, including the United States, will be eligible in joint purchases made with the resources of this instrument, but will not be able to exceed 35% of the estimated cost of each product. However, the percentage of components from candidate countries to join the EU, potential candidates, or countries with which the EU has closed security and defense agreements can pass from 35% to 65% if these countries close a specific bilateral agreement that associates them with SAFE, according to EU Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier.

**EU to Propose Flexible Climate Objective for 2040**
The European Commission plans to propose a new climate objective for the EU in July that includes flexibility for countries to meet it, according to EU diplomats. The objective is to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 levels, but the Commission plans to add flexibility to the target, which could reduce the requirements for each member state's sectors. This flexibility includes setting a lower emissions reduction target for national industries and allowing countries to buy international carbon credits to compensate for the rest, until reaching the 90% target. EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra confirmed during a meeting with EU country representatives on Wednesday that he plans to present the new climate objective on July 2, according to EU diplomats. The Commission has promised not to weaken the ambitious climate goals of Europe, despite growing criticism from states and parliamentarians concerned about the cost for European companies, which already have to deal with high energy prices and impending US tariffs. As the continent that is warming the fastest in the world, the Commission has delayed its proposal for climate goals for 2040 and has softened the severity of other environmental laws in recent months to try to calm the political backlash. EU countries are divided over the 2040 target, which they must approve themselves and the European Parliament. Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark support a 90% emissions reduction, while Italy and the Czech Republic oppose it. Germany has supported the 90% target if countries can use international carbon credits to reach three percentage points of the target. The Commission is also considering softening the requirements for countries to reduce emissions in specific sectors and giving them more options on which sectors to focus on to meet the target, according to diplomats.

**EU on Track to Meet 2030 Climate Goals, but Challenges Remain**
According to recent World Meteorological Organization (WMO) data, the European region has experienced the fastest temperature increase over the past three decades compared to any other region in the world. This rapid warming has had tangible effects on the environment and economy, with extreme weather events such as devastating floods and increasingly intense forest fires becoming more frequent, with severe consequences for agriculture, biodiversity, and local community safety. Despite these alarming signals, the latest data from the European Commission suggests that many EU countries have accelerated their efforts to decarbonize over the past two years. Official estimates indicate that greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 37% compared to 1990 levels, and a significant decrease of 8% was recorded in 2023. Additionally, a number of countries are already on track to meet the 2030 target of generating at least 42.5% of their energy from renewable sources. However, the path to a shared green transition is not without obstacles. International tensions, energy price hikes, and commercial uncertainties, including the prospect of new US protectionist measures, have led to calls from several European governments to revise or relax current environmental regulations. In this unstable scenario, the Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to reducing emissions by 90% by 2040, as recommended by the scientific community. To ensure that the path to these targets remains realistic and sustainable, Brussels is considering introducing greater flexibility in the implementation of climate policies, including mechanisms such as carbon credits. Vice-President Teresa Ribera emphasized that any flexibility must remain compatible with the Union's overall objectives. However, not all member states are proceeding at the same pace, with some countries, including Belgium, Estonia, and Poland, still lagging behind in defining their national plans, highlighting a persistent lack of homogeneity that could impact the cohesion of the entire European climate strategy.

**EU Commission Optimistic About Achieving 2030 Climate Goal**
The European Commission is optimistic that the EU's climate goal for 2030 can be achieved. According to the Commission, if all member states make a bit more effort than planned, the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than half can be reached. The Commission's climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, said, 'If we maintain this course, I am confident that we can achieve it.' The EU has already reduced emissions by 37% since 1990, while the economy has grown by almost 70%. 'Now we need to build on this momentum. Investments in clean technologies and innovation are crucial for the competitiveness of the industry and open up new markets for EU companies.' However, it is unclear whether the goals will be achieved as planned. The Commission will strengthen cooperation with member states and support them in implementing the measures. The Commission also emphasizes the importance of the 'Green Deal' laws, which have been implemented in recent years and months. Linda Kalcher from the think tank Strategic Perspectives notes that the EU states are driving climate policy forward, despite the public debate in some countries suggesting the opposite. 'It's time to move beyond the rhetoric and recognize that such political measures can strengthen the leadership role in clean technologies, direct investments, and ensure job security.' The EU aims to be climate-neutral by 2050, but a intermediate goal for 2040 is still missing.

**UK Returns to EU Orbit**
The United Kingdom has announced a major overhaul of its bilateral relations with the European Union. An agreement has been reached on disarmament and fishing. Over the next 12 years, EU and UK ships will be able to enter each other's territorial waters. In exchange, London has obtained a significant simplification of border procedures and a reduction in bureaucracy, which is particularly important for small food producers who have struggled to export to the EU after Brexit. The British government claims that the agreement with its largest trading partner will bring up to £9 billion (12.1 billion dollars) to the country's economy by 2040. Improved food supply conditions, increased energy security, and lower prices are also expected. The parties have agreed on the principles of a limited freedom of movement program for young people, which will simplify travel and employment for citizens under 30. The details of the agreement will be finalized later. The UK's participation in the Erasmus+ exchange student program is also being discussed. This is the third international agreement concluded by London in May, following agreements with India and the United States. Despite a limited short-term economic impact, authorities hope that this will boost business confidence and attract investments. 'It's a great day,' said Patrice Bravo, 'Europe is becoming more federalized with its own codes.' 'I'm glad to see the progress our students are making,' said Alexandre Lemoine, 'it's a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students.'

**UK strikes EU trade and defence reset in 'new era' for relations | Taiwan News | May. 20, 2025 08:58**
The UK has agreed to a significant reset of its defence and trade ties with the European Union, marking a 'new era' in their relationship. The deal includes a security and defence pact, fewer restrictions on British food exporters and visitors, and a new fishing agreement. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would 'correct some of the problems created by the Conservatives' original deal agreed after Brexit' and would benefit the UK economy. The agreement was denounced by the opposition Conservative Party and some fishing groups, but Labour member of parliament Chris Curtis said it would improve relations and correct some of the problems created by the original deal. The deal is expected to add nearly 9 billion pounds to the UK economy by 2040 and improve energy security. However, the UK's economy will remain significantly different from before it left the EU.

**UK, EU agree to ease customs checks on food and plants**
The UK and EU have agreed to ease customs checks on food and plant products, allowing goods to flow freely again. The new economic agreement is expected to add nearly £9 billion ($12 billion) to the British economy by 2040. The pact also links the two sides' emissions quotas, sparing British companies from the EU carbon tax. The removal of customs and administrative controls was a key priority for the UK in its negotiations with Brussels. The agreement will make it easier for food and drink to be imported and exported, reducing burdens on businesses and lengthy lorry queues at the border. 'Some routine checks on animal and plant products will be removed completely,' according to the joint agreement. The European Union is the UK's largest trading partner, and the agreement aims to boost British exports, which have fallen by 21 percent since the UK left the EU in 2020. An independent dispute resolution mechanism will be established in the event of a disagreement over health and food safety standards, but the Court of Justice of the European Union remains the ultimate authority.

**UK Reaches Agreement with EU on Trade, Defense, and Security**
After nearly nine years of voting to leave the union, Britain, with its significant defense capabilities, will participate in joint procurement projects. The two parties have also agreed to facilitate the entry of British food and tourists into the European Union and signed a new fishing agreement. The tariffs imposed by Trump, along with warnings that Europe needs to make more effort to protect itself, have forced governments around the world to rethink their trade, defense, and security relationships, bringing the UK and European leaders closer together. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who voted to remain in the EU in the Brexit referendum, is betting that presenting tangible benefits to the British people, such as faster electronic gates at EU airports, will outweigh the cries of 'betrayal' from Nigel Farage, a member of the Brexit campaign. The government says the agreement with its largest trading partners will reduce bureaucracy for food producers and farmers, making food cheaper, improving energy security, and adding around £9 billion to the economy by 2040. This is the third deal the UK has made this month, following agreements with India and the US, and while it is unlikely to lead to a significant economic boost immediately, it may increase business confidence and attract the investments that are desperately needed. Sunak said in a statement, 'It's time to look forward... to move on from old, stale discussions and political battles to find practical, logical solutions that benefit the British people.'

**UK and EU Reach New Agreement on Defense and Trade Relations**
The UK has reached a new agreement with the EU to regulate defense and trade relations since the UK's exit from the EU. The agreement includes the UK's participation in joint procurement projects, easier access for British food and tourists to the EU, and a new fishing agreement. The UK's Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has called for more consistency and fewer errors from the UK's defense team. The agreement is expected to boost the UK's economy by around 9 billion pounds by 2040. This is the third agreement reached by the UK this month, following agreements with India and the US. The agreement is seen as a positive step towards improving relations between the UK and the EU, which have been strained since the UK's exit from the EU in 2020. The UK's participation in joint defense projects is expected to lead to more regular security talks and the possibility of the UK joining EU military missions. However, many details are still to be finalized, including the UK's access to EU defense programs and the level of cooperation. The EU has also lowered its growth forecast for the eurozone in 2025 due to global trade tensions caused by the US's 25% tariffs on EU imports. The EU's growth forecast for 2026 has also been revised downward to 1.4% from 1.6% previously. The EU has warned that the ongoing trade tensions and the increasing frequency of climate-related disasters will continue to affect economic growth.

**UK economy to be boosted by GBP9 billion by 2040 amid new deal with EU**
The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has reached a deal with the EU that is expected to boost the economy by GBP9 billion by 2040. The deal includes the extension of fishing rights for European vessels for 12 years, closer ties to EU rules, and the introduction of e-gates at airports in Europe for tourists. However, the prime minister faced criticism from Brexit supporters and opposition parties, who accused him of betraying Brexit and surrendering access to British waters. Starmer said, 'It's time to look forward. To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people.' The deal includes several key points, including an open-ended sanitary and phytosanitary agreement to slash red tape on food and drink exports and imports, and a security and defence partnership that will pave the way for UK arms firms to bid for work under the EU's proposed new GBP150 billion security action for Europe fund.

**UK and EU Agree to Significant Redefinition of Trade and Defense Ties**
The United Kingdom has agreed to a significant redefinition of its trade and defense ties with the European Union, following a global shift made by US President Donald Trump. This move has forced both sides to put aside their bitter divorce and come to a new agreement. The UK, a major defense player, will now participate in joint procurement projects. The two parties have also agreed to facilitate access to food and visitors from the UK to the EU and signed a new and contentious fishing agreement. The tariffs imposed by Trump, along with warnings that Europe should do more to protect itself, have forced governments around the world to rethink their trade, defense, and security ties, bringing UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer closer to Emmanuel Macron, the French President, and other European leaders. Starmer, who supported remaining in the EU during the Brexit referendum, believes that the offer of tangible benefits to the British, such as the use of faster electronic gates at EU airports, will silence the 'betrayal' cries of Brexit activist Nigel Farage. The government says that the redefinition with its largest trading partner will reduce bureaucracy for farmers and food producers, making them cheaper; improve energy security and add almost £9 billion to the economy by 2040. This is the third agreement the UK has made this month, after deals with India and the US, and while it is unlikely to lead to a significant economic boost immediately, it could raise corporate sentiment and attract much-needed investments. 'It's time to look forward,' Starmer said in a statement. 'Leave behind the old debates and political fights to find practical and sensible solutions that bring the best for the British people.' 'We're ready to work with partners if that means we can improve people's lives here at home,' he added.

**EU and UK Agree on New Deals, Marking a New Era in Their Relationship**
The European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have agreed on new deals on defense, fishing, and trade, marking a new chapter in their relationship. The agreements include allowing EU fishermen to fish in British waters for 12 years, in exchange for easier export of British food to the EU. According to Downing Street, this means 'goods can flow freely again', which is estimated to add £9 billion to the British economy by 2040, equivalent to 124 billion kroner. The UK and EU have also agreed on a defense and security agreement, which includes the UK's defense industry being included in the EU's new defense fund of 150 billion euros. This means that EU countries can borrow to buy weapons produced in the UK, not just in the EU. The defense agreement also includes regular security meetings and the possibility of the UK participating in EU military operations. Young people who want to study in the UK will also benefit, as it will be easier for young EU citizens to come to the UK, and vice versa. However, a final agreement on quotas and study fees does not seem to be in place yet. Additionally, there are plans to allow British citizens to use the EU queue at airports. According to Keir Starmer, the UK's Prime Minister, 'it's time to look forward, to move from the old, rigid debates and political battles to find the healthy common sense and practical solutions that make the best for the British people.' EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says it's now possible to 'write a new chapter' in the relationship, which was severely strained during the Brexit negotiations a few years ago.

**Zakharova comments on Georgia's EU prospects with 'there would be somewhere to join'**
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova commented on Georgia's potential to join the EU by 2030, saying 'there would be somewhere to join'. She also reminded the experience of the United Kingdom, which left the EU 'for quite understandable reasons'. Zakharova noted that 'it's not about the good things that the UK would not have left', but rather that 'where there is something to gain, the British will be the first'. She added that 'crisis phenomena within the EU are so obvious, and its potential is so predictable, that there is nothing to do for those who think about their national economies'. Zakharova emphasized that 'it's a sovereign matter for everyone', and that Georgia should 'look at specific numbers, not just slogans'. She also mentioned that Russia and Georgia have been discussing this issue, despite their political differences and lack of diplomatic relations, and that they are building bilateral ties in a mutually respectful and beneficial way. 'We are having a dialogue on this matter', Zakharova said.
