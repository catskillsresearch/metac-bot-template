**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**UK Announces New War Preparation Plan with £15 Billion Investment in Nuclear Warhead Program**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the country's new war preparation plan, stating, 'We are moving to a war footing, our armed forces' primary objective is to prepare for war. When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military capabilities, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and clearly show that we are ready to secure peace through force.' The UK plans to invest 15 billion pounds in its nuclear warhead program and produce 12 new nuclear-powered submarines as part of the AUKUS alliance with the US and Australia. Starmer also stated that the UK will learn from Ukraine's experience and aim to have a 10 times more effective army by 2035.

**UK Defense Reform and Nuclear Potential: Britain Enters 'War Readiness Mode'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive defense reform for the UK's armed forces, which includes expanding the country's nuclear capabilities. According to Starmer, 'the world has changed', and the growing threats from Russia cannot be ignored. The best way to prevent conflict is to prepare for it. The principles of the reform, as stated by the Prime Minister, are readiness for combat, integrated armed forces, and an approach aligned with NATO. The British government has agreed to build at least six new ammunition factories, create a hybrid royal fleet, build 12 attack submarines as part of the AUKUS defense pact with the US and Australia, invest £15 billion in nuclear weapons, and improve living conditions for military personnel. However, Starmer did not specify when the UK will start spending 3% of its GDP on defense, only mentioning the planned increase to 2.5% by 2027. The rise to 3%, according to Starmer, may be possible by 2034. UK Defense Minister John Healey noted that the new nuclear investments will be 'a signal to Moscow', and the country plans to purchase 7,000 long-range missiles and invest in cybersecurity.

**UK to Build New Attack Submarines and Boost Nuclear Arsenal Amid Russian Threat**
The UK's Labour leader has outlined a plan to make the country a 'war-ready' nation, equipped for 'decades to come', in the face of the Russian threat. 'The threat we face today is more grave, more immediate, and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,' he said. He added, 'We are facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyberattacks, and an increasing Russian aggression in our waters, which also threatens our airspace.' Key measures include the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons, as part of the Aukus military alliance with the US and Australia. These new submarines will replace the current UK fleet by the end of the 2030s, which currently consists of seven such vessels.

**UK to Enhance Defense Capabilities, Increase Spending to 3% of GDP by 2034**
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced today, Monday, that the government will adopt significant changes to enhance the country's defense capabilities, making the United Kingdom more secure and powerful. According to Sunak, the UK must transition to a state of military readiness, where the British Armed Forces are always prepared to engage in war to deter any aggression. He pledged to end the reduction of the armed forces and build a more integrated and capable fighting force than ever before. Sunak stated that everything the UK does will enhance NATO's power, highlighting the importance of this alliance, which means that the UK will never engage in a war alone. He emphasized that this alliance is a fundamental source of Britain's strategic power. Sunak noted that the British government will work to accelerate innovation in the military field, to face current and future threats, and to make the army ten times more effective by 2035. He also mentioned plans to build at least six new ammunition factories to provide thousands of jobs, and to manufacture new long-range weapons to support European deterrence, in addition to investing in air and missile defense for the UK. Furthermore, Sunak announced plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines to protect the UK's territorial waters, and to invest £15 billion in updating the UK's nuclear warhead program. Sunak expects the UK to achieve its goal of spending 3% of its GDP on defense by 2034, expressing his hope that the country's readiness to fight will be a strong deterrent against any aggression. Sunak emphasized that the time has come to change the way the UK defends itself, to become more secure, pointing out that every citizen in this country has a role to play, especially as things have changed, and the threats facing the UK have become more serious and unpredictable. Sunak stressed that the war in Ukraine, new nuclear threats, and daily cyber attacks require a new era of defense and security.

**Britain to get defence boost to send message to Moscow  --  and possibly Trump**
The United Kingdom will increase its military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and aims to reach 3% by 2034, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The move is designed to send a message to Moscow and Washington, with the UK building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and creating an army ready to fight a war in Europe. Defence Secretary John Healey said the changes would 'transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment' and that the 3% goal is 'on track' to be met. However, it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money, and some leaders in NATO think 3% is not enough to deter Russia from future attacks. The UK will also invest £15 billion in its nuclear arsenal and increase its conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons. Mr. Starmer said re-arming would create a 'defence dividend' of well-paid jobs, and the move is also a message to President Donald Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defence.

**UK to build up to 12 new attack submarines**
The UK will build 'up to' 12 new attack submarines to replace the Astute class from the late 2030s onwards, according to the prime minister's announcement. The new submarines will be conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered, and will keep 'Britain and Nato safe for decades', as stated by Sir Keir. The government will also spend £15bn on its nuclear warhead program and commit to increasing UK defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027. The review will make 62 recommendations, which the government is expected to accept in full. The Labour party has committed to increasing defence spending to 3% of national income by 2034, but the Conservatives say this should be met by the end of the decade. The review will also include other announcements, such as £1.5bn to build six new factories for 'always on' munitions production capacity, building up to 7,000 long-range weapons, and setting up a 'cyber and electromagnetic command' to boost the military's defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace.

**UK to Introduce New Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines by Late 2030s**
The UK government plans to introduce 12 new attack submarines powered by nuclear energy and equipped with conventional weapons by the late 2030s. The UK Ministry of Defence announced that it will replace the current 7 submarines with the new ones. The ministry also stated that the cost of the existing nuclear warhead development program, which was previously initiated, will be £15 billion. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said, 'We know threats are rising and we must act decisively against Russian aggression. Our cutting-edge new submarines patrolling the world's oceans and our own nuclear warhead program at home are making our country both safe at home and strong abroad.' The new submarines are reportedly being developed as a joint model with the US and Australia under the AUKUS security partnership.

**British fighter jets to carry nuclear weapons in face of threat of Russia**
The UK government is in talks with US officials to introduce jets armed with nuclear weapons for the first time, as part of the latest defensive expansion against Russia. This move would be the UK's biggest deterrent development since the Cold War. The Defence Secretary, Radakin, views this as the UK's number one defence priority, citing rising nuclear risks across the globe. He said, 'The world is definitely becoming more dangerous. Nuclear risks are rising. For the first time since the Cold War, we face seriously increasing risks of state-on-state conflict.' The government also plans to increase defence spending to three per cent GDP by 2034 and move to wartime levels of arms production by building six new munitions factories. Labour leader, Sir Keir, has also called for a transformation in how the UK defends itself, saying, 'We will meet this moment head on -- by mounting the kind of response not seen before in most of our lifetimes.'

**Top Nuclear-Armed Nations In 2025: Where Does India Stand? - News18**
According to a study by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), as of early 2025, the world's nine nuclear-armed nations collectively possess approximately 12,331 nuclear warheads. The top five countries with the largest nuclear arsenals are Russia (5,449 warheads), the United States (5,277 warheads), China (600 warheads, expected to exceed 1,000 by 2030), France (290 warheads), and the United Kingdom (225 warheads). India has approximately 180 nuclear warheads and adheres to a no-first-use policy, while Pakistan has around 170 nuclear warheads and maintains its arsenal largely due to its historical rivalry with India. Israel is believed to possess around 90 nuclear warheads, and North Korea has approximately 50 nuclear warheads, although the exact number remains uncertain due to the secretive nature of its nuclear programme.

**New wave of smaller, cheaper nuclear reactors sends US states racing to attract the industry - Washington Examiner**
The US is witnessing a new wave of smaller, cheaper nuclear reactors, which could be operational as early as 2030. States are racing to attract the industry, with 25 states passing legislation to support advanced nuclear energy last year and over 200 bills introduced this year. Tech giants Amazon and Google are investing in nuclear reactors to meet their power needs. However, the devices face an uncertain future due to lingering public skepticism about safety, growing competition from renewables, and supply chain challenges. The US Department of Energy estimates the country will need an additional 200 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. More than 30 advanced nuclear projects are under consideration or planned to be in operation by the early 2030s, but those would supply just a fraction of the 200 gigawatt goal. According to Marc Nichol of the Nuclear Energy Institute, 'We’ve seen states taking action at ever-increasing levels for the past few years now.'

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**
According to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.

**Third World War with Nuclear Weapons May Occur by 2035, Study Warns**
According to a study by the Atlantic Council, 40.5% of 357 global strategists and experts predict that a global war involving major countries such as the US, China, or Russia will occur by 2035. The study also suggests that nuclear weapons may be used in the conflict, and space battles may take place. The creation of the US Space Force in 2019 by President Donald Trump is cited as an example that contributed to these predictions. Additionally, 30% of experts believe that climate change will be the second biggest threat to the world by 2035, while 1.7% think a new pandemic will be the main crisis. Meanwhile, 5.1% of respondents believe that the growing financial debt will harm the world by 2035. Sergey Vershinin, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, has previously stated that there is a high risk of a nuclear war between major powers, and the situation is deteriorating rapidly with an increase in conflict and tension worldwide. As Sergey Vershinin said, 'The situation is becoming worse at an alarming rate, and conflict and tension are rising worldwide.'

**'Worse than today': World in 2035 will be dark and scary, over 350 experts say**
Over 300 experts, including political strategists and foresight practitioners, participated in a survey conducted by the Atlantic Council, predicting a dark future for humanity by 2035. Four in 10 of them believe that a major war, involving nuclear weapons and space, will be caused by countries like the United States, China, or Russia. The survey found that 62% of respondents think the world will be 'worse off than it is today' in 10 years, while only 38% believe things will improve. Climate change was cited as the second biggest threat, with three in 10 experts predicting it will cause significant suffering. A financial crisis and a new pandemic were also predicted, but to a lesser extent. However, a majority (51%) of experts believe there will be more global cooperation to stop climate change by 2035.

**North Korea to have more nuclear weapons than UK by 2035**
North Korea's nuclear arsenal is expected to surge from around 50 warheads to 300 by 2035, thanks to technical assistance from Russia. Analysts warn that this could make North Korea's nuclear capabilities more threatening than the UK's. According to Ankit Panda, an expert on North Korea's nuclear development, Russia's assistance could help North Korea improve its guidance systems, cruise missile control, and countermeasures. Panda believes that Kim Jong-un will continue to modernize and expand his nuclear forces to achieve 'mutual vulnerability', making it difficult for the US and South Korea to eliminate all his nuclear weapons. This would require an increase in the number of warheads, potentially reaching 300 by 2035.

**North Korea could have more nuclear weapons than the UK by 2035**
Analysts have warned that North Korea could have more nuclear warheads than the UK by 2035, thanks to Russian assistance. Ankit Panda, an expert on North Korea's nuclear development, said that with Russian help, North Korea's arsenal of 50 nuclear warheads could rise to 300 in a decade. This would surpass the UK's estimated 225 nuclear warheads. Panda also stated that North Korea may already have the ability to detonate a warhead over an American city. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Director General, Rafael Grossi, accused North Korea of violating UN resolutions by continuing to develop nuclear weapons. Grossi also expressed concern over Iran's increased stockpile of 60% U-235, an isotope often used in nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, experts warned that Europe would need to dramatically increase its nuclear weapons stockpile should the US withdraw from NATO and cease to provide security guarantees to the continent.
