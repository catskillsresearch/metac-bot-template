**Grossi: Iran and US Must Continue Dialogue on Nuclear Issue**
The Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, believes that Iran and the US should continue negotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue, as a failure to do so could lead to a serious crisis. 'We need to make sure the dialogue continues. If the parties say they no longer want to talk to each other, the situation will be serious,' Grossi said in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della sera. He does not expect a complex agreement between Iran and the US, but rather something 'simple, like the Trump style, for example, no uranium enrichment in exchange for lifting all sanctions.' Grossi emphasized the importance of maintaining diplomatic efforts, warning that a military solution would be catastrophic and Iranian threats are not empty words. When asked about Iran's progress towards creating nuclear weapons, Grossi noted that 'there is a difference between possessing necessary materials and possessing nuclear weapons. If we talk about materials, they have made significant progress (...). But to create a nuclear weapon, other technologies are needed, and it's not excluded that the Iranians can develop them. They themselves have said that they have all the pieces of the puzzle.'

**Iran: 'We have the capability to build a nuclear weapon, but not the will'**
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that his country has the capability to build a nuclear weapon, but has not done so due to a lack of 'will'. Iran is willing to allow more inspections of its nuclear facilities, despite its refusal to negotiate its 'right to enrich uranium'. Araghchi emphasized that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and that it has no problem with more inspections and transparency. He also warned that if the US tries to prevent Iran from enriching uranium, there will be no agreement. The US and Iran are set to meet in Rome for the fifth round of nuclear talks, mediated by Oman. The US seeks to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, while Iran claims its program is for civilian purposes and aims to lift US sanctions that have crippled its economy.

**Iran-US Nuclear Talks Resume in Rome with Divergent Positions**
The Iran-US nuclear talks began in Rome on May 23, 2025, with divergent positions between the two countries. The Iranian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, does not include technical experts, as they seek to clarify the US position. The US has identified 'zero enrichment' as a 'red line', while Iran insists that there will be no agreement if this demand is maintained. Araqchi wrote on social media, 'Zero nuclear weapons = we have an agreement. Zero enrichment = NO agreement.' The US envoy, Steve Witkoff, had previously stated that uranium enrichment by Iran is a 'red line' for Washington. The Iranian leader, Ali Khamenei, has described the US position as absurd and predicted that the negotiations will not be successful. Despite the tensions, US President Donald Trump believes that the nuclear dialogue with Iran is 'on the right track', according to his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt. The two countries have been negotiating since April 12, and their previous meeting on May 11 was described as 'encouraging and useful.' The West, led by the US, and Israel have long suspected that Iran is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran denies the allegations and claims the right to nuclear energy for civilian purposes, such as energy production.

**Iran, US to hold new round of nuclear talks in Rome**
The United States and Iran are set to hold a new round of nuclear talks in Rome, marking the highest-level contact between the two nations since the US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear accord in 2018. Iran seeks a new deal that would ease sanctions, which have severely impacted its economy. US envoy Steve Witkoff stated that Washington 'could not authorise even one percent' enrichment, a position that Tehran considers a 'red line' under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi noted that 'fundamental differences' remain with the US, but expressed openness to increased inspections of its nuclear sites. The talks come ahead of a June meeting of the UN nuclear watchdog and the October expiry of the 2015 accord, which aimed to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60 percent, far above the deal's 3.67 percent cap, but below the 90 percent required for weapons-grade material. Experts in Tehran believe that Iran is unlikely to back down, citing the significant economic benefits of its nuclear industry, which employs 17,000 people.

**US Official: Washington Bets on Diplomacy, Fears Israeli Strike on Iran**
Former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Warrick, stated that there is a clear difference in approach between Washington and Tel Aviv in dealing with the Iranian nuclear file. He noted that former US President Donald Trump was strongly committed to diplomatic solutions, but at the same time emphasized that Iran has no right to enrich uranium, even for peaceful purposes. Warrick pointed out that having the capability to enrich uranium would allow Tehran to produce a nuclear weapon in the future, which would be a significant threat that the US and Israel cannot accept. Warrick explained that Israel is increasingly concerned, especially after Iran suffered significant losses in its air defenses, making its nuclear facilities more vulnerable to a potential attack. He added that Tel Aviv is pressuring Washington to take swift action, while Trump, during his presidency, gave diplomacy a full chance before considering military action. Warrick noted that there is a point of agreement between the two sides regarding the rejection of Iran's nuclear weapons, although some flexibility remains regarding the possession of a peaceful nuclear program under strict supervision.

**US-Iran Nuclear Negotiations: Progress, but No Agreement**
The fifth round of negotiations between the US and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program ended on Friday (23) in Rome, Italy, 'with some progress, but no conclusive results', said Oman's Foreign Minister, Badr al-Busaidi, who acted as a mediator. The main point of contention between the parties is the enrichment of uranium for civilian purposes. A US official confirmed the 'progress' but did not provide further details. Iranian Foreign Minister Sayyid Abbas Aragchi stated that the debate with Washington 'was very complex' and therefore 'more meetings are needed'. US delegation head Steve Witkoff said on Sunday (18) that 'we cannot authorize even one percent of uranium enrichment capacity in Iran'. However, Aragchi wrote on X that 'zero nuclear weapons = we have an agreement. Zero enrichment = we don't have an agreement.' Iran assures its peaceful intentions by recalling the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it is a signatory to. However, the US and Israel suspect that Tehran wants to acquire nuclear weapons. 'Holland, Belgium, South Korea, Brazil, and Japan are enriching uranium without possessing nuclear weapons,' said Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesperson for the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization (AEOI). Italian Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani stated on Friday that he spoke with his counterparts in Iran and Oman and reinforced that 'Italy is ready to host other peace negotiations, as Rome wants to be a center for initiatives leading to peace'.

**﻿Iran Tells US "Time To Decide" During 5th Round Of Nuclear Talks In Rome**
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that it is 'time to decide' on a nuclear deal, emphasizing that 'zero nuclear weapons = we DO have a deal. Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal.' The US administration has been pushing for no enrichment, but Tehran sees this as a non-starter, citing national sovereignty. Iranian officials have expressed doubts about the talks, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calling US demands 'excessive and outrageous.' The US has offered to lift economic sanctions in exchange for de-nuclearization, but Iran is open to enhanced monitoring by international inspectors, not relinquishing its right to pursue nuclear energy. The outcome of the talks in Rome will depend on whether the US softens its stance on zero enrichment.

**US and Iran to Resume Nuclear Talks Amid 'Red Lines' and Divided Stances**
Iranian and US negotiators will resume talks in Rome on Friday to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear ambitions, despite the Iranian leader warning that a new agreement may be unattainable due to 'red lines' being drawn. Both sides have much to gain: US President Donald Trump wants to reduce Tehran's potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could spark a regional nuclear arms race, while Iran seeks to lift the devastating sanctions crippling its oil-based economy. Iranian Foreign Minister Abás Araqchi and Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will hold a fifth round of talks mediated by Oman, despite both Washington and Tehran taking a hardline stance in public over Iran's uranium enrichment. According to US representatives, the talks, including the last round on May 11 in Oman, have been both 'direct and indirect'. Tehran and Washington have expressed a preference for diplomacy to resolve the deadlock, but remain deeply divided over several 'red lines' that negotiators must navigate to achieve a new nuclear agreement and avoid future military action. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday that Washington is working towards an agreement that would allow Iran to have a civilian nuclear energy program, but not enrich uranium, although he admitted that achieving this agreement 'will not be easy'. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Alí Jamenei, who has the final say on state matters, rejected Washington's demands that Tehran stop enriching uranium, calling them 'excessive and insulting', and warned that it is unlikely that the talks will yield results. One of the outstanding obstacles is Tehran's refusal to send its highly enriched uranium reserves abroad or to engage in talks about its ballistic missile program. Iran says it is willing to accept some limits on its uranium enrichment, but needs 'irrefutable guarantees' that Washington will not breach a future nuclear agreement.

**Iran's Foreign Minister Sends New Message to US: 'It's Time to Make a Decision'**
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has sent a new message to the United States, saying 'it's time to make a decision'. He emphasized that finding a way to reach an agreement is not difficult, but added that 'not having nuclear weapons means having an agreement, and not enriching uranium means no agreement'. Amir-Abdollahian also stated that Iran is open to 'more inspections' of its nuclear facilities, which could be a way out of the current impasse. The two sides have been negotiating since April 12, with four rounds of talks described as positive. However, the recent talks have been marred by disagreements over Iran's ability to enrich uranium within the country. The US has insisted that it will not allow enrichment until Iran agrees to a 1% cap, while Iran has said this is a 'red line' that cannot be crossed. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has hinted that Iran could import enriched uranium from abroad, which would allow for greater monitoring of its quantities and levels.

**Iran and the Nuclear Bomb: 2025, the Year of Diplomacy... or War?**
The West, led by the US, has long suspected Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons. An international agreement was reached on July 14, 2015, to limit Iran's nuclear program. However, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran currently possesses 275 kg of uranium enriched to 60%, exceeding the 2015 agreement's limit by more than 41 times. 'The Iranian nuclear program has never been as advanced,' warns Naysan Rafati, a specialist on Iranian nuclear issues at the International Crisis Group. Experts believe Iran may be just weeks away from having a nuclear bomb. This scenario is concerning, as Iran could use the bomb as a deterrent or to attack its enemies, including Israel. According to Frédéric Encel, a professor of geopolitics, it could also prompt neighboring countries, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey, to develop their own nuclear capabilities. To prevent this scenario, new negotiations are underway. Will it be an agreement or war? Our new video analysis explores the two possibilities.

**Iran Denies Halting Nuclear Program, US Seeks Solution Through Dialogue**
Iran's Foreign Ministry released a statement on Thursday, May 15, 2025, saying that halting the nuclear program is not on the table. The ministry added, 'The nuclear talks with the United States have been beneficial so far.' US President Donald Trump expressed his hope that he will not be forced to take a different path regarding Iran, saying, 'I believe in peace through strength, that's why we've allocated a trillion dollars to our defense budget.' Trump added, 'I think we're close to reaching an agreement with Iran.' He continued, 'We want Iran to be a great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon.' Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said that Iran must be prevented from acquiring a nuclear weapon. This comes as part of the international campaign led by the US to prevent Tehran from developing weapons of mass destruction. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that Tehran's positions are clear regarding the talks with Washington. He added, 'We hope to reach a critical stage in the current round of talks in Muscat.' Araghchi emphasized, 'Our nuclear program is based on strong legal foundations.' US Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff said earlier that Iran has agreed not to possess a nuclear bomb. Wietkoff emphasized, 'We will take that seriously, we must dismantle Iran's enrichment facilities and Tehran cannot possess centrifuges.' He added, 'We intend to pressure Iran to stop funding Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.' Wietkoff continued, 'The nuclear file is the issue that must be resolved today and quickly.' He added, 'Our talks with Iran are currently limited to the nuclear file.' Wietkoff emphasized, 'If our talks with Iran on Sunday are not fruitful, we will have to take a different path.' He added, 'We believe that seeking a solution through dialogue is better than any alternative.' Wietkoff emphasized, 'If we convince Iran to give up its enrichment program, we will ensure a permanent situation where they will not have a nuclear weapon.' He added, 'This is the best solution and we hope that it is what Iran wants because the alternative is not good for them.' Wietkoff also said that the talks with Iran on its nuclear program are positive.

**Israel's Defense Minister Vows to Prevent Iran from Acquiring Nuclear Weapon**
Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz said, 'Since I took office, I have committed to achieving two goals: preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and winning the war.' Katz added, 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and I, along with all parties, are committed to pushing towards preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.' The Israeli Prime Minister's office confirmed that Tel Aviv will not allow Tehran to possess a nuclear weapon, emphasizing that Israel's actions have 'delayed' Iran's program by a decade. According to Israeli and American reports, Israel was planning to launch a large-scale military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities in May 2025, with US support, before President Donald Trump decided to prioritize a diplomatic solution with Tehran. The US is currently engaged in indirect talks with Iran over its nuclear program, with the first round held in Muscat on April 12 and the second round scheduled for April 19 in Rome.

Hegseth added, 'if we cannot resolve the nuclear program at the negotiating table, then there are other options we hope we will not have to resort to'. He continued, 'we tell Iran, do not play with the United States, join the negotiating table to dismantle your nuclear capabilities completely'. The Iranian Foreign Ministry revealed that the ongoing talks with the Trump administration are limited to the nuclear file and lifting sanctions, stating that the Iranian negotiating team confirmed Iran's commitment to this framework during meetings hosted by Oman. The ministry stated that the negotiating position may change, but Oman remains the primary mediator, and denied reports of an imminent direct meeting between Tehran and Washington. The ministry also stated that 'the current conditions, which are experiencing pressure and threats, will not lead to positive results through direct dialogue'. Iranian Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, stated that the next round of nuclear talks with the US will take place on April 19. The first round of indirect talks between the US, led by Special Envoy to the Middle East, Stephen Witkoff, and Iran, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, took place on Saturday, with the two sides exchanging positions through Omani Foreign Minister, Badr Al-Busaidi.

**Iran-USA-Gespräche in Oman: Chance oder Sackgasse?**
Iran's Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi warned in December 2024 that if pressure on the country continues to grow, it may reconsider its stance on whether it should possess nuclear weapons. However, Iran currently has the necessary knowledge to produce nuclear weapons, but has chosen not to develop them. Iran expert Mahmoudian suggests that the negotiations should be conducted in a way that excludes Iran's ability to build nuclear weapons, and notes that President Trump's recent statements on the issue could be a signal to focus the talks on the Iranian nuclear question. A technical solution may be possible for this purpose.

**US Intelligence Warns of Imminent Israeli Strike on Iranian Nuclear Facilities**
According to Brian Hauge, the spokesperson for the National Security Council at the White House, former US President Trump 'will not allow Iran to possess a nuclear weapon.' He added that 'while he prefers to negotiate a peaceful solution to long-standing issues between the US and the Iranian regime, he will not wait indefinitely if Iran is not ready for this, and soon.' US intelligence reports, released in early January, warned that Israel is likely to attempt a strike on Iran's Fordo and Natanz nuclear facilities. US officials, both current and former, informed of the intelligence, stated that Israel concluded that its October 2023 attack on Iran weakened the country's air defenses, leaving it vulnerable to another attack.

**Iran Moves Towards US, but with a Condition**
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghtschi stated that the country is willing to negotiate with the US, but not under the condition of the 'maximum pressure' policy announced by US President Donald Trump. 'The lifting of sanctions makes negotiations necessary, but not in the framework of a policy of 'maximum pressure', because that would not be negotiations, but rather a form of capitulation,' Araghtschi said on Telegram. 'Iran will not negotiate with a country that simultaneously imposes new sanctions.' This statement comes after Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Chamenei urged his government to reject US negotiations, calling it 'not intelligent'. Chamenei stated that no problem would be solved through negotiations with Washington, citing past 'experiences'. The US withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran during Trump's first term, prompting Iran to gradually cease complying with its obligations. Trump announced on January 20 that he would return to the 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran, and on Tuesday proposed a new 'nuclear peace agreement' while emphasizing that Iran should not possess nuclear weapons.

**Trump Offers Iran a New Nuclear Deal, 'Verified' and Without Nuclear Weapons**
US President Donald Trump expressed his desire to reach a new 'verified' nuclear agreement with Iran, stating that he wants Iran to be a 'great and successful' country without nuclear weapons. Trump denied reports that the US is working with Israel to destroy Iran, calling them 'exaggerated'. Iranian officials, including the head of the Atomic Energy Organization, Mohammad Eslami, reiterated that Iran is committed to the non-proliferation treaty and does not have a nuclear weapons program. However, Iran has recently developed and showcased new military capabilities, including a ballistic missile with a range of 1,700 kilometers and three satellites. Trump has imposed a 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran, which has led to increased tensions and military demonstrations by Iran. Trump's proposal for a new nuclear agreement comes after his return to the White House in January 2025, and follows a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also expressed his opposition to Iran having nuclear weapons. 'We will start working on the agreement immediately, and we will have a great celebration in the Middle East when it is signed and completed,' Trump said. 'God bless the Middle East.'
