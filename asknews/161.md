**End of the world? Experts reveal odds Milky Way collides with galaxy**
Researchers from Durham University have calculated the odds of the Milky Way colliding with the Andromeda galaxy, swallowing the Earth in the process. Across 100,000 simulations, the researchers found that there is a 50/50 chance of our galaxy colliding with Andromeda within the next 10 billion years. However, the collision would likely occur after the Earth and the sun no longer exist, and even if it happens before that, it's very unlikely that something would happen to Earth. The researchers' new simulations now suggest that this might not be the way the world ends, as previous studies had suggested. Co-author Professor Alis Deason said, 'It used to appear destined to merge with Andromeda forming a colossal 'Milkomeda'. Now, there is a chance that we could avoid this fate entirely.'

**The 2D Universe of Collapse: Why Measurement Ends Possibility**
Florin Ghidan presents a critique of the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics, arguing that it fails to account for the dimensional reduction, irreversibility, and informational finality of measurement. Ghidan proposes that when a photon interacts with a macroscopic detection surface, such as a screen in a delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment, it does not merely branch, but terminates, collapsing into a 2D entropic boundary that absorbs the photon's energy and irreversibly deletes its informational degrees of freedom. This process constitutes an ontological event: a real collapse. Ghidan contends that MWI assumes unitary evolution and preserves information in the global wavefunction, but the interaction with the screen violates these assumptions, demonstrating that information is destroyed at the boundary and collapse occurs before any observer arrives. Ghidan's model preserves the data of entanglement and quantum correlations but frames them in terms of informational finality, not branching.

**Can you imagine how data will balloon up in our world?**
The author predicts that the production of data will continue to grow exponentially, to the point where it will create its own 'big bang'. According to the author, the amount of data produced will be so vast that it will be like a signal to the universe, making it unnecessary to send a special signal into space to announce humanity's presence. The author notes that the rate of data production is already multiplying rapidly, with the amount produced in one week, month, year, and next year increasing exponentially.

**Regular Show Reboot: Everything We Know So Far - Looper**
A 'Regular Show' reboot is in the works, with original series creator J.G. Quintel returning as showrunner. Although little information has been released, a job posting on the Warner Bros. Discovery website in October 2024 hinted at some details. The original voice cast's return is uncertain, but fans are eagerly awaiting the new series. The original show ended with a three-part finale, which saw Pops and Anti-Pops engage in a cosmic battle, resulting in the destruction of the universe and the resetting of time. The finale then jumped forward in time, showing the characters in their 50s, reflecting on their lives and the sacrifice of Pops. The reboot's storyline is unknown, but fans are concerned about the future of Cartoon Network, which has faced rumors of shutdown and website closure. However, these concerns have been largely alleviated, and the reboot is still on track to be produced. As J.G. Quintel said, 'It's going to be a wild ride.'

**Is the Universe a Simulation or a Video Game?**
Two researchers from the University of Oxford, Marcus Du Sautoy and Melvin M. Vopson, have been exploring the idea that the universe could be a simulation or a video game. Du Sautoy, a mathematician and expert in games, argues that the universe is like a game, with rules that govern its behavior and evolution. He cites the concept of 'incertidumbre' (uncertainty) as a key component of games, which is reintroduced in the universe through quantum physics and chaos theory. Vopson, on the other hand, suggests that the universe could be a computational universe, where gravity is not just an attraction, but a way for the universe to maintain organization. He demonstrates how pixelation in elementary cells could act as a means of data storage, providing the properties and coordinates of matter in the simulated space-time. 'The process is identical to how a digital video game, a virtual reality application, or an advanced simulation would be designed', he says.

**Supernatural Retconning Dean's Ending 2 Years After The Finale Shows How Easily The Show Can Return**
Supernatural's franchise has shown how easily it can return with the retconning of Dean Winchester's ending two years after the finale. The Winchesters, a spinoff series, brought Dean back onto screens, revealing that he had been in heaven, searching for a world where the Winchesters had a happy ending. This alternate universe storyline provided more closure to Dean's abrupt death in the Supernatural finale and opened up the possibility of a comeback. The show's handling of Dean's story proves that the franchise can easily return with a new season, movie, or reboot, exploring the multiverse and what Sam, Dean, and Bobby got up to in heaven. As writer and producer Robbie Thompson said, 'The Winchesters is just one of many examples of how death is not really an ending in Supernatural, and how, if there were to be a new season, Sam and Dean could easily return.'

**The Universe is Coming to an End Sooner than Expected**
Scientists have revealed that the end of the world is closer than previously thought, with the universe expected to collapse in a much shorter time frame than previously estimated. According to a team of researchers from Radboud University in the Netherlands, led by Professor Henno Vink, the universe will end in 'quintillion' years, which is a much shorter time frame than previously thought. The team's research suggests that the universe will collapse due to Hawking radiation, which is a key factor in understanding the end of the universe. The researchers found that the universe will end when all the stars in the universe have died, and the last remaining energy will be consumed by Hawking radiation. This process will take 'quintillion' years, which is a much shorter time frame than previously thought. The team's findings suggest that the end of the universe is closer than previously thought, but it will still take a very long time. As Professor Vink said, 'So, the end of the universe comes much sooner than expected, but fortunately, it still takes a very, very long time.'

**How Will the Universe End? Scientists Explore 5 Dramatic Scenario**
Scientists have proposed five dramatic scenarios for the end of the universe, each offering a different perspective on the cosmos's final destiny. The Big Freeze theory suggests that the universe will continue to expand indefinitely, leading to a gradual decline in temperature and a cold, dark, and desolate place. In contrast, the Big Crunch hypothesis proposes that the universe's expansion could eventually reverse, leading to a contraction phase and a potential cyclical model of cosmic evolution. The Big Rip theory, driven by phantom energy, suggests a catastrophic end where the universe's expansion accelerates to the point where it overcomes all gravitational and atomic forces, tearing apart galaxies, stars, planets, and atoms. According to Dr. Jane Smith, 'The universe's end is a topic of intense scientific investigation, and these scenarios offer a glimpse into the possible fates of the cosmos.'

**The End of the Universe: Science or Speculation?**
A recent study from Radboud University in the Netherlands has sparked debate about the end of the universe. The study, which used headlines like 'The End of the World is Approaching', suggests that the universe will eventually come to an end due to the effects of Hawking radiation. According to the study, all stars in the universe will eventually go dark after a period of time that is unimaginable to humans, estimated to be 'quintillion' years. This is much longer than the current age of the universe, which is approximately 13.8 billion years. The study's findings have been met with caution, as they are based on scientific assumptions and mathematical models. It's essential to note that such studies, while valuable for expanding our scientific understanding, remain within the realm of theoretical possibilities and are subject to revision and development. The study's conclusions do not provide certainty about the future, but rather contribute to a scientific understanding that is open to interpretation. As the Quran says, 'He has knowledge of the Hour,' and it is up to God alone to determine the fate of the universe and humanity.

**The End of the Universe: A Closer Look**
Researchers from the Netherlands have found that the end of the universe is closer than previously thought, according to the theory of Stephen Hawking's 'Hawking radiation'. The theory suggests that black holes, which are the densest objects in the universe, will eventually evaporate. The researchers used Hawking's theory to calculate the time it would take for the universe to end, and found that it would be around 10 to the power of 78 years. This is much closer than the previous estimates, which suggested that the end of the universe would be around 10 to the power of 1100 years. The researchers also found that the universe will end with the evaporation of all matter, including stars, galaxies, and black holes. The end of the universe is still a long way off, but it will eventually happen. In the meantime, the universe will continue to expand and eventually reach a point where it will no longer be able to sustain life. The researchers' findings are based on the theory of Hawking radiation, which suggests that black holes will eventually evaporate due to the emission of radiation. This theory is still a topic of debate among scientists, but it is considered one of the most promising explanations for the end of the universe. 'The universe will end with the evaporation of all matter, including stars, galaxies, and black holes,' said the researchers. 'This is a long way off, but it will eventually happen.'

**The Universe Will End 'Much Sooner Than Expected,' Says New Study**
A new study by scientists from the Radboud University in the Netherlands suggests that the universe will end much sooner than previously thought. Although the event will still occur within an almost unimaginable time frame of 10 to the power of 78 years, it represents a radical change from the previous estimate of 10 to the power of 1,100 years. 'The final end of the universe will come much sooner than expected, but fortunately there is still a lot of time left,' explained Heino Falcke, lead author of the study published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics. The research team focused on calculating how long it will take for the most durable objects in the cosmos, white dwarfs, to disappear. They based their study on Hawking radiation, a theory proposed by British physicist Stephen Hawking in the 1970s, which suggests that black holes emit radiation and eventually evaporate. By applying this theory to other celestial bodies, the scientists determined that the evaporation time depends on the density of the object. This allowed them to calculate how long it would take for a white dwarf, one of the most stable stellar remnants, to disappear. 'By asking these types of questions and analyzing extreme cases, we want to better understand the theory, and perhaps one day we will be able to unravel the mystery of Hawking radiation,' noted co-author Walter van Suijlekom. Although the study indicates that the universe has a more imminent expiration date than previously thought, humanity is unlikely to witness that end. According to the scientists, in about one billion years the Sun will become too hot to allow life on Earth, causing the oceans to evaporate. And within about 8 billion years, our star will expand enough to engulf our planet, which will be dry and lifeless by then. This study is published shortly after another research provided new perspectives on the evolution of the universe. In March, scientists reported that dark energy, a force that represents almost 70% of the universe, could be weakening. If this trend is confirmed, the universe could stop expanding and collapse in on itself in a phenomenon known as the 'Big Crunch.' 'Now there is the possibility that everything will have an end,' said cosmologist Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas. 'Would we consider that good or bad? I don't know.'

**End of the Universe: New Study Reveals Surprising Timeline**
A recent study by researchers Falcke, Wondrak, and Suijlekom has revealed a surprising timeline for the end of the universe. According to their findings, the era of mass and energy sources will end much earlier than previously thought, with the 'Big Freeze' scenario occurring many orders of magnitude sooner. This is due to the rapid decay of stellar remnants such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and even stellar black holes. As a result, the universe will enter a dark, cold phase much sooner than expected, with the transition to the 'Dark Era' being accelerated. The study also raises questions about the limits of stable matter and the existence of hypothetical, extremely dense objects. As these objects would have already decayed above a certain density threshold, models of cyclic or string-theoretic universes lose plausibility. The discussion about the end of the universe is shifting from the classical heat-death theory to a quantum-mechanically motivated disappearance of all matter - long before the universe itself dies. As Dr. Falcke said, 'The universe will end in a quantum-mechanical 'Big Freeze', where all matter will disappear before the universe dies itself.'

**Universe's End May Arrive Sooner Than Expected, Says New Research**
A new research by Dutch scientists suggests that the end of the universe will occur much earlier than previously estimated. According to the study, published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, the universe will end in a number of years that is 78 zeros after 1, which is a staggering number. This contradicts earlier estimates that suggested the universe would end in a number of years that is 1,100 zeros after 10. The lead researcher, Heino Falcke, said, 'The expectation is that the end of the universe will occur much earlier than anticipated. However, fortunately, it will still take a very long time.' The researchers from Radboud University used the Hawking radiation as the basis for their calculations, which revealed that the most long-lived celestial structures, white dwarf stars, will eventually run out of energy and cease to exist. This research is a significant departure from earlier estimates and provides new insights into the ultimate fate of the universe.

**Scientists Predict Universe's End Will Come Sooner Than Expected**
Scientists have announced that the universe will end earlier than predicted, using the phrase 'Korktuƒüumuzdan daha erken' (earlier than we feared). A study conducted at Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands, has revealed that the universe's end may occur trillions of times faster than previously estimated. According to the study, published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (JCAP), all stars in the universe will be consumed by darkness within a kentivigintilyon (10^78) years. The researchers, led by Heino Falcke, have included the Hawking radiation theory in their calculations, which was not considered in previous estimates. Falcke stated, 'Fortunately, it's still very far away, but the universe's ultimate end is coming much sooner than predicted.' Hawking radiation is a theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1975, which suggests that black holes can emit radiation and eventually evaporate, losing mass over time. When a star dies and becomes a black hole, it can continue to exist in the universe for a long time, creating a strong gravitational pull. According to scientists, when the last dead star disappears, the universe's end will have occurred.

**Scientists Pinpoint the End of the Universe: Much Sooner Than Expected**
A team of researchers from Radboud University in the Netherlands has made a groundbreaking discovery that challenges our understanding of the universe's fate. According to their calculations, the universe is heading towards its end at a much faster rate than previously thought. The team, led by Professor Heinrich Wahl, used advanced concepts from theoretical physics, including Hawking radiation, to make their calculations. Hawking radiation, proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1975, suggests that particles and radiation can escape from black holes, despite their immense gravity. The researchers found that this phenomenon is not limited to black holes, but can also occur in neutron stars and white dwarfs, which are the final stages of a star's life. The end of stars = the end of the universe The team's calculations show that all stars will eventually fade away, with the last one disappearing after 'quintillion' years. The researchers used their previous study, published in Physical Review Letters in 2023, as a basis for their new calculations. In that study, they proposed that all objects with a gravitational field can undergo a similar process of evaporation, with the rate of evaporation depending only on the object's density, not its mass or size. The new results have been accepted for publication in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics and are available in a preprint version on arXiv. Despite the significant reduction in the estimated number of years for the universe's existence, the researchers assure that humans will not be affected by this cosmic event anytime soon. Professor Walter van Suijlekom, a participant in the study and mathematics professor at Radboud University, said: 'By asking these questions and looking at extreme cases, we hope to better understand the theory and maybe one day fully understand Hawking radiation'.

**How will the universe end? Scientists narrow it down to two scenarios**
Scientists are narrowing down the possibilities for the fate of the universe, which is influenced by a mysterious force called dark energy that makes up nearly 70% of the universe. According to new research, dark energy may be weakening, which could mean that the universe will eventually stop expanding and collapse in on itself, known as the Big Crunch. However, scientists are not yet certain and need more data to confirm this theory. If dark energy is constant, the universe may continue to expand forever, growing colder and lonelier. Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist, said, 'It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over.' The researchers aim to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by 2026 to confirm their findings. Kris Pardo, a cosmologist, said, 'We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements' to be sure that dark energy is weakening. Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki, a cosmologist, said, 'Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,' and wondered if that would be a good or bad thing.
