**US to Ban Foreign Officials Over 'Flagrant Censorship' on Social Media**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new visa restriction policy targeting foreign government officials who censor Americans on social media. The policy aims to restrict visas for foreign officials who block or regulate American social media posts, which could be seen as 'censoring Americans'. This move is seen as a countermeasure to the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires major social media platforms to implement stricter content moderation policies. Rubio stated, 'Today, I am announcing a new visa restriction policy targeting foreign nationals who are responsible for censoring protected expression in the United States. Foreign officials who issue arrest warrants or threaten to arrest Americans for social media posts on American platforms, or who demand the adoption of global content moderation policies that extend beyond their authority, will not be tolerated.' The new policy does not specify which cases will be targeted, but it is believed to be a response to the EU's Digital Services Act, which designates X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and YouTube as 'large online platforms' and requires them to take strict action against hate speech and child exploitation content. US Vice President J.D. Vance has previously criticized the EU's 'authoritarian censorship' for harming the US technology industry, and the Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the EU's social media regulations. The US State Department's website now features a link to an op-ed by Senior Adviser to the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Samuel Samson, who criticizes the Digital Services Act as 'using content moderation to silence dissenting voices in a George Orwellian manner.' Samson also notes that independent regulatory agencies are currently monitoring social media companies, including X, and threatening to impose heavy fines if they violate free speech regulations.

**US Restricts Visas for Foreigners Who Censor Americans on Social Media**
The US Embassy in Brazil detailed the new policy of the Trump administration to restrict the issuance of visas to foreigners who, according to the White House, try to censor Americans on social media. In a statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio highlighted the restriction, which is provided for in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The measure also affects family members of the person targeted by the restrictions. According to the statement sent by the Embassy, the change is based on the right to freedom of expression. 'This right, legally enshrined in our Constitution, has made us a beacon of freedom for the world. Even as we act to reject censorship in our country, we observe disturbing cases of governments and foreign authorities adopting this practice,' Rubio said. He also cited cases of 'foreign authorities' taking censorship measures against technology companies and US citizens and residents 'when they had no authority to do so.' Recently, Elon Musk, owner of X, was at the center of a controversy with Supreme Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes. The minister blocked X in Brazil last year on August 30, after the company closed its office in Brazil and left without a legal representative. The unblocking only occurred in October, after Musk paid R$ 28.6 million in fine. At the time, the billionaire American, who had previously joined the Trump government, announced the closure of the company's headquarters in Brazil after the network was fined for refusing to comply with the order to remove from the air profiles of investigated by the Court for the publication of messages considered antidemocratic. 'It is unacceptable that foreign authorities issue or threaten to issue arrest warrants against US citizens or residents for posts on social media made on American platforms while physically present in American soil,' Rubio detailed, in the statement. The White House Secretary also classified as 'unacceptable' that foreign authorities demand that US technology platforms adopt global content moderation policies or become involved in censorship actions that reach the US. 'We will not tolerate violations of American sovereignty, especially when these violations compromise the exercise of our fundamental right to freedom of expression,' he concluded.

**Indian 'X' accounts withheld after Operation Sindoor restored**
The Indian government has unblocked access to many Indian and non-Pakistani accounts on X, formerly Twitter, that were restricted due to Operation Sindoor. The move came before a court hearing, where the accounts were to challenge their censorship. Arpit Sharma, a content creator with 3.4 lakh followers on Instagram, had his X account withheld on May 8, but it was restored on May 17. 'Just before our case was to be listed [in the Supreme Court], my account got restored,' Mr. Sharma said. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology did not respond to a query regarding the accounts' blocking. The Software Freedom Law Centre, India (SFLC) has filed a PIL in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of Rule 16 and the reading down of Rules 8 and 9 of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009, for violating Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. 'The widespread blocking of social media accounts without prior notice or an opportunity to contest takedowns is neither just nor effective,' the non-profit said.

**Blocking of X divides tense Tanzania - CAJ News Africa**
The blocking of X, formerly Twitter, in Tanzania has sparked controversy, with critics accusing the government of using it as a means to curb dissent and stifle criticism ahead of crucial polls. Hackers allegedly infiltrated the Tanzania Police's X account, posting prank content and sexual material, which has since been taken down. The Tanzania Revenue Authority's account was also targeted, leading to speculation of a coordinated attack on government entities. Minister of Information, Jeffrey Silaa, assured parliamentarians that the affected accounts had been secured, but critics believe the government is using the situation to clamp down on critics. 'People are raising their voices and calling for change through social media,' said critic José Jackié Karabhukane. 'It is extremely concerning to see authorities in Tanzania repeatedly respond to criticism by shutting down the internet and blocking access to digital platforms,' added Bridget Andere, Senior Policy Analyst at Access Now. The government is accused of human rights violations ahead of elections in October, with a rise in arrests, detention, and torture of prominent opposition members.

**Disney+ Fined for Blocking User Access**
The Consumer Center North Rhine-Westphalia (Verbraucherzentrale NRW) has successfully taken action against Disney+ for blocking user access. According to Iwona Husemann, a lawyer at the Consumer Center, 'consumers should not be forced to accept contract changes through technical barriers.' She added that 'access to paid services should not be linked to agreeing to new terms.' As a result, Disney+ is no longer allowed to block access to accounts. Starting from June 1, 2025, such access restrictions will be prohibited. If Disney+ blocks access to paid content again, a contract penalty will be incurred, Husemann emphasized.

**EU Opens Investigation into Adult Platforms for Failing to Protect Minors**
The European Union has announced the opening of an investigation into the adult platforms Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX, and XVideos, suspected of not taking sufficient measures to prevent minors from accessing their content. According to the new Digital Services Act (DSA), the European Commission points out the lack of 'appropriate' tools to verify user age and protect minors from adult content. As reported by AFP, a user could access these platforms on Tuesday by simply clicking to confirm they are 18 years old, without further verification. The investigation may lead to significant financial sanctions if the platforms are found to be in breach of the rules. 'Our priority is to protect minors and allow them to navigate online safely,' said European Commissioner Henna Virkkunen, responsible for technological sovereignty and the implementation of the DSA. 'In collaboration with the digital service coordinators of member states, we are determined to tackle anything that can harm young online users,' she added. The platforms, which have over 45 million European users per month, are subject to the strengthened rules of the DSA, along with X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Google, and Facebook (Meta). However, Stripchat will be removed from this list as it does not meet the 45 million user threshold, although this change in status will take several months, and the strengthened rules of the DSA will still apply in the meantime.

**Furkan Karabay's New X Account Blocked from Access**
The new X social media account of imprisoned journalist Furkan Karabay has been blocked from access. The reason for the block is 'protection of security and public order'. Karabay was arrested for a YouTube video and social media posts that were deemed to be 'insulting to the President' and 'targeting individuals involved in the fight against terrorism'. His new X account was blocked and made inaccessible from Turkey, citing the same reason as his previous social media account. 'Security and public order' is the reason given for the block, according to X. Karabay's previous social media account was also blocked.

**Tanzania block access to X after hackers targeted police account - TV47 Digital**
Tanzania has restricted access to X (formerly Twitter) for the second time in recent months, following a cyber attack on the country's police account. The compromised account, with 470,000 followers, posted false claims that the President had died, sparking outrage among top government officials. According to NetBlocks, a global internet shutdown tracker, X became unreachable across all major internet providers in Tanzania on Tuesday, May 20. This latest blockage comes after President Samia instructed the police force to take measures to 'protect' social media platforms, signaling a growing concern over the spread of misinformation online. The incident follows the arrest and deportation of several Kenyan activists from Tanzania, who had traveled to observe the trial of opposition leader Tundu Lissu.

**X handles of Turkish, Chinese media organisations blocked in India**
The Indian government has blocked the X (formerly Twitter) accounts of several Turkish and Chinese media organisations, including TRT World, Xinhua, and Global Times News, amid a crackdown on 'anti-India content' related to Operation Sindoor. The blocking of over 8,000 accounts, including those of international news organisations and prominent X users, was ordered by the Indian government, with X voicing disagreement over the orders, stating that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech.' The Indian government has also criticized Global Times for spreading disinformation, saying 'we would recommend you verify your facts and cross-examine your sources before pushing out this kind of disinformation.' Several independent media outlets and journalists remain blocked on X, including Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat, and Free Press Kashmir, as well as Anuradha Bhasin and Muzamil Jaleel.

The Indian government has ordered X (formerly Twitter) to block access to over 8,000 accounts in India, citing regional regulations. X has expressed objections to the directive, stating that the government did not provide clear reasons for the blocking. The platform has received executive orders from the Indian government, which include demands to block access to accounts that allegedly broke India's regional regulations. X has said that it is investigating legal options to challenge the directive, but users who are impacted can contact the Indian government directly. This development may strain Elon Musk's business ventures in India, including Tesla's plans to launch showroom spaces and Starlink's operations.

**Pakistan has restored X access after a 15-month ban - here's everything we know so far**
Pakistan has restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban, which was enforced in February 2024 due to the platform being 'used to draw attention to instances of alleged election fraud.' According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, metrics show that access to X has been restored in Pakistan, allowing citizens to access the platform without the need for a virtual private network (VPN). However, other platforms such as Telegram remain blocked in the country. Pakistan has imposed 21 shutdowns in 2024, the highest number ever, and is reportedly building a Great Firewall-like internet censorship system with China's help.

Pakistan has restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a months-long ban in the country. The social media platform was blocked in February last year following general elections in Pakistan. According to Internet monitor NetBlocks, 'metrics show access to X (formerly Twitter) has been restored in #Pakistan' as conflict breaks out with neighboring India. An Anadolu correspondent in Pakistan confirmed that the platform is now working without the use of a VPN. The government had previously stated that X is a 'threat to the national security' and could not be restored.

**Access Block Decision Issued for Popular Turkish News Accounts on X**
The Ankara 11th Sulh Ceza Hakimliği has issued an access block decision for the BPT, Boşuna Tıklama, and Zam Haber social media accounts, in accordance with the request of the İletişim Başkanlığı. This decision comes after the Bilgi Teknolojileri ve İletişim Kurumu (BTK) requested access block for over 700 accounts on X (formerly Twitter) last week. However, X management has not yet implemented this decision, and the accounts are still accessible. It remains to be seen whether X will appeal this decision, as they have done in the past. 'We will continue to fight for free speech and the rights of journalists and independent media,' said Elon Musk, X's owner. 'We will not be intimidated by these attempts to silence us.'

**The value of X**
Pakistan continues to block social media platform X (formerly Twitter), despite mounting legal and public pressure. The Lahore High Court is currently hearing petitions challenging the ban, which argue that restricting access to X violates Articles 19 and 19-A of the constitution, guaranteeing freedom of expression and access to information. The court has questioned why government institutions and officials, including the prime minister, continue to use X despite its official prohibition. The ban was imposed in early 2024 under the caretaker government, but its justification, citing confidential reports from intelligence agencies, is unconvincing and reeks of political expediency. The government's actions suggest an intent to normalise digital censorship under the guise of security, which is unacceptable. Free speech and access to information are fundamental to democracy, and an open digital space is crucial for political discourse. The ban on X should not become the new normal, and the government should engage in democratic debate, address misinformation through transparency, and strengthen public trust. Censorship is not the solution; dialogue and accountability are.

**X Blocks Signal Links, Sparking Controversy**
X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has been blocking links to Signal, a secure messaging service. According to users, X marks Signal links as spam, preventing users from accessing them directly from the platform. This move has sparked controversy, as it restricts users' ability to communicate outside of X. This is just the latest in a long list of controversies surrounding X, which has undergone significant changes since Elon Musk's acquisition in 2022. Other issues include the introduction of paid verification, a radical rebranding, and a decrease in transparency, including the removal of 'likes' visibility. As a result, alternative platforms like BlueSky have seen a significant increase in traffic, attracting users who miss the old Twitter experience.

**X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey: rights watchdog**
X, formerly known as Twitter, blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts include those belonging to Turkish journalists, activists, and media organizations operated by journalists living in exile, as well as some that have been inactive since 2015. This is not the first time X has complied with the Turkish government's censorship demands, having previously blocked access to over 100 accounts in October 2024. The move has been criticized by human rights and media freedom groups, who say it amounts to censorship. Turkey has a poor track record of online freedoms, with a score of 31 in a 100-point index, making it the lowest-scoring country in Europe. The Turkish government has been accused of muzzling freedom of expression and cracking down on people who express criticism of their government on social media.

**LinkedIn Blocked In Russia After Court Ruling - The Cerbat Gem**
Russia's communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, has ordered the blocking of public access to LinkedIn's website in the country, citing a court ruling that found the social networking firm guilty of violating a data storage law. The law, approved by President Vladimir Putin in 2014, requires websites to store the personal data of Russian citizens on Russian servers. LinkedIn has confirmed the block, stating that it is a foreign company and must first obtain approval from the foreign ministry and security services for a meeting with Roskomnadzor. The Kremlin has stated that the decision was legal, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were no concerns that the move would exacerbate fears of online censorship in the country. This is not the first time a U.S. company has been targeted under the legislation, with Facebook, Twitter, and Google also being ordered to host Russian users' personal information in Russia. Microsoft, which is currently in the process of acquiring LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, was also under investigation but has since been given the all-clear.
