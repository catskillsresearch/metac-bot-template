**China Prepares for Next Technological Assault with Huawei and UBTech Alliance**
China is preparing for its next technological assault, with Huawei and UBTech joining forces to bring humanoid robots to homes. According to Bank of America Global Research, the adoption of humanoid robots could start in 2028, with the industry expected to move billions of dollars annually. In reality, the change is already underway: 18,000 units are expected to be delivered in 2025, with 1 million shipments per year expected by 2030, and 10 million by 2035. Huawei and UBTech have signed a strategic alliance to collaborate on the development of humanoid robots for factories and homes, with the goal of accelerating the transition from laboratory innovation to large-scale adoption in industrial, domestic, and other scenarios. The alliance also includes the creation of a center for innovation dedicated to 'embodied intelligence', which aims to integrate cognitive functions in robotic bodies. According to LeadeRobot, the Chinese domestic market for humanoid robots could double this year, reaching 5.3 billion yuan (approximately 665 million euros). Zhou Jian, president of UBTech, confirmed in March that the company plans to produce over 1,000 units in 2025. This move is part of a broader national strategy, with the Chinese government betting on industrial automation as part of its response to various challenges, including commercial challenges, declining birth rates, and aging population. As the New York Times notes, the government is pushing for the adoption of robots in industries such as manufacturing, with the goal of maintaining low costs and reinforcing global competitiveness. The Chinese government has also requested that manufacturers lease units, record videos in real environments, and send them to the government to encourage the adoption of humanoid robots in the automotive industry. Even in the symbolic realm, there are gestures: in April, Beijing organized a half-marathon with 12,000 human runners and 20 humanoid robots, with only six crossing the finish line, but the message was clear. Bank of America Global Research expects this sector to evolve in three stages: first in factories and logistics (2025-2027), then in commercial and educational services (2028-2034), and finally in homes, with assistive and domestic applications starting from 2035. If the predictions come true, there could be 3 billion humanoid robots in use worldwide by 2060.

**Humanoid Robot Industry Trends: 2025 Expected to be a Year of Mass Production**
The humanoid robot industry is expected to accelerate in 2025, with Tesla's production plan aiming to produce 10,000 Optimus robots per month by 2025, 10,000 per month by 2026, and 100,000 per month by 2027. As the industry enters the mass production era, we believe that with the accumulation of data, iteration of large models, and decrease in hardware costs, humanoid robots will be expected to enter the industrial and home scenarios on a large scale. On the hardware level, we recommend paying attention to the following dimensions: 1) the adoption of rotational and linear actuators in parallel by main manufacturers such as Tesla, which is expected to increase the penetration rate of domestic manufacturers; 2) the use of planetary gearboxes as the core components of linear actuators, which are expected to bring about incremental application scenarios; 3) the use of flexible hands as the best choice for end-effectors, which requires high precision, load capacity, and flexibility, and is expected to bring about changes in freedom and transmission methods. According to Tesla's Optimus-Gen3, the freedom is expected to increase to 22, approaching the 24 freedoms of the human hand. The transmission method is expected to adopt a three-stage transmission scheme consisting of planetary gearboxes, miniature gearboxes, and tendon-based transmission. We recommend paying attention to module manufacturers such as Zhiwei Electrical, Jiechang Drive, and core component suppliers such as Ningzhi Electrical (hollow cup motors) and Zhejiang Rongtai (miniature gearboxes). 3) The shortage of production capacity and the urgent need for cost reduction also make harmonic reducers and six-axis force sensors worth paying attention to. We recommend paying attention to Green Harmonic, Zhongdadi, Henggong Precision, Donghua Testing, and Kelie Sensors.

**UST's Wang Xingxing Reveals Humanoid Robot Industry's Hot Trend and Future Prospects**
The sixth Shanghai Innovation and Entrepreneurship Youth 50 Forum was held on May 10, 2025, where Wang Xingxing, CEO of UST, revealed that the humanoid robot industry has experienced an unprecedented hot trend, with many companies accelerating the landing of downstream scenarios. Many humanoid robot manufacturers have gone out of stock, including UST, which is currently facing a shortage of personnel in various positions. Wang Xingxing believes that in the next 2-5 years, the problem of end-to-end artificial intelligence will become the core of technical research and development. Therefore, the strongest humanoid robot company must be a company with artificial intelligence capabilities. Currently, hardware issues are also hindering the development of the industry, and how to produce low-cost, long-lasting hardware is a key factor in large-scale production. UST has become a leader in product sales, with a sales volume of 23,700 units in 2024 and a market share of nearly 70%. The company has also delivered over 1,500 humanoid robots. With the continuous progress of technology, humanoid robots are expected to become the next generation of large-scale deployment of intelligent terminals, bringing about a wide range of market opportunities. The 2025 World Robot Competition - the first Humanoid Robot Sports Festival will be held on August 15-17, 2025, with a comprehensive competition including football, track and field, and pharmaceutical sorting. The festival will also include a theme conference and a carnival. The festival is organized by the China Electronics Society, the Wuhan Investment Holding Group, and the China Humanoid Robot Association. The event will showcase the comprehensive capabilities of humanoid robots. Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, has been a focus in the industry. In June 2024, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would perform a major hardware upgrade on Optimus in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, and would enter the limited production stage in 2025. On March 21, 2025, Musk announced that Tesla had completed the manufacturing of Optimus on the production line in Fremont, California. Tesla plans to produce 5,000 units of Optimus in 2025 and 50,000 units in 2026. To accelerate the mass production of Optimus, Tesla has published multiple job postings on its website, mostly for engineers, including machine learning engineers, deep learning operation engineers, and reinforcement learning engineers. This indicates that Tesla is still investing heavily in artificial intelligence to improve the overall capabilities of Optimus. On April 19, 2025, the Beijing Humanoid Robot Half Marathon was held, which attracted widespread attention and discussion. It was found that multiple companies' humanoid robots had shown impressive performance. Figure is another focus humanoid robot manufacturer. On February 21, 2025, Figure released the Helix end-to-end humanoid model, which first applied the 'visual-language-action (VLA)' to humanoid robots, enhancing the robot's learning ability and limb control ability. The Helix is composed of two AI modules, playing the roles of 'brain' and 'little brain'.

**Humanoid Robot Industry Report: Embarking on the Mass Production Era**
The humanoid robot industry has entered a deep cultivation period, and products need to be refined. In April 2025, the humanoid robot index first fell and then rose, with a cumulative decline of -0.06%. After the international environment's influencing factors gradually stabilized, the growth style robot sector rebounded, and the Beijing Yizhuang Sports Meeting attracted a lot of attention. We have seen that robots can now complete continuous work tasks, and the reliability of components has been verified. However, we also need to be aware that current robots still have many shortcomings in terms of hardware lightening, software intelligentization, and hardware-software collaboration. The industry's solutions are diverse, but the technical routes have not yet converged, and each company still needs to refine its internal strength, actively explore different technical routes, and push humanoid robots to the next maturity stage. The VLA model's generalization ability is worth paying attention to, and the cloud-end fusion of the operating system lays the foundation. PhysicalIntelligence, a company valued at $2.4 billion, released the VLA (visual-language-action) model meta-O.5, which is designed for robot control and can execute complex household tasks, such as cleaning the kitchen and organizing the bedroom, in a new environment. East Star Technology showcased its AI robot operating system, Hongdao, at the Zhongguancun Forum, achieving a fusion of control, calculation, visualization, artificial intelligence, and cloud services, which may become a distributed intelligent collaborative platform. On the hardware side, attention should be paid to the robot cable segment, and the battery life issue is worth paying attention to. The cable and connector play a connecting role, ensuring the robot's stable operation. Humanoid robots require high precision and durability for their cable sizes and lifespan, requiring extremely fine wire diameters to withstand repeated bending and folding tens of millions of times. The robot half-marathon competition ended with a unique outcome, except for the action balance ability, the robot power source upgrade has become a consensus, but the solution is still being discussed. Considering the research investment and scale effect in the power battery field, the mainstream power supply scheme in the future will rely on breakthroughs in battery body technology and customized services for specific scenarios. In 2025, the year of mass production for humanoid robots, the industry's trend is starting to take shape, and we recommend paying attention to the top humanoid robot industry chains in China and abroad: 1) T chain: Three Flower Control, Topwise Group, North Technology, Mingzhi Electric, and Zhaowei Machinery; 2) Huawei chain: Evte, Yijiahe, Kelite Sensor, Zhaowei Machinery; 3) U tree chain: Longsheng Bearing, Obit Middle Light; 4) Figure chain: Mingzhi Electric, Zhaowei Machinery, Lvdesheng, Lengyi Intelligent Manufacturing; 5) 1x: Zhongjian Technology; 6) Leading enterprises in the subdivided segments: Sodan Technology, Hanwei Technology, Lingyun Light, Ouyi Entertainment, Fulai New Materials, Hongye, Nanshan Zhishang, Xinqie Electric, and Guomao Shares. Risk warning: AI technology progress is not as expected, humanoid robot mass production progress is not as expected, domestic promotion is not as expected, and geopolitical risks.

**Humanoid Robot Industry Enters 'Hot War' Stage with New Product Releases**
The Chinese robotics industry has entered a 'hot war' stage with the release of new humanoid robots from several companies, including Xiangxue Technology and Zhimi Robot. The robots have been showcased with impressive capabilities, such as the ability to perform complex tasks and interact with humans in a natural way. However, the industry still faces challenges in terms of mass production, with many companies struggling to meet demand. According to Wu Wei, the public relations director of Digital Huaxia, the company has delivered several dozen products in 2024 and plans to produce around 1,000 units in 2025. The company's goal is to achieve mass production and make humanoid robots a reality. 'Now, every investment is betting on mass production,' said an investor. 'Whoever can produce at the lowest cost and occupy the market will have the opportunity. The final competition will be about cost and market share, and smart technology is just one aspect, but cost is related to production volume, and if production volume is large, scale effect will naturally reduce cost.' said Zhang Chi, the chairman of Beijing New Ding Rong Sheng Capital Management. However, mass production of humanoid robots is not a simple task, and many challenges remain, including ensuring quality control and matching algorithms with hardware. 'Mass production is not just about copying, our current production lines still rely on R&D personnel to complete manually. Although small batches of production will not have too many problems, once entering large-scale production, many difficulties will be encountered,' said Wu Wei. 'The quality of each robot affects the sustainability of production, and each robot involves algorithms, hardware, and debugging, making it difficult to match. It's like Musk said, making a demo is easy, but making mass production is very difficult,' said Wu Wei. 'We have an internal estimate that from 2026 to 2027, there will be a significant (production) ramp-up effect. The output in 2026 and 2027 will reach a data that everyone may be surprised by,' said Wu Wei. Additionally, the industry chain also faces challenges in terms of key components, such as planetary roller bearings, which have a complex production process and high technical threshold, and the number of suppliers with large-scale production capacity is limited, making it difficult to follow the rapid growth of market demand. 'Firstly, the rapid expansion of the humanoid robot market has led to an explosive growth in demand for components, but the production process of planetary roller bearings is complex, and the technical threshold is high, and the number of suppliers with large-scale production capacity is limited, making it difficult to follow the rapid growth of market demand,' said a representative of Zhongxing Robot. 'The mismatch between supply and demand has brought both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, component shortages may affect the production progress of humanoid robots, prompting companies to strengthen supply chain management and technical cooperation; on the other hand, it also provides a huge market space for related component companies, driving them to accelerate technological breakthroughs and capacity expansion,' said the representative of Zhongxing Robot. 'The current technical challenges of humanoid robot production include whole-machine motion control and software algorithm systems; cost challenges, such as the current high cost of the whole machine; commercialization challenges, such as the lack of relevant laws and regulations, and the current demand for production is greater than the demand for cost reduction, so we should prioritize production first and then optimize,' said Joanne, an analyst at TrendForce. 'Different companies have different views on the possible landing scenarios of humanoid robots. Some companies, such as Optimus and Yibao, have clearly stated that their product targets industrial scenes. For example, Yibao has completed industrial humanoid robot training in multiple car factories this year. However, some companies believe that C-end interaction scenarios are the correct way to open up humanoid robots. 'Industrial manufacturing is very difficult. To enter a factory, you need to consider whether you can truly achieve the function, such as whether you can screw in the screws, the precision requirements are very high. Compared to this, interactive robots have a higher degree of tolerance, and if you say something wrong, you can just be criticized, but factories cannot tolerate errors. The 'brain' of humanoid robots is now very powerful, but its 'body' - action accuracy and execution ability still exist a big challenge, but many mature industrial robots can do stronger loads and more accurate actions,' said a market director of a humanoid robot company in Shenzhen.
