**New York City Mayoralty: Five Democratic Figures Vie for the Top Spot**
As the primary elections in June approach, five Democratic figures are positioning themselves as the main contenders for the New York City mayoralty after Eric Adams announced his candidacy as an independent in November. Among them, Andrew Cuomo leads in polls and fundraising, but faces internal resistance. The five main contenders for the New York City mayoralty are Andrew Cuomo, Adrienne Adams, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Zellnor Myrie, who have met the requirements for the second and final debate before the early voting, which begins on June 1. According to the article, 'Andrew Cuomo is leading the fundraising effort towards the debate of candidates,' said the president of the Municipal Council, Adrienne Adams, who has experienced a financial boost that brings her closer to the public funding threshold. 'Adrienne Adams and the progressive support in New York,' said Zohran Mamdani, who has asked his followers to donate to Adams' campaign. As the article states, 'The campaign of Adams maintained payments to her fundraiser Brianna Suggs, involved in the FBI investigation, with a total of over $460,000 until mid-May.' The last debate before the early voting will be held on June 12, organized by The City, NY1, and other media outlets. The Financial Board will vote this week on new public funding requests, which will be a decisive step for the candidates who are still seeking financial support before the final campaign.

**Pennsylvania Perspective for Thursday, May 22, 2025**
Pennsylvania's 2025 primary elections were 'relatively calm and successful,' according to Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt, with minor issues reported statewide. Republican candidates Matthew Wolford and Maria Battista won their respective primaries for the Commonwealth and Superior Courts, and will face Democratic nominees Stella Tsai and Brandon Neuman in the general election. Pennsylvania lawmakers narrowed a proposed hospital merger oversight bill to focus on private equity, and awarded $22.5 million in Solar for Schools grants to 73 schools statewide. A new report reveals that opioid use disorder cost Pennsylvania over $232 billion in 2024, and a treatment combining behavioral therapy and medication could save up to $295,000 per case. Starting June 5, Pennsylvania will ban handheld cell phone use while driving, and District Attorney Larry Krasner is on track for a third term after winning the Democratic primary. Allegheny County Controller Corey O'Connor won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, defeating incumbent Ed Gainey, and the U.S. House narrowly passed President Donald Trump's major tax-and-immigration budget bill, which now moves to the Senate for expected revisions.

**Zohran Mamdani makes up ground in NYC mayoral race  --  but still...**
A new internal poll shows Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani gaining ground on Andrew Cuomo in the NYC mayoral primary race, but the ex-governor still maintains a 12-point lead. According to the poll, Cuomo would win the June 24 primary with 56% of the vote, while Mamdani would end with 44%. Mamdani's campaign said, 'With still a third lower name recognition than Cuomo and millions in cash on hand, Zohran is nowhere near his ceiling.' Cuomo's spokesman Rich Azzopardi pointed out that the results mirror recent independent polls, including one that had Cuomo winning 61% to 39% in the seventh round. The poll surveyed 500 likely voters between May 14 and 18.

According to a recent poll by IBRiS, Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, the candidate from Poland's ruling Civic Coalition (KO), would receive 45.7% of the vote, narrowly ahead of nationalist Karol Nawrocki, who would get 44.9% support, in the upcoming second round of the presidential election on June 1. The poll also showed that 7.8% of voters are still undecided. This is a reversal of the first round results, where Trzaskowski led Nawrocki by a margin of 1.9%. As the government views the election as crucial to its efforts for democratic reform, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Warsaw on Sunday to show support for rival candidates.

**Center-Left Wins Mayoral Elections in Genoa and Ravenna**
In the partial local elections held in Italy, the center-left won the mayoralties of the important cities of Genoa and Ravenna. According to unofficial results, Silvia Salis, the candidate of the center-left, won the mayoral election in Genoa with 51.6% of the votes, leaving behind Pietro Piciocchi, the candidate of the ruling center-right, who received 44% of the votes. In Ravenna, Alessandro Barattoni, the candidate of the center-left, won with 58.1% of the votes, leaving behind Nicolo Grand, the candidate of the center-right, who received 25% of the votes. However, the center-left candidates in Matera and Taranto did not reach the 50.1% threshold required to win, and therefore, the two cities will hold a second round of voting on June 8-9. 'We are winning the elections, while the center-right is celebrating the poll results,' said Elly Schlein, the leader of the main opposition party, the Democratic Party (PD). Matteo Renzi, the leader of the opposition party Italia Viva, stated that 'when the center-left unites, it wins, and it wins with a significant margin. Especially when it fields reliable candidates, as seen in Ravenna and Genoa. Today, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni suffered a significant blow. The statements that 'the polls showed her to be very strong' are no longer valid. The growth has been slowed down.'

**Exclusive | Ritchie Torres in dead heat with Kathy Hochul among NYC Dems in potential gov primary: new poll**
A recent poll conducted by the Honan Strategy Group for the Jewish Voters Action Network found that Rep. Ritchie Torres is in a dead heat with Governor Kathy Hochul in a potential Democratic primary for governor in New York City. The poll showed that 38% of likely city Democratic voters would back Hochul, compared to 37% for Torres, with 25% of the respondents undecided. Among likely Jewish city Democrats, Hochul led with 40% to 31% for Torres, with 29% undecided. State Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs dismissed the findings, saying, 'It sounds like a flawed poll. I wouldn’t pay attention to it whatsoever.' The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.89 percentage points and was conducted from May 15-18 among 1,136 Democrats.

**5 summer elections to watch**
This summer, several key primaries will take place in the US, setting the stage for general election match-ups in November. In New Jersey, voters will choose nominees for governor, with former state Assembly member Jack Ciattarelli likely to renominate as the Republican nominee. The Democratic field is more open, with Rep. Mikie Sherrill currently leading in polling, but other candidates like Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka still have a chance. In Virginia, voters will choose nominees for lieutenant governor and state attorney general, with several candidates vying for the Democratic nomination. In New York City, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo is the favorite to win the Democratic nomination for mayor, despite controversy surrounding him. In Arizona, several candidates are running for the Democratic nomination for a vacant House seat, with Adelita Grijalva, the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva's daughter, and former state Rep. Daniel Hernández Jr. being prominent contenders. In Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu is facing a challenge from Josh Kraft, the son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, in her bid for a second term. 'It is a packed race to oust New York City Mayor Eric Adams,' said Cuomo, who has been the favorite since he entered the race. 'I am committed to making sure that our city is a place where everyone can thrive,' said Wu, who is seeking a second term as mayor of Boston.

**New York Mayoral Election Heats Up as Mamdani Urges Supporters to Donate to Adams**
As the June 24 Democratic primary election in New York City approaches, the mayoral election has entered a heated phase. On May 18, State Assemblyman and Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani released a video, urging his supporters to donate to his competitor, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, to jointly block former Governor Andrew Cuomo's return to politics. Mamdani stated in the video that although he has already met the $8.3 million fundraising threshold set by the NYC Campaign Finance Board, he hopes his supporters will redirect resources to Adams, who has not yet received city matching funds, to help her qualify for public funds for TV ads by the deadline (May 20). This joint call is a rare occurrence in New York election history. Although Mamdani has not officially endorsed Adams, his move is equivalent to sharing strategic resources with a competitor within the same political camp. Due to New York City's ranked-choice voting system, voters can choose up to five candidates and rank them in order, making strategic cooperation between candidates feasible. Adams has received endorsements from several progressive officials, including State Attorney General Letitia James, since announcing her candidacy in March. According to a Marist poll conducted earlier this month, she has risen to third place but still falls short of the threshold for city matching funds, preventing her from launching an ad campaign. However, the poll shows Cuomo still leading with a two-digit margin. The Marist poll found that about 50% of black Democratic voters and 41% of Latino voters support Cuomo, far exceeding Mamdani's 20%, while Adams only received 14% of black support. Cuomo's campaign released its first TV ad, 'Crisis,' this week, promoting his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic and portraying himself as the most capable candidate to address the crime and cost of living crises.

**Exclusive | Thousands of Jewish voters register as Dems to vote in NYC mayoral...**
Nearly 7,000 Jewish city voters have recently registered as Democrats ahead of the June mayoral primary in NYC, a potentially ominous sign for lefty candidates viewed as soft on antisemitism. This is a significant increase from the 2,564 new Jewish voters who enrolled as Democrats in the past. The Jewish Voters Action Network (JVAN) pushed the effort, which is non-partisan and not endorsing any candidate. According to JVAN founder Maury Litwack, 'Jews are showing up to play. We're not ignoring this election. We are punching above our weight.' Concerns about antisemitism are driving up interest in the 2025 elections among Jews across the spectrum, and the winner of the Democratic primary will be heavily favored to win the general election.

**Chinese-American Community Leaders Launch Signature Drive for Democratic Primary**
The signature drive for the 2025 New York City Democratic primary is nearing its end, with candidates for the 65D and 65B districts seeking to demonstrate the influence of the Chinese-American community in politics. Incumbent 65D district leader Yujin Kim and challenger Wang Di are actively collecting signatures in Chinatown, Little Italy, and the Government District. Yujin Kim, who has served multiple terms as 65D district leader, emphasized the importance of Chinese-American participation in the election, saying, 'As long as the Democrats are in power in New York State and City, we need to voice our opinions from within the party to ensure that policies are more in line with the people's will and to protect the well-being of the people. We need to make a voice that is in line with the middle way, to ensure that the community's interests are taken seriously.' Wang Di, who is challenging the incumbent leader of a different ethnic group, has received strong support from Chinese-American Democratic members in the district and will continue to collect signatures to expand his influence. The signature drive will end this month, and candidates who gather enough signatures will appear on the June 24 primary ballot. This year's primary will include elections for mayor, comptroller, public advocate, city council members, judges, and Democratic district leaders.

As Chinese-Americans, we need to voice our opinions in a moderate and balanced manner to ensure that the community's interests are taken into account.' Wang Qian, who is challenging the incumbent leader of the 65B district, is also receiving strong support from Chinese-American Democratic Party members and will continue to seek more signatures to expand his influence. The signature drive will conclude at the end of the month, and candidates who gather enough signatures will appear on the primary ballot on June 24. This year's primary will cover positions such as mayor, comptroller, public advocate, city council members, judges, and Democratic district leaders.

**Democrat Rep Ritchie Torres endorses Cuomo for New York City mayor over Eric Adams: report**
Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., has reportedly endorsed Andrew Cuomo to run for mayor of New York City, citing Cuomo's 'competence to govern the city' and 'courage to stand up to extremist politics.' Torres, who represents the Bronx, told the New York Post, 'We don't need a Mr. Nice Guy. We need a Mr. Tough Guy.' Cuomo has not formally declared his candidacy but is rumored to announce soon. Torres predicted Cuomo's comeback story will be the 'resurrection of Andrew Cuomo' in the 2025 election, saying 'America loves a comeback, New York loves a comeback.' Cuomo faces multiple challengers in June's Democratic primary, but is currently polling as the front-runner.
