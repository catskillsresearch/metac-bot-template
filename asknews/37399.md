**Folly Beach's proactive approach: New sensors alert officials to rising water levels**
The City of Folly Beach in South Carolina has installed a water level sensor at Folly River Park, which sends real-time data to city officials. According to Nicole Elko, President of Elko Coastal Consulting, 'So there's one installed behind us on the Folly River Bridge, and it is sending real-time water level data to the communities so that they can manage what's happening on the ground.' The sensor alerts officials when water levels exceed a set threshold, allowing them to be proactive in managing flooding and life safety issues. The data is free and online, and has various uses, including for boaters, beachgoers, and city safety and management. Water levels on Folly Beach exceeded the king tide threshold 60 times in 2024, according to Elko.

**Rhein-Brücke: Längere Arbeitszeit an Pfaffendorfer Brücke in Koblenz**
To prevent a possible standstill in construction due to low water levels in the Rhine River at the Pfaffendorfer Bridge in Koblenz, construction companies are now working longer hours in the evenings. The city has extended the standard working hours until 10 PM, while still adhering to legal regulations. According to the city, 'stillstand of construction work due to summer low water levels in the Rhine shall be avoided.' This is particularly important for the next construction phase, where the first new bridge components will be installed in the coming weeks. 'A corresponding water level of the Rhine is required for this.' The construction of the new Pfaffendorfer Bridge, one of the main traffic arteries in Koblenz, began in 2023 and is expected to take around five years. The bridge is 311 meters long and costs approximately 181 million euros.

**Temporary walkway over river opened allowing works to begin on 800-year-old bridge**
A temporary walkway over the River Wharfe has opened, allowing for works to begin on the 800-year-old Otley Bridge. The Otley temporary footbridge was set up in March and the first section was craned into place in April. The next phase of works involves closing the bridge for two nights between May 27 and 29, from 8pm to 5am, to install concrete barriers and white lining. Leeds City Council said, 'while some disturbance and inconvenience are inevitable, the council will do its best to minimise disruption.' Councillor Jonathan Pryor stated, 'I am delighted to see good progress is being made. This continues to be a complex and challenging project, so achieving this milestone to maintain pedestrian access across the river, marks significant success so far.' The works are expected to be completed in the autumn.

**River Avenue Bridge to close for vehicle traffic starting July**
The River Avenue Bridge in Cochrane will close to regular vehicle traffic in July 2025, as part of a broader infrastructure update. The bridge will be converted into a dedicated pedestrian and active transportation corridor. According to Drew Hyndman, Executive Director of Development and Infrastructure Services, the main motivation for this change was to ensure reliable emergency access to properties south of the river. The update will also create a safer space for pedestrians and cyclists, reduce wear and tear on the bridge, and support future community uses. While vehicle access will be restricted, the bridge will remain open to pedestrians, cyclists, and emergency vehicles through a secure gate system.

**UK Declares Drought in Northwest England Amid Fears of Water Shortages**
The UK's Environment Agency has officially declared that northwest England has entered a drought state. The agency stated that the region entered a drought state on May 21 due to a decrease in water levels in reservoirs and rivers. According to the BBC, the region experienced its third-lowest rainfall between February and April on record since 1871, while England as a whole experienced its driest period in those three months since 1929. Despite recent rainfall, water levels remain low. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said, 'We officially entered a drought state in northwest England on May 21 and April due to a decrease in water levels in reservoirs and rivers... Despite the recent rainfall, water levels remain low, and we urge people to be aware of the effects of drought as we enter the summer season.' He added, 'With continued periods of instability and rainfall in the coming weeks, we will continue to closely monitor the situation and implement our drought plan for northwest England.' As of the end of April, England's reservoirs were at 84% capacity, lower than the same period last year during the 2022 drought. The Environment Agency warned of a 'moderate' risk of drought in England this summer if rainfall does not continue. The regulatory body stated that there are currently no plans to ban water sprinklers, but warned that water companies may be forced to implement measures including restrictions in the coming months. The UK government has warned that water supplies in the UK are at risk, with initial data from the Met Office showing that the UK has experienced its sunniest spring since records began in 1910.

**Tyumen Region Stands Firm Against 2025 Flood**
The Tyumen region has demonstrated a high level of preparedness for the flood of 2025. According to Governor Alexander Moor, 'We stood firm because we were prepared.' Despite the flood causing damage to some roads and bridges, the consequences are expected and can be rectified. Drones played a key role in the fight against the flood, conducting daily inspections of high-risk areas from April, helping to quickly build defensive structures and control water levels. The peak of the flood on the Isim River passed on May 26, and now 'the big water' is gradually receding. Governor Moor personally thanked the drone operators and rescuers for their smooth work, which allowed for the minimization of damage and proved that the system of protection of the Tyumen region from 'big water' works effectively.

**Government intervenes over new reservoirs amid water supply fears**
The UK government has intervened in the planning of two major reservoir projects in East Anglia and Lincolnshire to address growing concerns over the country's water supply. Environment Secretary Steve Reed has designated the projects as 'nationally significant,' allowing central government to take control and expedite their construction. The reservoirs, which will provide water for over 750,000 homes, are expected to be completed by 2036 and 2040. Water Minister Emma Hardy said, 'We are intervening in the national interest and slashing red tape to make the planning process faster to unblock nine new reservoirs.' Without new reservoirs, population growth, aging infrastructure, and climate change could cause drinking water demand to exceed supply by the mid-2030s. Water companies across England have committed to bringing nine new reservoirs online by 2050, which will supply an additional 670 million litres of water per day.

**Mumbai News: Water Levels At 7 Lakes Reach 15% As Monsoon Arrives Early; BMC Assures No Immediate Cuts**
The monsoon has arrived in Mumbai, but it has not yet brought substantial rainfall to the city's key lakes. As of now, the combined water stock in the seven lakes stands at 15% of their total capacity, slightly higher than the corresponding period in the past two years. A senior civic official said, 'While recent years have seen delayed monsoons with heavy rainfall often commencing only by mid-July, this year's monsoon arrived earlier than usual and is forecasted to be above normal.' With current water reserves and additional state-approved reserve stock sufficient to last until July, there is no immediate need to impose water cuts. The BMC has secured state approval to draw 1.81 lakh million litres from Upper Vaitarna and Bhatsa lakes as a contingency. Last year, a 5% water cut was implemented from June 5, 2024, due to sharp water level drops in May.

**Water levels on the Youghiogheny River Lake are coming back and boating season is open**
The water levels at the Youghiogheny River Lake in Somerset and Fayette Counties have risen significantly since November 2024, when drought caused the water levels to drop so low that the Great Crossings Bridge from 1818 was visible. As of March 13, 2025, the water levels have returned to normal, and the boat launch operated by the Army Corps of Engineers has been unlocked for the season. According to Ray Jakomas, a long-time resident of the area, the current water level is 200 feet, and it needs to rise to 375 feet to reach summer pool. The Army Corps of Engineers stated that the current water level is 1,425 feet above sea level, which is 14 feet lower than the summer level. However, they assured that watercraft will not have an issue if they put into the lake in the next few weeks. Boating season is officially open, and the US Army Corps of Engineers recommends having fun and wearing a life jacket while on the water.
