**RJD Questions PM Modi's Silence on Nitish Kumar as CM Face**
The RJD has questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not announce Nitish Kumar as the Chief Minister face during his two-day visit to Bihar. RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said, 'JDU had high hopes from PM Modi's visit, they thought he would announce Nitish Kumar as the NDA's Chief Minister face and he would become the CM after the government is formed, but PM Modi did not make any announcement.' The RJD claims that BJP will use Nitish Kumar's face to win votes, but after the government is formed, they will sideline him and make their own CM. JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar retaliated by saying, '2025-2030, Nitish will be everywhere, wherever he looks, power will follow.' JD(U) also claimed that Rahul Gandhi has visited Bihar five times but has never announced Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face.

**From Wayanad Tragedy To Modi's Green Vision: BJP Leader's Book Carries Warning And Hope**
BJP Spokesperson Tuhin Sinha and Dr Kaviraj Singh have released a book, 'Climate Action India', which highlights the rapidly changing climate dynamics globally and offers hope for a future that addresses air pollution, transitions to renewable energy, and sets ambitious goals like achieving Net Zero. The book uses the Wayanad landslide as an example, which claimed 254 lives, and highlights the significant role of air pollution in India, with 50% of lung cancer patients having never smoked. Sinha and Singh aim to break free from past mistakes and position Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a key figure in shaping India's climate agenda since 2014. The book credits Modi with launching India's Panchamrit strategy, which includes five promises: achieving 500 GW non-fossil energy capacity by 2030, sourcing 50% of energy from renewables, reducing projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes, lowering emission intensity by 45%, and reaching Net Zero emissions by 2070. Sinha predicts that Delhi will see far less air pollution this year, attributing this to the BJP's new government in Delhi, which he believes will invest in technology to end stubble burning.

Union Minister Piyush Goyal has assured Indian companies that the US tariffs will not adversely affect India, calling it a 'golden opportunity' to expand business. He emphasized that India and the US complement each other, rather than competing, and that the two countries have a relationship of trusted partners.
