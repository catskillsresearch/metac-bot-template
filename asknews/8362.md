**Xi Jinping could save America with a simple ad | Notice**
Matt Robison, a writer and former member of Congress, suggests that Xi Jinping could save America by announcing that China will be the first nation to win a human on Mars within the next ten years. This would spark a national response and a new space race, motivating American industry and the public to invest in space exploration. According to Robison, this would be a way to encourage the creation of new fortunes and to face an existential threat, rather than entering a real war. He believes that this kind of kick is exactly what America needs, what China needs, and what the world needs in 2025. Robison's opinion piece was published in Newsweek and is based on the idea that a powerful civilization can have long persistence, even after it has broken down. He references the example of the Roman Empire and suggests that America can learn from its history.

**US-China rivalry requires Indonesia to review defense posture - Academia - The Jakarta Post**
The US-China rivalry is reshaping the global order, with significant ramifications for Indonesia. As Hans Morgenthau said, 'International politics, like all politics, is a struggle for power.' The economic front of this rivalry, which began in 2025 with a 10% tariff imposed by the US on imported goods, has ignited a tit-for-tat tariff war, impacting global supply chains and economies worldwide, including Indonesia's. The military aspect of this rivalry has also presented a new and alarming dimension, as seen during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, where Pakistan's military, equipped with Chinese-made weaponry, could match India's more expensive Western and Russian platforms in a three-day war.

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**US-China Trade War: Who Will Be the Dominant Power?**
The trade war between the US and China has raised questions about who will be the dominant power in the future. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, but China has retaliated with its own tariffs. The situation has led to a decline in trade between the two countries, with the US experiencing a trade deficit of $700 billion in 2025. In contrast, China has a trade surplus of $700 billion, with a focus on exporting electronics and other goods. The US has a large national debt of $35 trillion, while China's debt is $15 trillion, but its total debt is 300% of its GDP. According to the IMF, China is expected to become the largest contributor to global growth in the next five years, with a 23% share. The US is still expected to be a major contributor, but its share is expected to decline. The two countries have different economic systems, with the US relying heavily on services, while China relies on industry. The US has a strong military, with over 6,100 tanks and 40,000 armored vehicles, while China has a large military with over 3.3 million soldiers and 3,260 aircraft. The US has a strong navy, with 490 ships, including 11 aircraft carriers, while China has a large navy with 777 ships. The US has a strong defense budget, with $740 billion in 2025, while China's defense budget is $178 billion. According to a report by the Telegraph, China has surpassed the US in terms of military strength, with over 1 million soldiers and a larger navy. The US is concerned about China's rapid military modernization, including its nuclear capabilities. The trade war between the US and China is not just about tariffs, but also about the future of the global economy and the balance of power between the two countries.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had stated that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is currently on track to reach defence spending levels of 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is optimistic about the progress of the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine deal.

**China's 'Made in China 2035' Plan: A Response to US Pressure or a Desperate Attempt to Revive Economy?**
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has announced its plan to prioritize manufacturing, dubbed 'Made in China 2035', in response to pressure from the US. However, experts question whether this shift will be enough to address the country's deep-seated economic issues, including inflation, overcapacity, and extreme imbalance. The CCP's plan is seen as a response to the US's efforts to promote American re-industrialization, led by President Trump's global tariffs. The tariffs have been a key factor in the US-China trade war, with the US seeking to block China's practice of 'dumping' goods on the global market. The CCP's financial system is also facing risks, with six major state-owned banks experiencing declining profits and rising non-performing loans. Some experts warn that China may enter a period of negative interest rates, which could have significant implications for the economy.

**China Seeks to 'Dominate' Asia, Says US Pentagon Chief**
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that 'the threat posed by China is real and may be imminent' and added that 'it has demonstrated a desire to alter the status quo' in the region. Hegseth, the head of the Pentagon, warned on Saturday (May 31, 2025) that China is 'clearly and credibly preparing the potential use of military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.' Beijing 'wants to dominate and control' Asia, Hegseth said at the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, the most important security forum in Asia. 'The threat posed by China is real and may be imminent,' he added. Hegseth assured that his country 'does not seek a conflict with communist China, but will not be pushed out of this critical region of the Indo-Pacific.' 'China has demonstrated a desire to alter the status quo' in the region, Hegseth said, adding that 'we cannot look the other way and ignore it. It's a wake-up call and urgent,' he added, referring to Beijing's operations in the South China Sea and in Taiwan, an island governed by a government that does not rule out invading. Hegseth emphasized that 'China harasses Taiwan every day. It's public,' regarding its supposed intention to invade the island in 2027. When presenting his strategy to his allies in the region, he made a reference to the absence of the Chinese Defense Minister, Dong Jun, an unusual decision by Beijing. 'In fact, we are here this morning, and someone is not,' he highlighted, without directly referring to his Chinese counterpart.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**The Rare Earth Wars**
China's dominance in the rare earth industry is coming to an end, with new mining frontiers opening up in Greenland, Brazil, Tanzania, and Australia. According to a study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's share of the global rare-earth supply will plummet to 28% by 2035. This is a relief, but also a concern, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has just a few more years to hold the world to ransom over rare earths. The CCP has mastered and monopolized the rare-earth industry, creating a potent trade weapon for itself. However, the US Department of Defense wants a sustainable, mine-to-magnet supply chain capable of supporting all US defense requirements by 2027. The US is also preparing for a potential conflict with China over Taiwan, with evacuation drills planned for Okinawa and a new 'war-fighting headquarters' being created in Japan. The Pentagon is fully focused on Taiwan, and ready to sacrifice other objectives in the process. Decoupling from China in strategic areas like the rare-earth industry has never been so urgent, and we have left it perilously late.

**China, the war-monger - The Singapore Post**
China has rejected a proposal from US President Donald Trump to cut the defense budget by 50%, which would have reduced the chance of a global war and spared funds for development. Instead, China has increased its defense budget to a record high of $249 billion, a 7.2% increase over the previous year. This move has triggered an arms race, with the US and its allies stepping up their defense efforts to combat the threat. The US has announced plans to develop a next-generation fighter jet, the NGAD, which will be way ahead of any other fighter aircraft of the current generation. China has been modernizing its navy and air force, with plans to possess six aircraft carriers by 2035. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is on the rise, and nations facing the Chinese threat are not sitting idle, increasing their defense budgets and developing advanced arms and weapon platforms. Posterity will brand China as the war-monger, having triggered an arms race through its aggressive moves.

**China Takes First Losses in Trade War with US**
China has taken its first losses in the trade war with the US, as the Chinese government has been forced to devalue its national currency, the yuan. This move comes in response to the new trade restrictions imposed by the US, which include tariffs of up to 104% on Chinese imports. The US market is a key market for China's economy, with exports to the US reaching nearly $3.6 trillion in 2024 and imports totaling $2.69 trillion, resulting in a trade surplus of around $1 trillion. The application of retaliatory measures in the form of tariffs is unlikely to provide significant support to the Chinese economy, as redirecting to alternative markets takes time. In the current circumstances, devaluation of the yuan appears to be the most effective tool. On April 8, 2025, the People's Bank of China set the yuan's exchange rate at 7.2038 per dollar, the lowest level since September 2023. Beijing is attempting to mitigate the impact of tariffs and increase the competitiveness of Chinese products on the global market by reducing the prices of Chinese goods in dollar terms, making them more attractive to consumers. China has resorted to this practice before, as noted by Becky Lu, a macroeconomic strategy specialist at Standard Chartered Bank, who stated that China uses the flexibility of the currency exchange rate to alleviate pressure on the economy in the face of increased tariffs. For ordinary Chinese citizens, this means a decrease in the purchasing power of the yuan and a need to increase production volumes. As a result, the well-being of the average Chinese citizen may decrease slightly. However, this trade war will not be without consequences for the US economy either. Economists predict an increase in inflation, leading to higher prices for American consumers. The outcome of this conflict is still unclear, and we can only wait and see how events unfold. Previously, experts evaluated China's response to the trade war initiated by Trump.

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**
According to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.

**Lin Yifu: China's Economy Will Surpass the US by 2030**
Lin Yifu, a Taiwanese-born Chinese economist, spoke at the 'Taiwanese Enterprises Association Great Lecture Hall' in Beijing, saying that it's difficult to say whether the US will benefit more than China in the trade war, as the US is an extremely practical country that will 'follow you and live in peace' when it can't 'strangle' you. He believes that China has a strong belief in its own abilities and will 'ride the wind and break through the waves' as long as it does its job well. According to Lin, China's economy will surpass the US by 2030, and its per capita GDP will reach 50% or even higher than the US by 2049, assuming no external influences such as trade wars. He also stated that the US is not only targeting China, but also other countries like Canada and Mexico. Lin believes that China's internal market and supply chain advantages will allow it to thrive in this challenging environment and even widen the gap with other countries. He also emphasized that China's goal of becoming a modernized strong nation and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation by 2049 is 'inevitable' and that Taiwan will not be left behind.

**China's War Preparations: A Threat to Global Security**
China is preparing for a large-scale war, including the possibility of using nuclear warheads, according to Colonel Philip Ingram, a retired British Army officer. China is building a new military command center near Beijing, which is ten times larger than the Pentagon, and is increasing its military presence in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Ingram stated that China is preparing its military, increasing its armed forces, and building up its naval and air forces. China is also stockpiling food, oil, gas, precious minerals, iron, and steel, in preparation for a potential conflict. Ingram emphasized that China is preparing for war, without any 'ifs' or 'buts'. He warned that a conflict between China and the US would have a global impact, and that the world would be at risk of a nuclear war. China is increasing its nuclear arsenal, with 100 new warheads added in 2024, and potentially over 1,000 by 2030. The US is reviewing its nuclear policy towards China in response. 'China is preparing for war, full stop, without any 'ifs' or 'buts', said Ingram. 'This is a very dangerous game for China, as it would lead to a mutually assured destruction, which has prevented nuclear war since 1945.'
