**Iran's Supreme Leader Seeks Successor Amid Rising Tensions**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has appointed a three-member committee to find his successor, amid rising tensions with Israel and the US. The committee has accelerated its efforts to identify a new leader, with two top contenders emerging: Khamenei's 56-year-old son Mojtaba and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of the Islamic Revolution's founder. Mojtaba is seen as a strong contender due to his close ties to his father's policies, but his hardline stance on opposition and foreign enemies may be a liability in the current crisis. Hassan, on the other hand, is viewed as a more moderate candidate who could potentially be more acceptable to the Iranian people. However, all options are still on the table, and the final decision rests with Khamenei himself.

**Israel Threatens Khamenei: Will He Back Down?**
Ayatollah Khamenei is being threatened by Israel, but he has shown no signs of backing down. In a public message of support to the Supreme Leader last Saturday, before the US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Khamenei said, 'I once again humbly express that this small and insignificant servant of the Iranian people is ready to be present with pride on any front or scene that he deems necessary.' Meanwhile, Ebrahim Raisi, also known as Khamenei's 'small and insignificant servant', has emerged as a potential candidate for the Supreme Leader position, as he is seen as a more moderate option compared to Khamenei. However, according to sources, Khamenei is still committed to his father's hardline policies and has not yet made any decisions about the candidates, and it is still unclear who will be the final choice.

**Iran's Supreme Leader Forms Committee to Find Successor Amid Assassination Threat**
A committee formed by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to find his successor has accelerated its work amid the threat of his assassination by Israel, according to Reuters sources. The 86-year-old Khamenei has been receiving information about the negotiations, according to Iranian sources, who wished to remain anonymous. He has gone into hiding with his family and is under the protection of the Velayat-e Amr Revolutionary Guard Corps. In the event of his assassination, the Iranian regime will immediately begin searching for his successor to 'demonstrate stability and continuity.' The sources acknowledge that predicting the future political trajectory of Iran is 'difficult.' The two main candidates for Khamenei's successor are his 56-year-old son Mojtaba and 52-year-old Hassan Khamenei, the grandson of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Mojtaba is a strict follower of his father's hardline policy, while Hassan is a close ally of the 'reformist' party, which advocates for easing social and political restrictions. However, Hassan's origin and reputation among high-ranking clerics and security officials make him a more viable candidate. According to Reuters sources, Hassan became a serious contender for the post of Ayatollah in June 2025, amid the military conflict with Israel and the US, as he could play a more conciliatory role than Mojtaba.

**Iran's Supreme Leader Hides in Bunker as US Attack Looms**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is reportedly hiding in a bunker and avoiding electronic communication after the US attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. He has named three high-ranking mullahs as potential successors if he is killed. The US has warned that they know where Khamenei is, but he is not yet a target. The question now is how Iran will respond to the US attack. The country's foreign minister has issued a threatening statement, but it is ultimately up to Khamenei to decide. He has focused on blaming Israel for the attack, rather than the US, in his first statement on the issue. Iran is under pressure to respond to the US attack, but it is not in their interest to engage in a large-scale war with the US. As the country's leader, Khamenei has the power to decide the course of action. He is also 86 years old and aware that he may not have many years left. The US has offered a possible way out of the crisis, suggesting that Iran accept a new agreement and commit to not enriching uranium on its own. This would be a difficult pill for Khamenei to swallow, but it could lead to the lifting of sanctions and a strengthening of Iran's economy. However, it is unclear whether Khamenei will accept this offer, and the situation remains volatile.

**Khamenei's Silence Broken: A Message of Retaliation, but Doubts Remain**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has broken his silence after the US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, publishing a message on X (formerly Twitter) accompanied by an image of a skull with a Star of David in the background. The message reads, 'We will respond to Israel,' without explicitly mentioning the US attacks. However, the message has not dispelled doubts about Khamenei's future as the regime's leader. According to the New York Times, Khamenei fears that his fate may be sealed and has selected a group of individuals to take on military roles, should the need arise, and has nominated three clerical officials for his succession. The US newspaper also reports that Khamenei has cut off electronic communications and is only in contact with his commanders through a 'secure channel.' This has hindered the ability of key regime officials to communicate with the Supreme Leader, including during a recent meeting between the US and Iran mediated by Turkey. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, were unable to reach Khamenei, according to Axios. The situation has also been described by former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, former parliament speaker Ali Larijani, and former chief justice Sadegh Larijani. Khamenei's fear of being tracked by Israeli agents, who have established a presence in Iran, has led him to take extreme measures to protect himself, including being protected by a top-secret elite unit. Tel Aviv has reportedly prepared various scenarios for neutralizing the Supreme Leader. US President Donald Trump has also fueled Khamenei's fears by suggesting a regime change, contradicting his previous statement. Khamenei is now at a critical juncture for the survival of the theocratic regime, with supporters demanding a strong response to the US attacks. Iran may consider various options, including blocking the Strait of Hormuz, attacking US bases in the Middle East, or activating sleeper cells in the US.

**Iran's Supreme Leader Appoints Three Successors in Case of His Death**
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has appointed three high-ranking clerics to succeed him in the event of his death, according to sources familiar with emergency plans. Khamenei, 86, has been hiding in an underground bunker since Israel's surprise attacks began, and has stopped using electronic devices to avoid detection. Sources told The New York Times that Khamenei has appointed the three clerics to the Expediency Council, and has advised them to be quickly selected 'to ensure a regular transition' in the event of his death. The Times did not name the candidates. However, the paper described this move as 'unprecedented' due to the typically long and secretive process of selecting a leader. Khamenei's son, Mojtaba Khamenei, was not among the three candidates. The late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in 2024, was one of the leading candidates. The Iranian Intelligence Ministry has ordered the suspension of phone and internet usage, and has asked leaders to remain underground. The public has been asked not to take photos of targeted areas and to report suspicious activity. A recording by the Iranian Parliament Speaker's advisor said that 'all top leaders were assassinated within an hour,' highlighting a 'big security and intelligence gap' that allowed drones and missile parts to be smuggled into Iran. Khamenei's succession is a hot topic in Iranian media, and this issue often comes to the forefront during crisis periods in Iran. The NYT reported in September 2022 that Khamenei had cancelled all meetings and public appearances after falling seriously ill, and had undergone surgery for a bowel obstruction. A source told the paper that Khamenei was being monitored by a team of doctors 24/7 at a clinic set up in the compound where his home and office are located. 'The leader's condition was critical last week, but he has recovered and is now resting, being monitored by doctors 24/7,' the source said. A day after the publication of the report, Khamenei delivered a long speech to the public, showing no signs of illness. Israel warned on Thursday that Khamenei's survival would be 'unacceptable,' following a barrage of rockets that hit a hospital in the south of the country and Tel Aviv suburbs, killing dozens. Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz said: 'A regime like this is very dangerous; its ideology is aimed at destroying Israel, and it uses all its resources to achieve this goal. Such a person's survival is unacceptable.' Speculation has grown that Israel's real target is not just Iran's nuclear and ballistic capabilities, but also to weaken the regime and remove Khamenei from power. According to Reuters, Israel's intense airstrikes are aimed not only at destroying Iran's nuclear centrifuges and missile capabilities, but also at sapping the foundations of Khamenei's rule and pushing him to the brink of collapse.

**Iran's Supreme Leader: We Will Not Accept Any Aggression**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, stated that 'Iran has not attacked anyone and will not accept any aggression, no matter what, as this is the logic of our people.' According to Iranian media, Khamenei made this statement in response to the recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East. Many Iranians gathered in the capital city of Tehran to express their joy over the US military strike on a US base in Qatar. The US military intervention, aimed at helping Israel in its war against the Islamic Republic, has been widely condemned by all parties involved. The Qatari and US officials reported that there were no casualties so far as a result of the strike, which was a response to the US attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend.

**CLOCK IS TICKING: Regime Plots Next Supreme Leader in Secret as Khamenei Likely Faces His Final DaysBunker**
Iran's leadership is accelerating its plans to name a successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, amid rising fears for his safety due to military threats from Israel and the United States. Two main candidates have emerged: Mojtaba Khamenei, the Supreme Leader's son, and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of the Islamic Republic's founder. The regime is divided between preserving ideological purity and selecting a leader who might defuse growing domestic unrest and international pressure. According to Hossein Rassam, a London-based political analyst, 'This is a moment of reckoning. Whether the Islamic Republic survives or not, it will be a very different one.' Whoever is chosen may not wield the same uncontested authority as Khamenei, and some insiders speculate that a weaker, less visible cleric might be installed as a puppet figure under Revolutionary Guards control.

**Is Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei being replaced? Reports claim possibility being considered  - BusinessToday**
Following recent US and Israeli airstrikes, there are reports that high-ranking Iranian officials are considering removing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei due to his age and declining health. 'Everybody knows Khamenei's days are numbered,' one official said. A coalition of officials is exploring the possibility of replacing the 86-year-old supreme leader, with Mojtaba Khamenei, the Supreme Leader's son, and Hassan Khomeini, grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, emerging as frontrunners. The fallout from the strikes has shifted the calculus, with some officials arguing it has made removing Khamenei more urgent, while others warn the upheaval could reinforce his hold. Khamenei has stopped all electronic messaging and is communicating solely through a trusted aide, amid fears that Israeli intelligence may have breached Iran's security structure.

Iranian opposition leaders Reza Pahlavi and Maryam Rajavi have called for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down, following a week of war between Iran and Israel. Pahlavi said, 'the only sure way to achieve peace is for this regime to now end', while Rajavi stated, 'Now Khamenei must go' and 'No to appeasement, no to war and yes to regime change'. Narges Mohammadi, a 2023 Nobel Peace Prize winner, also called for Khamenei's resignation, saying 'For the sake of the Iranian people, respond by stepping down'. Mohammadi also urged both sides to accept an 'immediate ceasefire' and condemned the 'devastating and ruthless war'.

**Khamenei Excludes Son from Succession List Amid Escalating Conflict**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has excluded his son Mojtaba Khamenei from the list of potential successors, according to three informed Iranian sources. This move comes as Iran faces unprecedented military escalation against it. Khamenei (86 years old) has taken measures to prevent potential assassination attempts, including avoiding electronic communication and passing orders through a trusted personal assistant. He has also moved to a secret bunker and activated a series of alternative leadership protocols. In a rare move, Khamenei has named three senior clerics as potential successors, indicating that the Expediency Council will appoint one of them immediately to prevent a power vacuum during the war. This development comes as Iran faces its most intense military attack since the war with Iraq in the 1980s. Khamenei sees the possibility of his assassination as a 'martyrdom' in the context of the major confrontation with the US and Israel. The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence has ordered comprehensive emergency measures, including banning senior officials from using phones or computers and urging them to stay in underground facilities. The government has also imposed strict restrictions on the internet and international communications, describing it as 'efforts to thwart spy and sabotage networks.' Since the escalation began, Khamenei has retreated from public appearances, appearing only twice through video recordings from behind a screen, addressing the people in a mobilizing and challenging tone, vowing that 'Iran will not surrender in this imposed war.' This development has shed light on the file of Khamenei's succession, which has been kept secret for years. With Mojtaba Khamenei's formal exclusion from the list of potential successors, the battle for the Supreme Leader's succession has entered a critical phase amidst an open war and growing concern for the future of the regime.

Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, stated on Wednesday that his country 'will never surrender' and warned the United States of 'irreparable damage' in case of intervention in the conflict between Iran and Israel. Khamenei's statement was in response to US President Donald Trump's threats, who called on Iran to 'capitulate without conditions' and claimed that the US could kill the Supreme Leader. Iran and Israel continued to exchange missile strikes, with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reporting that Israel destroyed two buildings in Karaj, near Tehran, where 'components of centrifuges were being manufactured.' Israel claimed to have evidence that Iran was approaching the 'point of no return' towards a nuclear bomb, and launched a surprise attack on June 13, targeting hundreds of military and nuclear sites, killing high-ranking officials and nuclear scientists.

Khamenei had previously responded to US President Donald Trump's threat to assassinate him, stating that 'the battle with Israel has begun' and 'I have returned to Khaybar with my Zulfiqar' (referring to the sword of Imam Ali and the fortress of Khaybar, which was inhabited by Jews during the time of the Prophet Muhammad). In a recent post on the X platform, Khamenei added that 'we must deal with the Zionist entity with strength, and we will never compromise with the Zionists.'

**Iran's Supreme Leader to Address the Nation Amid Escalating Conflict**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will address the nation soon, according to his press service. The address will be published in the form of a video message. Meanwhile, US officials believe that the next 48 hours will be crucial in the conflict with Iran, hinting at the possibility of military action if a diplomatic solution is not reached. US President Donald Trump has demanded that Iran's leadership surrender in the military confrontation with Israel, stating that his 'patience is wearing thin.' Trump also claimed that the US knows where Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is hiding, calling him a 'soft target.' However, it was previously reported that Trump had vetoed a plan by the Israeli government to assassinate Khamenei, and expressed confidence in the US's ability to act as a mediator in the conflict between Iran and Israel.

**Khamenei: US-Iran Talks Will Not Yield Results**
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei stated that the indirect negotiations with the US have not yielded any results and that they are opposed to direct dialogue. He also emphasized that Iran does not need anyone's permission for its uranium enrichment activities. Khamenei made these comments during a ceremony to commemorate the 19th of May 2024 helicopter crash that killed former President Ibrahim Raisi and his entourage. He criticized the US for its insistence on direct negotiations, calling it a 'threat and a trick' to get Iran to the negotiating table. Khamenei also rejected the US demands to stop uranium enrichment, saying that it is Iran's right and that they will not account to anyone for it. The US has been pushing for a complete halt to enrichment activities, but Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araki responded by saying that enrichment will continue, regardless of any agreement.
