**The moon: Why we want to go back**
NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, called Artemis Base Camp, and launch a new space station, Gateway, into the moon's orbit. A joint China-Russia project, the International Lunar Research Station, also plans to build a moon base by 2035. The moon's resources, including water, regolith, and helium-3, make it an attractive destination for future space missions. These resources can be used to sustain lunar bases, extract minerals from asteroids, and even provide fuel for nuclear fusion power. The moon's distance from Earth also makes it an ideal location for testing technologies and equipment for future Mars missions. According to Sara Pastor, ESA's Lunar and Gateway Program Manager, 'Humans have had a continued presence in space for the past 20 years aboard the International Space Station. But the ISS is only 250 miles away in low-Earth orbit, which is as little as four hours after launching from Earth. The moon is 250,000 miles away -- about three days' spaceflight -- and a far riskier journey for astronauts.' The first research on the moon aims to make that journey safer and easier, and to determine how human activity affects the lunar environment. 'ESA is developing instruments for radiation environment measurements, drilling and in-situ sample analysis, geophysics and lunar space weather,' Pastor said. The long-term goal of building surface and orbital moon bases is to serve as a staging post for more distant space travel, and to provide a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration, as Pastor noted, 'A colony on the moon will be extremely useful and a key training ground for Mars surface human exploration.'

**China and Russia Plan to Build a Nuclear Power Plant on the Moon by 2036**
China and Russia have signed an agreement to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2036. This project is part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), which aims to create a permanent base on the Moon's south pole. The nuclear power plant will be the heart of the system and will be built by robots without any human presence during construction, according to Yury Borisov, head of Roscosmos. 'The technology is almost ready,' he said. Meanwhile, the NASA's Artemis program is facing delays and budget issues, which may give China and Russia an advantage. China plans to send its first astronaut to the Moon by 2028 with the Chang'e-8 mission, followed by the construction of the lunar base between 2030 and 2035. The ILRS is becoming an international project, with 17 countries already signed up to participate, including Thailand, Venezuela, South Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan. The ultimate goal is to create a lunar infrastructure with habitable modules, rovers, pressurized vehicles, and continuous connection with Earth, which will also serve as a stepping stone for missions to Mars.

**Trump Withdraws Nomination of Isaacman as NASA Head, Deal Blow to Elon Musk**
A surprise turn of events has dealt a setback to Elon Musk. Trump had nominated a close friend of the tech billionaire, Isaacman, as the new head of NASA, but Trump has now withdrawn his nomination. Trump did not comment on the reasons for his decision, but it is believed that Isaacman's past donations to the Democratic Party and his close ties to Musk may have been factors. Musk is stepping down as a special envoy to the US government. This comes at a bad time for Musk, as the US government plans to cut NASA's budget by a quarter and reduce its staff by a third. The government also plans to redefine NASA's mission, with a focus on missions to the moon and Mars. This is important for SpaceX, which is developing the Starship rocket, capable of carrying up to 100 tons of cargo and potentially enabling a manned mission to Mars in a few years. Musk aims to send a million people to Mars by 2050. However, SpaceX has faced repeated setbacks in the development of the Starship, including a recent test flight that ended in a crash in the Indian Ocean. Musk remains undeterred, and has outlined an ambitious plan for a Mars mission, including a unmanned flight in 2026, a crewed flight in 2027, and the establishment of a Mars station in 2029, with the help of Optimus robots built by Tesla.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**Musk retains plan to fly Starship to Mars in 2026 despite setbacks**
Elon Musk has reaffirmed his plan to send Starship to Mars in 2026, despite recent setbacks in test flights. Musk stated that the success of this mission depends on Starship's ability to accomplish several challenging technical feats, including a post-launch refueling manoeuvre in earth orbit. He gave SpaceX a 50% chance of meeting the deadline. If not, the company will wait two years before trying again. Musk envisions launching 1,000 to 2,000 ships to Mars every two years to establish a self-sustaining human settlement. NASA plans to return humans to the moon aboard Starship in 2027, with the goal of launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Musk has previously aimed to send an uncrewed vehicle to Mars by 2018 and a crewed mission by 2024, but has since pushed back the timeline.

**Guest column: Budget cuts to NASA could hit the Gulf Coast hard. Here's why it matters.**
NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion crew-carrying spacecraft, built in Louisiana and Mississippi, are crucial for the US to remain at the forefront of space exploration. However, the administration's recent budget proposal threatens to terminate the SLS program after just three flights, which could have far-reaching consequences for the local economy and the nation's strategic and technological future. The cancellation of the SLS and Orion programs will bring economic benefits to a halt, including thousands of high-quality jobs and support for local businesses. From a broader perspective, SLS and Orion are essential for maintaining US leadership in space, as China plans to dominate in space with regular crewed moon missions by 2030. It would be a grave mistake to phase out the SLS and Orion well before a replacement system is ready, allowing rival nations to take the lead. The author urges members of Congress to continue to robustly fund the NASA budget and keep SLS and Orion powering America's future in space.

**US Government Proposes Ambitious Space Exploration Plan, Including Moon and Mars Missions**
The US government has released a budget proposal for 2026, which outlines the country's priorities in space exploration. The proposal calls for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to focus on sending humans to the Moon and Mars. According to the proposal, NASA will prioritize the development of a new, more cost-effective system for sending humans to the Moon, rather than relying on the current Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft. The proposal also allocates $1 billion for Mars-focused programs, although it does not specify what these programs will be. NASA's next director, Jared Isaacman, has stated that he wants to see Americans set foot on the Moon, but also believes that the agency should be able to pursue both the Moon and Mars missions simultaneously. Isaacman has also expressed skepticism about the current state of the SLS and Orion programs, which he believes are not sustainable. SpaceX's Elon Musk has announced plans to send an uncrewed mission to Mars in 2026, with a crewed mission following in 2029. However, the success of these missions is far from guaranteed, and NASA will face significant challenges in pursuing its ambitious plans for space exploration.

**China says it is on track to put boots on Moon by 2030 as Nasa's Artemis struggles with delay**
China's space agency announced the successful trial of its prototype Mengzhou next-generation reusable spacecraft and the Lanyue lunar surface lander, stating that their development is 'progressing smoothly'. The agency plans to test the safety and reliability of the Long March 10 rocket and Mengzhou spacecraft in subsequent months. According to Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), 'The Long March 10 and Mengzhou spacecraft are carrying out prototype development and testing as planned.' China aims to put boots on the Moon by 2030, while Nasa's Artemis III crewed mission to the lunar surface has been delayed to mid-2027 due to problems with the heat shield on its Orion spacecraft. Both missions are targeting a landing near the lunar south pole, which is thought to be rich in water-ice, a resource critical for establishing bases.

**China Advances Manned Mission to the Moon by 2030, Pressuring the US**
China continues to advance its manned mission to the Moon by 2030 without any setbacks, with large-scale tests of its main components: the Long March 10 rocket, the Mengzhou spacecraft, and the Lanyue lunar module, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). CMSA's deputy director, Lin Xiqiang, confirmed that the escape, propulsion, and control systems have been successfully evaluated on the ground, in preparation for the lunar landing expected before 2030. Meanwhile, the US is delaying its Artemis program: NASA announced that its human lunar landing mission is now projected for mid-2027. The main cause was a problem detected in the thermal shield of the Orion spacecraft during the re-entry of the Artemis I mission, which forced the postponement of the next phase of crewed flights. The Long March 10 rocket, with its three stages and large payload capacity, will be responsible for launching the Mengzhou spacecraft and the Lanyue lunar module into space. These systems have already completed propulsion tests, landing verification, and escape simulations under maximum dynamic stress conditions. Additionally, the CMSA confirmed tests of the lunar suit Wangyu and the Tansuo rover, both designed to operate in the lunar south pole, a priority area due to its possible water ice reserves. The current phase includes the integrated review of launch and lunar landing from the Jiuquan and Wenchang launch centers, as well as the development of the lunar remote sensing satellite, whose project has already been approved. These advances aim to consolidate a solid platform for establishing a permanent scientific base on the Moon, in collaboration with Russia and other countries. The lunar race between China and the US intensifies with similar objectives: sustained presence on the natural satellite and control of key resources. However, while Artemis accumulates delays, China maintains its goal for 2030. 'We will guarantee the success of all tests to establish a solid foundation,' Lin Xiqiang assured, referring to China's manned lunar mission. A key point is the cooperation between China and Pakistan, which includes the selection of two Pakistani astronauts for a future joint mission to the Tiangong space station. This alliance shows China's interest in projecting its space leadership in Asia and the rest of the world. Despite not having yet completed a manned mission to the Moon, its technical preparation and constant pace position it as a capable power to challenge NASA's lunar leadership.

**NovaMoon: A New Paradigm in Lunar Exploration**
The European Space Agency's (ESA) NovaMoon study proposes an advanced lunar PNT payload for deployment on the first Argonaut lander mission in 2031. NovaMoon will serve as a local differential, geodetic and timing station, enhancing the performance of Moonlight's PNT services and achieving sub-meter positioning accuracy across the lunar South Pole. The payload will include a set of geodetic instruments and on-board atomic clocks to establish precise lunar reference frames and time standards. NovaMoon's performance was evaluated for a lunar rover traversing the South Pole, achieving Kalman-filtered positioning solutions in a differential setup with a positioning accuracy consistently below 1 meter. The study highlights the potential of NovaMoon to support safer human and robotic missions, enable high-resolution lunar mapping, and improve operational logistics. Additionally, the payload will unlock numerous scientific research opportunities on the Moon, including the establishment of consolidated lunar geodetic and time reference frames.

**China's Ambitious Space Exploration Program: A New Era in Planetary Exploration?**
While the NASA is navigating potential budget cuts, China is unveiling an ambitious space exploration program, outlining a series of missions to be carried out in the coming decades. The 'Deep Space Exploration Laboratory', established three years ago by China to strengthen its approach to solar system exploration, has recently shared details on some of its most ambitious initiatives. These include the Tianwen-3 mission, scheduled for 2028, which aims to collect Martian soil and rock samples for return to Earth, and the subsequent Tianwen-4, in 2029, targeting Jupiter and its moon Callisto. China's plans do not stop here: a mission to Venus is planned for 2033 to recover samples of its atmosphere, followed in 2038 by the creation of an autonomous research station on Mars focused on using local resources. In 2039, a mission to Triton, Neptune's largest moon, is planned, with a subsurface explorer designed to study its internal ocean. In parallel to these robotic endeavors, China also plans to develop a large terrestrial habitat in 2030 to simulate long-duration human spaceflight, a step towards its crewed lunar program, aiming to land Chinese astronauts on the Moon by 2030. It is worth noting that, at present, only the first two missions (Tianwen-3 and Tianwen-4) have received formal approval from the Chinese central government. Some of the concepts presented appear particularly challenging from a technical standpoint, such as the exploration of Triton's ocean, whose ice crust has an unknown thickness, making it extremely complex to design a probe capable of penetrating it.

**China Advances Plan for Manned Mission to the Moon by 2030**
China continues to advance its plan for a manned mission to the Moon by 2030, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). The CMSA reported that key components of the project are progressing as planned, including the heavy-lift rocket 'Long March 10', the crewed spacecraft 'Mengzhou', the lunar landing module 'Lanyue', the lunar suit 'Wangyu', and the lunar rover 'Tansuo'. These components are currently in the preliminary prototype development stage, with design work meeting established deadlines. The construction of new infrastructure at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province has also begun, including systems for testing and launch, as well as ground equipment for mission tracking. The Chinese lunar exploration program includes two launches of the 'Long March 10' from Wenchang to place the 'Lanyue' module and the 'Mengzhou' spacecraft in lunar orbit, where they will dock and then descend to the lunar surface with a motor-assisted landing. Once on the lunar surface, the astronauts will use the 'Tansuo' rover to conduct scientific activities and collect samples. The mission will conclude with the astronauts returning to the 'Lanyue' module, which will then take them back to the 'Mengzhou' spacecraft in orbit, and finally back to Earth. The CMSA has selected its fourth generation of astronauts, who are currently training for lunar landing and exploration operations. The Chang'e 7 mission is scheduled to reach the lunar south pole in 2026 to search for water ice deposits, while the Chang'e 8 mission will explore possible uses of resources discovered by its predecessor and lay the groundwork for a manned mission before 2030.

**NASA's Dilemma: To the Moon or Directly to Mars?**
NASA is facing a dilemma under Trump's administration, with the possibility of dropping the moon mission and going straight to Mars. This comes as Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, is pushing for a direct Mars mission. NASA's former deputy director, Jim Free, who was a strong advocate for the Artemis program, has left the agency without explanation. The Artemis program aims to place humans on the moon, establish a permanent presence, and use the experience as a stepping stone for a manned mission to Mars. However, Trump is now considering dropping the moon mission and going directly to Mars, with SpaceX's Starship rocket playing a key role in the mission. Boeing has announced plans to cut up to 400 jobs from its Space Launch System (SLS) program, citing the program's high costs and limited success. Many experts believe that a manned mission to Mars is unlikely to happen before the end of the 2030s or early 2040s, but Elon Musk and SpaceX are more optimistic, aiming for a manned mission to Mars in the 2020s. NASA's current strategy documents state that the goal is to establish a sustainable human presence on Mars by the 2030s. Jim Free argued in October that the Artemis program should be continued, despite increased skepticism around Boeing's SLS rockets. 'If we leave the moon, I think we will fall apart and drive around, and others in the world will pass us,' Free said during a meeting of the American Astronautical Society. 'Leaving the moon would also let China stand alone in planting its flag on the moon's southern pole with a planned crewed mission in 2030,' notes space policy analyst Laura Forczyk.

**China's Lunar Mission: 'Wangyu' Spacesuit and 'Tansuo' Lander Take Shape**
China's space agency has revealed the names of its lunar suit and lander, which will be used for the country's mission to land on the Moon before 2030. The lunar suit, called 'Wangyu', which means 'looking towards the cosmos', and the lander, called 'Tansuo', which means 'exploring', are designed to carry two astronauts to the Moon's surface. According to Zhang Chongfeng, a spacecraft designer at the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), the lander has completed experiments in a simulated lunar surface test site and has undergone a significant amount of experimental work in a field test site. 'The lunar lander has entered the prototype stage and is currently undergoing detailed design and subsequent engineering testing,' Zhang said. The CMSA has also completed the construction of the Wenchang Space Launch Site on the island of Hainan, and the lander's production and testing facilities are operational. Zhang Wanxin, director of the space suit engineering office at the China Astronaut Research and Training Center, added that the agency has mastered key technologies such as lightweight and compact space suit manufacturing for lunar landing, as well as comprehensive protection against complex environments. China aims to land two astronauts on the Moon before 2030 and is making progress on the necessary hardware, including a crewed spacecraft, a lunar lander, and a new launch vehicle.

**A red moon: Will the next 'Sputnik Moment' be made in China?**
The United States is facing a new 'Sputnik Moment' as China is rapidly advancing its lunar program, with plans to land Chinese 'taikonauts' on the lunar surface before 2030. NASA's Artemis program is behind schedule, with a first planned landing mission, Artemis 3, now set for no earlier than mid-2027. China's lunar ambitions are driven by a focus on economic development and resource exploitation, with the moon's south polar region being a key target. The U.S. risks being caught flat-footed if it fails to follow through on its commitment to return humans to the moon by 2024, with potential consequences for global leadership and space governance. To avoid ceding ground to China, the U.S. government needs to streamline and simplify launch licensing, and clear the regulatory and bureaucratic underbrush to accelerate Artemis. 'We better watch out … It is not beyond the realm of possibility that they [China] say, 'Keep out, we're here, this is our territory,' cautions former NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. 'There is no reason to believe they will not be first to send a crewed mission to the lunar south pole,' writes Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's former head of science.
