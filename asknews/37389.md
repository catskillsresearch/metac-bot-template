**SpaceX Prepares for Ninth Starship Test Flight**
SpaceX is preparing to launch the Starship, a massive rocket that aims to take humans to the Moon and Mars, for its ninth test flight on May 27, 2025. The test will be broadcast live on the X social network and will be followed by ABC.es. This time, the Super Heavy stage, which has already flown in the seventh test, will be reused. The mission, called Starship Flight 9, is expected to last over an hour and will replicate the trajectory of its predecessor, Starship Flight 8. SpaceX aims to demonstrate the reusability of the Starship, which is a key step towards its ultimate goal of taking humans to the Moon and Mars. According to SpaceX, the problem with the previous flight was a hardware failure in one of the Raptor engines, which caused an involuntary ignition of the propellant. The company has conducted over 100 long-duration tests of the Raptor engine and has reinforced the affected areas with additional insulation. The FAA has confirmed that Starship is ready to fly again. The ultimate goal is to use this ship to take astronauts on the Artemis 3 mission to the Moon. SpaceX also plans to use Starship for at least three private space flights, two of which will carry the first space tourists orbiting the Earth. 'The learnings from this and subsequent flight tests will continue to make the entire Starship system more reliable as we approach complete and rapid reusability,' SpaceX said.

**SpaceX Prepares for 9th Starship Test Flight**
SpaceX is preparing for its 9th Starship test flight on May 27, 2025. The test will include a series of flight maneuvers, including the deployment of eight Starlink satellite dummies and re-entry tests into the Earth's atmosphere. The upper stage of the rocket will attempt to be caught and reused, a feat that was achieved for the first time in October 2024. However, the previous test flight in March 2025 ended in failure due to a malfunction of one of the Raptor engines in the upper stage, causing an unintended mixture of fuel and ignition. SpaceX has identified the cause of the problem and plans to optimize the engines to prevent it from happening again. The Super-Heavy Booster will not attempt to be caught this time, but will instead test a new re-entry angle, which could save fuel for future regular launches. The test will be live-streamed on SpaceX's X-page, starting 40 minutes before the scheduled start time.

**No! Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla is not in Covid-19 quarantine**
Rumors have been circulating on social media that Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla is in Covid-19 quarantine, but these claims are incorrect. Shukla and his crewmates entered a standard pre-launch quarantine, a routine protocol for all astronauts, ahead of the Axiom Mission-4 (Ax-4) to the International Space Station (ISS). This 'health stabilization' protocol is designed to ensure that astronauts are in peak health and free from infectious diseases that could jeopardize the mission or endanger the ISS crew. The quarantine typically lasts about 14 days before launch and includes enhanced hygiene, daily health checks, and limited contact with outsiders. The Ax-4 crew will remain in quarantine until their scheduled launch on June 8, 2025. 'The Ax-4 quarantine is a critical safety measure, not related to any specific illness like Covid-19,' said the Axiom Space update. 'This process ensures that astronauts do not carry colds, flu, or other contagious diseases into space, where the immune system can be weakened and infections can spread rapidly.'

**Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore Return to Earth After Prolonged Space Travel**
Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, two astronauts from NASA, are returning to Earth on March 18, 2025, after spending months in space. They will land in the ocean in a SpaceX Crew Capsule and will be taken out on a stretcher. This is a safety protocol to prevent them from suddenly being unable to walk due to the effects of prolonged space travel on their bodies. In space, the lack of gravity causes changes in the body, including a loss of balance and muscle mass. When they return to Earth, they will be taken out on a stretcher to help them adjust to the gravitational forces. According to experts, the lack of gravity weakens the balance system, causing problems such as dizziness, weakness, and space motion sickness. Although astronauts exercise to maintain muscle and bone strength, they still experience muscle and bone loss. Sunita Williams and Wilmore left Earth on June 5, 2024, and their stay on the ISS was supposed to be short-term. However, due to a helium leak and propulsion system failure in the Starliner, their return was delayed. In August 2024, NASA accepted the delay and announced that they would plan their return in early 2025 via a SpaceX mission. In September 2024, the Starliner returned to Earth without astronauts, freeing up the docking port for other spacecraft. Finally, NASA chose the SpaceX Dragon Crew Capsule to bring Sunita Williams back to Earth. The Dragon Capsule has launched 49 times since its creation and has made 44 trips to the ISS and 29 re-flights.
