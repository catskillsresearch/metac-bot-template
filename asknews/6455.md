**Egg packers prosecuted for switching best before dates**
The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) has prosecuted multiple egg packers for switching best before dates on eggs. Between January and March 2025, the prosecutions involved multiple offences under egg marketing regulations, including the unlawful repacking of eggs with altered or extended best before dates and breaches of required labelling standards. Aled Edwards, head of England field delivery, APHA, said, 'It's essential that consumers can trust the eggs they purchase are fresh, safe to eat, and clearly and accurately labelled.' The prosecutions resulted in several convictions, including Philip Hoyland of Summerley Top Farm, who was sentenced to 24 months' imprisonment, suspended for 24 months, and Holyfield Farm Fresh Eggs Ltd, which was fined £2,000 and awarded £200 for prosecution costs. The government has emphasized that every egg packaging centre must comply with all relevant legislation, including comprehensive environmental and animal welfare rules.

**Slovenia Introduces New Laws on Animal Protection and Agriculture**
The Slovenian government is planning to introduce a new law on animal protection, which will include mandatory microchipping of cats. The law is expected to come into effect on May 1, 2025. The current law on animal protection has been amended several times in recent years, with the latest changes aimed at improving the treatment of animals in shelters. However, some critics argue that the law does not go far enough in protecting animals. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food has proposed a new law on beekeeping, which would allow for the use of drones to monitor bee colonies. The proposal has sparked controversy among beekeepers, who are concerned about the impact of drones on their livelihoods. The Ministry has also proposed a new law on hunting and fishing, which would introduce stricter regulations on the use of certain hunting methods. The proposals are currently undergoing public consultation. Additionally, the Ministry has announced plans to introduce a new law on animal welfare, which would include stricter regulations on the treatment of animals in shelters and the use of animals in scientific research. The law would also introduce a new system for reporting animal cruelty. The Ministry has stated that the new law is aimed at improving animal welfare and reducing animal cruelty. However, some critics argue that the law does not go far enough in protecting animals. The Ministry has also announced plans to introduce a new law on agriculture, which would include stricter regulations on the use of pesticides and fertilizers. The proposals are currently undergoing public consultation.

**New EU Label for Smartphones: Detailed Information on Battery Life, Repairability, and Energy Efficiency**
Starting from June 20, 2025, all new electronic devices sold in the European Union will be required to display a label that provides detailed information on key parameters such as battery life, repairability, and energy efficiency. This new EU label is not just a simple sticker with service information, but a 'digital passport' that tells the complete story of the device being purchased. The system is inspired by the well-known energy labels of household appliances, but goes beyond with the goal of increasing maximum transparency in the market by providing useful parameters to evaluate and compare. The label will include 11 key parameters, such as battery life, repairability, and energy efficiency, as well as a QR code that allows access to more detailed information provided by the manufacturer. This new label will enable consumers to make more informed choices, prioritizing products that last longer, are easier to repair, and less prone to damage. This not only reduces long-term costs but also contributes to reducing electronic waste, a growing environmental problem. The increased transparency will also push manufacturers to improve the quality and sustainability of their products, promoting a more responsible and innovative market.

**European Countries Say No to Fur Business, Last Fur Farms to Close**
More European countries are saying no to the fur business, leading to the closure of the last remaining fur farms. According to a service published on Delfi.lt, as part of the international project Pulse, 'more and more European countries are choosing to ban fur farms, or the breeding and slaughter of animals solely for their fur'. Not only that, 'in some countries that have made this decision, the last fur farms are about to be closed'. Lithuania has banned fur farming, with the law coming into effect on January 1, 2024, and all fur farms will be closed by January 1, 2027. 'The law on the ban of fur farming in Lithuania entered into force on January 1, 2024, and from January 1, 2027, it will be prohibited to keep, breed, sell, or otherwise transfer animals solely for the purpose of obtaining their fur' - the service reports. Those who close their fur farms will receive compensation, with the Ministry of Agriculture stating that the Commission for the Environment has proposed a graduated indemnity principle. 'Those who closed their activities in 2024 may receive 3 euros per unit, in 2025 2 euros, and those who withdrew from the market in 2026 1 euro. In addition, 100% of the costs of demolition of the building, destruction of equipment, and severance pay for employees will be compensated by the agricultural company' - the service reports. The ban on fur farming in Lithuania was adopted thanks to the active involvement of environmental organizations and public bodies, such as 'Empty Cages' (Gabbie vuote), as well as residents of the country. In some cases, fur farms have been closed before the law came into effect due to the severity of animal welfare regulations.

**EU Downgrades Wolf Protection Status, Allowing for Easier Culling**
The European Union has downgraded the protection status of wolves from 'strictly protected' to 'protected', allowing for easier culling. This decision has been met with criticism from animal welfare organizations and some politicians. Sebastian Everding, a German politician, stated, 'The degradation of wolf protection ignores effective coexistence tools and risks turning nature protection into a political game, flattering fear rather than facts.' Ilaria Di Silvestre, spokesperson for the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), added, 'There are no data justifying a decrease in protection levels, but European institutions have chosen to ignore the science.' Despite the EU's decision, the wolf population in Europe has been increasing, reaching 20,300 individuals in 2023. Ursula von der Leyen previously warned of the 'real danger' posed by wolves to livestock in certain regions. However, Pascal Canfin, a centrist eurodeputy, emphasized that the decision does not grant a 'license to kill' but rather provides more flexibility for local derogations, with the wolf remaining a protected species.

**Parliamentary question | Answer for question E-001196/25 | E-001196/2025(ASW) | European Parliament**
The European Union's directive on animal protection regulates the use of animals for scientific purposes within the EU. However, it does not apply to activities conducted outside the EU. To address 'ethics dumping', the EU has implemented a rule in the Horizon 2020 regulation, which requires applicants to adhere to EU ethics standards, even for research conducted outside the EU. Applicants must sign a declaration stating that their activities would be acceptable in at least one EU Member State and undergo an Ethics Screening process, which may lead to further assessments and checks by ethics experts.

**Farmers Face Dilemma as Animal Welfare Standards and Emissions Reductions Clash**
Farmers in Germany are facing a dilemma: they must meet high animal welfare standards and reduce emissions, while also dealing with uncertainty over the new animal husbandry labeling law. Landowner Jürgen Dierauff is struggling to meet the new requirements, which include installing 'scheuerbalken' and raising the walls of the pens. The law, introduced by former Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir, aims to improve animal welfare, but has created confusion with the existing 'Haltungsformen-Label' which only had four stages. To avoid duplication, the 'Initiative Tierwohl' has updated its logo to match the new law's five stages. However, this has created new challenges for farmers like Dierauff, who must adapt to the changing criteria. Many farmers are hesitant to renovate their barns due to the high costs and uncertainty over the new regulations. The new federal government has promised to simplify the process and provide 1.5 billion euros in funding, but farmers remain skeptical. The big retailers, such as Aldi-Süd, are also playing a significant role in determining which farms will be supported, as they plan to only sell products from high-welfare farms by 2030. However, this may not be enough to ensure that farmers are fairly compensated for their efforts.

**Animal Welfare Associations Reveal 3 Dog Breeds to be Banned from Acquisition**
According to Dr. Mona Khalil, President of the Animal Welfare Associations Union, the executive regulation of Law No. 29 of 2023 on the regulation of possession of dangerous animals has not been officially announced, but based on discussions about the regulation, its main goal is to regulate the process of acquiring dangerous animals in society, including wild animals and some breeds of dogs that have been described as hazardous. Dr. Khalil stated, 'We, as animal welfare associations, have reservations about the classification of dangerous dogs, which initially included many breeds, but after discussions with the General Authority for Veterinary Services and specialists, the list was narrowed down to three breeds only.' She revealed that the three breeds will be included in the regulation, saying, 'The Brazilian Mastiff, a type of Argentinean Dogo, and two types of Mastiff.' When asked about the Husky, she replied, 'No.' Dr. Khalil emphasized that animal welfare associations do not consider any breed of dog to be inherently hazardous, stating, 'The danger comes from the wrong breeding practices, meaning I can turn a lion into a cat and a cat into a lion, and the issue is entirely dependent on training, but there is no dog by nature that is hazardous.' Regarding wild animals such as lions, she said, 'Yes, they will be banned from being acquired, and we, as animal welfare associations, have reservations about acquiring this type of animal even in zoos. Is it reasonable for humans to keep them in homes?' She continued, 'We have no problem with banning their acquisition, but what about those who have already acquired them? Will they have suitable places for them? We have reservations about keeping them in zoos, as their capabilities are not suitable for that, and we have strong reservations about it.'

**Koalitionsverhandlungen: Haltungskennzeichnung soll bleiben / 24.03.2025**
The current regulations for animal welfare labeling need to be fundamentally overhauled and made more practical. Staat and Economy must work together to ensure a consistent labeling system. Krüsken emphasized that having two parallel systems with different requirements makes little sense. However, a mandatory state labeling of animal welfare and origin should not be abolished. The Bund Ökologische Lebensmittelwirtschaft (BÖLW) also supports the state labeling and is calling on Union and SPD to further develop the five-stage animal welfare labeling. Peter Röhrig, the managing director of the Bio-Spitzenverband, stated, 'Consumers expect the transparent labeling of animal welfare to be extended to other meat products.' Currently, only half of the pig-keeping businesses have registered for the labeling, with significant differences between the states. It is unlikely that the labeling requirement for fresh pork will be implemented as planned on August 1, 2025. There are considerations to postpone the implementation date to January 1, 2026, to allow for necessary legislative adjustments. Additionally, there are discussions about ensuring a smooth implementation of the labeling for pork and its extension to take-away consumption before expanding it to other livestock species.

**Agriculture Minister Özdemir's Efforts to Improve Animal Welfare**
Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir has made some progress in improving animal welfare, despite the challenges posed by the current government coalition. The 'Förderung des Umbaus der Tierhaltung' program, which provides subsidies for farmers to upgrade their animal housing, has been implemented. However, only around 170 of the 15,000 pig farmers have applied for the subsidies, and only 100 applications have been approved. The program has a budget of 150 million euros, but it is unclear whether the next government will continue it. Additionally, a law requiring the labeling of animal welfare standards on unprocessed pork products will come into effect in August 2025. The labeling will indicate the level of animal welfare, with five categories ranging from 'Stall' to 'Bio'. This is intended to make it easier for consumers to choose more animal-friendly products and ultimately lead to better animal welfare. As Özdemir said, 'He has established a good approach to improving animal welfare conditions.'

**EU Commission Proposes Stricter Trade Rules for Agri-Food Sector**
The European Commission has proposed a plan to strengthen trade rules for the agri-food sector, including stricter standards for pesticides and animal welfare. The plan, set to be presented in 2025, aims to promote reciprocity of production standards and ensure that imported products meet EU norms. The Commission promises to prevent the reauthorization of banned pesticides and to prevent the production of prohibited substances for export. The plan also proposes the creation of a working group to strengthen import controls and the revision of animal welfare rules to ensure that imported products meet EU standards. Additionally, the Commission plans to extend mandatory labeling of origin to more agricultural and fishery products. The plan also recognizes the importance of the livestock sector in the EU's agriculture and proposes to develop policies that take into account the sector's climate footprint while highlighting its role in preserving the environment. Commissioner Christophe Hansen and Commissioner Olivér Várhelyi have recently announced a more stringent approach to production standards for imported food products, and EU Agriculture Ministers have joined the movement, urging the European executive to take action against imports containing banned pesticide residues. The plan also proposes to accelerate access to biopesticides and to examine new pesticide bans carefully if alternatives are not available in a reasonable timeframe and cost.

**EU to Strengthen Reciprocity in Production Standards on Food Trade**
The European Commission has proposed a plan to strengthen reciprocity in production standards, as requested by Italy, on food trade. The plan, set to be presented in 2025, aims to impose stricter rules on third countries when it comes to pesticides and animal welfare. According to a draft document, the Commission will pursue a stronger alignment of production standards applied to imported products, particularly on pesticides and animal welfare. The Commission promises to ensure that the most hazardous pesticides banned in the EU 'will not be admitted' through imports. It also promises to prevent banned substances from being produced within the EU for export elsewhere. Christophe Hansen, the EU's agriculture chief, and Olivier Várhelyi, the commissioner for animal health and welfare, have recently signaled a tougher approach to production standards for imported food. The ministers of agriculture in the EU have joined the push, urging the Commission to crack down on imports containing banned pesticide residues. The plan also proposes a 'dedicated task force' to strengthen controls on imports with increased checks, a measure long requested by the European Parliament. On animal welfare, the Vision also seeks to use a long-overdue review of the rules to ensure that imported products meet EU animal welfare standards. 'The targeted review of animal welfare legislation will be an opportunity to apply it in conformity with the WTO', reads the text. The document also suggests extending mandatory origin labeling to more agricultural and fish products.

**Better animal welfare brings benefit to all: Commissioner Varhelyi**
European Commissioner for Health and Animal Welfare Olivér Várhelyi emphasized the importance of modernizing animal welfare legislation, citing opportunities to improve welfare, respond to citizens' demands, and increase competitiveness. The event, 'From Dialogue to Vision to Action: What is needed for more sustainable and higher welfare animal farming in Europe', brought together stakeholders to discuss how the European Union can support farmers in transitioning away from intensive farming models. Reineke Hameleers, CEO of Eurogroup for Animals, called for the European Commission to deliver on its promises to phase out cages and publish legislation to address all other species. Philip Lymbery, Global CEO of Compassion in World Farming, highlighted the need for an ambitious EU Vision for Agriculture and Food that prioritizes the welfare of farmed animals and ensures farmers are financially supported. Key measures proposed by Eurogroup for Animals and Compassion in World Farming include a full revision of EU animal welfare legislation, post-2027 Common Agricultural Policy supporting farmers transitioning to higher welfare, and a multi-tiered EU-wide animal welfare labelling scheme.

**European Parliamentarians Push for Improved Animal Welfare Legislation**
Members of parliaments from Spain, Italy, Poland, Denmark, and the Netherlands are urging their governments to pressure the European Commission (EC) to prioritize the revision of animal welfare legislation. They are requesting a concrete timeline for the remaining proposals related to the Animal in Captivity, Sacrifice, and Labeling Regulations. The goal is to avoid further delays and pave the way for improved and harmonized legislation across the EU. The EC is expected to present its 2025 work program in the coming weeks, and animal protection organizations are asking for a concrete plan for the publication of pending proposals. This comes after Commissioner for Health and Animal Welfare, Olivér Várhelyi, promised that the first of these files would be released in 2026. The EC had initially proposed revising the outdated legislation in 2023, but failed to meet its commitment. Although the EC promised to respect the demands of 1.4 million citizens who called for the ban on cages, no timeline or details have been provided, and 300 million animals continue to be confined each year in the EU. Citizens are also waiting for the EC's response to their request to ban fur farms, which is expected in March 2026. FAADA and Eurogroup for Animals recall that this is the first legislative term with a Commissioner dedicated to animal welfare, and there is no excuse for further delays. Scientific evidence is available, as well as consensus that the current legislation does not meet its purpose: this legislative term can be the breakthrough that animal protection organizations and citizens have been waiting for.

**EU Challenges for 2025: Animal Diseases and Sustainable Pesticide Use**
The European Union (EU) is facing several challenges in 2025, including animal diseases and the sustainable use of pesticides. The EU is concerned about the spread of diseases such as African swine fever, avian influenza, and blue tongue, as well as other diseases like epizootic hemorrhagic disease and small ruminant plague. Spain and France have proposed the creation of a vaccine bank at the EU level to ensure a rapid response and availability of antigens to address the issue. However, the European Commission has not provided a concrete response. The EU members have also expressed concern about the reduction in co-financing for measures to combat the spread of diseases and emerging harmful organisms, and are calling for continued support for mandatory eradication campaigns, such as those against bovine tuberculosis. The European Commission has announced a proposal to review EU legislation on animal welfare (in production, transport, and slaughter) for the second half of 2023, but ultimately abandoned it and presented a project on protecting livestock during transport, which is currently being debated. Commissioner for Health and Animal Welfare, Olivér Válheryi, wants the legislation to be adopted quickly, ideally in the first half of the year, but there are still points of disagreement, such as the duration of journeys and transport during extreme temperatures. Válheryi seems more interested in applying existing rules uniformly than in proposing new requirements. He has proposed dialoguing with all stakeholders, including farmers, to find viable solutions. One of the pending proposals is the elimination of cages in animal breeding, in response to a citizen's initiative, but it is likely to be presented in 2026 and will include transitional periods and 'well-designed' rules that do not compromise the competitiveness of the sector. The European Commission has also announced that it will present a new proposal on the sustainable use of pesticides, but there is no new project in this area. The new commissioner for Health and Animal Welfare, Olivér Válheryi, has stated that his priority is not to set new binding targets for reducing the use of pesticides, but to improve the availability of alternatives to avoid further reducing the tools available to farmers for protecting their crops.

**Agrarbericht 2025: A Call for Fair Income and Animal Welfare**
The Agrarbericht 2025, a critical report on agriculture, was released on Friday, coinciding with the start of the International Green Week. The report, now in its 33rd edition, focuses on the theme of 'Wertschöpfung und Wertschätzung' (Value Creation and Appreciation). The report's authors, a coalition of organizations including the Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland (BUND), the Arbeitsgemeinschaft bäuerliche Landwirtschaft (AbL), the Deutsche Tierschutzbund, and Bioland, call for a fair income for food production to be achieved through the design of agricultural markets. This would involve binding contracts with clear specifications for price, quantity, quality, and duration, as well as a ban on buying and selling below production costs. The European agricultural funding should be used to finance public goods provided by agricultural businesses, such as climate protection, animal welfare, and species protection. Thomas Schröder, president of the Tierschutzbund, demands that animal welfare be made a state goal, obliging all government actions to prioritize animal protection over animal use. Xenia Brand, AbL's managing director, notes that many farmers are still struggling to cover their costs and that fairer producer prices are a promise made by the EU Commission. Olaf Bandt, BUND's chairman, emphasizes the need to protect ecosystems and biodiversity, while also ensuring that their protection does not come at the expense of farmers' income or under the guise of bureaucratic simplification.

**Meat from better animal welfare farms on the rise in German supermarkets**
Supermarkets in Germany are seeing a decrease in the amount of meat sold from farms with the minimum required standards, according to a report by the Handelssystem. The report states that in 2023, 1.5% of pork sold in supermarkets came from the lowest tier of animal welfare, down from 7.1% in 2022 and 22% in 2021. No chicken or turkey meat from the lowest tier was sold in supermarkets. However, 75.6% of beef sold in supermarkets still comes from the lowest tier, down from 77% in 2022. The Handelssystem has implemented a voluntary labeling system for animal welfare, which has led to an increase in the number of farms meeting higher standards. The system is being replaced with a new five-tier system, which will be mandatory for all meat sold in supermarkets. Bundesagrarminister Cem Özdemir has stated that the new system will give consumers more power to choose meat from farms with better animal welfare standards, and will also benefit farmers who adopt more humane farming practices. However, the long-term financing for the conversion of farms to meet the new standards is still unclear.

**Meat from Worst Animal Welfare Conditions Decreases in Supermarkets**
According to industry reports, there is a shift towards products with better animal welfare conditions in supermarkets. The proportion of meat from farms with only the minimum legal requirements has decreased since the introduction of the animal welfare labeling. For example, only 1.5% of pork from the 'SB-Regal' in 2023 came from the lowest tier 1, compared to 7.1% in the previous year. The data was presented by the Trägergesellschaft at the Agrarmesse Grüne Woche in Berlin. In contrast, over 75% of beef still comes from tier 1 farms, a decrease from 77% in 2022. The data only includes fresh meat and processed products like sausage meat from the retailers' own brands, which make up the majority of the offer. The voluntary animal welfare labeling, which has been in place since 2019, is being replaced by a new system with five tiers, similar to a state-mandated logo that will be introduced for pork in August 2025. The new system will range from 'Stall' with the minimum legal requirements to 'Bio'. According to the data, 90.5% of pork from the 'SB-Regal' is now in tier 2, which has higher requirements. The proportion of higher tiers 3 and 4 has increased to 2.6% and 5.1%, respectively. For poultry, tier 2 still dominates, with 89.8% of chicken and 91.5% of turkey meat. The proportion of tiers 3 and 4 has increased to around 5% for chicken. For beef, the proportion of tier 3 has increased to 5.6%, and 14.4% comes from tier 4.
