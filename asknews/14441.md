**China's Grip on Critical Minerals Faces Resistance as U.S. Miners Ramp Up Production**
The US government is taking steps to break China's grip on critical minerals, such as cobalt, lithium, and fluorspar. Ares Strategic Mining Inc. has secured an $11 million loan from the Utah State Legislature and the Utah Community Impact Board to accelerate production at its Lost Sheep fluorspar mine, the only fully permitted fluorspar operation in the US. The mine is expected to become a vital part of rebuilding the US supply chain for critical minerals. Senator Jerry Stevenson said, 'Fluorspar and gallium are essential to US national security and economic stability.' The US government is also supporting domestic development of these minerals, including with miners such as Century Aluminum Company and United States Antimony Corporation. NioCorp Developments Ltd. is progressing on multiple fronts at its Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project, including a full feasibility study update. Taseko Mines Limited is also making progress on its Florence Copper project, with major milestones including the completion of well drilling and cathode equipment installation.

**The wild hunt for clean energy minerals**
The world is facing a critical mineral shortage, essential for clean energy technologies. The US Geological Survey has flagged 50 minerals as critical to the economy and security, with 18 materials particularly important for energy. The demand for these minerals is surging, with mineral demands from clean energy deployment projected to double to quadruple by 2040. The US is a major consumer of critical minerals but not a significant producer, with China leading in production and refining capacity. Researchers are exploring alternatives to lithium, such as lithium iron phosphate batteries, and developing more efficient mining technologies. However, the challenge of securing a reliable supply of critical minerals remains, with the world likely to rely on lithium for decades to come. New mining projects are underway, including in the US, and companies are exploring mining the ocean floor and even asteroids for critical minerals.

**Chilean President Boric Announces Plans to Accelerate Renewable Energy and Pressure Israel**
Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced plans to accelerate renewable energy efforts and increase pressure on Israel over its war in Gaza, among other initiatives during the remaining nine months of his government. In a three-hour speech to Congress in the coastal city of Valparaiso, Boric also discussed crime, infrastructure, economy, and abortion rights, according to Reuters. Boric, a vocal critic of Israel, said he would introduce a law to ban imports from what he called 'illegally occupied territories' and support Spain's efforts to impose an arms embargo on Israel. Boric, who has recently summoned Israeli military personnel from Chile's embassy and summoned the ambassador for questioning, also announced a bill to 'accelerate carbon removal' which aims to promote investment in renewable energy sources, help end coal-fired power plants, and delay Chile's goal of removing carbon from the electricity grid by 2035 instead of 2040. Boric added that a bill to speed up permit procedures for new projects will be adopted within weeks, a long-awaited request from mining and renewable energy companies and other investors. Boric said, 'Investments will not reach their full potential if we do not work on updating and speeding up the permit process.' He also praised his plan to expand lithium mining, led by the giant copper company Codelco. Critics have accused Boric of failing to implement major reforms he promised during his campaign and of not revising the constitution of the dictatorship era, which was rejected by voters twice.

**The race for lithium to the end of the earth**
The US and China are engaged in a geopolitical battle for lithium supplies, with the US hoping that new discoveries of massive lithium reserves will upend the global alternative energy order. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has announced several significant lithium deposits, including the Smackover Formation in Arkansas, estimated to hold 5-19 million metric tonnes (mmt), and a deposit of 20-40 mmt in the McDermitt Caldera at the Oregon-Nevada border. According to the USGS report, 'Lithium resources have increased substantially worldwide and total about 115 million tons.' Meanwhile, China estimates 44 mmt of lithium in the country. The global demand for lithium is forecast to reach 2.5-3.1 mmt by 2030, with lithium supply expected to power 230 million electric vehicles by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.

**Ukraine-US Agreement on Natural Resource Extraction Faces Decades-Long Hurdles**
The recent agreement between Ukraine and the US on investing in natural resource extraction is unlikely to yield results before 2040, according to analysts. The deal aims to create a special investment fund for restoration, which will be formed from the profits of future mining and energy projects. However, experts note that implementing such initiatives requires significant private capital investments and time. 'This is a prospect of at least 10-15 years,' said former EBRD natural resources director Eric Rasmussen. Peter Bryanton, head of consulting company Clareo, believes that launching and developing fields will take at least a decade, making the agreement unable to change the situation on the resource market in the short term. Ukraine has significant reserves of iron ore, coal, lithium, graphite, and titanium, as well as being one of the top three European natural gas producers. However, large-scale projects in the oil and gas sector also face risks, including war, lack of accurate geological data, damaged infrastructure, corruption threats, and a shortage of experts. All this pushes the first real results to at least 2040. According to Minister of Economy Yulia Sviridenko, the investment fund should start operating in the coming weeks. However, it is not expected to generate profits before 10 years, as the funds will be reinvested in new projects and the country's reconstruction. The agreement does not cover existing facilities, such as Ferrexpo's mines or the Shimanivske field managed by Black Iron. Black Iron's general director, Matt Simpson, is confident that their project will remain key for investors after the war. Another obstacle is limited access to Soviet geological maps - most data is currently classified due to the war. Additionally, experts do not rule out that some of the most promising fields are already partially depleted.

**Cracks Appear in Europe’s Lithium Dreams as Global Market Shifts**
The optimistic projections for lithium mining in Europe, particularly at Portugal's Covas do Barroso site, are facing new scrutiny amid global market disruptions and plummeting investor confidence. Recent developments in Ghana, where a 15-year lease for the Ewoyaa site was put on hold due to a significant drop in the internal rate of return, may offer some perspective for local opponents of the Covas do Barroso mine. The lithium market has slumped since its November 2022 peak, with major lithium discoveries in the U.S. and China, and slower-than-expected adoption of electric vehicles contributing to the downturn. China's development of sodium-based battery alternatives, already entering commercial production for short-range vehicles, further complicates the issue. This raises questions about the long-term viability of other lithium projects, such as those pursued by Savannah Resources in Portugal, which could face similar economic pressures. While the Barroso project benefits from geographic proximity to EU refineries and markets, it is increasingly likely that operations will proceed on a smaller scale and with diminished returns, leading to more balanced decisions that account for both economic realities and environmental and social concerns.

**EU Designates Three Mines in Extremadura as 'Strategic' Amid Controversy**
The European Union has designated three mines in Extremadura, Spain as 'strategic' due to their importance in securing the region's independence from external materials. The mines, located in Almoharín, Cañaveral, and Aguablanca, are expected to create 1,500 jobs and provide a significant portion of Europe's critical materials. However, the projects have sparked controversy among local residents, who are concerned about the environmental impact and the potential disruption to their way of life. Some residents see the projects as an opportunity for economic growth and job creation, while others are skeptical about the promises made by the companies involved. The EU's goal is to reduce its dependence on external materials by 2030, with at least 10% of materials consumed being produced within the EU. The projects are still in the permitting phase, with some expected to start operations as early as 2026. 'We need to be realistic, we can't just rely on promises,' says Lalo, a 44-year-old maintenance worker at the Almoharín mine. 'My father tells me not to work in the mine, but I say, 'You have to die from something.' ' Ignacio Baños, CEO of Lithium Iberia, emphasizes that the process is being done in a regulated manner and that the project will comply with the regulations. 'We are not just talking about jobs, we are talking about a future for Europe,' he says. 'We will be able to provide 30% of the EU's need for lithium,' he adds. Serafino Iacono, executive of Denarius Metals, highlights the importance of the mines in securing Europe's critical materials. 'If we don't have nickel and cobalt in Europe, we will suffer,' he says. The EU's strategy is to reduce its dependence on external materials, particularly from China, which controls around 80% of the world's tungsten. The EU aims to have at least 10% of its materials produced within the EU by 2030 and no more than 65% of its consumption dependent on a single non-EU country. 'We need to be prepared for the future,' says Pablo Neira, CEO of Iberian Resources Spain. 'We can't just rely on imports, we need to produce our own materials.'

**EU's 47 Mining Projects: A Realistic Plan to Reduce Dependence on Rare Metals?**
The European Union has identified 47 mining projects to reduce its dependence on rare metals from China. However, achieving 10% of extraction for lithium and cobalt before 2030 is 'completely illusory', according to Eric Pirard, a professor at the University of Liège. 'We won't reach 10% autonomy for a series of materials, including lithium and cobalt. The effort is focused on these two metals, but for all others, we won't be able to extract 10% from the subsoil.' The reason for this is that the 47 projects are mainly for maintaining or reinforcing existing capacities, not new mining projects. 'If we want to open new mines on new raw materials, we need to do exploration first. This is also provided for by the Critical Raw Materials Act: each country must submit a project, a plan for subsoil exploration by May 24 of this year.' However, even if new projects are launched, the discovered deposits 'will not be put into operation before 10 or 20 years'.

**Russia Could Become A Lithium Powerhouse By 2030**
Russia is poised to become a major lithium supplier by 2030, with plans to produce at least 60,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate. According to Mining.com, the country has 3.5 million tons of lithium oxide reserves, which can be extracted in three regions: Murmansk and Tuva. This would be a significant increase from the 27 tons of lithium extracted in 2023, a byproduct from an emerald mine in the Ural Mountains. Russia's lithium deposits could make it a global powerhouse in the electric vehicle industry, but the country's uncertain future, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and demographic challenges, may impact its ability to extract, process, and sell lithium on the global market.

**Russia Plans to Mass-Produce Lithium to Reduce Import Dependence**
Russia plans to produce at least 60,000 tons of lithium carbonate by 2030 to reduce its dependence on imports and promote the production of high-capacity batteries. According to Reuters, key mineral resources such as lithium and rare earth metals have been in focus recently, with US President Trump trying to counter China's dominance in the field by providing production agreements to Ukraine and Russia, while ending the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Lithium is an indispensable metal in electric vehicle production, and the US Geological Survey has listed it as one of the 50 key minerals. In recent years, as Russian enterprises have begun to mass-produce lithium batteries and electric vehicles, lithium demand has surged. Russian official reports show that the country has 3.5 million tons of lithium oxide reserves. However, the US Geological Survey estimated in 2024 that Russia's lithium reserves are approximately 1 million tons, ranking 14th globally. The pure lithium content of lithium oxide is about one-third, while the pure lithium content of lithium carbonate is about 20%. 'Domestic industrial lithium production will start in 2030,' the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources said in a statement. 'It is now crucial to quickly establish production facilities and accelerate the extraction and processing of this strategic resource, which is vital to the national economy.' Russian President Putin expressed his willingness to cooperate with the US in the rare earth field last month, and Trump also responded by saying that the US is cooperating with Russia to promote economic development, and the negotiations are progressing smoothly. The Russian Ministry of Natural Resources has already issued permits for three lithium mines, including the Kolmozerskoye and Polmostundrovskoye mines in the Murmansk region of northwest Russia, and the Tastygskoye mine in the Tuva Republic near Mongolia. The government expects these three mines and their associated processing facilities to come online by 2030. In 2023, Russia only extracted 27 tons of lithium as a byproduct from a jade mine in the Ural Mountains. The Kolmozerskoye mine holds a quarter of Russia's known lithium reserves and is operated by Polar Lithium, a joint venture between Russian metals giant Nornickel and state-owned nuclear energy company Rosatom. The Polmostundrovskoye mine is licensed to private company Arctic Lithium, while the Tastygskoye mine is controlled by Elbrusmetall-Lithium, a subsidiary of Russian technology company Rostec.

**Russia plans to launch large-scale lithium production in 2030**
Russia plans to launch large-scale lithium production in 2030, aiming to produce at least 60,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate. This move is part of Moscow's efforts to reduce its dependency on lithium imports and boost production of high-capacity electric batteries. Russia has an estimated 1 million tons of lithium reserves, with 3.5 million tons of lithium oxide reserves. The country has traditionally imported lithium, but now seeks to launch facilities swiftly and increase extraction and processing of this strategically important resource. Three major lithium deposits, Kolmozerskoye, Polmostundrovskoye, and Tastygskoye, are expected to become operational by 2030, with Kolmozerskoye containing one-quarter of Russia's known lithium reserves. 'Industrial lithium production in the country will begin in 2030,' the natural resources ministry stated. President Vladimir Putin has called for speeding up plans to mine lithium deposits, citing the surge in demand for lithium in recent years due to the mass production of lithium batteries and electric vehicles.

**Country's only operational lithium mine seeks 25% expansion**
Albemarle, the company operating the country's only functional lithium mine, Silver Peak, is seeking federal approval to expand the site by about 25% by adding 1,596 acres, including 1,053 acres of public land. The expansion will be used for two transfer pump stations, two brine ponds, and future well drilling. The federal environmental review process will consider potential effects on air quality, cultural resources, Native American religious sites, and water. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management will need to issue a permit for the plan to move forward. Officials anticipate a draft environmental impact statement in mid-2025, a final environmental impact statement in late 2025, and a final record of decision in early 2026. 'Those interested in commenting on the initial Silver Peak expansion proposal or any future environmental impact statements can do so on the BLM's National Register,' according to the article. The expansion comes as other lithium mines, such as Rhyolite Ridge and Thacker Pass, are set to begin construction and production in the coming years.
