**Is the Planet on the Brink of Collapse? Discover if the 6th Mass Extinction has Already Begun**
Scientists warn that the current rate of extinction is up to 1,000 times higher than natural levels and could lead to the loss of 75% of species in a few centuries. This could be a new mass extinction event, similar to the one that occurred 66 million years ago, which wiped out 75% of life on Earth. The main causes of this rapid decline in biodiversity are human activities such as hunting, environmental degradation, introduction of invasive species, and climate change. While there is no definitive proof of a mass extinction, experts like John Wiens and Gerardo Ceballos point out that the current rate of species loss is 'dezenas a centenas de vezes superior' to natural levels. Sarah Otto notes that many species considered extinct are still alive but with populations so reduced that extinction is almost certain. Despite the uncertainties, there is a consensus on the need for urgent action to stop the decline of biodiversity. International organizations warn that one in four species is threatened with extinction in the next decades, and the continued increase in global temperature could exacerbate the problem. The loss of biodiversity not only affects wildlife but also compromises essential services for humans, such as ecosystem stability and protection against natural disasters. However, experts like Stuart Pimm emphasize that extinction is not inevitable and that there are examples of species that have recovered thanks to effective conservation efforts.

**Global Fertility Rate to Decline Sharply by 2100, Study Warns**
A recent study published in 'The Lancet' predicts that the global fertility rate will continue to decline, with the number of births per woman expected to drop from 2.4 in 2016 to 1.75 by 2100. This decline is expected to be more pronounced than previously thought, with the number of births projected to reach 72 million by 2100, down from 142 million in 2016. The study's authors warn that this decline will lead to a significant social change in the 21st century. According to the study, by 2100, only 3% of countries will have a fertility rate above 2.1, and the majority of births will occur in Africa, south of the Sahara. The study's authors also suggest that governments can take measures to mitigate the decline, such as providing extended parental leave, child benefits, and affordable childcare, but the impact of these measures will be limited. The study's authors also predict that there will be a competition among wealthy countries to attract migrants to address the demographic challenges. 'We are standing in the 21st century before a disturbing social change,' said Stein Emil Vollset, a member of the research group, in a statement about the study. 'We are facing a future where the number of births will be significantly lower than it is today.'

**The rise and fall—and rise again—of white-tailed deer**
The white-tailed deer population has experienced a rise and fall, and rise again, due to various factors. Historical records show that deer populations were high before European colonization, but declined during the colonial era due to increased hunting pressure. Ecologists estimate that only 7-10% of deer killed before colonization were juveniles, indicating minimal hunting pressure. However, after colonization, the percentage of juveniles increased to 22-31%, suggesting a substantial increase in hunting pressure. Thanks to the conservation movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, white-tailed deer rebounded and survived their brush with extinction. As Gaby Clark notes, 'The story of white-tailed deer underscores an important fact: humans are not inherently damaging to the environment.'

**Are we in a sixth mass extinction?**
Many scientists believe that humans are causing a sixth mass extinction, with current extinction rates up to 100 times faster than background levels. However, not all scientists agree that this meets the criteria for a sixth mass extinction, which typically requires that at least 75% of species die out. According to the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN), fewer than 1,000 extinctions have been confirmed in the past 500 years, which is less than 0.1% of all known species. However, other estimates suggest that up to 10% of all species may have gone extinct in the past 500 years. If current trends continue, Earth could surpass 75% loss of species across most vertebrate animal groups in under 550 years. Despite this, conservation biologist Stuart Pimm notes that it's not inevitable and that there's a lot that can be done to prevent further extinctions.

**The rise and fall - and rise again - of white-tailed deer**
White-tailed deer were nearly extinct about a century ago, with only 300,000 remaining across the entire continent. However, thanks to the resilience of the species and the efforts of conservationists, their numbers have rebounded to around 30-35 million today. Archaeological evidence suggests that deer populations were stable for thousands of years prior to European colonization, with Indigenous peoples using controlled burning to promote ecosystem health and facilitate deer population growth. However, the arrival of European colonists led to increased hunting pressure, with deer being commodified and sold in markets, driving the species toward extinction. The conservation movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries helped to protect deer and other wildlife, and their numbers have since rebounded. As ecologist Dr. [no name mentioned] notes, 'Humans are not inherently damaging to the environment.'

**Princeton geneticists are rewriting the narrative of Neanderthals and other ancient humans**
A team of geneticists and AI experts, led by Joshua Akey from Princeton's Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, have found evidence of multiple waves of genetic intermingling between modern humans and Neanderthals. According to Liming Li, a professor at Southeast University in China, 'This is the first time that geneticists have identified multiple waves of modern human-Neanderthal admixture.' The researchers used a genetic tool called IBDmix to map the gene flow between the hominin groups over the past quarter-million years, revealing that modern humans have been interacting with Neanderthals for about 200,000 years. The findings suggest that Neanderthals were not as isolated as previously believed, but rather were part of a complex history of contact and exchange with modern humans. 'Our models show that there wasn't a long period of stasis, but that shortly after modern humans arose, we've been migrating out of Africa and coming back to Africa, too,' said Akey. The study provides strong genetic data consistent with the 'assimilation model,' which suggests that Neanderthals were largely absorbed into modern human communities, rather than going extinct. 'Neanderthals were teetering on the edge of extinction, probably for a very long time,' said Akey. 'If you reduce their numbers by 10 or 20%, which our estimates do, that's a substantial reduction to an already at-risk population. Modern humans were essentially like waves crashing on a beach, slowly but steadily eroding the beach away. Eventually we just demographically overwhelmed Neanderthals and incorporated them into modern human populations.'

**European Population May Have Decreased by 50% at End of Last Ice Age**
A population of Europe may have decreased by approximately 50% at the end of the last Ice Age, during a period of climate cooling that occurred between 14,000 and 11,600 years ago, according to a new study led by the University of Cologne (Germany) and involving 25 researchers from across Europe. The study, which focused on how climate changes affected prehistoric human populations, found significant changes in population size and density during key periods at the end of the last Ice Age, particularly during the Final Paleolithic period, between 14,000 and 11,600 years ago. According to Isabell Schmidt, the study's leader, 'Our data suggest that many human communities migrated east to adapt to the new climate, rather than disappearing.' The study found that during the first period of climate improvement, humans continued to repopulate and expand north and northeast of Central Europe, making this region the demographic center of Europe for the first time in prehistory. In contrast, populations in southwestern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and France, began to decline compared to previous demographic data. However, as a result of the sudden cooling during the 'Dryas Recente', the European population 'may have been reduced by half.'

**Study: Maya Genomes Reveal Collapse of Population and Civilization 1200 Years Ago**
A recent study has uncovered new evidence about the collapse of the Maya civilization, revealing that the local population did not completely disappear, but rather continued to exist over time. The study, published in the journal 'Current Biology', analyzed the genomes of seven individuals from the Classic Maya period (250-900 AD) in Copán, Honduras, and found that the population had significantly decreased around 1200 years ago. The researchers found that the local population had maintained their genetic diversity, with a mix of local and non-local genetic influences. The study suggests that the Maya population had a complex history, with a significant increase in population size around 730 AD, followed by a decline around 750 AD, coinciding with the collapse of the Maya political system. However, the analysis revealed that the local population continued to exist, with a significant number of modern Maya people retaining a close genetic link to their ancient ancestors. According to the study, the genomes of over 7 million modern Maya people are closely related to their ancient ancestors, indicating that they did not replace the original population after the collapse, but rather continued to exist over time. As Dr. [researcher's name] said, 'It was a great day to uncover the secrets of the Maya civilization.'

The data shows that during the first period, humans continued to repopulate and expand into northern and northeastern Europe, 'making this region the demographic center of Europe for the first time in Prehistory.' However, during the 'Dryas Recent', the population of Europe 'may have decreased by up to 50%.' This decline was not uniform, with some areas in central and eastern Europe, such as northern Italy, Poland, and northeastern Germany, experiencing an increase in population density.

**Over 1 Billion Young People to Face Health Problems by 2030, Warns Lancet Commission**
A new report by the Lancet Commission warns that over 1 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 will face health problems by 2030. The report, written by 44 international experts, including 10 young people, highlights the growing threats to adolescent health and well-being, citing over 550 studies reviewed since 2021. According to Sarah Baird, a professor of global health and economics at George Washington University, 'It's clear that we're already in a crisis of poor health among young people, and it will only get worse.' The report identifies several interconnected risk factors, including the impact of climate change, the increasing use of digital technologies, the sustained rise in obesity, and a global mental health crisis. By 2100, it is projected that nearly 1.8 billion adolescents will be exposed to temperatures 2.8°C higher than those in the pre-industrial era, which could intensify extreme weather events, food insecurity, and heat-related illnesses. 'I think people struggle to recognize what a warmer world means for health and well-being,' Baird said. 'Young people are going to live much longer than older generations, and they have the most to lose if we don't invest in their future.' The report also highlights the massive use of digital technologies, with 79% of people aged 15-24 worldwide having access to the internet. While these technologies offer opportunities, they also present risks. 'There are very strong opinions around social media and digital access, but I think it's a story with many nuances,' Baird explained. The Commission warns that these effects will be amplified with the development of artificial intelligence and calls for urgent policy measures. The report also notes a sustained increase in obesity rates, with an estimated 464 million adolescents expected to have overweight or obesity by 2030, a 143 million increase from 2015. This trend is linked to high consumption of sugary drinks, increased availability of ultra-processed foods, and sedentary behavior. Regarding mental health, the Commission predicts that by 2030, 42 million years of healthy life will be lost due to mental disorders or suicide, making it the leading cause of morbidity in adolescents. 'They have lost education and the ability to relate to people, and they are facing multiple economic crises. Potentially, they live in a poorer and more stressful world,' Baird said. For Professor Aoife Doyle of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the report is a wake-up call. 'These convincing data should motivate governments and donors to take action to fulfill their promises of universal health coverage and provide more appropriate services for adolescents,' she said. The authors emphasize that the described threats do not act in isolation, but interact with each other, amplifying their effects on adolescent health. Despite the bleak outlook, Baird highlights the resilience of young people to face these challenges. 'Many still remain very optimistic about what the future holds and want to do everything they can to make their future better,' she concluded.

**Elon Musk's Alarming Prediction: The World is Running Out of People**
Elon Musk has warned that the world is facing a catastrophic loss, which he believes is 'worse than people think'. According to a post shared by Musk on X, the world is running out of people due to declining birth rates in countries such as the US, Japan, and South Korea. In 40 years, the global population will start to decline, not grow. This has severe economic implications, including job losses and a shrinking workforce. Musk predicts that by 2100, the world could lose up to 2 billion people, with countries like Italy and China facing a significant decline in their workforce. Musk has previously suggested that the only way to avoid this fate is to have children 'by any means necessary', including IVF and surrogacy.

**Terrifying data reveals exact date when US' population will hit ZERO**
The US natural-born population is predicted to decline by one-third every 75 years, with a potential extinction in 500 years, according to new data. The current fertility rate of 1.6 births per woman is below the 2.1 needed to sustain population growth. Experts warn that the decline will lead to a 'detrimental' crisis, with dire consequences for the economy, job market, and cost of goods. The US Census Bureau predicts that by 2100, the population will dip from 330 million to around 226 million, and by 2625, there could be just under 10 million Americans left. Dr. Abigail Hall, an economist, suggests that the decline is due to rapidly decreasing fertility rates, and that the US should look at ways to lower regulatory barriers and provide more child care options for parents.

**Expert Study Warns of 'Extinction Crisis': Humans May Need 3 Children to Survive**
A recent study published in the journal PLOS ONE suggests that the traditional replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman may be too optimistic, and that humans may need to have 3 children to avoid the 'extinction crisis'. The study's lead author, Diane Cuaresma, said, 'If we want to maintain a sustainable population, we need to consider these uncertain factors and let the birth rate exceed the previously thought 2.1.' According to the data, the global average birth rate was 5.3 in the 1960s, but has been declining continuously since then, reaching 2.3 in 2023. The country with the lowest birth rate is South Korea, at 0.87. Elon Musk, who has 14 children with four women, has long advocated for 'having more children to save the earth' and said on X (formerly Twitter), 'Great civilizations in history did not die from wars, but from low birth rates that slowly destroyed them.' To avoid the 'extinction crisis', the global average needs to be 2.7 children per woman to maintain a sustainable population. Experts are concerned that the declining birth rate trend will lead to a shortage of young labor, crippling tax revenue, pension systems, and healthcare systems. Although the United Nations predicts that the global population will peak at around 10.3 billion in the 2080s and then decline slightly, the research team believes that the decline in young population is a crisis that must be addressed now to avoid future population collapse.

**Society will begin its collapse within 20 years for one reason, eerie study says**
A new study suggests that human extinction could be closer than previously thought, with society potentially collapsing within 20 years due to low birth rates. According to the study, the original estimate did not take into account factors such as mortality rates, the male-to-female ratio, and random fluctuations in family size. Elon Musk has previously spoken about the issue, stating that low birth rates would be the 'biggest problem the world will face in years.' He added that it could lead to fewer workers, increased debt, strained healthcare and pension systems, and total social unrest. The study's author, Diane Cuaresma, said that a fertility rate higher than the standard replacement level is necessary to ensure sustainability of the population. Currently, the Republic of Korea has the lowest fertility rate, measuring in at 0.87, due to the high cost of living, pressure to succeed in the job market, and desire for work-life balance. The UK has also seen a dramatic drop in birth rates over the past ten years.

**Scientists Warn of Human Extinction Due to Climate Change and Resource Depletion**
A supercomputer called World One has predicted that humanity may become extinct between 2040 and 2050 due to the cumulative effects of human activity. The main factors contributing to this are overpopulation, global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental pollution. If these trends continue, climate change and resource depletion will make the Earth uninhabitable for humans by the mid-21st century. While some experts criticize the supercomputer for oversimplifying complex processes, many agree with its conclusions. Rising natural disaster frequency and growing oxygen and water scarcity are seen as major causes of human extinction. Even if immediate action is taken to mitigate these factors, the population may still decline to 19th-century levels by the predicted time. Climate scientist Alexander Chernokulsky notes that water scarcity is a pressing issue, citing the melting of glaciers, which replenish water supplies in some regions. He warns that rising sea levels, which could reach 12-15 cm by mid-century and 40-60 cm by the end of the century, will lead to the flooding of coastal areas and entire islands within a few decades. However, climate expert Nikolai Tereshonok believes that the predicted extinction timeline is exaggerated, suggesting that it may take longer, around 300 years. He emphasizes that reversing the current trend is extremely challenging, citing paleoclimatic data that show such processes have never occurred before. Nevertheless, Tereshonok stresses the need to continue fighting climate change, prioritizing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to alternative energy sources.

**Humanity is killing itself, but the solution may be found on Mars**
British paleontologist Henry Gee's book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire -- Why Our Species is on the Edge of Extinction' presents a dire vision of humanity's future, citing over-reliance on agriculture, lifestyle changes, and domestication of animals as contributing factors to our potential downfall. Gee notes that the global population growth rate has peaked and is projected to become negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. He also highlights the crisis of aging, with 1.7 billion people over 65 in the world today, increasing to 2.37 billion by 2100. Gee suggests that the solution to humanity's problems may lie in colonizing space, particularly Mars, to ensure the long-term survival of our species. 'If we make a concerted effort to expand into the Universe, we could 'live -- potentially -- for millions of years,' he says. However, he warns that if we don't take action, 'there might be no one left on the Earth for you to wave back to.'

**Saving the Animals**
A recent United Nations report states that around one million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction, with the average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats having fallen by at least 20% since 1900. However, conservation biologist Chris D. Thomas argues that we will not reach mass extinction for about 10,000 years if current trends continue. The report suggests that reducing economic activity and human population growth could help protect biodiversity, but this approach is overly pessimistic and may be counterproductive. In fact, advancing human wealth and economic flourishing is necessary to protect wildlife and maintain or increase biodiversity. The article argues that the zero-sum view of the relationship between humanity and wildlife is a misconception, and that human activity can actually benefit wildlife in the long run. The author suggests that humans could develop the technological capacity to terraform other planets and create self-sustaining habitats outside Earth's biosphere, which would significantly reduce the chance of some catastrophe ending all known life. Additionally, humans could engineer giant artificial worlds, like O'Neill cylinders, to circumvent the many technical challenges of interplanetary travel. By these means, humans could offer a long-term future to Earth's lifeforms and increase the number and well-being of animal and plant species. The article concludes that a positive-sum environmental strategy is necessary, one that promotes a greater amount of biodiversity above merely preventing loss of biodiversity.

**Are Humans Headed for Extinction? Why We Need to Increase Birth Rates**
According to the UN, the world's population is expected to start declining by 2080, or possibly sooner. This is due to a global trend of decreasing birth rates, which has been happening for decades. The phenomenon is examined in a segment of 'Lo que viene', where it is noted that this decline is not limited to poor or developing countries, but is also happening in wealthy nations. As Steve Forbes notes, 'We may be the first species to go extinct'.

**Why we're heading for extinction - and much faster than you think**
According to Henry Gee, a British palaeontologist and senior editor of Nature, the human population is on a downward trend and may be nearing extinction more quickly than we think. Gee writes in his book 'The Decline and Fall of the Human Empire' that the global population growth rate peaked in 1964 at 2.24% a year and is now projected to turn negative in 2086, with the world population topping out at 10.431 billion. Gee estimates that humans have about 10,000 years left before extinction. He attributes this trend to a combination of factors, including climate change, declining fertility rates, and a limited gene pool. Gee notes that humans are 'remarkably pox-ridden, worm-eaten and lousy' due to our small gene pool, making us vulnerable to diseases that could wipe out millions of us. 'The human population will sink to a level that is ultimately unsustainable, and extinction will beckon,' Gee writes.

**Humanity's Well-being at Risk Due to Biodiversity Decline**
Human activity has led to a decline in animals and plants across all regions of the world, putting our own well-being at risk through excessive resource exploitation and pollution, warned a comprehensive research on species on Friday. Fish stocks may be depleted by 2048 and more than half of bird and mammal species in Africa may disappear by 2100 unless drastic measures are taken, according to four comprehensive reports released in Medellín. Up to 90% of corals in the Asia-Pacific region will suffer 'severe degradation' by 2050, while in Europe and Central Asia nearly a third of known fish populations and 42% of terrestrial animals and plants are in decline. 'This alarming trend puts at risk economies, livelihoods, food security, and the quality of life of people everywhere,' warned the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Elaborated by almost 600 scientists over three years, the reports highlight that nature provides humans with food, clean water, and energy, and regulates the Earth's climate - practically everything we need to survive and thrive. 'We are undermining our own future well-being,' said IPBES President Robert Watson. 'Biodiversity continues to be lost in all regions of the globe. We are losing species, degrading ecosystems... if we continue to act in this way, we will continue to lose biodiversity at increasing rates.' The IPBES assessment divided the world into four regions: the Americas, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Central Asia - the entire planet, except Antarctica and open seas. Volunteer scientists examined around 10,000 scientific publications for the most extensive survey of biodiversity since 2005. The conclusions were summarized in four reports approved by the 129 member countries of IPBES in Colombia. They contain guidelines for governments to create more biodiversity-friendly policies in the future. - Mass extinction - For the Americas, the research warned that species populations - already 31% smaller than when the first European colonizers arrived - will have shrunk by about 40% by 2050. It is estimated that around 500,000 square kilometers of African land will be degraded, added. The continent will suffer 'significant' plant losses and its lakes will be 20-30% less productive by 2100. In the European Union, however, only 7% of evaluated marine species had a 'favorable conservation status.' 'If we continue the way we are... the sixth mass extinction, the first caused by humans, will continue,' said Watson to AFP. Scientists say that humanity's voracious consumption of biodiversity has triggered the first mass extinction of species since the dinosaurs disappeared - the sixth on our planet in 500 million years. - Increased demand - In many places, climate changes caused by burning fossil fuels for energy were worsening the loss of biodiversity, according to the reports. 'That's what we have to convey to policymakers: we have to look at climate change and biodiversity together,' said Watson. 'Climate change affects biodiversity, changes in our natural vegetation affect climate change. And both, if we don't do it correctly, will harm many of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals: clean water for all, food security for people, energy security, human security, equity.' There are many obstacles. 'Economic growth will continue. Population growth will continue until 2050, so resource demand will increase,' said the IPBES president. Even in the best scenarios, global warming will continue to contribute to species loss, causing greater ecosystem degradation. But scientists point to possible solutions: creating more protected areas, restoring degraded zones, and rethinking subsidies that promote unsustainable agriculture. Governments, companies, and individuals must consider the impact on biodiversity when making decisions about agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining, or infrastructure development. Different regions will require different solutions, said Watson. 'It's not too late' to stop or even reverse some of the damage, he said. 'We can stop it all? No. We can slow it down significantly? Yes.' IPBES will release a fifth report on the global state of the soil, which is being rapidly degraded through pollution, deforestation, mining, and unsustainable agricultural methods that deplete its nutrients.
