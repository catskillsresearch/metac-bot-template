**61 Countries Suspend Brazilian Poultry Imports Amid Avian Influenza Outbreak**
The number of countries that have suspended imports of Brazilian poultry has risen to 61, following the confirmation of the first outbreaks of Avian Influenza H5N1 in commercial, subsistence, and zoo farms. The Ministry of Agriculture reports that the latest countries to join the list are those of the Eurasian Union (Russia, Belarus, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan), which, like the 27 EU countries and Argentina, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Jordan, Malaysia, Morocco, Mexico, Iraq, Pakistan, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Timor-Leste, and Uruguay, have completely blocked purchases. Only the state of Rio Grande do Sul has been exempt from the import ban by Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bahrain, Cuba, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Kazakhstan, the United Kingdom, Tajikistan, and Ukraine. Saudi Arabia and Japan have suspended purchases only of poultry from the municipality of Montenegro, where the first case was identified. Authorities have ruled out the first suspected human case of infection, a worker at the Montenegro farm where the outbreak was reported.

**Humanos podem pegar a gripe aviária? Tire suas dúvidas sobre a vacina**
In humans, treatment for avian flu involves clinical support to alleviate symptoms, which may include antivirals and mechanical ventilation in severe cases. According to the article, it is recommended to seek medical attention if any symptoms are presented. Approximately 20 vaccines against H5N1 have been licensed worldwide, but Brazil is not on the list. The Institute Butantan in Brazil is waiting for Anvisa's approval since August 2024 to conduct a study on the H5N8 influenza type A vaccine (fragmented, inactivated, and adjuvanted) in humans. The clinical study will have hundreds of volunteers and aims to produce safety and efficacy data for a potential future registration. It is essential to note that current flu vaccines do not protect against H5N1 infection. The focus on avian flu is expected to end by mid-June, with the Ministry estimating 28 days to complete all containment measures initiated on May 15. This 28-day period also corresponds to the virus cycle causing avian flu, H5N1. Only after this period, and without new case reports, will the country resume exporting chicken.

**Butantan Awaits Anvisa Approval for Avian Influenza Vaccine Development**
The Butantan Institute, located in the west of São Paulo, has been waiting for nine months for the Anvisa (Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency) approval to start clinical trials for the development of a vaccine against avian influenza (influenza type A H5N8). The request was sent in August 2024. The H5N8 variant has high pathogenicity and can cause severe respiratory problems, including deaths, in humans. The lethality of avian influenza reaches nearly 50%. The study will involve over 700 volunteers from Pernambuco, Minas Gerais, and São Paulo, divided into two groups: 18-59 years and 60 or more. According to the director of the Butantan Institute, Esper Kallás, the initial plan was to produce 30 million doses, which would be enough to immunize 15 million people. 'We defend not only creating this vaccine but also the technological development route. If another virus causes avian influenza, we propose the exchange and act quickly. Walking the technological development route and immunobiological is a privilege that Brazil should invest more and more,' he said. The study will include a screening with biochemical, hematological, and serological exams, and the participants will receive two doses of the vaccine or a placebo, with a 21-day interval between applications. Only one in seven volunteers will receive the placebo. The results of the study will be used to produce data on safety and efficacy for a future registration request.

**US Avian Flu Cases Plummet, Experts Worry About Lack of Transparency**
The number of human cases of avian flu in the US has drastically decreased, with no new cases reported since January 14. Experts are concerned that this may be a bad sign, as the virus is still present in birds and cattle. Luis Buzón, a spokesperson for the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, says that the reduction in cases is 'too strange' and that the lack of transparency in the information may be a cause for concern. Daniel López-Acuña, an epidemiologist, believes that the decrease in cases may be related to the policies of the Trump administration, which may have led to a lack of reporting of cases. Buzón agrees with this theory and notes that the virus is still present in birds and cattle, and that the 70 cases reported in the past 14 months may be below the actual number of cases. 'We are seeing the tip of the iceberg,' he says. The microbiologist also notes that the policies of inmigración implemented by the Trump administration may be related to the decrease in cases, as many workers in the livestock industry are undocumented immigrants who may be afraid to seek medical attention. 'It is impossible to communicate cases or detect patients with mild symptoms,' he says. Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland, has called for urgent vigilance, as the virus is still present in animals and may be transmitted to humans. López-Acuña notes that the lack of information is a major concern, as it makes it difficult to establish the risk of transmission. 'We are already late if we detect the transmission between humans,' he says. The safety of public health, both in the US and globally, depends on detecting the presence of pathogens and epidemic risks early on. 'The danger has not disappeared, it has disappeared the information,' says Buzón.

**Multi-Country Outbreak of Cholera, External Situation Report #26, Published 22 May 2025 - South Sudan**
From 1 January 2025 to 27 April 2025, a total of 157,035 cholera cases and 2,148 deaths were reported in 26 countries across three WHO regions. In April 2025, 37,147 new cholera cases were reported, a 5% increase from March, with 561 cholera-related deaths globally, a 3% decrease from the previous month. The global stockpile of Oral Cholera Vaccine stands at 3.6 million doses, below the minimum emergency threshold of five million, due to persistent demand exceeding supply. Conflict, mass displacement, natural disasters, and climate change have intensified outbreaks, particularly in rural and flood-affected areas, where poor infrastructure and limited healthcare access delay treatment.

**Scientists Develop mRNA Vaccine Against Avian Influenza for Cattle**
While the avian influenza is spreading among poultry and cattle in the United States, a team of scientists has made a promising step to contain outbreaks before they can evolve into a human pandemic. Researchers have developed the first mRNA vaccine against avian influenza for cattle. Preliminary results of the study, published on the bioRxiv platform (awaiting peer review), show that the experimental vaccine induces a strong immune response in calves and protects against infection. The concerns about the pandemic threat from avian influenza, as Nature online reports, have increased since the first detection of the H5N1 virus in dairy cattle in March 2024. Since then, over 1,000 farms in 17 US states have been affected, and 64 human cases and one death have been reported. To develop the vaccine, the team of Hensley used over ten years of research on mRNA vaccines against seasonal influenza. The researchers modified an existing vaccine by replacing the viral hemagglutinin gene with that of the new H5N1 strain found in farms. Last year, the same vaccine had already shown efficacy in ferrets, an animal model used to test influenza vaccines. In the new experiment, 10 calves were vaccinated and, after 49 days, fed with milk from H5N1-infected cows. The vaccinated animals showed significantly lower levels of viral RNA compared to those not vaccinated, suggesting effective protection against infection. According to Scott Hensley, virologist at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of the study, 'this is a crucial step in the development of influenza vaccines for cattle, which will contribute to reducing the risk of virus transmission from animals to humans.' Although the data is incomplete, Richard Webby, director of the OMS center for the study of influenza ecology in animals, describes the results as 'a good starting point.'

**Avian Flu: Scientists Warn of Potential Pandemic**
Scientists are sounding the alarm about the potential for the avian flu to become the next pandemic. The disease has been circulating in thousands of rural properties for months and has recently been identified in Brazil. Researchers warn that the US may have already passed the point of no return for the avian flu to become a human pandemic due to inadequate surveillance. The disease has been identified in wild birds and mammals in all 50 US states and has moved beyond farms, infecting over 1,000 dairy herds, according to the US Department of Agriculture. There have been at least 70 human infections and one death. In Brazil, the virus was detected in commercial birds for the first time last week. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (Mapa) confirmed the detection of the avian flu virus in a commercial farm in Rio Grande do Sul on May 16. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, said, 'The avian flu is not a temporary problem - there was a mistaken perception that it would disappear. Now there is a recognition that it is a problem that needs to be managed.' The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 59 outbreaks in domestic birds, 44 in other birds and mammals in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Since December 2024, there have been human cases of H5N1 in the US, UK, India, Mexico, Cambodia, and Vietnam. 'In biological terms, these are huge leaps across species barriers - it's not just a jump from ducks to pigeons,' said Caitlin Rivers. 'The possibility of the virus continuing to spread and becoming a threat to humans grows every day.' If left unchecked, she warns of the possibility of a 'sudden change.' 'It's a virus known for liking to change and adapt,' she said. 'There is an old concern that, the more it circulates, the more paths it finds to modify. It could be a steady march gaining strength.'

**Avian Flu in the US: Experts Warn of Decreased Vigilance and Potential Pandemic Risk**
The number of human cases of H5N1 avian flu in the US has decreased significantly over the past three months, with no new cases reported since January 14. However, experts in public health are warning that this may be due to a lack of vigilance, social and political barriers, and budget cuts in key agencies, rather than a seasonal decline. The virus has infected 70 people, mostly farm workers exposed to infected animals, with only one death. California, one of the states with the most reports, has significantly reduced the number of tests performed, from at least 50 people per month in late 2024 to only three in March 2025. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert, suggests that many mild cases may not be reported, especially in vulnerable communities. Angela Rasmussen, a Canadian virologist, blames the decline in surveillance on the Trump administration and the fear of persecution among immigrant farm workers. The recent resignations and layoffs in the USDA and FDA have also affected the ability to respond to zoonotic outbreaks. Despite this, some research efforts continue, including a study in Texas to investigate possible exposures to the virus among farm workers and a study in Maryland to investigate cases of avian flu in domestic cats. Experts insist that vigilance must be strengthened, as the risk of a future pandemic is still considered 'moderate' by the CDC.

**Another global pandemic fears rise as H5N1 bird flu spreads across US farms**
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread rapidly across US dairy farms, affecting over 1,000 herds since March 2024. This has raised serious public health concerns, as the virus can infect mammals, including humans. Over 70 human infections have been reported, with at least one fatality confirmed in Louisiana in January 2025. The Global Virus Network has warned of the risk of the virus mutating and developing the capacity for human-to-human transmission, which could lead to a pandemic. Health officials, including Dr. Sten H. Vermund and Dr. Marc Johnson, have emphasized the importance of proactive monitoring, vaccination programmes, and robust testing measures to control the spread of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has clarified that the current public health risk remains low, but urges people with close contact with animals to follow precautionary guidelines.

**Leaked China CDC Document Confirms New H5N1 Strain More Contagious In Humans**
A leaked internal notice from China's National Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has confirmed a new mutant strain of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has increased human contagion risk. The notice stated that the H5N1 variant (A/H5N1-2025E) has a new mutation in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein gene, increasing its ability to bind to mammalian cells and the risk of human-to-human transmission. As of March 12, 127 samples nationwide tested positive for the mutant strain, with 68% from live poultry market environments and 25% from asymptomatic carriers among poultry workers. Experts warn that the consequences of human-to-human transmission will be disastrous, with a historic mortality rate of H5N1 in humans reported by the World Health Organization at around 50%. The U.S. CDC has noted that only one of the 70 cases of human infection of H5N1 bird flu detected in the United States since 2024 has died. China's health authorities have taken measures to increase monitoring of human bird flu infections, but the public remains uninformed about the real reason for these measures. Dr. Sean Lin, a former U.S. army microbiologist, called for the U.S. government to put pressure on the Chinese regime to disclose the situation of avian influenza infecting humans and pigs, and the threat it poses.

**Everything You Need to Know About Bird Flu**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus has been spreading globally, infecting over 960 people since 2003, killing roughly half of them. In the United States, it has infected dozens of people, mainly farm workers, and killed its first person in January 2025. The virus has also appeared in dairy cows in Texas, causing concern for the dairy industry. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) rate the public health risk as low, but the situation could change. Scientists are working on H5N1 vaccines for poultry and dairy cows, but it's uncertain whether they will be deployed. The virus has shown to be highly adaptable, with new variants emerging, and it's possible that it could evolve to spread easily among humans. However, as of spring 2025, there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human H5N1 transmission in the United States. Researchers believe that the virus would have to change its hemagglutinin to recognize a sugar arrangement found in the human upper respiratory tract to facilitate person-to-person transmission. They are also studying the role of disease history and immunity in the spread of the virus. The CDC has found that three dairy veterinarians had antibodies to H5N1, indicating they'd been infected, but had never noticed symptoms. The virus has also acquired new gene variants, which may be a factor in its spread. 'The thing about this virus is, every time we think we know what's going to happen, it does something totally unexpected,' says Michelle Wille, a virus ecologist at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne, Australia. 'And that's the only consistent thing I can say about it.'

**US Avian Influenza Outbreak Raises Concerns of Potential Pandemic**
The H5N1 avian influenza virus is spreading rapidly in the United States, with 70 human cases reported since 2024. While the number of cases is still relatively small, the virus has infected a wide range of animals, including cattle, wolves, bears, and domestic cats. The virus has also shown a high degree of mutation, with 15 of the human cases being caused by a different strain of the virus. Researchers are concerned that this mutation could lead to a more severe disease. The US government's response to the outbreak has been criticized as inadequate, with some experts warning that the country is not prepared for a potential pandemic. The Trump administration's restructuring of the government's health agencies has also raised concerns, with some experts warning that the changes could weaken the country's ability to respond to a pandemic. A recent Gallup poll found that 20% of Americans believe that vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they are intended to prevent, a number that has doubled since 2019. The poll also found that 31% of Republicans believe that vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they are intended to prevent, a number that has increased significantly since 2019. The Trump administration's restructuring of the government's health agencies has also led to a significant reduction in the number of experts working on infectious disease research and response. The CDC has reduced its workforce by 10%, and the FDA has reduced its workforce by 1000 employees. The USDA has also reduced its workforce by 25%, including experts working on avian influenza. Experts are warning that these changes could weaken the country's ability to respond to a pandemic. 'The restructuring is weakening the CDC and the nation's ability to respond to new infectious disease threats,' said David Fleming, a member of the CDC's advisory committee. 'This is the worst time to weaken our preparedness posture.'

**Scientists Warn of Potential Avian Influenza Pandemic, Call for Immediate Action**
A group of scientists have published a letter in the journal Science warning of the potential for an avian influenza pandemic. They are calling for immediate action to prepare for a possible outbreak of H5N1, which has already infected humans in the US and caused severe illness. 'Preparing now can save lives and reduce social and economic impacts if H5N1 or another virus leads to a pandemic,' the letter states. The scientists, led by Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, note that the virus has already crossed species and adapted to mammalian hosts, including cattle, causing widespread exposure and sporadic infections in humans. They emphasize the need for urgent action to address gaps in preparedness, including the development of an effective vaccine that can be produced in large quantities quickly. They also stress the importance of equitable access to the vaccine, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, they recommend implementing a communication strategy based on scientific data to address public concerns and rebuild trust in public health. Finally, they suggest testing pandemic response plans in a transparent and collaborative manner, transcending political divisions. Currently, human infections have been contained, with 88 reported cases worldwide since January 2024, and 5 reported cases in 2025. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the risk of zoonotic transmission, including H5N1, is low for the general population, but moderate for individuals exposed professionally, depending on risk mitigation measures in place.

**Avian Influenza Spreading Silently Among Humans, Study Suggests**
A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Cdc) suggests that the H5N1 avian influenza virus may be spreading silently among humans in the United States. The study, which analyzed blood samples from 150 veterinarians who worked with cattle, found that three of them had antibodies to the virus, indicating a recent infection. However, none of the three reported any symptoms associated with avian influenza, such as respiratory problems or conjunctivitis, and none of them used protective gear for their respiratory or eye areas. The study's lead researcher notes that the results do not reflect the current situation in the US, as the blood samples were collected between June and September last year, before the launch of a national testing program for milk. Nevertheless, the study suggests the need for better surveillance not only of animals but also of people who work with them. Dr. Bassetti said, 'Casi anche asintomatici' (even asymptomatic cases). The study suggests that the virus may be spreading more widely than previously thought, and the number of infected people could exceed the 70 reported cases in March 2024.

**Unprecedented bird flu shift leaves experts 'deeply concerned': 'Coughing and sneezing'**
A new strain of bird flu, the D1.1 genotype, has been detected in dairy cattle in the United States, leaving experts 'deeply concerned'. According to the USDA, this is the first time the D1.1 genotype has been found in animals, and it has previously only been detected in wild birds, wild mammals, domestic poultry, and humans. Speaking to Yahoo News, an expert said, 'It's very concerning. It shows a new independent jump from birds to dairy cows.' The detection of the D1.1 genotype will likely complicate efforts to control the avian influenza outbreak, which has already led to the culling of 145 million birds since 2022. While the risk to the public remains low, some experts are concerned that the H5N1 strain could eventually mutate into a strain capable of human-to-human transmission.

**First Outbreak of Highly Pathogenic H5N9 Avian Influenza in California, USA**
The World Organisation for Animal Health (Woah) has confirmed the first outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N9 avian influenza in a duck farm in California, USA. The discovery was made parallel to the identification of the H5N1 strain in the same farm in Merced County, California. Almost 119,000 birds in the farm have been killed since the beginning of December. 'This is the first confirmed case of Hpai (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N9) in poultry in the United States,' said the US Department of Agriculture in its report to the Woah. The alert level is high in the US, where almost 650 poultry farms have been affected since the beginning of the new epidemic in 2022, totaling around 130 million birds. The Food and Drug Administration has also invited producers of dog and cat food that use raw or unpasteurized materials derived from poultry or cattle to update their food safety plans. In Italy, there have been 18 outbreaks of avian influenza since the beginning of the year, with the latest one confirmed in January in the province of Verona in a farm with 800,000 laying hens. The European Commission has signed a contract with the British pharmaceutical company Seqirus for the supply of 665,000 doses of human vaccine against the transmission of avian influenza. The vaccines are intended for people most exposed to the risk of transmission, primarily those working in poultry farms and veterinary services.
