**UK Defense Secretary: Taiwan's Future Must be Resolved Peacefully, US Warning is Correct**
UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said that Taiwan's future must be resolved peacefully, and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's warning is correct. Wallace stated that Austin was reiterating the fact that China's Communist Party has expressed its desire to unify Taiwan with mainland China, and they have always maintained that this should be done through diplomatic means. They have warned that any military action could be a threat, and this is what Austin meant. Austin said in his speech on Saturday that 'everyone must be clear that Beijing is genuinely preparing to use military force to change the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region.' He also stated that 'we know this. Xi has ordered his military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027, which is public knowledge. The People's Liberation Army is building the military needed to achieve this goal, and training every day to prepare for real action.' Austin emphasized that 'once again, I want to make it clear: any attempt by communist China to use force to conquer Taiwan will have devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. There is no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat posed by China is real and may be imminent. We hope it is not, but it is possible.' When asked if Austin's 'imminent' threat is real, Wallace replied that 'Xi has told his military that he hopes they can be prepared in two years to take Taiwan by force if necessary. This is the risk we face, and this is why diplomacy and some military deterrence are so important, as they can confuse and perhaps change China's calculations in the Indo-Pacific region.' Wallace added that 'but Austin's point is that we should not take military steps, but rather diplomatic ones, and we agree with that. I and Austin have been cooperating closely in many areas.' When asked if the 'imminent' threat is real or just Austin's rhetoric, Wallace said that 'I think Austin's warning is correct, and he is accurately assessing China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region.'

Additionally, the UK Royal Navy's 'Prince of Wales' aircraft carrier strike group is set to visit the Indo-Pacific region, and UK Defense Chief of Staff Tony Radakin said in a panel discussion in Singapore over the weekend that the principle of freedom of navigation is just as important in the Indo-Pacific as it is in the English Channel. Radakin emphasized that 'for the UK, maintaining the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and its principles of freedom of navigation is just as important in the Indo-Pacific as it is in the English Channel, which is why the UK Navy exercises freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific, including in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.'

**Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Warns of 'Ostrich-Like' Mentality Amid China's Military Threats**
Taiwanese Progressive Party Chairman Wang Hsing-huan warned that Taiwan cannot afford to be in a ' ostrich-like' mentality, ignoring the possibility of war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently stated that China's military action against Taiwan 'may be imminent' and urged allies in the Indo-Pacific region to increase their defense budgets to deter China. Wang pointed out that various US think tanks, frontline Indo-Pacific commanders, and naval combat forces have warned that China will launch an invasion of Taiwan in 2027. China has also set a goal of 'winning a local war' by 2027. Wang emphasized that China's ideal script for invading Taiwan is to 'encircle and blockade' the island, creating pressure on Taiwanese society through localized military actions, and then using pro-China parties in Taiwan to advocate for 'peace talks' and shape international opinion to accept unification. He stated, 'Those who advocate for peace talks are Taiwan's enemies.' To counter China's military threats, Wang suggested that Taiwan must strengthen its military deterrent, solidify its alliances with Indo-Pacific nations, and cultivate an 'unyielding resistance spirit' to prevent China from launching an invasion. 'If China expects a blockade to lead to a long-term war and international sanctions, it will be hesitant to launch an invasion,' Wang said.

**US Warns of Imminent Chinese Attack on Taiwan, China Responds with Fury**
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has warned that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan could be imminent. He stated that Xi Jinping has ordered his army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Hegseth also emphasized that the US is ready to counter China's hegemonic ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. The US has 'returned' to the region and is 'here to stay', but Hegseth urged countries to take responsibility for their own defense without relying on the US. China has responded harshly, saying that the Taiwan issue is 'purely internal' and that no foreign country has the right to interfere. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also warned the US not to 'play with fire' and not to use the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had warned that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is increasing its defence spending, aiming to reach 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is on track to receive eight new nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS agreement.

**China Warns US Not to 'Play with Fire' Over Taiwan**
China has warned the US not to 'play with fire' over Taiwan, in response to comments from US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who accused Beijing of preparing an 'imminent' invasion of the island and attempting to alter the regional balance in Asia. 'The Taiwan issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere,' said the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson in a statement released at midnight. Beijing has expressed its 'firm opposition' and 'deep discontent' with what it considered a 'provocative and inciting' speech by Hegseth, who on Saturday warned that the Chinese military 'practices daily' a possible invasion of Taiwan and hinted at the supposed intention to do so before 2027. 'Let me be clear: any attempt by the Communist Party of China to conquer Taiwan by force will result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world. The Chinese threat is real. And it could be imminent,' emphasized the Pentagon chief on Saturday. China has also warned the US not to 'harbor illusions' about using the Taiwan issue as a bargaining chip to contain China, and has announced a formal protest to Washington.

**US Defense Secretary Announces China's Planned Invasion of Taiwan**
US Defense Secretary Pita Hegset announced that China will invade Taiwan within two years. He stated, 'The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been instructed to reach the capacity to invade Taiwan by 2027. They are building the necessary military power, training every day, and conducting realistic exercises.' Hegset warned that any Chinese annexation attempt could have devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. 'The threat posed by China is real and could become a reality very soon. We hope it doesn't, but it certainly could.' he said. Chinese Military Academy Vice President Hu Gangfeng responded to Hegset's allegations, saying, 'We do not accept any baseless accusations against China. These accusations are fabrications, distorted facts, and claims made by those who are directly responsible for the crime.' Hegset made these comments in Singapore, where he met with US military personnel and participated in a training session.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**How the US plans to fight off Chinese invasion of Taiwan**
The US Special Forces conducted a drill simulating a war between the US and China over Taiwan. The scenario, which began with Chinese ships crossing the Taiwan Strait with the intention to invade, quickly escalated into chaos with hostile drones and explosions. The drill was a response to Chinese President Xi Jinping's order to be ready to 'reunify' Taiwan with the mainland by 2027. The Chinese military has been building up its forces, boasting one million more troops than the US, a larger navy, and a growing nuclear arsenal set to reach 1,000 warheads by 2030. 'Attention on the floor!' a soldier shouted, 'Sorry to barge in, sir, but you'll want to hear this.' Chinese ships have begun to cross the Taiwan Strait 'with full intention to invade.'

**China's Military Enhances Ability to Launch Surprise Attack on Taiwan, US Officials Express Concern**
According to a Financial Times report, Taiwan and US officials and experts say that China is rapidly enhancing its ability to launch a surprise attack on Taiwan, with the goal of having the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027. The report states that China's air force and missile forces are ready to launch an attack at any moment, and that the Chinese military has been conducting frequent amphibious landing exercises near Taiwan's ports. Additionally, China has deployed new rocket systems that can strike key targets on the island. US military officials have expressed concern that China's military activities are becoming increasingly aggressive, with Chinese warplanes entering Taiwan's air defense identification zone over 245 times per month, up from less than 10 times per month five years ago. A US defense official stated, 'This is a clear indication that China's air threat to Taiwan is escalating and intensifying.' The report also notes that US intelligence agencies believe that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered the military to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027. US officials have expressed concern that Taiwan's self-defense capabilities will be crucial in deterring a Chinese invasion, and that the US and its allies must prepare for a possible conflict. A US official stated, 'I have confidence that if Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party really do what they've committed to doing, if they really try to occupy this island, to start this war, we will win, we will defeat them, but tens of thousands of people will die.' Taiwan officials have also expressed concern, with one official stating, 'Taiwan is very dangerous, Taiwan is basically always at risk of being attacked by China, regardless of whether it's the KMT or DPP in power, they just want to attack us.' The report also notes that China is learning from the Ukraine war, with US experts warning that China is observing the international community's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and is using it to evaluate its own attitude towards Taiwan. A US expert stated, 'If Russia can invade a sovereign state, occupy parts or all of Ukraine, and no one really stops him, China will fantasize about taking Taiwan and all the advanced semiconductors produced there, and no one will be surprised.'

**US Think Tank Warns of Nuclear War if China Invades Taiwan in 2030**
A recent report by the Atlantic Council, a US think tank, has warned that if China were to invade Taiwan in 2030, the Korean Peninsula could become a second battlefield, and a nuclear war may be unavoidable. The report, titled 'Guardian Tiger II', simulated a hypothetical scenario in which China launches a large-scale conventional war against Taiwan, leading to a US-China confrontation. According to the report, North Korea would play a significant role in this conflict, with China and North Korea sharing intelligence and North Korea launching short-range ballistic missiles at US military bases in South Korea. The report warns that the conflict could escalate into a nuclear war, with China using nuclear weapons to cut off Taiwan's external aid and then invoking a military alliance treaty with North Korea to justify its intervention in the Korean Peninsula. The report also suggests that the US may struggle to make a quick decision on whether to use nuclear force in response to North Korea's provocations, given the complexity of the situation. Experts are calling for the US to reorganize its command and control systems in the Indo-Pacific region and to engage in regular trilateral security talks with South Korea and Japan to address the synchronized threats from China and North Korea.

**Taiwan's Mine-Laying Defense: A Crucial Task in the Face of Chinese Invasion**
According to a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), if China were to invade Taiwan, it would prioritize attacking ports rather than beaches. The report, written by David Axe, a US military expert, cites a 2021 report by the 2049 Initiative, which states that Taiwan's Taichung Port, Kaohsiung Port, Mailiao Port, Taipei Port, and Anping Port would be the main potential targets. Taiwan's defense department's primary defense task would be to deploy mines, and the timing would need to be carefully managed within a short period before actual combat. However, it is unclear whether Taiwan's leaders are aware of this. Axe quotes Ian Easton, a researcher at the 2049 Initiative, who states that due to the lack of infrastructure for unloading large transport vessels and the exposed position of landing on beaches, China would have to target ports. Taiwan's defense department's primary defense task is to deploy mines, as they are cheap, difficult to detect and clear, and effective in deterring and repelling attacks. According to Chris O'Flaherty, a retired British Royal Navy captain with extensive experience in mine deployment, the waters around Taiwan are ideal for laying mines, with many rocks and rapids, and Taiwan's anti-ship missiles would slow down the clearing of mines. However, it is unclear whether Taiwan's leaders are aware of this. Taiwan's navy lacks sufficient mine-laying ships to quickly deploy mines around each target port and update them. Currently, Taiwan has only 4 fast mine-laying ships in service, with 10 more 400-ton ships under construction or planned, but it will take several years for them to join the fleet. Axe suggests that Taiwan should quickly act, even combining commercial ships to lay mines, before the invasion begins. However, this preparation work must be completed quickly. In theory, it can be started now, but it may affect trade navigation and reveal positions, and provide Beijing with a pretext for viewing it as a legitimate reason for attack. Axe believes that Taiwan should act quickly, even combining commercial ships to lay mines, before the invasion begins. However, even with concentrated mobilization of available ships, it may still not be enough. US retired Admiral James Winnefeld has called on the US military to prepare to assist Taiwan in laying mines. US submarines can lay mines from underwater, and stealth bombers can lay mines from the air. However, the report notes that Taiwan should not rely on the US, especially with the current president's unpredictability. Taiwan should not assume that symbolic mine-laying work is enough, but rather needs to be dense and have the actual ability to destroy invading fleets, not just deter them. After all, Beijing may be willing to pay a large price in ships and lives to achieve its goal of annexing Taiwan.

**China's Invasion of Taiwan: The Importance of Port Defense**
According to a recent article by David Axe, a US military expert, if China were to invade Taiwan, it would prioritize attacking ports rather than beaches. The article cites a 2021 report by the 2049 Project, which states that the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) lacks the infrastructure to unload large transport vessels and that landing on beaches would expose them to attack. As a result, the PLA would likely target Taiwan's ports, with five ports - Taichung Port, Kaohsiung Port, Mailiao Port, Taipei Port, and Anping Port - being potential targets. To counter this, Taiwan's military would need to deploy mines, but it is unclear whether the country's leaders are aware of this. According to Ian Easton, a researcher at the 2049 Project, the success of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would depend on the PLA's ability to occupy, control, and utilize Taiwan's large ports. Axe notes that Taiwan's military has a limited number of mine-laying vessels, and that even if all available vessels were mobilized, it may not be enough to create a sufficient minefield to deter the PLA. Axe suggests that Taiwan should rapidly deploy mines, even using commercial ships if necessary, to create a minefield that can effectively deter the PLA. However, it is unclear whether Taiwan's leaders are aware of this and are taking necessary steps to prepare.

**Taiwan Strengthens Cybersecurity in Response to China's Maneuvers**
Taiwan is strengthening its cybersecurity in response to China's maneuvers. The government has launched the National Cybersecurity Plan 2025-2028 and increased the defense budget by 3%. This decision is not random, but rather a measure to mitigate the increased military presence of China, which has increased by 82.5% between 2022 and 2024. Taiwan's cybersecurity is a key pillar at the domestic level, with some examples dating back to when Lai was Prime Minister (2017-2019) and promoted a plan for the development of the industry, the law that regulates information security, and the creation of institutions related to digital development and security. The current government is preparing to resist the worst scenario in 2027, when Beijing plans to complete the modernization of its armed forces, allowing the People's Liberation Army to execute a total blockade in the strait, according to the US Indo-Pacific Command and sources from the Ministry of Defense consulted in Taipei. However, not everyone agrees with this hypothesis. Chen Yeong-Kang, a legislator and former head of the Navy, argues that 'the greatest threat is not missiles, but cybersecurity, crisis management, communication, and essential services.' He emphasizes that the real risk lies in the digital and strategic wear and tear of the island. According to Chen, in 2035, China will complete its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), redefining its relations with Taiwan from an economic and strategic perspective. With a projected GDP above that of the US, 'China could opt for cooperation rather than direct confrontation,' he highlights. The real battlefield is not in the strait, but in cyberspace. While China intensifies its digital coercion without risking its reputation among Taiwan's allies, the island is strengthening its cybersecurity with the support of the US, the UK, and the OECD, according to its new national strategy. By facing one of the world's most sophisticated cyber actors, Taiwan demonstrates once again that its resilience is its greatest defense.

**Date China will invade Taiwan revealed by former intelligence officer**
A former British military intelligence officer, Philip Ingram MBE, has predicted that China will invade Taiwan within the next two years. Ingram, now a journalist and geopolitical analyst, compared China's building of 'invasion barges' to Russia's forward deployment of blood stocks before its attack on Ukraine. He stated that 'the China exercises going around Taiwan are becoming more and more sophisticated, they are practising that power projection capability.' Ingram estimated that China will have the naval and military forces needed to take Taiwan militarily by early to mid-2027. He warned that a Chinese attack on Taiwan is a foregone conclusion, saying 'you don't build that sort of thing unless you've made the decision to go. I would say we are in a game of when not if when it comes to Taiwan.'

**Taiwan's military exercises to focus on invasion preparation**
Taiwan's military is conducting exercises focused on preparing for a potential invasion by China in 2027, a deadline previously mentioned by security experts and military officials. Former US Navy admiral Philip Davidson warned that China could attempt to invade Taiwan by 2027, while Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly instructed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be prepared for an invasion by then. However, Su Tzu-yun, a fellow at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, noted that there is no clear indication a formal decision has been made to resort to force by then. Security analysts worldwide have urged their governments to prepare for a possible conflict, and the Han Kuang exercises' focus on 2027 is a logical response to these concerns, according to Su. 'It could create a perfect storm,' he said, 'if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership.' The defence ministry's 'immediate response drills' were specifically designed to deter China from 'turning exercises into war,' Su added. 'The principle of risk control was followed,' he said. 'It is normal to use timelines as a reference for defence strategy,' Su noted. 'The US military must be prepared for contingencies before then,' said former US Indo-Pacific commander John Aquilino. 'China is accelerating its military expansion, particularly in dual-use shipyards and nuclear weapons launch platforms,' said US Air Force Strategic Commander General Anthony Cotton. 'These developments align with preparations to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027,' he added. 'The US should expedite its own military production in response,' Cotton said. 'It is a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,' said former CIA director William Burns, describing Xi's directive to the PLA. 'China is accelerating its military expansion,' Burns added. 'It will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' said Davidson. 'Whether or not China launches an invasion in 2027, it will continue efforts to weaken US influence in the Indo-Pacific,' he added. 'Alternative deadlines have been proposed, including 2035 and 2049, both of which mark major PLA anniversaries,' Su noted. 'However, if Xi seeks a fourth term, he may take military risks to justify his leadership,' he warned.

**'2045': A Board Game Simulating a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan**
The Taiwanese board game '2045' simulates a Chinese invasion of Taiwan 20 years in the future. Players must make strategic decisions to prevent the Chinese forces from taking over the island. The game's creator, Chang Shao-lian, explains that '2045' is different from their previous game, which required players to cooperate to win. 'We decided to move away from romanticism and create a game rooted in realism,' he says. The game has raised $122,160 through a crowdfunding campaign and has consulted with experts, including military personnel, political analysts, and national security specialists, to make the game as realistic as possible. Ruth Zhong, a 36-year-old player, says, 'I thought (using a nuclear bomb) was a necessary action to ensure the survival of the island.' The game's creator, Lai Boyea, notes that the game's scenarios are based on real-life exercises conducted by the Chinese military and that the game's developers have studied real attacks to enhance the game's technical credibility.

**Taiwan players go nuclear in Chinese invasion board game**
The Taiwanese board game 2045 simulates a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, challenging players to make strategic decisions to secure the island's freedom. The game's release comes as China maintains military pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. According to Mizo Games founder Chang Shao-lian, 2045 is different from previous war games, as it requires players to make individual decisions based on the evolving situation, rather than cooperating to win. The game's creators consulted experts on military personnel, national security, and political analysts to ensure its realism. Ruth Zhong, a 36-year-old player, said, 'The most interesting part of this game is that you have to make continuous decisions based on the evolving situation, and these choices can alter the entire history of Taiwan in an instant.' Zhong also noted that the game shows the limits of people's willingness to assist others in a crisis, saying, 'Its value lies in showing players that even in a game, or in real life, your allies won't necessarily help you unconditionally.'
