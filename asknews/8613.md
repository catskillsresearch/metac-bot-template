**UK Announces Nuclear Submarine and Ammunition Factory Plans in Response to 'Russian Threat'**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a comprehensive rearmament plan for the UK, including the construction of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six new ammunition factories. The initiative is part of the government's effort to prepare the country for what Starmer called 'the most serious, immediate, and unpredictable threat since the Cold War.' According to Starmer, the UK is facing a war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber attacks, and increasing Russian aggression in its waters and airspace. In response, Starmer advocated for the strengthening of deterrence: 'When we are directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be prepared and, frankly, to show them that we are prepared to establish peace by force.' The plan includes the replacement of the current fleet of seven nuclear-powered attack submarines with up to 12 new units equipped with conventional armaments, developed under the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia, and expected to enter service by the end of the 2030s. The government will also allocate £15 billion (approximately R$ 115 billion) for the country's nuclear deterrent program, which Starmer called 'the ultimate guarantee of our security.' Additionally, the creation of six new ammunition factories is expected to increase the sector's production capacity and generate approximately 1,000 jobs, with an additional £6 billion (R$ 46 billion) budget during this legislative period.

**UK Must Prepare for War, Says Labour Leader Keir Starmer**
UK must prepare for war, said Labour leader Keir Starmer in a defense industry in Scotland on Monday, presenting a report on the state of the country's defense. - The threat we face today is more serious, less predictable, and more immediate than anything we've seen since the end of the Cold War. We are facing a war in Europe, a new nuclear threat, cyber attacks, increased Russian aggression in our territorial waters and airspace, and their reckless behavior is leading to increased living costs in our country. This is a new era for security and defense, said Starmer. The British government has announced an increase in defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and now aims to reach 3%. Six new ammunition factories will be built to replenish the army's dwindling stockpiles, which are being depleted as artillery ammunition is sent to Ukraine. A new generation of nuclear weapons and submarines is being developed, and new drones, ships, and aircraft will be acquired to increase naval capabilities. The Times reports that the government is considering purchasing American F35A fighter jets to be able to launch nuclear weapons from the air. However, there are question marks about the pace of the buildup. - I'm not going to engage in fantasy politics and take dates out of the air now, said Starmer when pressed by the BBC about when the 3% target will be met. Ministers have spoken of 'the end of the next parliamentary term' - but within Starmer's Labour Party, criticism is growing that they have already cut aid and support for poor families. Meanwhile, the center and right-wing opposition argue that it is happening too slowly. Former army chief Richard Dannatt is among those who criticize the pace of the buildup. - A vague goal of increasing defense spending to 3% by 2034 is not enough, it's like asking Adolf Hitler to wait until 1946 to attack us in 1938, he said.

**Egypt Calls for Israel's Accession to Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty**
Egypt's Foreign Minister, Dr. Badr Abdel Ati, called for Israel's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear state, noting that 'the current treaty imbalance regarding the commitments of countries in the context of non-proliferation in the Middle East exacerbates the instability in the region.' Abdel Ati made this statement during a meeting with the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, on June 2, 2025. Abdel Ati emphasized that 'Israel remains the only state in the region that has not joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty and refuses to submit its nuclear facilities to the Agency's guarantees.' He expressed his hope that the Director General would make efforts to implement the annual resolution adopted by the General Conference of the Agency regarding the application of guarantees in the Middle East. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry's official spokesperson, Tameem Khalaf, stated that the Minister appreciated the Agency's vital role in supporting regional security and stability through promoting the principles of nuclear non-proliferation and expanding the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes serving sustainable development goals. He also praised the Director General's achievements since taking office in late 2019, particularly his active participation in climate change conferences, including the 2022 Sharm el-Sheikh Summit, which significantly contributed to the international recognition of the positive role that nuclear energy can play in combating climate change and adapting to its consequences. The spokesperson highlighted Egypt's efforts to utilize peaceful nuclear applications to serve national development goals, particularly through the project to establish a nuclear power plant in Dabaa, which is a significant step in this direction. He emphasized the importance of strengthening cooperation with the Agency and benefiting from its technical expertise to ensure the implementation of the highest international standards in nuclear safety and security. This project, he added, will open up wider horizons for Egypt in its comprehensive development journey.

**New twist in Russia-Ukraine war as Britain asks for US nuclear-capable fighter jets to..., Starmer govt accuses Putin of...**
The UK is reportedly in talks with the US to acquire a fleet of nuclear-capable fighter jets to enhance its nuclear deterrence against Russia. According to reports, the UK plans to equip US-made fighter jets with nuclear missiles, which could be the largest expansion in UK's nuclear deterrence capabilities. The move has the support of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who believes the world faces its worst nuclear threat since the Cold War era. The UK currently lacks the capability to launch nuclear strikes from the air, but acquiring the US-made F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets would allow it to do so. The deal would also enable the UK to launch nuclear strikes from air, vastly enhancing its deterrence capabilities. Additionally, the Starmer government plans to manufacture 7,000 long-range weapons and increase its defense spending to 3% of the country's GDP by 2034.

**Top Gun! British fighter jets will soon carry nuclear weapons for the first time ever as part of biggest defence expansion since the Cold War | Daily Mail Online**
The UK government, led by Defence Secretary John Healey and Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, is planning to purchase US fighter jets capable of launching gravity bombs with lower power than conventional nuclear weapons. This move is part of the largest defence expansion since the Cold War, with the goal of increasing defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034. The government has also announced a strategic defence review (SDR) to explore 'deliverable and affordable' solutions within the resources available to defence. Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition, has stated that increasing the resilience of Britain is 'vital' in an 'ever more dangerous world.' The new defence money will be found by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said, 'This Government has announced the largest sustained increase to defence spending since the end of the Cold War.'

**Agenda for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Review Conference Still Unclear**
The Preparatory Committee for the 2026 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has concluded without reaching a consensus on the agenda. Despite the urgency of the nuclear issue, countries failed to agree on transparency and accountability measures. Florian Eblenkamp, an advocacy officer for the International Coalition Against Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), emphasized that the non-proliferation norm must not be allowed to collapse under geopolitical cynicism. Ambassador Harold Agyeman, the committee's chair, stated that the success of the review conference in 2026 depends on the political will of state parties to demonstrate progress on their obligations and strengthen accountability. Reaching Critical Will nominated Ambassador Dang Hoang Giang, Permanent Representative of Vietnam to the United Nations, expressed confidence that collective wisdom and shared determination can lead to meaningful progress. However, the presence and threat of nuclear weapons loom large, and the international community must remain vigilant in advocating for the NPT and other disarmament treaties.

**US, Saudi Arabia on pathway to agree on civil nuclear agreement**
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced that the United States and Saudi Arabia are on a 'pathway' to sign a preliminary agreement to cooperate on Saudi Arabia's civil nuclear industry development. However, Wright noted that Saudi Arabia has not agreed to the non-proliferation criteria required under Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which would permit the US to work with Saudi entities to develop a civil nuclear industry. Wright stated that 'there will definitely be a 123 agreement' but emphasized that there are 'lots of ways to structure a deal' that would meet both US and Saudi objectives. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has previously stated that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would follow suit, fueling concerns among arms control advocates and US lawmakers. The agreement is part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 reform plan, which aims to generate substantial renewable energy and reduce emissions.

**René Obermann Warns of Russian Attack on NATO and Recommends German Nuclear Weapons**
René Obermann, former CEO of Deutsche Telekom and current Airbus supervisory board chairman, warns that Russia may attack NATO before 2029. He believes that Russia is preparing for a war on the NATO's eastern flank and that Putin's aggressive behavior towards the West is a sign of this. Obermann suggests that Germany should acquire its own nuclear weapons to protect itself from Russia's 5580 nuclear warheads. He proposes that Europe should form a 'common shield' with shared governance and that the Ukraine should be supported 'with all available means'. Obermann also recommends that Europe should develop its own satellite constellation to reduce its dependence on the US. He criticizes the current EU satellite system, Iris, which will not be operational until 2030, as being 'too late' if Russia were to attack before then.

**China Accelerates Nuclear Development: Arsenal Approaching 1,000 Warheads**
According to a recent report by the Federation of American Scientists, China currently possesses around 600 nuclear warheads, with many more in production. The study highlights that China is developing its nuclear arsenal at the fastest rate among the nine nuclear-armed states, despite having signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The report, published by the Nuclear Information Project, reveals that since May 2024, China has continued to develop three new missile silo fields for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with solid fuel, as well as proceeding with the construction of new silos for its ICBMs DF-5 with liquid fuel. China is also advancing the development of new ICBM variants and advanced strategic launch systems. The report suggests that Beijing has produced excess warheads for these systems, ready to be used once the launchers are operational. The study also notes the Pentagon's projections, which indicate that China's arsenal will surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030. The 2024 report presented to the US Congress by the Department of Defense revealed that China could have around 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035. However, the Nuclear Notebook notes that the growth of the arsenal will depend on China's stockpiles of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and tritium. In 2023, the International Panel on Fissile Materials estimated that China possessed approximately 14 tons of HEU and around 2.9 tons of separated plutonium available for nuclear weapons.

**Amazon and Google Commit to Tripling Nuclear Capacity by 2050**
Amazon and Google have committed to tripling the world's nuclear capacity by 2050. This move comes as data centers struggle to keep up with energy demand, and companies are turning to alternative solutions. The nuclear option is now seen as key to ensuring a stable energy supply. According to Hugues Ferreboeuf, digital project manager at the Shift Project, data center energy consumption could triple by 2030, and Google's energy consumption is increasing by 20% annually. Google has partnered with Kairos Power to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) capable of producing 500 megawatts by 2035, while Amazon is supporting start-up X-Energy to create a fleet aiming for 5 gigawatts by 2039. Microsoft has signed a contract with Helion Energy to revive a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, with a goal of producing 837 megawatts by 2028. Meta has announced a call for American actors to exploit between 1 and 4 gigawatts using nuclear power by 2030. The US has over 2,000 data centers, and the demand is increasing, with a growing concern over energy supply. Tripling the nuclear capacity by 2050 will require massive investments and coordination between states and companies. The SMRs have the advantage of being able to be installed near data centers, but their deployment will not happen before several years. In the meantime, some companies may continue to use gas-fired power plants to meet their immediate needs. The uranium supply is also a key point, with some reactors requiring highly enriched uranium, mainly produced by Russia. According to Valérie Faudon, the European nuclear industry must invest to avoid dependence on foreign actors. The deployment of these reactors could follow a model similar to the aerospace industry, where companies with the ability to produce in series will dominate the market.

**55 Years of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons: Challenges and Concerns**
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has been in effect for 55 years, since March 5, 1970. The treaty was signed by 40 countries and aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament. The NPT defines the five official nuclear-armed states as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia. Other countries that have signed the treaty have voluntarily renounced their right to possess nuclear weapons. The treaty obliges nuclear states not to transfer nuclear weapons or control to non-nuclear states, and not to help them produce or acquire nuclear weapons. Non-nuclear states are not allowed to produce nuclear weapons or seek help to create or acquire them. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the treaty. The treaty allows its participants to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. As of now, 191 countries are parties to the treaty. The treaty has been the subject of several conferences, including the 5th conference in 1995, which decided to extend its indefinite duration. The 10th conference, held in 2022, ended without a final document due to disagreements between countries. The next review conference is scheduled to take place in New York in 2026. Russia has expressed concerns about the 'unprecedented scale' of the modernization of the US nuclear arsenal, including tactical nuclear weapons deployed in other countries. Other factors contributing to the treaty's degradation, according to Russian experts, include the US withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 2019 and the Open Skies Treaty in 2020, as well as the NATO's status as a nuclear-armed military bloc.

**Australia Warns of Spying on Nuclear-Powered Submarine Program and Threats to Foreign Dissidents**
Australian National Intelligence Director Mike Burgess warned on Wednesday that spies are targeting the country's nuclear-powered submarine program, and also warned of potential actions against foreign dissidents living in Australia. Burgess stated that the security situation in Australia is 'deteriorating'. Australia aims to acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines by 2040 as part of the AUKUS trilateral alliance with the US and UK, after unexpectedly abandoning a previous agreement with France. This strategic program is an attractive target, including for friendly countries, according to the head of the Australian National Security Agency. China has escalated its strong criticism of the AUKUS agreement, considering that transferring nuclear-powered submarines to Canberra violates non-proliferation rules and poses a threat to its security. Burgess stated in his speech in Canberra that foreign intelligence agencies are trying to understand the capabilities of future AUKUS submarines and how they will be deployed, as well as undermining the trust of allies in Australia. He believed that by 2030, they will try to undermine support for AUKUS and may seek to 'destroy' it if regional tensions escalate, adding that Australian defense personnel have been 'continuously targeted'. He also noted that 'some received gifts from their counterparts containing tracking devices'. Burgess also warned that terrorism remains a real threat, citing the possibility of lone-wolf and younger perpetrators. Regarding foreign dissidents living in Australia, he stated that 'investigations by the National Security Agency have identified at least three different countries that were planning to cause physical harm to individuals living in Australia... and in a few cases, we had serious concerns about the person's life'.

**State Duma to Discuss Agreement with Belarus on Security Guarantees and Extension of Maternal Capital Program**
The State Duma plans to discuss the ratification of the agreement with Belarus on security guarantees within the Union State, as well as consider in the second reading the draft laws on extending the program of maternal capital until December 31, 2030, and on the right of the Central Bank to annually determine the list of foreign currencies for the payment of the charter capital of credit organizations. The agreement with Belarus on security guarantees, signed in Minsk on December 6, 2024, was submitted to the State Duma for ratification in February by Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the text of the agreement, nuclear weapons of the Russian Federation may be used in response to the use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction against Russia or Belarus, 'as well as in the event of aggression against any of the parties using conventional weapons, creating a critical threat to its sovereignty or territorial integrity.' The sides consider a military attack on a participant in the Union State as an act of aggression against the Union State as a whole and will take corresponding countermeasures using all the forces and means at their disposal. As noted by the Chairman of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, the task of the deputies is to implement the decisions made at the level of the heads of the Union State. He emphasized that in the conditions of modern challenges, questions of ensuring security within a common defense space acquire key importance. The extension of the program of maternal capital The draft law on extending the program of maternal capital until December 31, 2030, was submitted to the State Duma by the Russian government in December 2024. Changes are proposed to be made to the Law 'On Additional Measures of State Support for Families with Children.' As stated in the explanatory note, about 5 million Russian families will have the right to maternal capital from 2027 to 2030. According to preliminary estimates, the implementation of the draft law will require additional expenses from the budget in 2027-2030 in the total amount of 2.776 trillion rubles. Volodin previously emphasized that support for families with children, future parents is a priority in the work of the deputies. He said that despite challenges, threats, and Western sanctions, the state fulfills not only all its obligations but also implements additional measures of support for citizens. The Chairman of the State Duma noted that this is the result of the work of the political system and the economic model created by the President of the Russian Federation. The right of the Central Bank to determine currencies for bank capital The State Duma will also consider a draft law granting the Board of Directors of the Central Bank the right to annually determine the list of foreign currencies that can be used to pay the charter capital of credit organizations, insurance organizations, and non-state pension funds. The document is initiated by a group of deputies and senators led by the Chairman of the Committee of the State Duma on the Financial Market, Anatoly Aksakov. The list of such currencies, presumably, may include the currencies of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries - Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Belarus, the currencies of the BRICS countries, including the Chinese yuan (currently allowed for use) and the Indian rupee, as well as the currencies of Brazil, South Africa, Argentina, Egypt, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia.

**FAQ: Is Turkey the Next Nuclear Proliferant State?**
Turkey is taking steps towards acquiring nuclear weapons, according to experts. The country has secured a provisional mining agreement with Niger to access uranium, which could be used to produce enriched uranium fuel. Turkey is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), but its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has long suggested that countries have a 'right to enrich' uranium. Erdogan's recent efforts to strengthen Turkey's influence in the region, particularly in Syria, increase the possibility that Ankara will seek nuclear weapons. Turkey's current capabilities regarding nuclear energy production are primarily reliant on Russian assistance, but it is developing a vast nuclear energy production program that could assist a nuclear weapons effort. Experts warn that Turkey would require time to acquire and develop key nuclear weapons capabilities, such as a source of fuel, expertise, and a means to integrate a nuclear warhead on a deliverable missile. Erdogan's aspiration to elevate Turkey as a great power and his emphasis on strengthening conventional military capabilities may also drive his interest in acquiring nuclear capabilities.
