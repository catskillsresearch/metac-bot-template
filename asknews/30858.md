The prices of eggs in Egypt have remained stable on Saturday, May 24, 2025, following the fluctuations in the past few weeks. The stability in egg prices reflects a relatively calm situation in the market, compared to periods that witnessed sharp fluctuations.

He added that the average annual per capita consumption of eggs in Egypt is 140 eggs, and that this vital industry provides employment opportunities for over 2 million workers.

**American shoppers shift to cheaper chicken | Ontario Farmer**
According to CoBank, American shoppers are shifting to cheaper chicken, resulting in increased sales. Chicken consumption is on pace to rise 1.5 pounds this year. In contrast, pork prices are expected to remain steady due to high costs, except for feed, which has decreased. The U.S. is predicted to overtake Europe as the leader in pork exports this year. Beef prices have continued to rise, exceeding $8.60 per pound, but demand has not slowed, with ample retail hamburger promotions. The composition of beef coming to market in 2024 has been derived more from fed cattle, with more steers entering the feedlot than last year, contributing to higher cattle weights.

**Egyptian Poultry Market Sees Decline in White Chicken Prices, Stability in Local Chickens and Eggs**
The Egyptian market witnessed a new decline in the prices of white chickens on Friday, May 23, 2025, while the prices of local chickens and cartons of eggs remained stable. This reflects a relative balance within the local poultry market, amidst continuous fluctuations due to supply and demand factors and production costs. The price of a kilogram of white chicken in the farm was around 85 pounds, a significant drop compared to previous days. This decline is attributed to an increase in supply and a decrease in demand in some areas, especially with the onset of summer, which usually sees a relative decline in the consumption of white meat. In retail stores, the price of a kilogram for the consumer ranged from 90 to 100 pounds, depending on the region, transportation costs, and traders' profit margins. This decline is considered an opportunity for consumers who want to buy protein at relatively lower prices. On the other hand, the prices of local chickens, preferred by a wide range of consumers for their quality and taste, remained stable. The price of a kilogram in retail stores was 122 pounds, reflecting a balance between supply and demand, amidst a growing trend towards natural and less processed food options. Cartons of eggs also remained stable, with a carton of red eggs selling for 127 pounds in wholesale markets, and ranging from 135 to 137 pounds for retail sales. White eggs sold for 123 pounds in wholesale markets, and between 130 and 133 pounds for retail sales, depending on the region. This stability is attributed to the availability of supply and stable production costs, especially after the end of the Ramadan season, which traditionally sees an increase in demand for eggs and poultry. The Egyptian poultry sector is one of the most affected by global economic changes, due to its heavy reliance on imported production inputs such as feed and vaccines, making prices susceptible to continuous fluctuations. Seasonal factors also play a crucial role, as summer sees a decline in consumption rates, with Egyptian families opting for cost-cutting measures. In this context, official bodies and the Poultry Producers Union continue to monitor the market to reduce the gap between farm prices and retail prices, by regulating intermediate channels and reducing unnecessary costs.

**Chicken Consumption Sees a Boost, but Demand is Now Declining**
Despite a recent decline, chicken consumption is currently at a good point. According to an industry expert, per capita consumption of chicken in the best months of 2024 surpassed that of beef (53 kg vs 47 kg), a reversal of the historical trend where beef was the most consumed meat. Arias noted, 'The consumption of chicken and pork decreased significantly, and that affected the demand for these products.' The increased demand led to higher prices and commercialization values for poultry products, causing some to approach the prices of traditional beef cuts. In response, demand stabilized and then began to decline in the last weeks of 2024 and the first month of 2025. An industry expert stated, 'We had to find a way to turn things around because demand was low, so we offered discounts and promotions. People used to come in, buy two chickens, and leave. Now they ask for the price, but they stick to their budget. A request for 10,000 pesos worth of chicken is becoming more common.'

**Argentina's Shift to Chicken: A Response to High Beef Prices**
In Argentina, a country famous for its cattle ranches and juicy beef, chicken is now the main dish. For the first time, the per capita consumption of birds surpassed that of beef in 2024, according to official data, as the consumption of red meat - more expensive - fell due to the three-digit inflation and austerity measures of President Javier Milei. The change, although part of a longer trend, highlights how Argentines are tightening their belts and adapting their diets. Milei's spending cuts stabilized the country's unstable economy, but in the short term, pushed over half of the population into poverty. The impact of prices 'The reality is that I eat more chicken because beef is much more expensive. Chicken yields much more', said Araceli Porres, 45, who has three jobs in Buenos Aires to support her family, and who usually prepares chicken stir-fry and milanesa. Data from the Rosario Grain Exchange showed that chicken consumption jumped to 49.3 kg per capita in 2024, surpassing beef, which fell to 48.5 kg - still the highest in the world, ahead of Uruguay and Brazil. Pork consumption rose to 17.7 kg per capita. 'Chicken consumption has grown and this is driven by price', said butcher Daniel López in a neighborhood outside Buenos Aires, explaining that the cheapest price of a kilogram of ground beef was between 5,000 and 6,000 pesos (5 to 6 dollars), against half the price of chicken. 'That's the difference, and today people are very careful with their wallets', said López. 'Salaries remain low, inflation is still felt, so people always ask about offers and we end up offering chicken, which is the best economic option.'

**Chicken Reigns Supreme in Argentina Amid Decline in Red Meat Consumption**
In Argentina, the land of haciendas and traditional grilled meats, chicken has become the new king due to the decline in red meat consumption. According to official data, in 2024, the 45 million inhabitants of the country consumed more chicken per capita than beef, a first in history. This change is part of a longer trend, showing how Argentines are adapting their diets due to economic austerity and high inflation under President Javier Milei's ultraliberal management. Araceli Porres, a 45-year-old woman from Buenos Aires, said, 'The reality is that we eat more chicken because meat is much more expensive. Chicken is more profitable.' Data from the Rosario Grain Exchange shows that chicken consumption increased to 49.3 kilograms per capita in 2024, surpassing beef consumption, which fell to 48.5 kilograms, the highest in the world. Pork consumption also rose to 17.7 kilograms. 'Chicken consumption has grown and that's driven by the price of meat,' said butcher Daniel López, explaining that the cheapest price for ground meat was between 5,000 and 6,000 pesos, while chicken legs or breasts cost between 2,000 and 2,500 pesos. 'That's the difference and today people are being very careful with their wallets. Salaries are stable, but inflation is still felt, so people always ask for offers and we end up offering chicken, which is the most economical option,' he added.

**From exotic treat to weekly staple, Australians are obsessed with chicken**
Australians are consuming more than 50 kilograms of chicken meat per person per year, making them world leaders in chicken consumption. According to food historian Lauren Samuelsson, the shift in chicken consumption can be attributed to a combination of cost and cultural factors. 'During World War II, prices were capped to stop overinflation of goods -- a pound of steak was about a sixpence, for chicken it was about four times as much,' Samuelsson says. The price of chicken has dropped significantly since then, making it a staple in Australian cuisine. Australians are now spending more than $8 billion a year on chicken meat, with the average person consuming two chicken-based meals per week. The industry is expected to continue growing, with the Australian government forecasting that each person will consume 52 kilograms of chicken meat per year by the end of the decade.

**Competitive retail prices bode well for chicken demand in 2025 says FCC**
According to a recent sector outlook from Farm Credit Canada, if chicken's retail price advantage over beef and pork persists, per capita consumption could rise in 2025 despite slowing population growth. Senior economist Graeme Crosbie wrote that all major proteins have seen major price increases at the grocery store since November 2020, with retail chicken prices increasing 24%, pork rising 14%, and retail beef prices jumping 39%. However, feed prices have declined since early 2023, putting downward pressure on farmgate prices for broilers, which has trickled down to retail chicken. Since early 2024, retail chicken prices have declined 3.7%, while pork prices rose 2.2% and beef climbed 9.6%. Crosbie expects retail chicken prices to remain competitive in 2025, and if the relative price advantage continues, chicken consumption per capita could increase, leading to a forecasted increase in production of 1.2%.
