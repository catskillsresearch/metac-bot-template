**Indian economy has potential to do much better than China in near future: Jim Rogers - Yes Punjab News**
Renowned investor Jim Rogers believes that India has the potential to surpass China in the near future, making it one of the most exciting investment destinations in the world. Rogers, who has been in the investment world for decades, praises the Indian government's understanding of economics and its efforts to open up to global trade. He notes that India's nominal GDP is expected to surpass Japan's in 2025, making it the world's fourth-largest economy. Rogers also emphasizes the importance of free trade agreements (FTAs) and believes that more FTAs will be beneficial for India and the world. India has already signed 13 FTAs and is currently negotiating several others, including an FTA with the EU and the UK. Rogers expresses his desire to invest more in India, stating that if the market goes down, he wants to put more money in the country. 'I think that the people in Delhi understand what needs to be done and are trying to do it. And that would be so wonderful for India and for the world,' Rogers said. 'If India can actually open up and have trade with the whole world. You cannot believe how exciting India can be in the future,' he added.

**India to overtake Japan as world's 4th largest economy in 2025, poised to surpass Germany by 2028: IMF**
According to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook, India is expected to overtake Japan as the world's fourth-largest economy in 2025, with a nominal GDP of $4,187.017 billion. India is also poised to surpass Germany by 2028, becoming the third-largest economy with a projected GDP of $5,584.476 billion. The United States and China are expected to remain the world's two largest economies in 2025. The IMF has revised India's GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 6.2%, down from 6.5% due to rising global uncertainty, particularly due to tariff-related policy decisions by US President Donald Trump. As the IMF report states, 'For India, the growth outlook is relatively more stable at 6.2% in 2025, supported by private consumption, particularly in rural areas, but this rate is 0.3 percentage point lower than that in the January 2025 WEO Update on account of higher levels of trade tensions and global uncertainty.'

**India to overtake Japan as fourth largest economy in 2025 | Mint**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that India will surpass Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy in 2025, with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.187 trillion. This shift would mark a significant milestone in India's economic ascent, underscoring its resilience and sustained growth momentum amid global uncertainties. However, India's growth forecast for 2025-26 has been lowered to 6.2% due to trade policy uncertainty and a broader cut in global trade forecasts. IMF's economic counsellor Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said, 'Likewise, financial institutions will re-evaluate their credit supply to businesses, until they can assess the latter's exposure to the new environment.' Despite the challenges, India's rise in the global economic rankings reflects its long-term growth potential, underpinned by robust domestic demand, a favourable demographic profile, and structural reforms aimed at boosting productivity and enhancing the investment climate.
