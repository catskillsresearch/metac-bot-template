**Chinese tourist arrivals in Spain surge amid record-breaking travel year: data**
According to the Spanish Tourism Institute (Turespana), the number of Chinese tourists visiting Spain rose by 26 percent in the first quarter of 2025, following a 66.7 percent increase in 2024. The total number of international visitors to Spain in the first four months of 2025 reached 25.6 million, putting the country on track to reach a record 100 million visitors this year. The growth in visitor numbers represents a 7.1 percent increase compared to the same period last year, when Spain set an all-time record of 93.8 million tourists. Turespana noted that the growing popularity of Spain among Chinese travelers is reflected in the doubling of direct flights between China and Spain since the pre-pandemic year of 2019, with 61 flights scheduled this summer. As sources at the tourism institute said, 'Spain is consolidating its position as an on-trend European destination in the Chinese market.'

**Visa crackdown on Chinese students coming, State Department’s Rubio says • NC Newsline**
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security will work to 'aggressively revoke' visas for Chinese students. This move is part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and battle with higher education. Rubio stated that the State Department will also 'revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.' According to Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the State Department, the US 'will not tolerate the CCP's exploitation of U.S. universities, or theft of U.S. research, intellectual property or technologies to grow its military power, conduct intelligence collection or repress voices of opposition.' However, the total number of students from China declined slightly from the 2022-23 school year, when that figure stood at more than 289,000. Students from other countries, including South Korea, Canada, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Nigeria, also comprised large groups of international students in the US during the 2023-24 school year.

**Algeria among top 5 nationalities of permanent residents in Quebec**
In 2024, Quebec continued to attract a significant number of permanent immigrants, with increasingly diverse geographic origins. Algerians are now among the top 5 nationalities of permanent residents. According to the 2025 demographic report published by the Institut de la statistique du Québec (ISQ), the migration movements added 156,700 people to the Quebec population, a figure among the highest in its history, although lower than the record of 193,000 in 2023. The decrease is mainly due to a decline in international migration gains, with an international migratory balance of 158,600 people compared to 200,300 the previous year. Non-permanent residents (NPR) - temporary workers, international students, and asylum seekers - continued to play a major role in demographic growth. Their number increased by 103,700 in 2024, bringing their total to 616,600 as of January 1, 2025. Although their contribution remains higher than that of permanent immigrants, it was less important than in 2023 (152,100). Quebec: Cameroon in the lead, Algeria in the top 5. In 2024, Quebec welcomed 59,500 permanent immigrants, a slightly higher figure than in 2023 (52,800). Nearly half (48%) of them had previously held a non-permanent resident status, a proportion much higher than in the early 2010s, where it was around 20%. Among these admissions, economic immigration dominated, representing 69% of the total. Family reunification accounted for 17%, while refugees and people in similar situations made up 12% of new arrivals. For the first time, Cameroon became the main country of origin of permanent immigrants to Quebec in 2024, with 7,327 admissions (15% of the total). France came in second place (12%), followed by China (8%), Tunisia (7%), Algeria (6%), and Morocco (5%). With 3,650 new permanent residents, Algeria thus confirmed its place among the top 5 nationalities in Quebec immigration. This growing presence reflects a diversification of migration flows, marked by a strong increase in African origins. 'This trend is part of a broader diversification of immigration to Quebec,' said an ISQ spokesperson. 'We are seeing a significant increase in the number of immigrants from Africa, particularly from countries such as Cameroon, Algeria, and Morocco.'

**Thailand's Tourism Industry Faces Challenges as Chinese Tourists Flock to Japan**
According to the Kasikorn Research Center and Japan's National Tourism Organization, Japan received 144 million foreign visitors in the first four months of the year, a 25% increase from the same period last year, with a record 39 million visitors in April alone. China's tourists to Japan have surged to 20 million, a 68% increase, making it the top destination for Chinese tourists. In contrast, the number of Chinese tourists to Thailand has decreased to 1.77 million, a significant decline. Flight data also shows that the proportion of direct flights from China to Japan has increased from 13% to 17.9%, while the proportion of flights to Thailand has decreased from 11% to 7.7%. The Thai tourism industry, which accounts for 20-25% of the country's GDP, is facing a significant challenge. Despite receiving 134 million foreign visitors in the first four months of the year, a 1.75% decrease from the same period last year, China remains Thailand's largest source of tourists, contributing 1.83 million visitors, but with a much weaker growth rate than Japan. The Kasikorn Research Center predicts that the number of Thai tourists to Japan will reach 12 million in 2025, with a consumption value of 54 billion baht. Thailand must quickly adjust its image, safety, and sustainable tourism services to prevent the tourism industry from becoming a less important driver of economic growth.

**Chinese Nationals Dominate Foreign Property Purchases in Korea**
According to the Ministry of Justice, this year, foreign nationals have purchased 4,169 apartments, houses, and commercial buildings in Korea, with Chinese nationals accounting for 66.9% of the total. The majority of Chinese purchases were concentrated in Gyeonggi Province, with 1,431 purchases in the province, followed by Incheon's Bupyeong-gu with 195 purchases. In Seoul, Chinese nationals accounted for 45.4% of foreign purchases, with a total of 243 purchases. However, in the high-end Gangnam area, American nationals accounted for 58 purchases, 4.8 times more than Chinese nationals. Despite this, Chinese nationals have been purchasing more and more properties in Korea, with their share of foreign property purchases increasing from 53.7% in 2022 to 56.2% in 2023. This has led to concerns about 'reverse discrimination' against Korean nationals, who are subject to stricter regulations and taxes when purchasing properties. 'Chinese nationals can purchase properties in Korea more easily than Korean nationals due to the lack of regulations and taxes,' said Professor Kim of Seoul National University. 'This is not a case of 'mutualism' being violated, but rather a case of unequal treatment.'

**Foreigners shun bright city lights for rural charms**
Foreigners in China are increasingly choosing lower-tier cities and rural areas for their authenticity, peacefulness, and affordability, rather than bustling metropolises. According to the Seventh National Population Census, the number of foreign nationals living on the Chinese mainland increased by 42.42% from 2010 to 2020, with Yunnan province alone accounting for 376,000 long-term foreign residents. Patrik Bachstatter, a 33-year-old Swedish expatriate, found a new home and calling in the ancient town of Dali, citing its clear air, mountains, and strong sense of community as key factors. As Bachstatter said, 'I read that Dali is known as the 'California of China'. It's not a big city, but it has good infrastructure and a lifestyle that's closer to nature. That really appealed to me, especially for my child's education.'

**Japa: Nigeria ranks 2nd among foreigners who migrated to the UK in 2024 [See Top 5]**
According to the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS), Nigeria has emerged as the second-highest source of long-term migrants to the UK in 2024, with 120,000 individuals.

The profile of non-EU+ migrants shows a relatively balanced gender distribution, with 52% male and 48% female, and 82% of migrants are of working age. The largest share of non-EU+ nationals, 417,000 people, migrated to the UK for work-related reasons, followed by study-related immigration, which brought in another 375,000 individuals. As stated by the ONS, these patterns reflect the UK's demand for foreign labour and its appeal as a global education hub.

**Foreign Tourists Flock to Off-the-Beaten-Path Destinations in China**
More and more foreign tourists are choosing to explore off-the-beaten-path destinations in China. According to the National Immigration Administration, the number of foreign tourists entering China increased by 82.9% in 2024 compared to the previous year, with a total of 648.8 million people. In the first quarter of 2025, this number reached 17.4 million, a 33.4% increase. The trend is driven by China's optimized visa policies, which have made it easier for foreigners to visit the country. 'I have fallen in love with China,' said John Jamiet, a French tourist, 'because we chose to take the road less traveled. If we had only visited big cities and eaten at popular restaurants, this trip would have been just like any other.' Jamiet and his wife visited Beijing, Shanxi's ancient city of Pingyao, Xi'an, and Guangxi's stunning natural scenery. They were impressed by the safety, cleanliness, and friendliness of the Chinese people. 'In the West, people have misconceptions about China, so it's necessary to see China's true face,' Jamiet said. 'China is not just a country with a long history and rich culture, but also a country with a modern and vibrant atmosphere.'

**Japan concerned birthdate decline in 2024**
Japan's birthrate has declined by 5% in 2024 to a record low of 720,988, including foreign nationals. If only Japanese nationals are counted, the number is likely to be below 700,000. This marks the lowest number of births since comparable records began in 1899. The Japanese government sees the years leading up to the 2030s as the 'last chance' to reverse the declining birthrate, but there are no indications that the trend is stabilizing. The population decline is accelerating, with the natural decrease hitting a record-high 897,696. Marriages increased by 2.2% to 499,999 couples, but the total remained below 500,000 for the second consecutive year. As the birthrate continues to decline and the population ages, the proportion of individuals aged 65 and older is increasing, which is expected to further raise the burden of social insurance premiums on the working-age population. According to estimates, total social security benefit expenditures will rise to 169 trillion yen ($1.13 trillion) in 2040, a 28% increase from 2020.
