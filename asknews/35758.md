**Candidates linked to narco and sects cast a shadow over Mexico's judicial election**
The upcoming judicial election in Mexico on June 1 has been marred by allegations of links to organized crime and sects such as La Luz del Mundo. Despite the 2024 judicial reform promising greater transparency and accountability, activists have warned of loopholes that have allowed 'high-risk profiles' to infiltrate the justice system. A network of over 1,400 citizen vigilantes has identified at least 40 candidates with some degree of risk, and in 24 cases, presented formal evidence to the National Electoral Institute (INE), which declared itself unable to remove them. Miguel Meza, of the civil organization Defensorxs, said that one of the 'worst cases' is Francisco Herrera Franco, a candidate for penal judge in Michoacán, who was nicknamed 'the prosecutor of terror' during his tenure (2020-2022), and is accused of having made deals with criminals and being involved in the murder of journalists Roberto Toledo and Armando Linares. Another 'alarming' profile, according to Meza, is that of Leopoldo Javier Chávez, a candidate for federal judge in Durango, who was imprisoned in the US for six years for trafficking methamphetamine. 'This is a case that shows the legal gaps in this reform', Meza warned, pointing out that among the requirements for candidacy, only a certificate of no criminal record in Mexico is required, without considering foreign convictions. Sharim Guzmán, a victim of the La Luz del Mundo sect, joined the network after detecting the candidacy of Job Daniel Wong, a cult minister who aspires to be a magistrate in Jalisco. Although the INE rejected removing him from the contest for not being officially registered as a 'cult minister', Guzmán warned that not even the leader of the church, Naasón Joaquín García, who is currently imprisoned in the US for child sexual abuse, was ever registered as such. 'That's more dangerous than a lawyer defending a narco-trafficker (...) because here your payment is eternal life', Guzmán warned.

**Journalism is not a crime**
The killing of journalist Abdul Latif Baloch in Balochistan is the latest tragic addition to a long list of journalists who have been killed for doing their job in Pakistan. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Pakistan ranks 12th on its 2024 Global Impunity Index, with at least 75 journalists and media workers killed since 1992 for reasons related to their work. Many of these killings remain unresolved, with perpetrators walking free due to a culture of impunity and the failure of the state to ensure justice. The article highlights the dangers faced by journalists in Pakistan, particularly those reporting on sensitive issues, and calls for the state to provide meaningful protection to media professionals and end the culture of impunity. 'There is no journalism without journalists,' the article states, 'and there can be no democracy without a free press.'

**Number of Palestinian Journalists Martyred in Gaza Rises to 221**
The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate stated that the number of journalists martyred in Gaza has risen to 221, following the martyrdom of colleague Motez Mohammed Rajab on Wednesday evening. The syndicate condemned the assassination of Rajab, who was martyred while performing his professional duty in covering the ongoing Israeli crimes against our people, as Israeli occupation forces targeted a civilian vehicle in Gaza City, resulting in his immediate martyrdom. The syndicate emphasized that this repeated targeting of journalists and media crews is part of a deliberate policy by the Israeli occupation to silence free speech and impose media blackout on its crimes, preventing the Palestinian narrative from reaching the world. Since the beginning of the Israeli aggression, the number of martyrs from the journalistic family has risen to 221, constituting a blatant violation of international norms and conventions that guarantee the protection of journalists during conflicts. The syndicate called on the International Criminal Court to launch a thorough and swift investigation into the Israeli occupation's crimes against Palestinian journalists, and to issue immediate arrest warrants for the leaders responsible for these violations. Local, Arab, and international media outlets were urged to intensify their coverage of the crimes committed against journalists, shedding light on the suffering of Palestinian journalism, which is paying the price for the truth. The syndicate stated that Rajab's martyrdom represents a new crime added to the record of atrocities committed by the champions of words and images, emphasizing that these crimes will not silence the truth, nor intimidate free pens that have decided to remain witnesses to injustice and aggression, and a voice for our defenseless people who are facing genocide.

**Violence Against Journalists in Brazil Remains a Concern Despite Decrease in Cases**
Despite a 20.44% decrease in the number of cases, violence against journalists in Brazil remains a concern. According to the Federación Nacional de Periodistas (FENAJ), there were 144 cases of aggression in 2024, the lowest number since 2018. However, the report notes that the attacks are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous, with a shift from physical violence to structural forms of silencing, such as judicial harassment and censorship. The FENAJ highlights an increase in judicial harassment, which accounted for 15.97% of cases in 2024, up from 13.81% in 2023. The organization also notes that the number of physical attacks decreased from 40 to 30, but warns that the number of incidents remains alarming, including attempts on journalists' lives and attacks with firearms. The FENAJ attributes the increase in violence during the electoral campaign to the intensification of hate speech, particularly by extreme right-wing groups. 'The attacks continue, but they are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous. We are living a transition from physical violence to structural forms of silencing, such as judicial harassment and censorship,' said the FENAJ. 'The censorship is institutionalized, often through judicial means, which makes the situation even worse.'

**Killing journalists**
Pakistan's journalists have been facing increasing threats and violence, with 124 journalists killed worldwide last year, and Pakistan ranking second after Sudan. Recently, Abdul Wahid Raisani, a journalist at Daily Azadi, was shot dead in Quetta, and the Balochistan Union of Journalists has condemned the incident. The Freedom Network's 2024 Impunity Report states that six journalists were killed in Pakistan between November 2023 and August 2024. The government and legal framework have failed to ensure action against the murderers of journalists, creating a culture of impunity. As the Freedom Network's report asserts, 'silencing journalists impacts all strata of society, damages democratic values as well as the public's faith in the system.' The authorities must commit to enforcing laws and conducting robust investigations into violence against the press to prevent such atrocities and bring the perpetrators to justice.

**Thuringia: 17 Crimes Against Journalists in 2024**
In Thuringia, Germany, journalists have faced verbal and physical attacks, with 17 politically motivated crimes reported in 2024. The majority of these incidents involved threats, insults, coercion, and physical harm. Two journalists were lightly injured. Most of these crimes were linked to demonstrations, with six attributed to the far-right, four to the far-left, and one to a religious ideology. The German Journalists' Association (DJV) estimates that the actual number of incidents is higher, with DJV Landesgeschäftsführer Sebastian Scholz stating, 'The dark figure is clearly higher.' Scholz also noted that journalists are often subjected to verbal abuse and insults, which are not always reported. A security concept has been implemented by the Thuringian police to protect journalists, particularly at demonstrations and political gatherings. However, Scholz warned that journalists also face intimidation in their personal lives, which can impact their work, saying, 'Some stop writing about certain topics altogether.'

**World press freedom day: 266 journalists face criminal cases in Bangladesh since Aug 5 last year**
Since August 5, 2024, journalists in Bangladesh have faced a new form of repression, with 266 cases filed against them, mostly related to the student-led July uprising. The cases include murder and assault charges, with many journalists being targeted for their reporting. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), the highest number of cases has been filed in Dhaka (88), followed by Sylhet and Chattogram. Many journalists have been arrested, with 13 still in jail, and at least 28 have been attacked in mob violence. Former Media Reform Commission chief Kamal Ahmed said the cases are 'unequivocally made on trumped-up charges' and that the murder charges are 'all false.' Human Rights Watch has called the prosecution of journalists a 'replication of the familiar patterns of abuses from the Hasina administration.' RSF has also expressed concern over the surge in violence against the media, calling on the authorities to prosecute those responsible and ensure the safety of media professionals. 'There is no specific law in Bangladesh that can prosecute a journalist for incitement of murder through journalism,' said Kamal Ahmed. 'There are laws that can be used against journalists for breaking down social harmony,' he added. 'Mobs know that they can attack journalists with impunity,' said Omar Faruk, a journalist who was attacked while covering the demolition of the house of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. 'I have no hope for justice,' he said. Célia Mercier, head of the RSF South Asia Desk, said, 'While the interim government's takeover in August 2024 raised hopes for improvement, journalists' safety remains unprotected. They are being assaulted while reporting, subjected to physical retaliation for their articles, and their newsrooms are being stormed by protesters.'

**Journalists Under Threat: A Record Number of Killings and Imprisonments**
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has reported a record number of journalists killed in 2024, with at least 124 professionals in 18 countries losing their lives due to their work. Israel was responsible for 70% of these deaths, according to the CPJ. Additionally, the organization has recorded a record number of journalists imprisoned, with 361 cases worldwide in 2024. CPJ's Spanish director, Carlos Martínez de la Serna, attributes this trend to 'the increase in authoritarian repression in many latitudes, accompanied by a decline in democracy.' He also points to wars in Ukraine, Sudan, and Gaza, as well as economic instability, as factors contributing to the repression of journalists. The One Free Press Coalition has released its annual list of the 10 most urgent cases of journalists imprisoned in different countries for seeking the truth. 'Ten cases that illuminate the efforts of different governments to criminalize journalism, silence the media, and withhold information,' says the organization, which includes The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, and EL PAÍS among its members. The list includes cases from Asia and Eastern Europe, and highlights the challenges faced by journalists in these regions. 'Journalists are under threat even in stable democracies,' says Martínez de la Serna. 'The press has to do its job, and we have to read the press. And the rest of us, denounce laws that undermine the right to information.'

**World press freedom day: 266 journalists face criminal cases so far**
At least 266 journalists have been implicated in various cases related to the events of July and August last year in Bangladesh. The repression of journalists has taken a new form since August 5, 2024, with fears for physical safety and instances of judicial harassment still visible. Many journalists are bearing the brunt of retaliation for the Awami League government's brutal response to the student-led July uprising. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), the highest number of cases has been filed in Dhaka - 88, followed by Sylhet and Chattogram. Nearly 50 media organisations have been impacted by these cases, with only 18% of the journalists prosecuted having overt political stripes or benefiting from the Awami League regime. The majority were the victims of retaliatory cases. 'These cases need to be independently investigated to find out the underlying reasons behind them,' said Kamal Ahmed, a journalist and former head of the Media Reform Commission. 'No law states how journalists can incite murder through journalism.'

**137 journalists sued so far**
At least 137 journalists have been implicated in 32 criminal cases filed in Dhaka, Chattogram, Bogura, and Rajshahi, centering the July uprising. The cases include charges of murder, attempted murder, unlawful assembly, rioting, abduction, vandalism, extortion, assault, and genocide. Many of the cases name the journalists as co-accused alongside deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Dhaka Metropolitan Public Prosecutor Omar Faruq Faruqi said the journalists 'aided and abetted' Sheikh Hasina through their speeches and questions in TV talk shows. However, Supreme Court lawyer Jyotirmoy Barua said the cases are a 'new phenomenon' and 'violate professional freedom guaranteed by article 29 of the constitution.' The Dhaka Union of Journalists has condemned the filing of a murder case against 24 journalists, saying it poses a serious threat to freedom of expression.

**Prisión, difamación y censura: así el chavismo castiga a periodistas en Venezuela**
In Venezuela, exercising journalism can come with a prison sentence. After the presidential elections on July 28, 2024, 13 journalists remain detained following post-election protests, while 18 others were released. New detentions have been made against journalists who share 'uncomfortable' topics on social media for the chavismo regime. This is part of a discourse of attack against independent press and direct accusations against journalists in exile. The confiscation of El Nacional's headquarters by a massive fine, the radical change in editorial lines of Globovisión and El Universal after changes in ownership under suspicion or sanctioned by the US, and the closure or censorship of over 400 media outlets in the past 20 years, are part of the ecosystem of censorship, harassment, and persecution of journalism and press freedom in Venezuela. Recently, detentions like that of journalist Nakary Mena, who was arrested after a report on social media for Impacto Venezuela, show a new trend on 'sensitive topics' that the chavismo regime does not want to be discussed. Mena's report on the perception of increased crime in Caracas and a report on the murder of a community leader led to the temporary detention of journalist Roman Camacho in March. The economy has also become a sensitive topic, with a report on the exchange rate gap between the official and parallel dollar and its impact on prices leading to the detention of communicator Nelin Escalante for seven days in October 2024. The chavismo regime is also targeting journalists through social media, with detentions occurring after their faces appeared in publications shared on their social media accounts or the accounts of the media outlets they work for. The charges against journalists in Venezuela have also evolved, with the addition of 'distribution of false news', a charge not even listed in the Venezuelan Penal Code. This is similar to the Operación Tun Tún, which criminalized citizens who were part of the electoral Comanditos, and was later used to justify police and judicial actions against them. The arrests of activists and journalists are preceded or 'justified' by digital narratives pushed by the officialdom, creating a new repressive scheme against journalism that uses social media as a channel of dissemination due to the blocking of independent media outlets' pages in the country.

**Freedom to Write Index 2024 - PEN America**
The Freedom to Write Index 2024, released by PEN America, reports a record high of 375 writers jailed in 40 countries worldwide. China remains the leading jailer of writers, with 118 writers behind bars, followed by Iran, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Israel, Russia, Türkiye, Belarus, Egypt, and Myanmar. The majority of writers jailed were men (84%), and women comprised 16% of the total. Online commentators (203) and journalists (127) were the most prevalent professions among those incarcerated. The report highlights the increasing trend of transnational repression, with 143 writers in forced exile or displaced. The crackdown on dissenting voices and ideas has led to a significant increase in the number of writers jailed, with a growing number being detained without charges or awaiting trial. The report also notes the targeting of women writers, particularly in Iran, where 13 women were jailed for opposing the mandatory hijab rules or writing in support of feminist ideas. The Freedom to Write Index emphasizes the importance of protecting writers and free expression, as authoritarian regimes seek to suppress dissenting voices and control the narrative.

**Venezuela: 22 Journalists Fled, 14 Detained, and 2 Forced Disappeared in 2024**
According to the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), 22 journalists fled Venezuela in 2024 due to the repression by Maduro's government. Additionally, 14 journalists were arbitrarily detained, 4 were temporarily detained, and 2 cases of forced disappearances were reported. The IPYS stated that 'the prison and exile are just two of the most visible consequences of the increase in repression during 2024. Self-censorship has emerged as a survival mechanism, but it further weakens the possibility of free reporting and information in Venezuela.' The report warns that the risk of continued or increased repression in 2025 is high, which could lead to a complete silence in the country. The IPYS also highlighted that the prosecution of journalists on terrorism charges is a 'clear violation of due process guarantees and a worsening of judicial harassment as a pattern.' The Ministry of Public Prosecution, public defenders, and the Judiciary, all 'co-opted by the officialdom,' were identified as key actors in the repression against the press in 2024, particularly in the context of the social conflict caused by the official result of the presidential elections on July 28. The closure of media outlets and digital space restrictions also increased, with the National Commission of Telecommunications (Conatel) shutting down 15 radio stations in the first six months of 2024. The IPYS documented 383 cases, representing 571 violations of journalists' and media outlets' informational guarantees.

**Three people who threatened journalists to face criminal charges**
Three individuals who threatened journalists outside the law courts will face criminal charges on Friday, according to sources. On Wednesday, journalists and camerapersons were filmed, threatened, and followed while attempting to cover the arraignment of four men arrested in connection with a drugs heist from an army barracks. Relatives of the accused were involved in the threats, with one person saying, 'I'm going to take a photo of you, and then if you show my brother I'll f*ck up your entire family.' ONE News editor Josef Caruana confirmed that two of the broadcaster's journalists and a cameraman were targeted and a police report was filed.

**52 Citizens, Including 4 Journalists and 8 Girls, Referred to Criminal Trial**
The Higher State Security Prosecution referred 52 citizens, including 4 journalists and 8 girls, to criminal trial on charges of joining a banned group, financing it, and spreading false news. The prosecution accused them of 'joining a prohibited group established in contravention of the law, financing the group to achieve its objectives inside Egypt with knowledge of its anti-state goals, participating in achieving these objectives, and spreading false news.' The list includes journalist Amr Qazaz, one of the founders of the Rased website, and journalist Madhat Ramadan, as well as Amr Imad Abdullah and Abdullah Shihata Abdel-Jawad. The case also includes girls such as Azhar University student, Mohamed Kamal Eidya, who was arrested on November 8, 2020, without clear reasons, and was later forced to hide for 10 days. The case also includes the names of the girl Abdel-Rouf, who was arrested on November 9, 2020, and was forced to hide for 36 days in a national security facility, as well as the girl Zahraa Mohamed Ahmed, who was arrested three years later on September 25, 2023. According to a previous report by the Bladi Island Humanitarian Organization, the case was marked by torture and violations, as the authorities did not stop at arbitrarily arresting the journalists and the three women, but also forced all the defendants to hide for periods ranging from 5 days to 3 months, and subjected them to beatings, torture, and electric shocks inside national security facilities, as well as poor treatment and poor detention conditions, and a clear violation of the law and a contravention of Article 143 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which prohibits the continuation of pre-trial detention for more than two years.

**Investigating Crimes Against Ukrainian Journalists**
Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna was seized by Russian security agents in March 2022 and held for ten days before being exchanged for Russian POWs. She continued reporting from occupied territories, but vanished in the Zaporizhzhia region in summer 2023. Her family received a notification from the Russian ministry of defence in October 2024 that she had died the previous month, but her body has not been returned. Roshchyna's death is one of numerous cases of attacks on media workers that the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office are investigating as war crimes. Since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine has initiated pre-trial investigations in over 120 criminal cases concerning Russia's physical aggression against journalists. A dozen Russians have been charged with related crimes, including Aleksey Kim, a general accused of ordering an Iskander missile strike on a Reuters crew filming in Kramatorsk on August 24, 2024. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the Institute of Mass Information (IMI) are working to raise awareness, collect evidence, and demand accountability for these crimes. International pressure is key for both access to detained media workers and justice for crimes against them.
