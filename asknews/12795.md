**Mainland Affairs Council slams Want Want's 'Taiwan, China' remark | Taiwan News | Jun. 2, 2025 12:25**
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has condemned Want Want China Times Media Group for suggesting Taiwan is part of China at the Cross-Strait Chinese Culture Summit. Want Want General Manager Tsai Wang-ting said, 'We are Chinese' and that the company 'must never forget our roots, history, culture, bloodline, and mission.' The MAC stated that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country and that the group's participation in the summit and statements echoing Beijing's united front propaganda have 'severely damaged our national interests and sovereignty.' The council accused Want Want of acting recklessly for personal gain and condemned the group for willingly becoming a CCP pawn. The government will review whether the group's actions constitute collaboration with China's ruling party, government, and military, potentially violating Article 33-1 of the Cross-Strait Act.

**Environmental Groups Demand Abolition of Coal-Fired Power Plants by 2028**
Environmental groups and citizens gathered in front of the Legislative Yuan to demand the abolition of coal-fired power plants by 2028. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the total electricity generated by new gas-fired power plants by 2028 will be enough to replace the total electricity generated by existing coal-fired power plants. Taiwan Health Air Action Alliance founder, Leaf Guangpeng, said, 'If the North Deep Ocean Ultra-Supercritical Power Plant is built, it is estimated that 576 people will die from air pollution within 15 years. If the old and largest coal-fired power plant, Middle Fire, is not retired by 2034, it is estimated that over 10,000 people will die from coal-fired power plant-related illnesses, and over 20,000 people may die.' Dr. Wei Zhaoyao, president of the Taichung Medical Association, pointed out that coal-fired power plant emissions contain PM2.5 and other toxic air pollutants, which can cause lung cancer, pneumonia, liver cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and other types of cancer, as well as chronic diseases such as diabetes and kidney disease. The group is calling on the government to support the abolition of coal-fired power plants by 2028, which they believe is a feasible and just policy. They will be monitoring the voting results and publishing the names of lawmakers who oppose or abstain from the vote.

**Wu Jing-yi Questions '2028 No-Coal Mid-Fire' Plan: Genuine or Ploy for Nuclear Power Referendum?**
Taiwanese politician Wu Jing-yi has questioned whether the proposed '2028 no-coal mid-fire' plan is a genuine attempt to improve air quality or a ploy to pave the way for a nuclear power referendum. Wu said that the current strategy of the ruling and opposition parties is to 'abolish coal, not subsidize Taipower, and not raise electricity prices', but in reality, they are using their legislative power to interfere with the administration's authority. Wu pointed out that the current plan to achieve mid-fire without coal by 2034 is already in place, and the Kuomintang's proposal to accelerate the timeline to 2028 without providing any alternative energy solutions is 'intentionally creating an energy crisis and inducing electricity panic to justify their nuclear power extension advocacy.' Wu criticized the Kuomintang's actions as an overreach of their legislative power and a disregard for energy expertise, saying that energy transformation requires scientific planning and technical support. She also warned Taichung Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen that 'the air at Guanyuan' will not generate electricity, and that if Lu is genuinely concerned about air pollution, she should urge Taipower to accelerate the construction of gas-fired power plants. Wu asked Lu, 'If you support using the energy issue in Taichung to manipulate the nuclear power extension referendum, do you support storing nuclear waste at home? Do you support storing nuclear waste in Taichung?' Wu concluded that the only way to achieve a normal parliament is through a large-scale recall, as these politicians have 'gone mad.'

**Wu Jingyi Questions Lu Hsiu-yen's Motives on Nuclear Power Plant Delay and 'No Coal' Proposal**
Media person Wu Jingyi questioned whether the proposal to delay the shutdown of the Third Nuclear Power Plant is a genuine environmental concern or a ploy to pave the way for a nuclear power plant referendum. She pointed out that the opposition party's strategy is to 'no coal, no subsidy to Taipower, and no electricity price increase' and that the Legislative Yuan's proposal to achieve 'no coal' by 2028 is not a genuine concern for air pollution in Taichung, but rather a deliberate attempt to force Taiwan to play a political game at a critical juncture in the energy sector. Wu Jingyi stated that the current plan to achieve 'no coal' by 2034 is a reasonable and scientifically-planned goal, but the Kuomintang's proposal to accelerate the timeline to 2028 without providing any alternative energy solutions is a reckless and unprofessional move. She also questioned whether Lu Hsiu-yen, the chairperson of the Legislative Yuan, would support storing nuclear waste in Taichung, and asked if she would support storing nuclear waste in her own home. Wu Jingyi emphasized that Taiwan is located in a seismically active area and that these lawmakers are pushing for nuclear power plant delay in the 'low-end' areas of the south, while the country's high-tech industry is thriving. She concluded that only a mass recall can bring about a normal parliament, as these lawmakers have gone mad.

**China rejects US defence chief's warnings on Taiwan invasion threat**
China has rejected US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's warnings about the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, calling them 'groundless accusations'. Hegseth had stated that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan 'would result in devastating consequences'. China's National Defence University vice president, Hu Gangfeng, said the accusations were 'nothing more than attempts to provoke trouble, incite division and stir up confrontation to destabilise the Asia-Pacific region'. Australia's Defence Minister, Richard Marles, pointed out that China's largest conventional military build-up since World War II is happening without strategic reassurance and without a clear strategic intent. Australia is currently on track to reach defence spending levels of 2.33 per cent of GDP by 2033-34, and is optimistic about the progress of the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine deal.

**Taiwan's Experience: A Lesson from Ukraine in the Face of Chinese Aggression**
The experience of Ukraine could serve as an example for Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, according to former Australian Prime Minister. Taiwan and the People's Republic of China are separated by the Taiwan Strait. Since 1949, Taiwan has been governed by its own administration, with the flag and some other attributes of the former Republic of China remaining in place, but it has not officially declared its independence. According to China's official position, the island is considered one of its provinces. Relations between China and Taiwan have deteriorated in recent years. In 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to conduct a peaceful 'reunification' with Taiwan. In response, Taipei pledged to defend its freedom and emphasized that only the Taiwanese people can decide their own future. The US Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, which allows the US to supply Taiwan with defensive arms and serves as a guarantor of the island's security. The Biden administration supported Taiwan and provided it with hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid. Former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated in the summer of 2023 that the US does not support Taiwan's independence, but will help it defend itself.

**US Warns Allies of China's Growing Threat: 'Invading Taiwan in 2027'**
US Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, has warned allies not to 'look away' from the 'imminent risk' posed by China, which is investing in high-level nuclear arms and armament technology to 'invade Taiwan in 2027'. Hegseth has reiterated that China's attempts to conquer Taiwan 'by force' would have 'devastating consequences' for the Indo-Pacific and the world. China has warned the US that military aid to Taiwan increases the 'risk of conflict'. Hegseth has called for increased defense spending 'to prevent war, make the cost too high, and peace the only option'. Analysts interpret this as a signal from Washington to increase arms sales in Asia. Hegseth has also highlighted the 'risk' of economic dependence on China, which 'deepens its malign influence' globally. This comes as tensions rise, with China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, not attending the Singapore meeting, and instead sending a delegation from the National Defense University.

**China Warns Taiwan: Pursuing 'Independence' Will Have No Good Outcome**
Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang warned the Taiwanese government that pursuing 'Taiwan independence' would have no good outcome. Zhang stated that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is 'always ready for battle' and will strengthen its military training and defense to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Zhang made the comments during a press conference on May 29, 2025, in response to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's recent statement that 'invaders are the ones who destroy peace' and that 'being prepared for war is a way to avoid war.' Zhang said that as long as Tsai continues to pursue 'independence,' the Taiwan Strait will never be peaceful and Taiwanese people will never be at peace.

**Preparing for the Challenges of 2035: Taiwan Must Be Ready**
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has released a report titled 'Possible Scenarios for 2035' which presents three possible scenarios: China's economy stagnating, the United States' global leadership waning, and the global trust system collapsing. The report consulted with multiple think tanks, including the Brookings Institution, the American Enterprise Institute, and the RAND Corporation, to identify the driving factors behind structural changes and their potential far-reaching effects. It is not meant to predict the future, but rather to help countries understand how to respond to the changing trends and provide warnings and take action. The report highlights the importance of Taiwan being prepared for the challenges that lie ahead, regardless of the scenario that unfolds. Taiwan must be aware that China's economic stagnation or continued growth will bring different security and economic challenges. If China's economy stagnates, it may increase the possibility of Beijing taking more aggressive actions against Taiwan; if the US' global leadership wanes, Taiwan may face reduced US support in the region. In the event of a global trust collapse, Taiwan's economy, which is heavily reliant on international trade, will be particularly vulnerable.

**China, the war-monger - The Singapore Post**
China has rejected a proposal from US President Donald Trump to cut the defense budget by 50%, which would have reduced the chance of a global war and spared funds for development. Instead, China has increased its defense budget to a record high of $249 billion, a 7.2% increase over the previous year. This move has triggered an arms race, with the US and its allies stepping up their defense efforts to combat the threat. The US has announced plans to develop a next-generation fighter jet, the NGAD, which will be way ahead of any other fighter aircraft of the current generation. China has been modernizing its navy and air force, with plans to possess six aircraft carriers by 2035. The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is on the rise, and nations facing the Chinese threat are not sitting idle, increasing their defense budgets and developing advanced arms and weapon platforms. Posterity will brand China as the war-monger, having triggered an arms race through its aggressive moves.

**PLA's 'Sea Thunder-2025A' Exercise: A Show of Force Against 'Taiwan Independence' Separatists**
The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command announced on April 2 that it had organized the 'Sea Thunder-2025A' exercise in the middle and southern parts of the Taiwan Strait. According to Zhang Xi, a military expert from the People's Liberation Army National Defense University, this exercise demonstrates the PLA's ability to use a variety of means to suppress the 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces. Zhang said, 'For the DPP authorities and 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces, the PLA has always been in a state of high alert, with a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. We want to use the 'Sea Thunder' exercise to show a more severe approach, tightening the noose around the 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces and making the chains of restraint even tighter. The more fiercely they resist, the more intense the storm will be.' The exercise focused on subjects such as identification, warning and removal, interception and detention, and tested the PLA's ability to control the region, implement joint blockade, and precision strike.

**China Threatens to Tighten Grip on Taiwan if Separatism Increases**
China has stated that it will tighten its grip on Taiwan if separatism in the democratic government island increases, according to state media. The Chinese military said, 'The more unruly the 'Taiwan independence' separatists become, the tighter the noose around their necks and the sharper the sword hanging over their heads', said military spokesperson Wu Qian at the 'Two Sessions' annual political event, according to Xinhua. The Chinese army 'is a force for action to combat separatism and promote reunification', Wu said, warning separatists to stay away from the 'precipice'. 'They are on the edge of a precipice (...). If they persist in going down the wrong path, they will find themselves in a dead end', he warned. China considers Taiwan, which has its own government since 1949, as part of its territory. Wu Qian previously stated that China would not rule out the use of force to retake control of Taiwan. The comments come as China announced a 7.2% increase in its defense budget for 2025, the same rate as last year. Wu Qian described the military spending as 'limited', aimed at developing 'combat forces' and improving capabilities in reconnaissance, attacks, and support in operational theaters. In recent years, Beijing has increased military pressure on Taiwan, regularly sending planes and ships to its vicinity and conducting large-scale exercises around it. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense denounced 'live-fire exercises' by the Chinese Navy in an area 74 km from the island in late February. Wu Qian responded that it was a 'routine training exercise', denouncing a Taiwanese propaganda campaign. China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said on Friday that 'achieving complete reunification of the motherland' is 'a common aspiration of the entire Chinese people'. 'It is the general trend of history and a just cause', he added.

**China to have world's most powerful army by 2035? Xi Jinping's MASTERPLAN revealed, Beijing to increase defence budget by...**
China's President Xi Jinping aims to build the world's most powerful army by 2035. To achieve this, Beijing has announced a 7.2% increase in its defense budget for 2025, which totals 1.78 trillion yuan ($249 billion). China's defense budget is the second-largest in the world, after the US. However, in terms of active military personnel, China is ahead of the US. According to defense analysts, China plans to enhance its Army and Air Force to match or surpass the US. China's military spending is a concern for neighboring countries, including Japan, India, and the Philippines, as it has rapidly modernized its military prowess and has a history of territorial disputes. Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang stated that Beijing will 'strongly oppose separatist activities aimed at Taiwan's independence' and will promote peaceful cross-strait relations. China claims its military spending is for defensive purposes, but experts suspect that it may be hiding its true military spending. 'We will continue to increase our defense budget to ensure the country's sovereignty and security,' said Xi Jinping, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). 'China's military budget is a smokescreen to divert attention from its mega defense projects,' said an expert, adding that China spends a massive sum on its defense sector through different projects.

**Taiwan players go nuclear in Chinese invasion board game**
The Taiwanese board game 2045 simulates a Chinese invasion of the island, challenging players to make strategic decisions to secure Taiwan's freedom. According to Ruth Zhong, a 36-year-old player, 'The most interesting part of this game is that you have to make continuous decisions based on the evolving situation, and these choices can alter the entire history of Taiwan in an instant.' The game's creator, Mizo Games, consulted experts to ensure the game's realism, including military personnel, national security analysts, and political experts. The game's release comes as China maintains military pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. 'We decided to move away from romanticism and create a game rooted in realism,' said Mizo Games founder Chang Shao-lian. 'Some players assume the game caters only to pro-Taiwan independence players, but in reality, anyone with a strategic vision for the Taiwan Strait conflict can find ways to win,' he added. The game's value lies in showing players that even in a crisis, allies may not help unconditionally, as said by Zhong. 'Its value lies in showing players that even in a game, or in real life, your allies won't necessarily help you unconditionally,' she said.
