**Musk: Chances of Starship Flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50**
Elon Musk said that the chances of Starship flying to Mars in 2026 are 50/50. The spacecraft has already completed nine test flights, with the last one taking place on May 27. However, the mission ended in an emergency due to a fuel leak. The previous flights in January and March also ended in failure, with the spacecraft exploding within the first 10 minutes of flight. Despite this, Musk is optimistic about the progress made and believes that the data collected will help improve the spacecraft. The next version of Starship, Version 3, is expected to be 124.4 meters tall and will be capable of flying to Mars. The spacecraft will be reusable and will have a refueling system on orbit, which is necessary for long-distance space travel. The first flight of this version is planned for the end of this year, and if successful, Starship may fly to Mars as early as next year. SpaceX plans to send five Starship Version 3 spacecraft to Mars in 2026 to test the spacecraft and its technologies. However, Musk believes that it will be challenging to achieve this goal, citing the need to master the refueling of Starship in space as the main problem. He estimates the chances of success as 50/50. If successful, SpaceX plans to send around 20 spacecraft to Mars in 2028-2029, which may be crewed. However, Musk also suggests that two robotic landings may be conducted before sending humans. The final decision will be made later. In the third launch window (2030-2031), up to 100 Starship spacecraft may be sent to Mars, and in the next window (2033), up to 500. SpaceX is currently searching for a suitable location for a Martian city, which should be relatively far from the poles, have access to water ice, and have a flat surface for landings and takeoffs. The main candidate is the Arcadia Planitia region. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sufficient settlement on Mars with a population of over a million people, which will require transporting millions of tons of cargo. According to Musk, the construction and maintenance of such a city will be carried out using Starship, possibly its future 142-meter version. During periods of Earth-Mars alignment, thousands of upper stages of the spacecraft will be able to arrive and depart.

**UK to build up to 12 new attack submarines**
The UK will build 'up to' 12 new attack submarines to replace the Astute class from the late 2030s onwards, according to the prime minister's announcement. The new submarines will be conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered, and will keep 'Britain and Nato safe for decades', as stated by Sir Keir. The government will also spend £15bn on its nuclear warhead program and commit to increasing UK defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027. The review will make 62 recommendations, which the government is expected to accept in full. The Labour party has committed to increasing defence spending to 3% of national income by 2034, but the Conservatives say this should be met by the end of the decade. The review will also include other announcements, such as £1.5bn to build six new factories for 'always on' munitions production capacity, building up to 7,000 long-range weapons, and setting up a 'cyber and electromagnetic command' to boost the military's defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace.

**Asteroids in Earth's Orbit: A Threat from Space - 2025 Avoids Catastrophe by a Hair**
The US space agency has listed over 100 asteroids that will approach the Earth in 2025, some of which are massive. According to Detlef Koschny, an asteroid expert from the European Space Agency, 'the size range of 20 to 40 meters already represents an existing threat.' If an asteroid of this size were to hit the Earth, it would require the evacuation of larger cities. A much larger asteroid, with a diameter of 1,000 meters, would be considered a 'planet killer.' However, none of these massive asteroids are expected to approach the Earth in 2025. Some of the notable asteroids approaching the Earth in 2025 include: 424482 (2008 DG5) on June 6, 2025, with a diameter of 310-690 meters, and (2020 BC6) on January 5, 2025, with a diameter of 190-410 meters. NASA is closely monitoring these asteroids and their potential impact on the Earth.

**Elon Musk say it's '50/50' he'll land on Mars next year and he needs to 'get lucky' - Daily Star**
Elon Musk says there is a '50/50 chance' of landing a spaceship on Mars next year, and he needs to 'get lucky'. Despite recent test flight failures, Musk remains optimistic about progress towards establishing a self-sustaining civilization on Mars. He believes reusable rockets will enable more than a million people to live on Mars within 30 years. Musk hopes to send 20 ships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with the goal of building a self-sufficient city that could survive even if cut off from Earth. He is scouting possible sites for a Mars city, with Arcadia Planitia being the leading candidate. Musk aims to fly 100 ships to Mars between 2030 and 2031 and 500 more in 2033. He said, 'This is, like, an incredible thing to have - this amazing city on Mars, the first city on another planet and a new world.'

**CIA Report Warns of Global Catastrophe by 2030: A Countdown to Disaster**
A 2003 report by the CIA, 'The 2030 Spike: Countdown to Global Catastrophe', written by Colin Mason, describes six factors that will converge in the next decade, leading to a global catastrophe. These factors include energy scarcity, demographic disparities, global poverty, climate change, food shortages, water scarcity, and international anarchy. The report proposes over 100 measures to mitigate the consequences of this crisis. According to the report, 'estimates place available petroleum resources at less than one billion barrels, and global consumption at 28 billion barrels per year, indicating depletion in as little as 34 years.' The report also cites studies by the International Water Management Institute, predicting that one billion people will face absolute water scarcity by 2025. To avoid this, the report suggests using science, particularly genetics and climatology, to address climate change, water and food scarcity. However, some measures proposed in the report are more controversial, including: diverting scientific effort from arms, space research, and 'doubtful' technologies to practical goals for humanity; establishing a global authority to define priorities and advise on implementation; forming a 'censor' body to examine new technologies and identify potential harm; creating a specialized international penal law body to prevent the application of harmful technologies; and establishing research institutes with secure funding. The report concludes that these objectives may not be achievable, but can be approached.

**Elon Musk targets 2026 for first space mission to Mars**
Elon Musk aims to launch the first space mission to Mars by the end of 2026, but acknowledges that overcoming technological hurdles, particularly in-orbit refueling, is crucial for the long journey. A favorable planetary alignment in late 2026 provides a unique opportunity for a relatively short transit between Earth and Mars. If Starship is not ready by then, a new mission in 2028 would be targeted. The first mission would consist of -built Optimus humanoid robots. Despite failed test flights, including a fuel leak and uncontrolled spinning on the ninth test flight, Musk remains optimistic, citing each failure as valuable data for accelerated testing. NASA relies on Starship for its Artemis program, which aims to send astronauts to the moon as early as 2027, a stepping stone to possible human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Musk's ultimate vision is to launch up to 2,000 Starships every two years to establish a permanent and self-sustaining human settlement on Mars.

**Musk retains plan to fly Starship to Mars in 2026 despite setbacks**
Elon Musk has reaffirmed his plan to send Starship to Mars in 2026, despite recent setbacks in test flights. Musk stated that the success of this mission depends on Starship's ability to accomplish several challenging technical feats, including a post-launch refueling manoeuvre in earth orbit. He gave SpaceX a 50% chance of meeting the deadline. If not, the company will wait two years before trying again. Musk envisions launching 1,000 to 2,000 ships to Mars every two years to establish a self-sustaining human settlement. NASA plans to return humans to the moon aboard Starship in 2027, with the goal of launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. Musk has previously aimed to send an uncrewed vehicle to Mars by 2018 and a crewed mission by 2024, but has since pushed back the timeline.

**Elon Musk Aims to Launch Starship to Mars Next Year**
Elon Musk plans to launch a Starship to Mars next year, with the goal of establishing a permanent human presence on the planet. The first Starships will be launched in 2026, carrying robots, including Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots. Musk estimates a 50% chance of success for the 2026 mission. The next step will be to send 20 Starships to Mars between 2028 and 2029, with humans on board. The ultimate goal is to launch 100 Starships to Mars, with 500 more following in 2033. Musk acknowledges the challenges ahead, but believes that each launch brings the company closer to its goal of making humanity a multi-planetary species. 'Supposing the first missions are successful and land safely, we will send humans on the next mission and really start building the infrastructure on Mars,' Musk said. The SpaceX has already identified a potential location for the first human colony on Mars, Arcádia Planitia, a volcanic plain in the northern hemisphere of the planet.

**Russia to Launch 240 Additional GLONASS Satellites in 2030**
According to Ivan Revnyukh, the head of the department of automatic space complexes and systems of special and dual purpose at Roscosmos, the agency plans to start creating an additional segment of the GLONASS navigation system in 2030, consisting of 240 satellites on low orbits. The first two disassemblable satellites of the low-orbit space complex of GLONASS are expected to be launched in 2030. The system will be composed of 240 satellites at an altitude of 800 kilometers, compared to the usual GLONASS satellites which orbit at an altitude of around 19,000 kilometers. As stated in the presentation, the introduction of the low-orbit segment will make the GLONASS system available in complex conditions at 100%, improve its accuracy, increase the power of signals on Earth, and enhance its resistance to interference. 'With the introduction of the low-orbit segment, the GLONASS system will become available in complex conditions at 100%,' Revnyukh said.

**Growing Space Debris Threatens Earth's Infrastructure**
The growing amount of space debris in Earth's orbit poses a threat to the planet's infrastructure. According to NASA employee Donald Kessler, the 'Kessler-Syndrom' could make parts of the Earth's orbit unusable. Currently, around 40,000 objects are orbiting the Earth, with only a third of them being functional satellites. The rest is space debris, including fragments from explosions, broken-down spacecraft, and collisions. The European Space Agency (ESA) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are working together to develop a 'Zero Debris Charter' to reduce the creation of new space debris by 2030. The charter has already been signed by over 100 actors in the international space industry. To mitigate the problem, experts are discussing new concepts and technologies to prevent further growth of space debris and collisions. These include controlled re-entry of used satellites, removal of non-functional objects from overburdened regions, and recycling of space debris in orbit. The ESA reports that in 2024, there were several major and numerous smaller fragmentation events that added thousands of new debris objects to the orbit. Even small particles can cause significant damage to satellites, and larger pieces can cause massive damage upon collision. The global satellite population is expected to exceed 60,000 by 2030, and the development of more space-based technology will continue to increase the amount of space debris. 'We need to take action to prevent a disaster,' says Manuel Metz, an expert on space debris at the DLR. 'The handlungsbedarf is great' (the need for action is great), adds Pamela Dörhöfer.

**NASA will give you $3 million if you can solve their unique space toilet problem**
NASA has launched the LunaRecycle Challenge, offering $3 million to innovators who can develop technology to recycle human waste in space. The goal is to minimize waste and store, process, and recycle it in a space environment, as stated by NASA, 'so that little or no waste will need to be returned to Earth.' Currently, there are 96 bags of human waste left behind by Apollo 11 astronauts in 1969 on the moon. The selected innovators will be revealed in May 2025, and the new technological waste disposal system will be used in future space missions if selected.

**NYC Council Passes Bill to Establish City-Wide Public Toilet Strategy**
The New York City Council has passed a bill to establish a city-wide public toilet strategy, aiming to add over 2,100 public toilets by 2035, nearly doubling the current number. Currently, New York City has approximately 1,100 public toilets, serving 8.6 million residents, with only one toilet available for every 7,820 people. This shortage has caused significant inconvenience to the homeless, elderly, and those with medical conditions, and has exacerbated the enforcement of public urination laws. According to City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, 'The accessibility of public toilets is crucial to the health, safety, and quality of life of New Yorkers. Today's legislative action is an important step in addressing the long-standing infrastructure gap and will bring greater accountability and transparency.' The bill, proposed and led by Council Member Sandy Nurse, will establish a cross-departmental strategic planning program, led by the Deputy Mayor, in collaboration with the Department of Urban Planning, Department of Parks and Recreation, and Department of Transportation. The bill requires the city to update the strategic planning report every four years and set specific targets, including providing at least 2,120 public toilets by 2035, with half of them owned and maintained by public institutions. Nurse stated, 'New Yorkers, relief is on the way! Whether you're going out with friends, working as a delivery person, journalist, caregiver, or homeless, everyone needs accessible toilets. This bill is a positive response to human basic needs, making living and working in this city easier and more dignified.'

**1.2 Million Pieces of Space Debris Orbit the Earth, ESA Warns**
A cloud of 1.2 million pieces of space debris, each larger than 1 centimeter, orbits the Earth, posing a threat to satellites and space stations. According to the European Space Agency's (ESA) report on space debris, over 50,000 pieces are larger than 10 centimeters, and 40,000 are tracked by surveillance networks. The ESA's Master system models indicate that at an altitude of 550 kilometers, the debris poses a significant threat to active satellites. The constant collisions that fragment the debris in orbit further increase the risks. The ESA's models show that the fragmentations in 2024 increased the number of debris in orbit by at least 3,000 units, considering only the tracked debris. However, there is a positive trend in controlled reentries from orbit, particularly of satellites, due to improved compliance with guidelines for mitigating space debris by removing satellites at the end of their lifecycle from orbits. Controlled reentries of launchers have also surpassed those of uncontrolled reentries for the first time in 2024. To ensure a debris-free Earth orbit, the ESA emphasizes the need for effective mitigation measures, which is why it has approved the Zero Debris Approach program, aiming to limit debris by 2030. 'It is urgent to put in place effective mitigation measures,' the ESA says. 'The orbit of the Earth is becoming increasingly important for the safety of future missions to the Moon.'

**Orbital Pollution: A Growing Concern**
A potential problem related to the re-entry of Starlink satellites into the Earth's atmosphere has been raised by Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics. In January, 120 first-generation satellites returned to the atmosphere, out of over 7,000 launched since 2018. While the satellites are designed to disintegrate in the atmosphere, they contain 30 kg of aluminum oxide each, which damages the stratospheric ozone layer. A study published in the 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences' in October 2023 found evidence of the persistence of debris. NASA's flight over Alaska in February detected 10% of aerosol particles containing aluminum and other metals from the satellites' disintegration. This is just one of the issues facing SpaceX, which was criticized by 120 astronomers in October 2024 for the lack of environmental impact assessment for the launch of 58,000 satellites in low Earth orbit by 2030, with 42,000 of them being Starlink satellites. Musk has used his economic, political, and media power to push the director of the Federal Aviation Administration to resign after a $633,000 fine for three safety rule violations. The problem of space waste is discussed in the cover story of this issue, which highlights the danger of impact with operational satellites and the over 25,000 tracked waste objects in orbit. The article also explores emerging technologies to address orbital pollution and ideas for a circular economy in space, suggesting that those responsible for the situation should bear the costs of cleaning up.
