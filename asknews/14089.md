**Phishing Gang Members Sentenced to 15 Months in Prison**
Two men from Willebroek and Boom were sentenced to 15 months in prison with a suspended sentence for their involvement in a phishing gang. They were tasked with picking up packages from Mediamarkt and Coolblue, which had been purchased with money stolen from bank accounts through phishing practices. According to prosecutor Catherine Van de Heyning, 'Their function was to pick up packages that were purchased online with money that was stolen through phishing practices from bpost machines.' The investigation started when a woman from East Flanders discovered that 1,209 euros had been withdrawn from her account to purchase an item from Mediamarkt. The police monitored the bpost machine where the packages were to be delivered and caught J.D. from Willebroek taking the package and getting into a car driven by J.C. from Boom. The court found the two men guilty and sentenced them to 15 months in prison with a suspended sentence and a fine of 1,600 euros. 'We see more and more that phishing practices not only involve cash withdrawals from accounts, but also online purchases,' said Van de Heyning.

**Man sentenced for role in Minnesota's largest ever fentanyl bust**
Quijuan Bankhead was sentenced to 10 years in prison, five years supervised release, and a $100 special assessment for his role in one of the largest fentanyl busts in Minnesota history.

This comes as preliminary data from the Minnesota Department of Health shows that over 1,200 people died from drug overdoses in 2023, with about 70% involving synthetic opioids like fentanyl.

**Sam Bankman-Fried's Early Release, Schiff Vs Vance, Bitcoin's Fall, And Trump's Meme Coin Dinner: This Week In Crypto - Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) Common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (ARCA:BTC)**
The past week in cryptocurrency was marked by several significant events. Sam Bankman-Fried, the notorious fraudster, is set to be released from prison four years ahead of schedule due to 'good conduct time' credits. Economist Peter Schiff publicly disagreed with Vice President JD Vance's support for Bitcoin, sparking a debate over its value and impact. Bitcoin's value dropped below $105,000 after President Donald Trump's warning about the US-China trade agreement. Additionally, Google warned that RSA encryption, a key security feature in securing Bitcoin, may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Meanwhile, a black-tie gala hosted by Donald Trump for top TRUMP MAGA/USD meme coin holders turned into a high-net-worth crypto networking event.

In May 2025, 15 Devon residents were convicted and jailed for various crimes. The list includes a man who tried to escape police by running along the roof of a cannabis factory, a knifeman who robbed a shop, and a violent woman beater who bit and hit her ex-partner with her own shoe. Other convictions include a Torquay man who fired an air gun at a group of noisy men, a poetry-loving Devon paedophile who hid his shameful secret, and a driver who abandoned an injured teenager in a car and told lies. The individuals were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 6 months to 8 years and 10 months. According to the article, the individuals were described as 'pleasant while sober' but 'awful, violent and unpredictable' when under the influence. 'I had been locked in and my job was to look after the plants,' said Rudolf Mikli, who was jailed for 12 months for his role in the cannabis factory. 'I am very sorry and just want to get on with my life,' said Mike McCabe, who was jailed for 2 years and 8 months for firing an air gun.

**Fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried Set To Leave Prison Four Years Early As 'Good Conduct' Credits Trim His 25-Year Sentence**
Sam Bankman-Fried, the former cryptocurrency mogul, is expected to be released from prison on December 14, 2044, four years earlier than his original 25-year sentence. This is due to 'good conduct time' credits that can cut up to 54 days from each year of a sentence. Bankman-Fried was convicted of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy for 'commingling money with Alameda Research' and channeling billions in customer deposits into risky bets, political donations, and luxury real estate. His defense team has appealed both his conviction and sentence, arguing that the trial moved too quickly and misinterpreted cryptocurrency practices. However, regulators and lawmakers continue to sift through FTX's wreckage, and a separate civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission seeks billions in disgorgement.

**Sam Bankman-Fried thrown in solitary confinement after unauthorized...**
Convicted crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried was reportedly moved to solitary confinement after taking an unauthorized jailhouse interview with Tucker Carlson. Bankman-Fried appeared in a video call with Carlson from Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, where he has been held for 18 months, in an apparent long-shot campaign to receive a presidential pardon for his 25-year sentence. According to a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons, 'this particular interview was not approved.' Bankman-Fried has been trying to plead his case since FTX collapsed in 2022, and has devised a 19-point plan to revive his public image, including going on Tucker Carlson's show and coming out as a Republican. He has maintained his innocence and filed an appeal, arguing that the judge who oversaw the case was biased.

**"Don't think I'm a criminal": Crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried maintains innocence from prison**
Convicted crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers on his FTX exchange, maintains his innocence from behind bars. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, Bankman-Fried described the Metropolitan Detention Center as 'sort of dystopian' but said he is keeping busy by reading novels, playing chess, and working on his legal case. He also spoke about his interactions with fellow detainee Sean 'Diddy' Combs, describing him as 'kind.' Bankman-Fried explained that he donated to Democratic politicians in the past, but shifted to giving to Republicans privately in 2022, which he believes may have contributed to the party's lack of support for him. He criticized the Biden administration's heavy-handed crypto regulations and expressed hope that the industry would be in better hands under a Trump administration.

**SBF Says He Was Shocked By Democrats' Crypto Stance Prior to FTX Collapse**
Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried suggested that his harsh prison sentence was due to his increasing ties to the Republican Party before his arrest. He stated, 'By late 2022 I was giving to Republicans privately as much as Democrats.' Bankman-Fried donated over $40 million to 196 members of Congress, including top Republicans and Democrats. He was found guilty of multiple charges of fraud and conspiracy in March 2024 and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Bankman-Fried's parents have reportedly been meeting with lawyers in President Donald Trump's orbit to secure a presidential pardon. He also criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during his trial, calling it 'something out of a nightmare' due to difficulties for crypto companies to register.
